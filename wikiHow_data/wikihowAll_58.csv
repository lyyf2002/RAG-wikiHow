Try going into the music files of other games and finding a program to edit them.,
Also, remember that when you hit something, it won't make a sound, this is just music that you play repeatedly, or maybe for different areas (like maybe 20 screens you change the music, then 20 more and you change).",How to Create a Text Based World With Batch Script3," Also, if you have a flute, guitar, drum or any other instrument you could probably get the feel., It's to add a little bit more of a game feel to it."

First, make your templates, for items, weapons, monsters, npcs, shops and things like that (a template is like the programming, then you fill it out).,If you don’t know how to program batch and want to learn it from this guide, read on:,
there are things called labels, like on the loading screen, the “:LOAD” (without the quotation marks).,
The “@echo off” (without the quotation marks) command is one that is almost required.,
The “echo” (without the quotation marks) command is so that the words after the echo command would be displayed on screen (echo Hello World would make: Hello World).,
The ‘ping local host’ command (yet again, without the quotation marks) is for testing if the computer is connected to a wireless network.,
the ‘set /p input= ?’ (without the quotes) command is where you put something in that space in-between the input= and the question mark, and then the input (stuff the player types) is going to be there.,
The ‘if %input%== goto’ is another interchangeable command.,I have found that some of the lag causers may be used in ASCII, either use the ‘type filename.txt’ (filename is replaceable, but it has to be a text document, and also without the quotation marks) to type an external document on screen with no echo before it.,
Also, try making a diversion, like a cool ASCII picture on the loading screen to keep the player interested for the few seconds it takes to load.,
You always have to remember, batch isn’t a flexible language, and programming the classes for example, has to be loaded into the templates.,
You have to remember, let's say that you poisoned a troll, you would have to make a whole new screen for that, and maybe it lost 45 hp, another screen.",How to Create a Text Based World With Batch Script4,"

(This is a command line language, so when you press enter it makes a new line on the screen too).
Note: if you are already a programmer in batch script, and know the @echo off, : , ping localhost, if %input%== and echo commands then you can go ahead and skip to the next note. If you do not know all of those commands try to learn them from every batch article on Wikihow (ping localhost may not be on here, but it is for testing the connection of the network. It should only be used once, that’s on the loading screen.)

 :LOAD
@echo off
echo

This is the loading screen. Type in PLAY and press ENTER to go to the main screen. If any problem occurs with this, please try an errorlevel program, or check for anything wrong with your computer (wireless connection effects this).


ping localhost
set /p input=COMMAND?
if %input%==PLAY goto :MAIN

You may look at this and be confused. just copy and paste it, or edit if you want to. It's just a loading screen.





,, The name is always 1, 2, 3 or 4 letters long, in capital letters and has the colon behind it (the two little dots)., It makes sure that they don’t see the coding, but only the echo things. The “@echo off” command is required for making a game though. If you switch the off to on, the player will see all of the programming too.,, This is only needed on the loading screen. Try not to put this anywhere else., This is one of the few changeable commands in the way of you putting the words in it. After they type their input (that of which has to be in capital letters) they press enter and it’s in., You put what they have to type in and then press enter for (so maybe if %input%==FIGHT),, Maybe the game logo in ASCII., The templates are things that you copy, fill out and paste into the coding to end up with a monster or other thing., That’s why I make templates for it. One monster can be up to 5 PAGES LONG (if it has more than 25 hp (that’s STRONG))"
"
Make sure that you change the background and text color (do that by under the ‘@echo off’ (without the quotation marks) you would put color and then putting a letter then a number.,Make sure that there isn’t a page without ASCII art.,
Have some blank CD’s, a back ground story, a plot, a title and a crew to make the game.,Also, keep a separate reference about everything in the game, as well as a map (maybe if you go north from deep forest, you get to the deep forest one, then east and deep forest 7, it’s the navigation of the game)",How to Create a Text Based World With Batch Script5," Here is the table:

,,

You don’t =need an engine or a compiler for batch.
The database is so that when someone wants to find out about a weapon, monster or other thing they can go put it in the database which is a separate batch program with all of the information inside of it. This can also be merged with the game. The database is very important, as it is also the coding of the game.

Monsters would be what the players character fights to advance, so there needs to be a lot of them.,
Monsters need stats, but you can’t program them, so type them out.,Monsters should also have what they drop in their description, as well as XP gain, things like that.,

Decide on a budget.,
Choose a theme for your hunt.,
Plan it out!,
Begin registering your site(s).,
Will you hire a professional programmer or code it all yourself?,
Do a test run.,
Voila!

",How to Create an Internet Riddle Trail Game," $0 is acceptable for now but think about getting a paid domain.;
, Will it be completely random (like NotPr0n) or have a long theme (like the LOST Alternate Reality Game)?

, This is very important. People get caught up in the excitement and just rush into making the sites. Instead, sit down and figure the whole thing out. Make all your different clues and answers. Figure out how you (or someone you hire) will have to code the site to make it work.

, If you purchase a domain for it with your budget, then you probably only need one. If you're doing this with a $0 budget, try using 000webhost. Don't use Angelfire.

, Either way, start having your site coded and the clues put in.

, Make sure the clues aren't too difficult or too easy. Make adjustments as necessary.

Repeat the previous main steps (as needed) until you are satisfied.",How to Create an Enjoyable Educational Video Game," The topic of an educational game could be anything from how to cook a simple meal to advanced particle physics. The first thing you need to do is determine what sort of subject matter you want your game to illustrate. Whatever you decide here will become the basis for the game you create.;
, It is very difficult to teach something that you're not deeply familiar with. Take time to ask yourself, “would I be able to teach this subject to my target audience in a classroom?” While you don’t need ultimate knowledge on every field related to your game’s topic, you should posses a very firm grasp on the concepts you’re trying to teach. Take some time to research your topic here if necessary.

, It’s alright if you’ve never designed a game before. There are many in depth tutorials on most aspects of video game design, programming, and asset creation available on YouTube. Even though you don't need a great deal of experience to make a game, creating a good game will require some understanding of the design process and video games themselves.

, While there is no set definition of a good video game, no one with any experience playing games will hesitate to point out a bad one. Educational games of the 90’s focused primarily on teaching a topic, adding in gameplay like functions as an afterthought. No matter how technically accurate and educational your game is, it won't do any good if it doesn't hold the player's attention long enough to get your topics across. A good educational game should focus on gameplay and build education into the system. ], Are there any existing games about your subject? What other educational materials on the subject exist? Being mindful of prior art is important because it allows you to draw inspiration without knowingly (or not) encroaching on any copyright.

, Everyone brainstorms in a different way. Some people do it alone with index cards or a notepad while others prefer to brainstorm in a group with a white board or collaboration software. The point of this step is to generate more than enough ideas related to your topic to give you something to go with. Don't worry if some of your ideas seem to be well off track, because you will narrow them down later.

, The topic you want to teach should be broad enough that players without prior knowledge will still be able to benefit, but not so broad that the educational bits will get lost in the openness of the game. Try to find a balance between an all encompassing game and one which dwells over specific details of a specific topic.

, This choice should be based on what you're trying to teach. For example, a real time strategy game or first person shooter would be poorly suited to teach physics. Likewise, a side-scrolling platformer would have a difficult time conveying the details of algebra. Note: There are exceptions to this, such as Valve Software’s Portal game can be implemented to teach physics lessons., Will your target audience be a room full of third graders or adults trying to further education? Understanding the target audience at an early stage will help you tailor the game to a level that will entertain them. Younger audiences will need likely to be helped throughout their play through of your game, while older audiences may feel insulted if you do the same thing. Try to limit your audience to as few groups as possible.

, No matter how great an idea is, if it doesn't fit with the theme of your game, valuable resources (such as time, energy, and money) will be wasted on it. Don’t feel obligated to incorporate every good idea that comes up into your game. You will have other opportunities to use those ideas in later projects. There is an old adage in film, ""If you can cut a scene and have the movie still make sense, cut it.""

, Now that the analysis and design stages are completed, it is time to get ready for action. Make sure that you have access to a reliable (and internet connected) computer with all of the software that you will need. The software will vary greatly from person to person depending on the scope of your project and what you're comfortable with.

, Unless you're tackling this project by yourself (which will be difficult, although not impossible), feel free to enlist the help of other people. Depending on where you’re coming from or the scope of your project, these people could be friends or family members with coding or art skills, or paid professionals who know exactly what they’re doing. There is no shame working on this by yourself, just understand the resources that you have available and don’t overstretch the scope of your abilities. Utilize the resources that others have.

, This step is optional and often overlooked, but can be used to diagnose any potential problems and generate better ideas before any coding takes place. Think of every mechanic and system in your game, then make a paper version of it. This will let you see how you want key pieces of your game to interact and lets you make any adjustments to your idea before ever writing any code.

, The details of this will vary greatly depending on the engine and IDE (integrated development environment) you're using, but the advice is the same. Starting with a solid back end will greatly reduce the number of problems you encounter later in your project. Take your time to make sure all of your systems are working together correctly before implementing anything else.

, Not all types of games place the player in control of a character. If you have chosen a genre that allows the player to directly manipulate their environment, program that now. If you have a playable character, this is a good time to work on the controls and basic animation.

, Even though this is generally the last step in implementing a game, special attention should be paid to the user interface. This is how the player will spend most of their time interacting with your game and if it isn’t intuitive to the player, they won’t enjoy the game as much as you would like.

, Friends and family may work for small projects, but if you don't make it clear that you need honest feedback on your game they may tell you what you want to hear to protect your feelings. Many colleges and universities have game clubs which will play test your game for free. Larger projects may require professional play testers.

, Don't directly ask them this question, but ask them questions about the subject matter. It should be clear by their answers whether your topic material got through to them. You may want to prepare some quiz-like questions to evaluate whether the topic was entirely understood.

, You can directly ask them this question, but most people won't be able to give a direct reason. Watching the way they play and monitoring their expression will give you a much more accurate idea. The point of creating an enjoyable educational game is that the player enjoys it, so this is the most important step in the testing phase.

, Don't guide them through the game if they get stuck on a puzzle or with part of your UI or control scheme. Mark these down as problem areas which need to be fixed. Ask for feedback while they're playing and what they're thinking/attempting to do.

, Now that you have completed the first iteration of your game, determine whether or not you are satisfied. Did the players enjoy the game you created? Did they learn anything from it? If so, you’ve created an enjoyable educational game. If not, you can go back to part 1 and begin the process again with all of the information you’ve gathered from testing.Through this iterative process, your game will become better and many of the problems will be worked out."

Come up with an idea, then flesh it out: Idea creation should always be the first step to any creative endeavor, because you can’t reasonably start on it without at least some basis.,

Distribution.",How to Create a Game in RPG Maker XP," This also is a step you will probably have the most fun with, considering you likely already have multiple ideas bumping around your head. However, they’re probably just small, cool things you want to implement. Flesh these out considerably. Come up with all your characters, environments, enemies, items, weapons, abilities, and anything else you can think of. It will make the actual implementation process far easier if you’re working off of a solid outline rather than coming up with things on the fly as you go.;
, How much detail you put in is up to you, but having a script, which in this case is both the dialogue that occurs as well as a description of the events, is vital to a well made game. Much like the first step above, getting everything out on paper will give you not only a much better idea of how you’re going to go about making the rest of your game, but also make the process far easier, because you’ll just be copying and pasting from the script into the dialogue boxes. The script and the document you created in step one will be your most important resources.

, The reason for doing map making as your next step is that it will help you to better visualize your world. Doing this will allow you to potentially change your mind about, and fine tune every other aspect of your game. To start creating a map, right click on the first initial map in the map pane, right below the tileset, and click ""New Map"". You make maps using “tilesets”, which are picture files that have a large variety of different objects and environments within them that are separated by the game maker into a grid. This is because everything you create visually in your game is done as a grid. Each square represents one step a character can take. In these squares, you can place one square of your selected tileset. You can also create events, which will be discussed later. It’s also worth mentioning that you can utilize three layers with which to make your map, especially useful for making walls, ceilings, and just anything that you want to be above ground.
You can also edit each square in a tileset to have different characteristics such as the ability to be walked through, and/or from which directions. This is done in the Tilesets tab in the Database, discussed later.


If you are creating sub-maps that are meant to exist within other maps, for example, a small cave in a forest, make it a sub-map of the forest by right clicking the bigger map and creating the smaller map from that, rather than from the world map. It will make visualizing where maps are that much easier.

, This next section will require much time and fine-tuning as you create your game. Everything here is done in the Database. The tabs at the top are essentially your to-do list. For the most part, you want to go through each, ensuring that they are filled out with everything your game will contain, from your primary characters, all the weapons, character abilities, item, status effects, monsters, the experience they give, items they drop, and of course, the groups those enemies will be in when they attack your party, as well as editing the different tilesets you have. In other words, create the entire underlay of the game. You also don't have to worry about the ""Common Events"" or ""System"" tab just yet. You will be coming back to the Database over and over again as you play through everything you create, but for now, just create the “preliminary draft”.

, Here is where the meat of your game creation process lies. To create an event, select the “events” layer. Double click a tile on the map. The options here are immense, but common things you might do are place an NPC (non-playable character, such as a generic village inhabitant) to speak to, cause a conversation to occur between characters, or initiate a battle. You can also cause these events to trigger in multiple ways including upon touch, on clicking the space bar (the default “select” button”) next to the tile, or automatically upon entering the map.There is an extremely large variety of customization possible while creating event tiles, and discovering them is part of the fun.

, You’ve already created your monster groups, now you have to put them on their respective maps. You can do this in the map menu by right clicking on it in the menu pane, and clicking ""Map Properties"". There, you’ll be able to select which monster groups you want to appear in that map and how common that group will appear.

, The music in your game provides the “atmospheric backbone”, if you will, to your game. The music you choose will be part of the memories those who play your game will associate with it. You can choose any music you want, from the included tracks or an MP3 file of your choosing, for maps, battles, boss battles, cinematics, everything. They essentially create the mood, so be sure to take the tone of the current in-game situation into account when choosing. Map music is chosen on the map menu you set your monster groups in, battle music is set in the Database, as is music for common things in every game like the title screen and game over screen. You can also set a certain song to play whenever you want using an event.

, This step is technically optional, but is heavily recommended. Sure, the main storyline is the important part, but everyone loves some good sidequests. They go a long way into making your game less linear. Some ideas might be killing an optional monster to get a sweet weapon, completing a special dungeon with a large sum of money at the end, or anything really that you can think of.

, You should not only be testing sections and battles repeatedly, but also the entire game, because maintaining a good balance (i.e. difficulty level) and engaging experience is vital. A good thing to do is have a main save file that you’re going through the game with, and then you can adjust battles for what a normal party would be at for that stage in the game. Make sure to go through everything with a fine-toothed comb because bugs are everywhere, and very easy to miss. Not only that, but they can be potentially game-breaking, such as a door you are unable to go through to advance the plot. So make sure you play through your game multiple times until it’s perfect. Congratulations, you’re done your game! However, you want people to play it don’t you?

, When you finally finish your game and want others to play it, you have several options. The first and easiest way, assuming one of these people is a friend of yours, if to just get them to play on the computer you made the game on and just play through it in the RMXP program itself. However, if you want to actually be able to put the file onto a disk to give it to someone to play, it’s an easy process.


Compress the game data: Go to “File” and then click “Compress game data”. It will ask for a destination folder (or disk). This compressed data has all the information the game needs to run except for the audio files and graphics. This comes back to what I mentioned at the beginning regarding the RTP. If the person using your game has installed the RTP file on their own computer, then they can simply run the game off of this compressed game file. Having RMXP installed is not needed for them.
To download the RTP file separately, go here: http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/download/run-time-package

If they don’t have it installed, you will need to include the audio and graphics folders along with the compressed data, which will make the file you’re sending much bigger.When your recipient wants to run the game, they just need to double-click the “Game” file.

Download Game Maker from yoyogames.com for free.,
Now it's time to start creating your game!,
Upload your pictures into Game Maker 8.,
Put your game all together now!,
Export your game and send it to friends by attaching it to e-mails.",How to Create a Game Like Club Penguin in Game Maker 8," (This tutorial uses version 8.) This will be the free version. You can purchase the Pro Edition of Game Maker at a low price;
, The best way to start that is by creating sprites, which are basically images. You can use MS Paint or most any art program that you want (Game Maker comes with one also). This is the main part of creating your game, since it shows how much quality your game has. If you're not that good at drawing, you can always create your sprites by getting images from the Internet. If this is your first time creating a game, start simple and don't go overboard. In Club Penguin, the main characters are penguins, but you can do any characters that you want, whether they are animals or people.

, Now that that is done, we can start creating our objects. To have your characters move, you could program it so that they move when the player presses the arrow keys. Start this by creating an event. To have an object do what you want it to do, browse through the events, and then through the commands.

, Create rooms (which can be thought of as levels or menus) and load your objects into them. You can design backgrounds for them, also. Make sure that you test it a few times at every few changes that you make, so that you're not too confused later if something goes wrong.

, You can even keep it on your own computer on the desktop! Begin playing, and have a fun time! :)

Once you’ve buried it, you will be able to see the difference between it and regular pitfall seeds. The Tricky Pitfall Seeds leave a much smaller star on the ground, making them harder to see and avoid.
Once buried, you can wait around and hopefully see someone fall in!

Identify the cheater.,
Learn the most common cheat, that being the one described above.",How to Cheat in Mario Strikers Charged1," Someone who chips the ball is not a cheater. Chipping the ball behind/around the goal to confuse the goalkeeper is a move tricksters will frequently use, but it is not cheating. The move is not ""cheap"" either because it usually takes a decent amount of skill to score a goal using chip-tricks. A cheater is a player who takes advantage of glitches in the game, the most common being the Boo-Goalie glitch where Boo disappears into the goalie and the team that made the Boo disappear into the goalie skips the charging phase and can score incredibly cheap goals.

, It is good for fighting back against a cheater. To use this cheat you must have a Boo on your team.

"
"
Gain possession of the ball.,
Charge the ball to its maximum before it must be released.

,
Then, before it is shot/passed, use Boo's deke to disappear into the goalie's arms.,
Throw the ball to a good passer, maybe even the same Boo.

,
Pass the ball down field without charging it to a powerful player.

,
Shoot the ball, and if done correctly, the ball (even if completely uncharged) will pass right through the opposing goalie.",How to Cheat in Mario Strikers Charged2," First, with possession of the ball, move Boo next to your own goalkeeper.;
,, He will take the ball from your Boo.

,,, This can be done with a balanced player or even a weak shooter as well, but it does not work correctly as often.

"
"
With Boo, take the ball to the opposing goalie.,
Just before he does this, use Boo's deke to disappear.,
Alternatively, as opposed to shooting the ball just after disappearing you can also chip it in.",How to Cheat in Mario Strikers Charged3," Charging the ball has no effect on the outcome of this move. When you get close enough, the goalie will attempt to lunge at or hit you in an effort to take the ball.

, You have a tiny window of opportunity to score just after doing this because (with good timing) you will have passed right through the goalie. If you wait more than a split second to shoot, the goalie will recover and take the ball.

, Chipping makes it harder for the goalie to take, but if done at an odd angle (such as from the side) it won't work since chips are not guided automatically towards the goal like shots are. This move is used frequently on Wi-Fi as well. It is best to just let the goalie handle it, he can stop it sometimes. Or you may have a player just behind the goalie hit the Boo passing through him, thus stopping the ball. (If done from a bad angle, you may actually end up knocking the ball into your own goal!)

"

The third ""cheat"" isn't actually a glitch, nor is it cheating but it is a good move to know nonetheless.",How to Cheat in Mario Strikers Charged4," First, with a fast player (any speedy one will do) gain possession of the ball in your own territory. Hold down Z (the chip button) for a few seconds. Then run towards midfield, and as soon as you enter your opponent's half, release Z and move the player you were controlling either back into your own territory or horizontally off to the side. If done right, the chip will be very high and catch the goalie off guard and sail directly over him before plummeting into the goal.


This will only work in stadiums that have fast terrain. This works well in stadiums like ""Classic: Bowser Stadium"" and ""The Wastelands"". It will not work in slow places like ""The Dump.""

"
"
Another glitch is with a Boo.",How to Cheat in Mario Strikers Charged5," If you disappear right by a goalie, when the goalie hits you, you have about a 60% chance of the ball flying in.

"
"
Learn that there are ways to combat the cheats.,
For the first cheat, the most obvious thing to do it hit the Boo or steal the ball as soon as you see it make a move towards its own goalie.

,
You can also attack all the power players downfield to minimize the chance of scoring even if the cheat works (weaker characters shots are much slower and the cheat sometimes wears off before the ball reaches the goalie).

,
There is no real way to stop the second cheat other than to just let the goalie handle it.

,
If the third move is used against you, have a player behind the goalie and press A to deflect the chip shot.",How to Cheat in Mario Strikers Charged6," If you are unwilling to cheat to beat a cheater, you must be aware that there are ways to stop cheats from working.

,,,, Players use this move extremely often and the goalie cannot block the very high shots about half the time, so it is a good idea to always have at least one fast/good passing player deep in your own territory solely for this purpose.

Go to Practice on the Main Menu.,
Gain Experience in ""Exhibition Game"" mode.,
Learn all the different types of players.,
Select players according to position.,
Now adjust your batting order.,
Select the number of innings to be played and whether you want to be home team or away.,
Pitching and Fielding:


When pitching, make sure you change your pitches all the time, meaning throwing fastballs, curves and change-ups as randomly as possible.,
Batting: Only use the charge swing occasionally, preferably only with your power hitters.,
Player Chemistry.,
If you follow these steps and tips, you should be a successful ball player.",How to Win a Game in Mario Superstar Baseball," This tutorial will work you through the basic mechanics of Mario Superstar Baseball.;
, Choose an accurate difficulty level. If you are a beginner, you should probably set it to ""weak"". Now select a team captain. The captain will be your default starting pitcher, although this can be changed when you arrange your lineup before the game. For reasons to be explained later, you may also want a captain with good relationships with others. For instance, Mario gets along with Luigi, but not Bowser or Wario.

,


Balance Players: These are well-rounded characters who are near average in all categories, which include batting, pitching, fielding and running. Balance Captains: Mario, Luigi, Daisy, Birdo.
Technique Players: Technique characters are generally poor batters, with near average speed. However, their pitching and/or fielding makes up for the lack of offense. Technique Captains: Peach, Waluigi
Speed Players: Speed characters are very fast runners who range from average to very poor in terms of batting. Speed Players vary greatly from one another in fielding and pitching. Speed Captains: Yoshi, Diddy Kong
Power Players: Power Players are very good batters, who smash long hits and home runs more often than other players. However, they are usually very slow runners and very poor fielders. Some Power players are actually quite good pitchers, while some are the exact opposite. Power Captains: Bowser, Bowser Jr., Wario, Donkey Kong.

, Make sure to put players at positions that fit their abilities. You want slower players with less fielding talent at positions like catcher, first base, and third base because those positions don't get as much action as others. There are no designated hitters. You want fast players in the outfield and characters with good range in the in the middle infield. The player with the best pitching arm goes on the mound. You will also want your catcher to have strong arm to throw out potential base-stealers. Arm strength is also a plus at positions like shortstop and right field.

, You want fast and reliable players in the first and second spots. You should have more balanced players in the third spot, your big power hitters in the fourth, fifth and sixth spots. Characters that you don't trust as much with the bat, or that just don't fit anywhere else, fill in the seventh, eighth and ninth spots.


Here is a mock lineup...

1. Speed Player
2. Speed/Technique Player
3. Balance/Power player
4. Power Player
5. Power Player
6. Power/Balance Player
7. Balance/Technique Player
8. Technique Player
9. Speed Player



, The home team has a slight advantage. If you are just learning, choose a smaller inning amount. You can choose from 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 innings.

, If you get predictable, the batter catches on, and could potentially get a big hit. When your pitcher gets tired, switch arms right away. To do this, press Start and select Change Positions.
When out-fielding, just get in or around the circle (it shows where the ball will land) and if it turns red, that means you will catch the ball if you stay where you are. To catch fly balls, you don't have to do anything besides run to where the ball will land. Only press ""A"" if you are forced to make a leaping or diving catch. As for in-fielding, just let the ball come to you. To throw you can press ""A"" and nothing else, and the ball will automatically be thrown to the best possible location, usually first base. You may also use the control pad to select a base to throw to in the event you have multiple places to throw to. Tilt it right along with ""A"" for first base, up for second, left for third, and down for home. If the character cannot reach the ball on their own and it looks like it will go to the outfield, press ""A"" to make a leaping or diving catch. And if you still can't get there in time, it would have gone past you anyway, so no harm done.

, Using the charge swing with a character with weaker batting skill usually results in a fly-out. If you have good timing and practice enough, you can hit bloop singles (base hits that drop between the infielders and outfielders) with almost any player.


Home-runs and Big Hits: If you want to hit a homer, you have to position your batter just right and have perfect timing. You want the ball to hit the sweet spot of the bat (usually near the middle, where the bat's logo is) when the bat is perfectly parallel to the ball.

, This is something new to video games. Player chemistry is basically the relationship one player has with another. For instance: If the shortstop has good chemistry with the first baseman, when the shortstop attempts to throw to first, the ball will fly with greater speed and accuracy. If the shortstop is an enemy of the first baseman the throws to first will be wildly off-target, sometimes flying right past the player. The same is true with batting. If the batter has good chemistry with a player on base, then that player is more likely to get a hit or home-run. Bad chemistry does not affect batting, only fielding.

, Good luck!

Short hopping, how do you do it? Short hopping is achieved by quickly tapping the X or Y button or by quickly pushing the analog stick up. You'll know if you're short hopping if you're jumping significantly ""shorter"" then you normally do.

, Dash dancing is done by quickly moving your analog stick left and right repeatedly very quickly. When you should dash dance is dependent on how often you are ""standing"". Throughout a match, when you are just standing idly, you should dash dance as you can do many things out of a dash dance such as grabbing, jumping, and etc. Plus it intimidates your opponent.

, L-Canceling reduces the amount of lag you receive after performing an aerial and landing on the ground.


If you want to L-Cancel, after performing an aerial, simply press any shield button right before you hit the ground.

, Wavedashing is a technique used to allow players to perform ground moves while moving horizontally on the ground.


This is achieved by short hopping and then immediately air dodging diagonally into the ground.

Go to Nook’s Shop.,
Talk to Nook.,
Put it all together.,
Be familiar with the rules about using cheats.,
Use the cheat codes as helpful shortcuts when playing the game.,
Understand that the game doesn't penalize you for using cheats.,
Use the following codes for the rest of the golden tools.,
Enter these codes to receive extra money.,
Use cheat codes to get holiday or other special furniture sets.,
Use cheat codes to get the harvest set.,
Enter these codes to get the snowman set.,
Try using these codes to get Mario items.",How to Use Game Cheats in Animal Crossing," Nook is the raccoon who runs the item shop in Animal Crossing. The first incarnation is called Nook’s Cranny. This shop will be upgraded over time. It does not matter what level your shop is; you will be able to use cheat codes at it. Find the shop on your map and enter!;
, Speak with Tom Nook by pressing “a”. He’ll ask you what you want; choose “other things” and then choose “say code”. This takes you to a text screen where you input codes to your fancy! Repeat this process for every code that you have/want. Again, many codes can be found online.


A sample code for the Golden Axe is as follows: 4B2&p%eGcglO7NHZCS3hjkKJtlgH - the Golden Axe never breaks, making it a great advantage to have if you’re interested in changing up the landscape of your town.
As you can see, the code is a bit difficult, so it will require careful entry. If you make a mistake, an error will come back saying that no item was obtained.

, Using game cheats is a really simple process overall. To recap: find Nook in his shop, talk to him, choose “other things” and then “say code” in order to reach the text box for input. Put in a code, and enjoy your new item! Rinse and repeat to your heart’s desire.

, There are limitations to using cheat codes in Animal Crossing, which could cause you to run into issues if you attempt to exceed those limitations.


You can only use three codes per day. You must wait 24 hours before you put in more codes. So if, for example, you use the codes for the golden shovel, golden axe, and golden bug net, that is all you will be able to get that day.
If you try to put in the code for the golden fishing rod, you will receive an error. You must wait 24 hours before you can redeem any more codes.

, Animal Crossing can be played many ways, and the cheat codes provide the opportunity for you to use certain shortcuts.


For example, if you don’t want to invest a lot of time in farming bells, then go ahead and use the code for 30,000 bells until you have as much money as you want (but remember that you can only redeem 3 codes per 24 hours).
If you want those golden tools early on in the game to make things easier, go ahead and grab those. If you want a really nice looking house and don’t have the time to grab all the furniture yourself, use all the codes for the set.

, Although most items can be obtained in game through a bit of work, the game doesn't penalize you at all for making things a little easier on yourself. As a result, there's no need to feel guilty about using these codes - feel free to cheat away!

, All of the golden tools can be obtained other ways through the game. For example, you would receive the golden bug net by catching all of the bugs possible in the game. That, however, can take a lot of time and effort, so if you want to speed things up, use these codes:


To obtain the Golden Net, follow the steps above and enter this code: 4B2&p%eGcglO7NHZCS3hjkKJtlgH - the Golden Net swings sideways, instead of just up and down, making it easier to catch bugs. A great tool to get to catch all those bugs.
Goldenrod: YYUKhrekPQ6a3M#4&f3bdAZJf

Golden Shovel: GkUFUvirg%PX6a3ZizGfw5dTZLQh - the Golden Shovel has a random chance of digging up some bells!

, Aside from tools, you can enter codes in Nook's Shop to receive extra money you can use to buy things. For example:


To receive 30,000 Bells, tell Tom Nook the following code: WB2@pAR%hTk8JHyrT - extra bells can be nice if you’re having a hard time farming them otherwise in the game. You can use this code multiple times to keep getting payouts of 30,000 bells, making this an easy way to accumulate cash.
There’s also a code for 10,000 bells: Wn2&SAVAcglC7N POudE2Tk8JHyUH


, Animal Crossing contains a lot of different furniture pieces. Some of these are only available for collection on special event days or holidays.


Having a complete furniture set in your home is important, as it will earn you extra points with the Happy Home Academy (they give you ratings based on your décor).
If you miss those, or don’t have the time to invest in participating in the events in order to collect all the furniture, here are codes for a few of the sets.

, The harvest set is an autumn-themed collection of furniture. You can get it using the following codes:

Learn all the basic controls.,

Enter a tournament once you are comfortable.",How to Play Mario Power Tennis," Become familiar with shots, lunges, serves, power shots, etc.


Use the Control Pad to move your player around on the court.
Pressing ""A"" will result in a basic topspin shot.
""B"" is for slice shots.
Press ""A"" and then ""B"" for a lob shot, that is, one that flies deeper into your opponent's territory.
Press ""B"" and then ""A"" for a drop shot. A drop shot is one that lands very close to the net. Slower opponents find these especially hard to reach.
If your racket is glowing, you can press ""A"" and ""R"" at the same time for a unique shot only your character can make. There are two kinds of these---offensive and defensive. Offensive shots are made when you are right in front of the ball. Often these are hard to return. Defensive shots can be made when you are too far away to otherwise reach the ball. These special returns just might save you the game!
For extra power and/or spin, you can press either ""A"" or ""B"" twice instead of once before you hit it.;
, What is your style of playing? Do you want to go all out offense and smash the ball every time? Or maybe all defense, so you can let your opponent make his or her own mistakes. Or something in between. Here are all the basic types of players:



All-Around: These well-balanced players are at or near average in all areas of tennis. They have decent power, average range, average speed, etc. Very good for beginners or anyone who likes to compete in a well-rounded manner.

Speed: These players are very fast and can be almost anywhere on the court in no time at all! However, they lack power and range.

Technique: These are players who can pinpoint the hard-to-reach corners of the court and hit the ball there at will. If you're playing one of these you'd better stay near the corners. Usually average speed and below average power.

Power: Power players are usually very slow, and most of them have bad range as well. But they can put a lot of speed on their shots.

Tricky: Tricky players have the ability to curve the ball far more than other types of players, which can distort your perception of where exactly it will land. They have bad power and average to slightly above-average speed.

Defensive: Defensive players are slow and lacking good power, but they can reach and return almost any shot. These players let the opponent make their own mistakes.

, Choose the Novice level. It might take a little while to get used to the controls and you might not win at first. Be sure you start on the Peach Dome courts, these have no gimmicks or anything else to mess you up.

, The World Tour on Mushroom level is where you should start. Work your way to the top with all your favorite characters and advance through all the different levels of the tournament!

Before you start the game, make sure Waluigi is hitting in the leadoff (1) spot.,
Have your player two (Wario) throw the first pitch.,
Swing.,
If you hit it just late enough, the ball will be hit high in the air.",How to Hit a Home Run With Waluigi in Mario Superstar Baseball," It may take thousands of tries to hit a home run with Waluigi against the computer, so a second player is a must-have. Make sure this person is okay with being the one to give up the big hit.;
, You will sign in as Waluigi and your second player should select Wario. Wario is an excellent choice, because his fastball is always perfectly straight and for some reason, batters tend to hit his pitches farther than anyone else's.

, This ballpark works great, because the outfield walls are closer in than all the other stadiums, making the homerun more likely.

, Also make sure Waluigi's team is batting first. This makes it so that you can get right to hitting with Waluigi.

, Waluigi is a strange hitter, so be sure he charges up at exactly the same time Wario does. When Wario is fully charged, he will throw his ""blazing fastball,"" the fastest pitch he can throw. This is important, because the faster the throw is, the faster the hit will be, and thus it will go farther.

, Once Wario has thrown the pitch, you (Waluigi) should swing. But there is a catch to this - Waluigi has to swing late. Not late enough that he misses the pitch, but just late enough so that it goes to the left part of the field. Waluigi is left handed, and most lefties pull the ball towards right field, but with Waluigi this doesn't work. It will actually be less powerful if he pulls it right.

, It will soar towards the left field foul-pole. And if you hit it perfectly, the ball will land fair or hit the pole, both resulting in a home run just over the outfield wall. But most likely, the ball will not be hit perfectly. Either the outfielders will catch it, or it will be a foul ball. You might even miss the pitch entirely by trying to swing too late. If this is the case, just try to get the next pitch. If Waluigi is out, then exit back out to the Main Menu and try again. It may take many tries before you hit it right. But when you do, you get the satisfaction of accomplishing the hardest feat in this game - hitting a home run with Waluigi. You also get to see his almost never-before-seen home run celebration!

Do more.",How to Get Two Animal Crossing Towns on One Gamecube," Preferably one that doesn’t already have Animal Crossing data on it.;
, When you first load up the game on the Gamecube, it will create a saved data for your town on the memory card in Slot 1. That memory card then contains your entire town in it.

, It is advised that you label your memory cards (e.g., AC Town 1), or have identifiably different cards in order to keep straight which cards have which data.


When Animal Crossing was first released for Gamecube, for example, every copy came with an Animal Crossing-specific memory card.

, Preferably one that doesn’t already have Animal Crossing data on it.


The Gamecube will always default to reading the card in Slot 1 for information unless you specifically instruct it otherwise.

, Since this new card won’t have any Animal Crossing data on it, then Animal Crossing will launch the same way it does as if you’re first starting the game, and you will be able to create a brand-new town.

, This new town will be stored on the second memory card. Again, it is advised that you clearly label your memory cards so that you will know which card has which town, and you can easily switch between towns whenever you want.


Whenever you want to play in Town #1, simply put memory card #1 into your Gamecube’s Slot 1.
Whenever you want to play in Town #2, simply put memory card #2 into your Gamecube’s Slot 1.

, If you have two different towns, you have the opportunity to visit them. You’ll need memory card #1 in Slot 1 and memory card #2 in Slot 2.


Say your character in Town #1 wants to visit Town #2, you just need to have both memory card #1 and memory card #2 in your Gamecube at the same time.

, This would be the game in Slot 1.

, Once you’re in the game and in control of your character, walk to the train station, located in the north section of town.

, You can do so by pressing “A.” In this dialogue, he’ll ask you if you want to take a trip. Say yes.


If there is no memory card with Animal Crossing data on it in Slot 2, then this will not work.
If you’ve set everything up correctly, your character will board the train, and shortly arrive in your second town.

, You can achieve this by putting memory card #2 in Slot 1 (the main slot) and memory card #1 in Slot 2. Loading the game will then cause you to load your second main character and his or her town.


Just look for the train station and travel to whatever town’s data is placed in Slot 2 of the Gamecube.

, There are a few advantages to managing two different towns and visiting them in Animal Crossing for Gamecube.


For instance, you have the chance to check two completely different sets of items stored in the Nook shop each day. Since the shop randomly stocks its furniture, it is highly unlikely that the Nook shop in both towns will have any overlap in items.
Each town will most likely have a different fruit, and non-native fruits sell for 500 bells a piece (as opposed to 100 bells for native fruits) at the shop.

, With two towns, you have more opportunity to do things in general. You can complete favors for animals in the town you’re visiting, go bug-hunting or fishing, and any number of things that you can already do in your own town.

There's no other chance to use them. Ike should be at least 18/16 (Promoted to Lord at level 18, and is level 16 now), and have either Aether (which is acquired through an Occult scroll) or Resolve and Wrath skills equipped.;
, The final level is a large map and has many different routes. This is advantageous, because it can be easier to stay away from Ashnard, who on the hard difficulty will move around. However, you must make sure you're not putting your units into difficult positions. Having a few units go straight forward, towards Bryce, and another group go either left or right (depending on which you feel your units would be better fighting against) can be a good strategy. Once one side is cleared, you can either wait for units to slowly come to you and pick them off, or slowly move towards them. If you're very confident in your units, you can even split your group into three, and have all three paths covered at once.

, There's a lot of enemies on the map, that could get in the way of a fight or even potentially kill a character before a battle with Ashnard even begins. Using your units to make sure Ike and anyone else planning to fight Ashnard is at full health, can be very important. Keeping them distracted/routing them should be considered in any of your strategies. However, a lot of them also provide a lot of, possibly needed, EXP. Especially, if your Ike is under-leveled. Especially if playing on a lower difficulty, take advantage of the fact that you have some time before fighting Ashnard.

, On the hard difficulty, having Ike and your dragon laguz set up in a bush can be a huge help to surviving battles against Ashnard while you wait for your abilities to kick in. Just be sure that Ike is the closest unit to Ashnard, when he decides to start moving. If playing on a lower difficulty, having Ike's supports near him can help, since Ashnard is stationary. Just make sure that they are not in attack range of Ashnard.

, Remember that Ike (equipped with Ragnell),the dragon laguz and the laguz generals are the only units that are going to be a threat to Ashnard. Ike on his own is not very threatening to the Daein King; however, if an Aether activates or Resolve and Wrath are added to the equation, then Ike, with a little luck, can even manage to defeat Ashnard by himself.

Start out at the easiest possible stage, and gradually work your way up as new concepts are introduced to you and you become more confident with the older ones.;
, Maybe after a few tries you just got lucky. Find out what you did wrong, and practice it multiple times to perfect that skill. You will thank yourself later on in the game.

, Being precise lessens the amount of times you fall off the stage, and being fast ensures you can finish the level within the time limit. Combine the two and you get a master, someone who can finish any level on their first try to well within the time limit.


You can improve your precision by finding a level that is like an obstacle course, like square holes on the ground you will fall through if you go over or pins you can't hit. Don't move the control stick all the way up to go fast, just keep it slightly tilted in the direction you want to go and gradually tilt is to change directions to get around the next obstacle.
You can improve your speed by first becoming really comfortable with going slowly and precisely and then picking up the pace a little.

Super Smash Bros. Melee: Easily THE BEST GAMECUBE GAME OF ALL TIME, Super Smash Bros. Melee is a top-notch Gamecube game that simply cannot be missed.",How to Buy a Nintendo Gamecube," EBGames and other game stores are currently selling used Gamecubes for around $30-60, which is less than most next-gen GAMES cost nowadays.;
, Thankfully, most used/new Gamecube games can be acquired very cheaply at most game stores. Below is a list of some Gamecube titles that shouldn't be overlooked:, It's an open-ended game, where you take the role of a human (I'm not sure what the character really is.....) in a village filled with anthropomorphic animals. Your goals are to buy a house, fill it with all sorts of furniture, pay off your debts, and generally just have fun, and there's lots to do, from fishing to contests to rare furniture, and much, much more. Think of it as a slightly different Sims game, except with talking animals. A must-buy for any Gamecube owner.

, It's an unusual RPG with a great storyline and better-than-average graphics. It uses a turn-based battle system that revolves around ""cards"" called Magnus, which can be used for attack and defense. There are two games in this series- Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and Baten Kaitos Origins. The original Baten Kaitos has a slower pace, in terms of battles, and the storyline is slightly better than Origins. Also, there are more party members to choose from in the original. In Origins, the battle pace is faster, providing an eclectic blend of turn-based and ""real-time"" strategy. The voice acting (yes, VOICE ACTING) is MUCH improved in this version, and the storyline and music is still top-notch.

, It's a real-time RPG with a mildly interesting storyline and above-average graphics; although it may not be a must-buy, it's still worth a try.

, It's sort of a ""farming game"" as far as genres go; you grow crops, sell them, explore the town, acquire various farming animals, fish, and much more. It may sound boring, but it is a very addictive and fun game once you've played it for a while.

, For those of you unfamiliar with this franchise, it revolves around a young boy name Link who discovers that he is the true bearer of the mystical artifact known as the ""Master Sword"" and that he is destined to save the world from an evil being known as Ganon or Ganondorf. From the in-depth puzzles and dungeons to the innovative weapon selection and fast-paced action, the Legend of Zelda franchise is a pristine example of what a video game franchise SHOULD be. Another must-buy, although the large amounts of sailing in this game might be a turn-off to some.

, Twilight Princess is a deep, multi-layered game, from the intriguing storyline to the solid gameplay. This game has a darker tone than most Zelda games, garnering the first T rating for a Zelda game in history. The enemy AI (artificial intelligence) is more advanced than Wind Waker's, and the human-to-wolf back-and-forth transformation within the game is an interesting novelty. This game has been called ""the best Zelda game of all time,"" earning a 10 out of 10 in many reviews, and is an absolute must-buy for the Gamecube.

, Lego Star Wars takes place in a Lego-like version of the Star Wars universe, and it relates the events of Star Wars Episodes I through III. Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy takes place during Star Wars Episodes IV through VI, so it's really a matter of taste and what Star Wars movies you prefer more. There are a few notable changes between the two titles; Lego Star Wars II has customizable characters, ""bounty hunter mode"", where you can play as several bounty hunters from the Star Wars franchise, and improved vehicles and bonus levels. Many reviews have called these two titles ""fun, impressive..."" and ""The Best Gamecube Action Game of 2006."" They have also won awards for ""Best Gameplay"", ""Best Game Based On a Movie or TV Show,"" and ""Best Children's Game.""

, Hilarity ensues. This game puts an interesting spin on the series; a racing game instead of a platforming game. You can choose from a large cast of Nintendo characters and their distinctive cars, then it's off to the racetrack. This game features superb multiplayer modes, a large amount of courses, and the fact that a kart (car) can carry two drivers, one in the front and one in the back. This title has garnered many positive reviews, earning an average 9.5 out of 10. Definitely worth a look for racing fans and Mario fans alike.

, These two games are no different. Metroid Prime's story revolves around a bounty hunter named Samus, who investigates a ship that sent out a distress signal.She finds out that it is owned by space pirates, only to discover that not everything is as it seems.........Echoes features a more ""light-and-dark"" storyline, and is quite different from the original Prime's storyline. These two games are sort of a combination between first-person shooters and action/adventure games. These two titles, especially Prime, have been critically acclaimed, garnering 10 out of 10s in many reviews and were chosen for the ""Top 100 Games"" list for GameFaqs, the ""Top 100"" list for IGN, and the original Prime is considered one of the best-selling games for the Gamecube, and stands as the third-highest-rated game of all time as of November 2007. A must-buy.

, The storyline borrows quite a bit from the Cthulhu Mythos, and revolves around the female protagonist named Alexandria, who is investigating the mysterious murder of her grandfather. Eternal Darkness is notorious for its ""sanity effects""; a green bar at the top of the screen measures how much ""sanity"" you have left. When it becomes low, very strange things happen in-game, including surreal events; a ""blue screen of death""; when trying to save, instead of the usual ""Do you wish to overwrite saved data"" screen, there is a ""Do you wish to delete all save files"" with the options ""Yes"" and ""Continue without saving."" No matter what you do, all files appear to be deleted; insects swarming over the lens of the camera, game messages that claim that an ""error"" has occurred, and the inventory screen appearing to be empty. This game may not have achieved incredible commercial success, but it has been called the ""#5 Scariest Game of All Time"" by Game Informer and X-Play, and has earned a 92% average in most game reviews.

, A turn-based battle system, based on the original Paper Mario, infuses this game, as well as the ""audience"" system; since most battles actually ""take place"" on a stage, the audience can boo or cheer you on, depending on how well you do, and you will be rewarded for how well you do by the audience. IGN has called this game ""an absolute blast to play,"" and it was named ""the 16th Best Gamecube Game of All Time"" by IGN. It currently holds an average score of 88% on Game Rankings.

, Unfortunately, it has gone down in popularity for game cube ever since the New Play Control! version came out. The basis of game play in Pikmin is to retrieve ship parts using strange plant-like creatures called ""Pikmin""; there are different colors and types of Pikmin, each with their own unique powers. The story revolves around an odd creature named Captain Olimar, who, in order to save his company, must acquire a set amount of money to keep himself in business. He crash-lands on a bizarre planet along the way, and must use the native Pikmin to repair his ship and escape, all the while gathering valuable items, in 30 days, before his oxygen supply runs out. Most ""game days"" are 15 minutes in length, and Olimar must return to his ship along with his Pikmin squadron before the time limit is up, otherwise the native beasts will devour most of his Pikmin. The game also features a more difficult Challenge Mode, better-than-average graphics, and a unique style of gameplay. Pikmin has earned a 9.1 out of 10, an award for ""Best Puzzle Game,"" an ""outstanding"" rating according to IGN, and is considered fun for gamers of all skill levels. Pikmin 2, Pikmin's sequel, was even more acclaimed than the original, mostly because the 30-day time limit was removed. There are also two more types of Pikmin in Pikmin 2, improved controls, easier multitasking, the addition of ""sprays"", a multiplayer feature, and the fact that a player can continue searching for treasure as long as he or she wishes, instead of only 30 days. Pikmin 2 has earned a 39/40 according to Famitsu, and IGN and Gamespot both gave the game a 9.3 out of 10. Another must-buy, especially Pikmin 2, seeing as it is the better of the two games.

, But when he arrives at the village where Ashley is being held captive, he discovers that it has been taken over by horrific creatures known as Los Ganados, and a religious cult bent on world domination named Los Illuminados. Smarter and quicker than regular zombies, Los Ganados feature sophisticated AI. The game is well known for its solid gameplay, quick controls, item management, cinematic cutscenes and storyline, and fast-placed gun play. This game has earned several Game of the Year Awards, achieved Player's Choice Status, and has earned a 10 out of 10 in many reviews.

, It has earned over 91% for all versions on Game Rankings.com, and has earned a 9.2 from IGN.

, This game features many fun minigames, but the plot is very weak. It is an excellent multiplayer/party game, and has earned an E3 2002 Game Critic Award for Best Puzzle/Trivia/Parlor Game, and is a Player's Choice Game.

, The game revolves around many popular Nintendo characters fighting it out on many different stages. The game features many diverse Nintendo characters, from Mario to Kirby to Fox, and much more, a ton of different items to use in battle, a rich and superb multiplayer mode, and dozens of trophies and various unlockables to acquire. Super Smash Bros. Melee is sixth on the Gamefaqs list of ""Best...Game....Ever...."", IGN's reader choice chose it as ""Game of the Year,"" Electronic Gaming Monthly chose it as ""Best Multiplayer Game"" and ""Best Gamecube Game,"" the 200th edition of Electronic Gaming Monthly selected Melee as #92 of the Most Influential Games of All Time on their ""Top 200 Games of All Time"" list, IGN named it the third ""Best Gamecube Game of All Time"" in 2007, and Gamespy chose it as fourth in a similar list. Melee has earned many, many 10 out of 10 reviews and is considered to be THE best Gamecube game ever. If you buy no other game for the Gamecube, buy Melee.

Make sure your town is populated to capacity.,
Check the condition of your town with Pelly or Phyllis at the town hall.,
Reap the benefits.",How to Have a Perfect Town in Animal Crossing," Your town is divided into 16 acres. These acres are 16 squares by 16 squares each. A perfect town should have at least 8 perfect acres, and 8 good acres. How good an acre is is measured by the number of trees, flowers, weeds, and junk in that acre.;
, This is so you’ll know how much trees and flowers you should have. The best way to do this is to choose a pattern from your inventory. Start at the top left (or top right) corner of your town and count 16 squares to the right.


Put the pattern on the 16th square and on the one next to it to the right, which is the first square of the next acre. Knowing that that square is part of the acre, count 16 squares to the right again, and mark the 16th and the 1st in the next acre.
Keep marking, and do this vertically too, until you have finished the whole map.

, When you go to Isabelle in the Town Hall and talk to her by pressing “A,” you have the option of inquiring about citizen satisfaction in your town. Isabelle will then give you guidance on how to improve.

, In order to do this, go sit in the mayor’s chair in the back of the Town Hall. Isabelle will then come up, and talk to you.


There will be two options for what you can do in the mayor’s chair: public works projects and ordinances. For this, pick public works projects. Then, you will see the list of available public works projects. Choose the one you like most and you’ll be off to the next step!
Building upgrades, such as the Dream Suite, do not count towards the number of public works projects as far as the citizen satisfaction is concerned.
Remember that some public work projects reduce citizen satisfaction. This can be any project that emits a large amount of unnatural light (e.g., video screen) or is industrial (e.g., drilling rig).

, Isabelle will tell you that you need to find a place for the project to be placed. You can then run around town, and Isabelle will follow you. Once you have a spot you like, talk to Isabelle again by pressing “A.”


If the spot is large enough and not blocked by nearby features (such as a river), then Lloid the gyroid will be placed and you can start collecting funds.
If the spot does not provide ample space, you will need to keep looking.

, Of course, you need to collect the funds! Every public works project has a different funding amount that is listed when you first pick from the available projects. Your citizens will chip in a small amount of bells, but it is up to you to collect the bulk.


Once you have completely funded the project by donating bells to the gyroid, the project will be completed and built the next day.

, Oftentimes, you’ll find yourself being told that your citizens want more public works projects—build them!

, Sometimes, Isabelle might also tell you that the citizens want more flowers and trees in the town. It is actually good because not only will it increase citizen satisfaction, it will make your town more beautiful.

, In fact, it is the first thing you should consider doing. Setting the ordinance in place will result in flowers almost never wilting and weeds growing less frequently, thus aiding you in your mission to keep the town beautiful.

, If you have time traveled a lot without caring about how much weeds there will be, chances are your town is by now flooded with them. It could be very frustrating to think of having to get rid of every single one, but believe me, it’s completely worth it.


Your town will look amazing just because there are no weeds, and it is not as hard as it may appear at first, be patient.

, If there was a rafflesia somewhere in your town, then you might want to see if there are more. Rafflesias are big red stinky flowers (considered as weeds) that appear when there are too much weeds in your town.


You can get rid of a rafflesia if you pluck every single weed in your whole town.

, This also includes junk that is buried. Make sure to get rid of them because they are unacceptable in having either perfect or good acre.


Fruits, however, and shells are not considered junk, nor are patterns that you put down, so they can stay.

, Too many will cause a decrease in satisfaction. Isabelle can help you gauge whether or not you have too many or too few trees; if she doesn’t mention trees at all, then you know you’ve hit the right balance.


To plant trees, have a sapling in your inventory (purchased from the garden center), and follow the same process with the flowers.
To plant fruit trees, you must first dig a hole with your shovel, have a fruit in your inventory, and then bury that piece of fruit.
Trees must have at least one space between each other in order to grow and absorb enough nutrients. If you try to plant one tree too close to another, it will wilt and die.

, To plant flowers, have them in your inventory. Then, when you’re standing in the spot that you want the flowers to be planted, tap on the flower bag, and hit “Plant.” The flowers will then drop directly under your character’s feet.


You can purchase flowers from the garden center off Main street.
Planting flowers of the same type near each other is beneficial as it may result in hybrid flowers.
Don't have too many flowers, but not too few either. Keep in mind that weeds cancel out flowers on a 1:1 ratio. Likewise, if you don't want to get rid of some weeds like dandelion puffs or clover patches, you can just plant some extra flowers.
Flowers also substitute trees if there is too few trees in an acre, and they can also cancel out trees if there are too many of them.

, Your town can hold at most 10 villagers, and being capped is your best bet for achieving perfect town status. Having less than 10 can result in less satisfaction.

, Once you've built public works projects and beautified your town, check with Pelly or Phyllis if there are anything else you must do.


Isabelle{ or Pelly and Phyllis before New Leaf] will roughly tell you what the problem is, but you will have to figure out where the problem is. She will either tell you that you have to add more trees, get rid of trees, add flowers, get rid of rubbish or get rid of weeds, or she might tell you that this town is horrible which means you have to do all of the above.

, For as long as you keep your town beautiful, build many public works projects in it, and keep it fully populated, you will achieve Perfect Town status. Benefits will be in the form of new public works projects, rare mushrooms, and the Golden Watering Can.

Enjoy your clear town!",How to Have a Lovely Town on Animal Crossing City Folk1," A selection is the little pieces of the town that are connected by a bridge or a slope. First you must know where your house is and start working on the selection your house is in.
, All of them. Until your selection is also clear from trees. (It's probably best to time travel and buy more than one as the axes break easily, but be careful of the weeds!)

, and dig up those messy tree stumps!

, or by just simply tapping the hole.

,, But keep reading if you want decorations! (More greenery e.t.c)

"
"
Read the steps above so that you know what you're doing.

,
Find a nice blank space (In your house selection) to make your flower path, you could make the path go from the beach to your house, from a bridge to the town hall or a path just going nowhere!,
Find a pattern to be your path, by clicking the little pencil icon at the bottom of the screen.,
Make a path!,
Abort this step if the path doesn't lead to anywhere.,
Finish the path.,
Get some flowers.,
Now go to the beginning of your path and plant all the flowers you found around the path and work your way upwards.,
Now again, from where you just left off, plant all the flowers in you pockets around the path.

,
Make sure when you plant the flowers, don't plant them behind houses where you can't see them!,
That's all your flowers?,Save your game and return to the title screen,,
Click A on the Wii remote and as soon as you talk to the cat, click on other things... then Set date/time then set the date to 1 day forwards or backwards you don't want millions of weeds again, right?,Now click on your character and start the game again!,
Run to Tom Nook's store!,Plant them around your path working upwards.,
Is that not enough?,
Still not enough flowers?,
Congrats.",How to Have a Lovely Town on Animal Crossing City Folk2,", Your ideas of a path! Plan where you want your flower path to be, you don't necessarily need to write/draw it down, but you can if you wish., Then click on the one you want and click on display on floor.

, Make it where you want the path to go (e.g from the back to your house, from your house to tom nooks store, anywhere you like, you can even make it split to more than two places if you want, It'll take longer though!)

, When you've finished your trail, and it leads to a wall, instead of making it lead right into a wall, leave a gap for something to go there, like trees, or unwanted free furniture for everyone to take, or maybe even shells, but you don't have to.

, Once you've finished your planned path, it should look something like this:

, Now we need flowers! (Why else? It wouldn't be called a flower path if it has no flowers!) First go all around your town (Not just your selection) and pick all the flowers you see (Even the ones around peoples houses)!






 Remains of the chopped trees! But don't worry, they're for later :]

Chopping down all the trees in your selection must of left some remains, if so, you can either pick it all up, or, if you have no space in your pockets, save them till later!

,


Have you collected all the flowers in town? If so, good! Now to go and buy all the flowers at Tom Nooks' store, but don't buy any trees yet.







,, It'll be a waste of bells.

, Well if you want something to do each time you go on animal crossing, I suggest that you add all the flowers you can find/buy each day and water the dying ones each day! It'll be a flower collection!


What if you don't want to wait each day for the flowers? No problem, Time travelers! Read on!







,, Keep the time the same if you wish.,, buy all the flowers and pick any flowers you bump into! Also, pick any weeds you bump into as well!,, Then save the game back to the title screen again, and if you set it one day forwards send it 1 day backwards this time, and if you sent it one day backwards, send it one day forwards this time., Then keep repeating step 15-20 until you have planted enough flowers., You have now made a flower path! You may now take away the pattern to make it an invisible path or edit the path, or just keep it as it is! It's all yours now! Don't forget to water the dying flowers everyday! And if some have died, replace them with more flowers at Tom Nooks or around the town!

"
"Okay, for different fruits you'll need to go to Tom Nook and buy a load of papers.,Now write a letter to anyone you like (But not another person you're sharing the animal crossing with), make sure you're sending it to the computerized characters, write anything, just a simple 'hello' will do (They think of it as beautiful poetry anyway), and then attach your towns fruits to them.,

, Do not let your character eat the foreign fruit! Instead we're making an orchard! So get your shovel and dig holes all around your selection. (Try not to dig up your flower path though!) and once you've dug as many holes as you have foreign fruit, go near one of the holes then go in your pockets, click on the desired fruit and click on bury, your character should have then buried the selected fruit and now it should have turned into a sapling/shoot.,,,,, Be creative!

, To earn the golden net, you must first use the regular bug net to capture every bug in game. Below, there is a comprehensive list of every bug in the game. Looking at the huge list below, it is clear that capturing all kinds of bugs is a year-long effort, making the golden net quite a difficult item to acquire. Take a stroll around the area to find bugs.

, If you see a bug, quickly equip your net. You can do this by scrolling left/right on the D-Pad or by opening your inventory with the X button. Select the net and drag it over to your character.

, Depending on the bug’s location, catching bugs will vary.


To catch bugs that perch on trees, quietly and slowly approach them; only push forward on the D-Pad gently. When you’re about 3 steps away from the tree, hit A to capture the bug. If you move too quickly or too close, it will fly away.
Bugs that fly through the air can be chased by running after them, and caught once you’re about 3 steps away.
Bugs by flowers flock around the plants and can be caught by slowly approaching the flowers.

, Once you have caught all bugs, you will be awarded the Golden Net by Tortimer.

Know that there is a particular strategy, like all characters, that you need to get used to.,
Counter attacking is critical to your success as Doc.,
Generally speaking (although this depends on your opponent) you want to pill spam to bait your opponent.,
Now for the Counter-Punch.,
Once you have done this process 1-2 times your opponent will likely have about 60-80 damage.,
Edge Guarding.,
Back-Air: short hop and kick your opponent in the face this is probably the best edge-guarding attack you have.

,
Cape: especially against space animals (fox, Falco) this is very helpful against the Up-B recovery technique as it reverses an opponents attack making them face away from the stage thus preventing them from being able to grab the ledge of the stage

,
Neutral-Air: jump out off the stage and hit them with this move to push them further out (very good option if they have used a jump already).,
Recovery: you should generally try to recovery low with Doc and Sweet-Spot the edge.,
One advanced technique that's very effective with Doc is the WAVEDASH.,
Use the Wavedash primarily to get in close for grabs and tilts, and ultimately Doc's Ace: the wavedash to smash attack combo.,
Make sure you learn to SHFFL (short-hop, fast fall, L-Cancel) when doing aerial attacks, this takes a lot of practice but is pretty important for Doc.

",How to Win With Dr. Mario in Super Smash Bros. Melee," The strategy in the case of Doctor Mario is DEFENSE then counter. You cannot go into battle with Doc with an offensive strategy (well you can and you will but not in the same manner as say Marth). You need to focus on what I call Counter Attack Strategy.

, What is the counter attack strategy? Well basically you want to bait your opponent in to a compromised position. This may be self-explanatory but I write it out to emphasize its importance (I will repeat myself often in this guide, take it as something particularly important if I do). Rarely ever do you want to rush into an attack with Doc, you will get punished if you try.

, This will force him to attack you. This is the position you want to be in initially. If and when your opponent gets by the pills you then either attack his compromised position (he will likely have jumped over the pills or rolled by them) or continue to defend by utilizing your sheet (cape). The idea here is to be as aggravating as humanly possible to force your opponent into making critical mistakes.

, Once the opponent is in a compromised position you lay on the hurt. This is IMPORTANT for your success as Doc. You must COMBO to be effective as Doc. Use your tilts and up-throw to get them in the air and SHFFL to keep them there (after giving them about 20-30 damage with pills ect). Remember: you can't really combo that well until they have some damage so get some pills to connect before the offensive counter (this is not quite the case with the floaters: Marth, Peach. You should combo early against them because they fly to far when they have damage)

, At this point you want your opponent off the stage. Try a forward or back throw or a D-Smash to do it. This where you put one of Doc's best assets to the test.

, This is very simple: you do not ever, ever, EVER, let an opponent back on the stage in this game. With Doc this is pretty easy. The following attacks are very good for this purpose:

,,, Don't worry if you take a hit here as you will likely get pushed back towards the stage, getting hit here is generally expected and its worth it.

, you do this by floating kind of low then Up-B to just barely grab the edge thus allowing you to avoid the edge-guard by your opponent. If you get hit really far out you can try the tornado (Down-B) to get more distance, although this takes a LOT of practice to gain from.

, I said WAVEDASH! This move is very good with Doc and I often use it for all of my on ground movement (you can move faster than running in many cases);
, When the opponent is at about 30-40 damage I usually go for W-Dash to Down-Smash. You can often trick your opponent by facing away and W-Dashing at them D-Smash and hit them with the back end of the attack (they won't realize what you are doing thinking you can't hit them facing backwards :)). When they have about 60-80 and you can't get them off the stage try a W-Dash to Forward-Smash to slide right up next to them and connect (this is particularly effective as Doc's F-Smash does most damage up close).

Using B- Using the B button can execute a lot of Jigglypuff's strongest attacks.",How to Use Jigglypuff in Super Smash Bros Melee," You can either walk, by simply tilting the control stick left or right. Or you can run (in Jigglypuff's case, hop) by double tapping Left or Right. As well, Jigglypuff can also ""float"" or ""fly"" by Pressing up, or Y multiple times while in the air. Crouching is also a good technique to use. By holding down on the control stick, You can crouch, and avoid many attacks, that will fly over your head, because when Jigglypuff is Crouched, it becomes almost paper thin.
Using





and





Effectively - Using





and





can be very good for Jigglypuff, whether it's using it's Shield, or Doing an Air Dodge(An air Dodge is when you are in the air, and you tap the





or





to do a mid-air dodge). When you're on the ground. You can do a Ground dodge, this is where you tap the control stick in a certain direction, and press





or





(according to what direction you're going) to dodge an attack (This is also known as Rolling. Or you can do a shield grab. If you have your Shield on (Holding





or





) and a player is right beside your shield, you can press the





button to grab them from within your shield.
Z or Grab - Grabbing is very effective with Jigglypuff. Just stand by a person and press the Z button. or, you can do a ""running Grab"" where you run at the person and then press Z. This extends your reach by a bit.
A - The A button, though weak, can be powerful is executing a Smash attack. When pressing a Normally, Jigglypuff will do a slap, if ""a"" is pressed consecutively Jigglypuff will continue to attack. When you tap the control stick in a certain direction, and press a at the same time, you do a Smash attack. This attack will do a good amount of Damage, and can also be charged.;
,


Pound - When you tilt the control stick to the side and press B, Jigglypuff will do it's ""Pound"" where it does one punch in a certain direction. It can be used for horizontal recovery purposes, and can be tilted up or down after executing the move.
Rollout - When B is pressed alone, Jigglypuff will do it's ""Rollout"" attack. This attack can be charged, and can charge on for a limitless amount of time. The longer it's charged, The more damage it will do. (Up to a certain point, however.) This attack will go in 1 direction, unless you move the control stick in the other direction you want it to go. (This attack will only go left or right)
Sing - When you press B and Up, you will execute the attack, Sing. Sing is one of Jigglypuff's special attacks, but usage of it is not recommended. If you are near a player, and you use Sing, the player will almost immediately fall asleep. The move is easily punishable by air attacks, because characters cannot fall asleep midair.
Rest - When you press B and Down, you will execute the attack, Rest. Rest is Jigglypuff's strongest move, if executed perfectly. When Jigglypuff is almost right on a person, and Rest is executed, it will send the other player flying away (They will literally be almost off the screen, or farther), and will do good damage, but is only meant as a ""knock out"" move because Jigglypuff will sleep for 3 seconds, even with you don't hit the opponent, which gives them the opportunity to do powerful moves like Ganondorf's Warlock Punch or Captain Falcon's Falcon Punch.

",How to Play Link in Super Smash Bros Melee,"


Analog Stick: Move it lightly to walk or move it all the way to run. Tap it hard to dash to one side. Move lightly down to crouch or tap it quickly to drop through a floor (that has floor underneath it, of course). Tap up to jump and tap up again to do a mid-air jump. X and Y also allow you to jump as well.
Crouch: That shield Link sports isn't purely for... well, sport. It also is able to block ranged attacks from your opponents (i.e. Sheik's needles or Samus' charge shot). Crouching also severely reduces your knock-back from your opponents. Since it is much harder to phase Link, crouching makes it aggravatingly difficult to remove him.
L and R buttons: These are used to deploy your shield. Many players forget how important using the shield is; it can save your life! Just don't let it run out (it shrinks), or you will be severely stunned.
L/R:+direction: (You use it to roll) Roll! For God's sake, if you get nothing else from this guide, roll! Rolling is an absolute must. It is the key to victory and will save you from hundreds of points of damage. Rolling will keep your enemies guessing as to when and where you will attack, and allows you to deal damage without taking damage. Use rolling as often as possible!
Z Button: Grab. Note that since you get a long range grab with the hook-shot, it will take a moment for the hook-shot to retract, so be careful.
While in the air, L (+ direction, it's optional): Mid-air dodge. Use this correctly to trick an enemy or survive a big blast (like Samus' charge shot) in mid-air.
A Button: Quick attack. It is the most basic attacks, use it to attack your foes. Tap it quickly, multiple times for multiple quick stabs. Good for getting an enemy off-balance for a moment.
A Button+Tapping of Analog Stick (left or right): Smash Attack 1: A slower but stronger swipe. Use this often to send your enemies soaring!
Smash Attack 2: Using this effectively can damage foes extremely fast. Press A again after using a smash attack to do a second smash attack. Note that you can charge your smash attack and you can time your second slash to be more effective. In multiplayer games, you can use the C-stick to do a quick smash attack in any direction, but note that you can only do a second smash if and only if you press the A button at the right time afterward, as if you were doing it with A-smash.
A Button+Analog Stick Up: Quick upper swipe to knock enemies off balance.
A Button+Tapping of Analog Stick Up: A series of several strong swipes that you can link with other moves to score consecutive hits.
A Button+Analog Stick Down: Use this to trip your enemy and get consecutive hits. If you hit the ground, it'll take a second to take your sword out of the ground.
A Button+Tapping of Analog Stick Down: Use this to trip enemies on both sides of you, or to deal extra damage if you have the time.
While in air Tap A Button: If you simply tap A, you'll do a light kick that tends to hit enemies even if they are in the middle of an attack.
While in air A Button+Tapping of Analog Stick: This will swing your sword and spin you around, dealing considerable aerial damage. Also good for attacking a grounded enemy from the air to knock them into the perfect position to use another attack.
While in air A Button+Tapping of Analog Stick Down: A very strong attack, quite capable of killing someone, you will plant your sword straight down and nail anyone you hit. Hold it down and score up to three consecutive hits (note each hit will be weaker).
While in air A Button+Tapping of Analog Stick Up: Use this for enemies that are above you. It does leave you slightly vulnerable.

,


B Button: Bow: Hold down B to use your bow. Excellent for long range damage. Be weary; enemy shields can deflected back the arrows at you, and in which case, you should use your shield also. If you crouch, Link's Hylian shield may actually protect him.
B Button+Tapping of Analog Stick Left or Right: Boomerang: Use this with a direction and a smash attack to send it further. Throw it at angles to keep your enemies guessing where it will hit as well as off-balance. Since it is a boomerang it will come back but hurt the enemy and not you.
B Button+Analog Stick Up: Spin attack. Extremely effective move. Excellent for getting back on the stage (if you're falling), as well as knocking enemies away, ground or air. Use it when you have enemies on both sides of you. Extremely effective when many enemies are around.
B Button+Analog Stick Down: Take out a bomb. You can do a bunch of things with these, even if they aren't very powerful. You can keep enemies off-balance (allowing you to go in for an attack), you can disarm motion sensors and Bomb-ombs, and create a little chaos. You can press B+down to throw it or tap A+Tap Analog left or right, or press Z.
A Button+Dash: While running, press A to do a rushing swipe. This will knock enemies off their feet allowing time for another attack.

, There are only a few, but they work very well.


Blocking Projectiles: Normally when playing Smash Bros., you would use the R button to create a colored circular shield that slowly disappears. However, when playing as Link, it's best not to. Instead, do absolutely nothing. Link himself is holding on to a shield, which is nothing like the one summoned by the R button. It is able to block most projectiles. The advantage of it is that it cannot disappear or be broken by extremely powerful attacks.
Bomb Jumping: During your recovery, pull out a bomb with Down+B. Just before you use your third jump, throw it upwards. Then, Up+B into the bomb. When it hits you, you can use your third jump again.

, Try to get a few in a row and time your second hit so that you land both. The second slash sends enemies further.;
,,, One easy one is the rush attack + spin attack (rush in, he gets knocked off his feet, then use spin attack to deal more damage/send them flying).

,,"
"
Use the tip of the sword.,
Time your attacks carefully and precisely.,
Use Aerial A-attacks wisely.,
Use his forward smash.,
Plan your Down-B counters.,
Reverse your Dolphin Blade.,
Wavedash.,
Attack twice in one jump.",How to Play Marth in Super Smash Bros Melee1," Marth's attacks are the most powerful at the tip of his sword. Because of this, you can keep attacking your enemies from a distance, while they cannot even touch you. It is best to be fairly far away from your enemy at all times.;
, Timing is everything with Marth's attacks. Do this and your opponents will be flying off the stage in no time.

, Marth's Aerial A-attacks are said to be the greatest in the game. However, make sure that that you don't give your enemy the opportunity to attack.

, This attack has a large negative stigma for being overused, and for a good reason. It is powerful, relatively quick, and has the greatest range of Marth's moves. Practice so that you'll be able to get a tipper; it's much more powerful. Also, do not over use the move because it can be punished or may greatly annoy the opponent.

, They can be useful, but it is entirely situational. Yes, it renders you physically invulnerable, but when used more than maybe once or twice the opponent catches on and will fake an attack, make you counter, and you will be left open for punishment. There are a few (a very small few) times when pros will use it, yes, but only as a ""mind game"" or trick to fool someone unaccustomed to seeing counters, or after a ledge hop (letting go of the ledge by either tilting the control stick down or away from the ledge, and using your second jump to come back onto the stage). It can also be used as an Edgeguard to counter characters using their third jump (usually up-B).

, Reverse Dolphin Blade (Up-B) is done by pressing up-b and then quickly back. If Marth is next to the opponent, it will be much stronger, capable of killing them at higher percentages.

, Marth's wavedash is among the best in the game, ranked 4th under Mewtwo, Ice Climbers and Luigi. It is done by flicking your thumb along a jump button (usually X) to do a short hop, then quickly directional air dodging towards the stage at an angle. If done correctly, you'll see Marth ""slide"" across the stage quickly. Try to input fast enough so Marth appears to have never left the ground. If mastered, this will greatly increase Marth's mobility and allow you to execute complex combos., Marth is one of the few characters that have the ability to do two aerial attacks with one short hop. This can be done with his forward-air, which comes out fast and has little recovery time.

Guard a ledge with Down-Tilt.,
Negate their ledge recovery with forward smash.,
Knock them down with a Down air spike.,
Edge-hog when your opponent is falling.",How to Play Marth in Super Smash Bros Melee2," Down-Tilt is a perfect move when guarding the edge from your opponents grasp. Use right before the opponent tries to grab the edge.

, Forward smash has an enormous range. Because of this, It can be used to overpower an enemy's recovery.

, Do this by hitting with the tip. Do not use this move off the stage because it has tons of after-move lag, and you could fall to your death. However, it is possible to jump from the ledge onto the stage and down air at the same time, spiking and opponent who tries to grab it after you.

, To do this, just grab the ledge as the opponent tries to do so. Usually, the best way to do this is with a well placed wavedash. Since only one character can grab the ledge, they will fall to their deaths if you are holding it unless they can make it back onto the stage or knock you off it. When you first grab the ledge or roll onto the stage, you are temporarily invincible so use that time to absorb the recovery attack of your opponent.

"
"
Use side-B recover in the air.,
Counter to escape a barrage.,
Sweetspot to recover onto a ledge.",How to Play Marth in Super Smash Bros Melee3," When being knocked away, side-B will give Marth a bit of time to stay in the air. When you are close enough to the side of the stage, then press Up-B. If you are close enough to the side of the stage and your enemy is trying to ""Hedgehog,"" the attack will sometimes hit him. You can even side-B more than once if you time it correctly, allowing you to cover vast distances to make difficult recoveries.

, Down-B is used as a counter, and is one of Marth's most helpful attacks. Use it when you are being barraged by attacks and cannot escape. You will take no damage from that attack, and then use a sword strike to knock away enemies.


Avoid countering repeatedly, as most players will catch on quickly and fake you out, leaving you open.

, This is done by delaying the timing of Dolphin Blade (Up-B) so that you grab the ledge as late as possible, making yourself less vulnerable as you recover. This can be countered by edge-hogging though, so be careful.

"
"
Pummel them in the air.,
Attack in ways people don't expect!,
Snare them with a rare Nair.,
Keeping momentum is key!",How to Play Marth in Super Smash Bros Melee4," Aerial attacks and smashes are extremely useful for amassing damage on your opponent. When they have a fair enough amount of damage, you can force them off an edge and use either a charged B or a smash to keep them there.

Well, that's a bit vague, nearly all worthwhile characters have a big air game due to complete cancellation of lag made by shuffling (see the related article here or preferably on smash boards) and most characters rely on smashes for KOs. a charged b is predictable, use c-stick smashes. yes, you're going to say they're cheap, but not to anyone who tries to use ""advanced techniques"". search the advanced how to play video on YouTube or go to smash boards to find out everything I've said here and more.

, One example is to jump forward and use your b to charge up a little and deal a good bit of damage. But remember, the only way this is a good strategy is if it is unexpected. So use sparingly (not a lot)., An easy yet effective strategy is to use Marth's nair (neutral air). It's large hitbox, double slashing, and quick execution is an excellent approach used by both Marth newcomers and pros, Momentum is your efficiency in combat. Performing combos is the most common way to improve momentum, but there is a better way. If you can't seem to get ""in the groove"" of a fight, and the enemy has more momentum, try to disrupt him instead of trying to immediately get him with combos and such. Get him off of his game, and then you can worry about getting back on yours. You aren't going to beat him if his momentum is greater, so stop him, then you will be able to build your own."

Learn to SHFFL (short hop fast fall L-cancel).,
Learn to bomb jump.,
Use the hookshot to mix up your recovery.,
Use Link's up special.",How to Play Link Professionally in Super Smash Brothers Melee Tournaments,"

Link has very strong smash attacks (A and a direction or C-stick) that are good for killing the opponent and racking up damage, but they are a bit slow. Link's strong attacks (A lightly and a direction) are fast and good for setting up aerial combos. Link has very good aerial attacks (A and a direction in the air or C-stick) that are very powerful, with some of them being his main killing options, such as down aerial and up aerial. Link's special attacks (B and a direction) are great for keeping enemies away from you; all of his projectiles are good for making it difficult for the opponent to approach you, and the bomb can help you get back on stage easier.
,

To wavedash, you must jump and immediately air dodge diagonally into the ground. This causes the character to slide along the ground, similar to dashing, but allows the character to use any ground move, not just a dash attack. While Link's wavedash doesn't move him very far, he can still do useful things with it, such as wavelanding or edgeguarding with it.

To waveland, airdodge into the ground right when you are about to land. This technique is very similar to a wavedash, except instead of jumping you do it while landing. Wavelanding is useful for landing on the ground and on platforms quickly, while being able to attack out of it.
To edgeguard with a wavedash, go close to the edge while facing away from it, and wavedash backwards. This will make you fall of the stage and grab the ledge. This is useful if your opponent is trying to grab the ledge, as only one person can grab the ledge at a time.

,

SHFFLs allow you to use an aerial attack really close to the ground and quickly act out of it, making it a valuable tool for attacking and continuing combos. SHFFLs also allow you to attack grounded opponents easier with an aerial attack. Link has very powerful aerials that can be used to SHFFL, such as neutral air, up aerial, and down aerial. To SHFFL, you have to short hop, use an aerial, fast fall, and then L-cancel the aerial.

Short Hop: To short hop, lightly press X or Y. You will jump lower than normal.
Fast Fall: To fast fall, hold down at the peak of your jump. This causes you to fall quicker than normal.
L-cancel: To L-cancel, press L, R, or Z when you land on the ground of you are doing an aerial attack. This will allow you to act sooner after landing.

,

To bomb jump, pull out a bomb as soon as possible once you get hit far off stage, throw it upwards, and use your up special into the bomb. If done correctly, the bomb's explosion will hit you, and you will be able to use up special again or your hookshot., To grab onto the ledge (or any wall) with your hookshot, press Z when you are offstage near the ledge and facing it. If you feel that your opponent can predict your up special recovery and grab the ledge to take that option away from you, use your hookshot to get back on stage. This can surprise your opponent, and potentially turn the situation to your advantage. You can also use the hookshot after an air dodge, so you can use your air dodge to give you a little extra height, or move closer to or further from the stage before using the hookshot. Then, when you are hanging, you can press A to jump up from where you are. At certain heights, this can snap you directly to the ledge, which gives you some invincibility to help you get back on stage.

,

The spin attack is one of Link's most versatile moves. It can be used to get back on stage, to finish an aerial combo, or to prevent the opponent from grabbing the ledge.

Getting back on stage: Link's up special is a good way for Link to get back on stage, due to it going relatively high and doing damage, deterring anyone from trying to interrupt it.
Finishing aerial combos: The last hit of an aerial up special has good knockback, meaning that if you can trap an opponent in an aerial up special when they are at a high percentage, they could potentially be killed by it.
Preventing the opponent from grabbing the ledge: If the opponent is hit by a grounded up special, they will be sent diagonally downwards with considerable power. This is called a semi-spike. If this is done near the ledge, it can send the opponent far enough that they cannot come back. To make sure they can't come back, grab the ledge. This will force them to land on the stage, due to only one player being able to grab the ledge at a time, making it harder for them to survive.

Use this speed to your advantage to combo opponents and to attack before they can. Fox is also a very combo-oriented character. Learn some of his bread-and-butter combos, such as up throw to up aerial, and use them to defeat your opponent.;
, Fox has very useful special attacks, that can help him get on stage easily, rack up damage, or combo into other attacks.


Neutral special (B): Fox pulls out his blaster and shoots lasers. It doesn't make the enemy flinch at all (unlike Falco's blaster), and doesn't deal very much damage, but shoots very quickly. Use the blaster if the opponent is far away and and doesn't want to come to you.
Side special (sideways and B): Fox shoots forward very quickly while leaving illusions of himself behind. It is best used to get back onto the stage, due to the fact that it is very quick. Since it does little damage and knockback, it is not recommended to use this as an offensive move.
Up special (up and B): Fox turns into a ball of fire, and after a few seconds flies in the direction the control stick is held down in. Useful for getting back on stage, but not good as an attack due to it taking a long time to activate.
Down special (down and B): Fox activates his reflector, also known as a shine. The reflector can reflect any projectile back at the opponent. While touching/contacting an enemy, it will push them a bit sideways if on stage, and diagonally downwards if offstage. Fox's reflector can be jump cancelled, meaning that if you input a jump Fox will stop using his reflector. This can be tied in with a wavedash (jump and immediately airdodge into the stage) to ""waveshine"" (down special, wavedash, down special, repeat) an opponent off the stage with little interruptions. Be aware, this requires quick button presses, and may take practice to do consistently.

, Fox has good tilts that can easily combo into other attacks.


Neutral attack (A), also known as a jab: Fox does a quick punch, followed by another punch, and then does a bunch of kicks. If A is pressed only once, Fox will only do the first punch. If A is pressed twice, Fox will do the first punch and the second punch, but no kicks. It is best to only use the punches by itself due to the kicks having extremely little knockback. The first punch is very versatile, and can combo into several things, such as up smash or forward smash. If your opponent is on the ground, and you use the punch part of the neutral attack, it will force the opponent to get up, allowing you to follow up with an attack. This is called a jab reset.
Strong side (lightly sideways and A): Fox sticks his foot out. This move can be angled up or down slightly. If used near the edge and angled downwards, it can prevent the opponent from grabbing the ledge.
Strong up (lightly up and A): Fox does an upward kick behind him. This move has decent range and power and pops opponents upward. Up tilt can combo into all of Fox's aerial attacks as well as up smash, another up tilt, or a down special.
Strong down (lightly down and A): Fox quickly sweeps of his tail. Can combo into aerial attacks well.
Dash attack (A while running): Fox sticks his foot out while running. Can combo into some moves, but is vulnerable to being shielded.

, Fox has good smash attacks that have high knockback and are quick.


Side smash (sideways and A on ground or sideways on c-stick on the ground): Fox does a roundhouse kick. It has decent range and moves Fox forward a bit, but if missed can be punished easily by your opponent.
Up smash (up and A on the ground or up on c-stick on the ground): Fox does a fast overhead kick. It is extremely powerful, killing enemies easily under 100%. If you use down special and wavedash out of it, you can follow up with an up smash.
Down smash (down and A on the ground or down on c-stick on ground): Fox does a strong split kick. It hits on both sides and it a great way to attack enemies that are coming off the ledge. It has very high knockback and can easily send enemies off the stage far enough so they can't get back.

, Fox has very good aerials that are powerful and quick.


Neutral aerial (A in the air): Fox kick out in front of him quickly. This is a good way to bring up damage with little risk. It has a unique property move because it it stronger when first used and gets weaker during the later frames of the move. It shares this property with Fox's back aerial as well.
Forward aerial (forward and A in the air or forward on c-stick in the air): Fox kicks quickly in front of him five times. This move is situational because it is very difficult to land all the kicks, and each kick individually doesn't do much damage.
Back aerial (backwards and A in the air or backwards on c-stick in the air): Fox kicks behind him. It is similar to neutral aerial because it is stronger in the first few frames of use and weaker in the later frames. This move is great for preventing people from coming back on the stage since it is fast and has decent knockback.
Up aerial (up and A in the air or up on the c-stick in the air): Fox quickly whips his tail above him and then kicks up with his foot. It is a very powerful move and can easily kill upwards if both hits connect, but is very weak if only the first hit connects. Use this after an up throw for a nice combo.
Down aerial (down and A in the air or down on c-stick in the air): Fox spins around and drills downwards. This move can combo into several moves if used near the ground, such as an up smash, grab, or down special.

, Fox has decent throws, with one being a great set up for combos. To grab, press Z or L/R and A.


Pummel (A while an opponent is being grabbed): Fox knees his opponent. Useful for racking up damage, but be careful not to jab too many times, or your opponent may escape from the grab.
Forward Throw (forward while opponent is being grabbed): Fox punches the opponent and they fly forward a bit. Useful for getting the opponent off stage. If used against a heavy opponent, they can be grabbed again right after, allowing them to be potentially ""chain grabbed.""
Back Throw (backwards while opponent is being grabbed): Fox throws the opponent behind him and shoots three lasers at them. Doesn't have much combo potential, so it is mainly used for throwing the opponent off stage.
Up Throw (up while opponent is being grabbed): Fox throws the opponent up and shoots three lasers at them. This is Fox's best throw to set up a combo, because it can easily be followed by any aerial, and up smash, or an up tilt.
Down Throw (down while opponent is being grabbed): Fox slams the opponent on the ground and shoots them with a bunch of lasers. Can combo into a down special, up smash, or up tilt; however, the opponent can roll away after the throw ends and avoid any follow up attacks.

, Examples of these are wavedashing, L-cancelling, shine spiking, and drillshining. While the first two techniques aren't exclusive to Fox, they are still very helpful and important to learn.


Wavedashing allows a character to slide along the ground, giving them a pseudo-dash but allowing them to use any ground move, not just a dash attack. To wavedash, jump and immediately after airdodge into the ground diagonally. If done correctly Fox should slide along the ground a bit. Wavedashing is very useful for Fox because it gives him more mobility and he can use it to continue combos.
L-cancelling allows a character to act sooner out of an aerial attack when they land on the ground. To L-cancel, press L, R, or Z right before landing if you are in the middle of an aerial attack. This will allow you to act sooner after you land than if you landed without L-cancelling. L-cancelling does not work with special attacks, it only works with aerials.
Shine spiking is when Fox hits a character with a down special off of the stage. When Fox's down special hits a character off stage, that character will be sent diagonally down. This technique is effective against characters that don't have effective methods to get back on stage, due to the fact that Fox's down special sends them just far enough so they can't get back. After a successful shine spike, grab on to the ledge, and just as the opponent is going to grab the ledge, roll onto stage. While rolling onto the stage, the game still considers a character as holding onto the ledge; therefore, since only one character can hold the ledge at a time, your opponent will have to land on the stage instead of grab the ledge, which is more difficult.
Drillshining is a combo with Fox that involves Fox using his down aerial, L-cancelling it, hitting the opponent with down special, and then wavedashing out of it. This combo can be repeated, meaning that the opponent can be trapped in this combo indefinitely. While this technique is very useful, it requires quick inputs and proper timing, making it very difficult to do.

, Training mode is a controlled environment perfect for experimenting with combos and techniques without the CPU player interrupting.

, Some top players who play Fox are Mango, Leffen, and Armada. It may be hard to understand what is happening sometimes, so slow down the video at these parts and watch it several times to understand it better. Try to watch what they do and analyze why they do it in that situation, and then try to incorporate it into your gameplay.

Use Throws: Throwing is one of the staples of being a good Mario character.,
Meteor Smash: The Meteor Smash is a powerful and deadly attack that Mario can use.,
Use the Backflip-Kick: The backflip-kick is when you are in mid-air and press up + A.,
Know His Down + A: Mario's down + A attack is a very effective and powerful move.,
Wave-dash: Wave dashing is good with every character, it makes you much harder to hit.

,
Cape: Mario's cape is one of the greatest ""weapons"" in Super Smash Brothers.",How to Play as Mario in Super Smash Bros. Melee," Most important may be his back + A throw (when Mario spins around then throws the enemy). It is very useful to not only do damage, but to also surprise and then separate your opponent from yourself.;
, Timing is everything for this move. Practice and get better at this and you will start to become a better player.

, It may be a weak move, but it is an excellent juggling move. As an added bonus if you do that and time a meteor smash correctly, you can get a quick K.O.

, Use this a lot since it is a good way to get quick damage.

,, It can deflect any ranged attack and, when your opponent is trying to get on to the stage, you can knock him off with no chance of recovery if timed right.

, When jumping, Kirby can jump 5 times in a row. ""B up"" just makes you jump slightly, then fall to the ground like a rock (but you go forward a bit and it's a pretty high leap).

, ""Down B"" turns Kirby into a the whomp, rock, or a 100 ton weight; however, there is no difference in damage output. If you fall on someone, it does about 20 percent damage and makes you temporarily invulnerable to all attacks excluding grabs.

, Use ""B Left"" and ""B Right"". It takes time, but deals good damage if you can land a hit.

Use Falco's Down-A attack.,
Use Falco's Down-A Air attack.,
Use Falco's Up-B Fire Bird.,
Use Falco's Reflector (Down-B).,
Use the blaster.,
Mix up the combinations.",How to Play As Falco in Super Smash Bros. Melee," This sends opponents skyward in a powerful tail sweep. This move can be a useful and quick kill option if the opponent is sitting at a high percentage and can be set up in a number of different ways. One of these ways is a laser to Down-A;
, This sends opponents rocketing down at a diagonal angle, so you never really have to intercept flying opponents. This is also a very common killing move, simply intercept the opponent with it when he's over air. Also, you will find that this move is one of Falco's best because it is essential to combo-ing.

, This is a lot more powerful than Fox's Fire Fox and has the power to send opponents burning into the background. However, it's still awful as an offensive move because it is far too slow to start up and finish, and leaves you open to attack. It is only useful for recovery. No exceptions.

, This points upwards (Fox's points sideways). Although this has nothing to do with the direction missile attacks go in, if executed close to an opponent, it sends them upwards. This is a really great move to use in combos, since you can continually use the reflector along with Falco's dair (down-air) afterwards and repeat in order to combo the opponent. This is called pillaring, and is not recommended for new players.

, Proper use of the blaster is essential, as this is frequently cited as the best projectile attack in the game. On the ground, the move is slow and inflexible, but by using the Short Hop Laser technique (short hop, laser, fast fall), a Falco player can greatly improve their offensive game. Using the attack in the air causes the lag associated with putting away the blaster to be cancelled upon landing and allows the player to move around while using the laser, making it the perfect approach tactic.


Another technique, the Ledgehopped Double Laser, allows players who are hanging off the edge to quickly return to the stage while attacking an edgeguarding opponent- it involves falling from the ledge, jumping, and firing two lasers before landing on the stage (the timing of the jump controls the height of the lasers). This can also help new players learn some components of the SHFFLing technique, which allows aerial attacks to be performed next to the ground with amazing speed.

, If you catch onto Falco, and you know all of his moves, you can easily mix up moves to make outstanding, breathtaking combos.


You could Shine (Reflector), jump, down air, jab, forward tilt, jab, side smash, then when the opponent is recovering, down air them as they are about to get to the stage. This will send them down at such a fast pace, and is labelled as a 'spike'. There is no way to recover from this move after a certain percent.
Another great combo is on Fox if he has 0% damage. Shine, downair, fast fall, L-Cancel, shine, downair, fast fall, L-Cancel, do it three times, then shine, jump (right away) and back-air, then when Fox is coming back, jab him then forward smash. Done. 0%-Death. Whilst pillaring, you must read the directional influence of your opponent and keep the combo going, or you will get nowhere. Falco's recovery is also highly exploitable, having a much weaker range than fox, his only upside being his side b, but his up-b is very edge guardable.

Captain Falcon's special moves (moves using the B button) may seem to be useless, but they can be very useful in certain situations. His B attack is extremely slow and leaves you wide open, however it is one of his most powerful attacks. Use it when your enemy is wide open, such as after their shield has been broken. Captain Falcon's side B attack is effective for popping the enemy up into the air, however if shielded against or dodged, it can be punished. It is most effective for chasing the opponent when they are rolling or running away. Use Falcon's up B to get back on the stage. Do not use this as an attack, as it can be punished if you miss, and doesn't deal much knockback. Captain Falcon's down B isn't very good for attacking, as it can be dodged easily, but if you are offstage and high enough you can use this to regain a jump, helping you recover.
Captain Falcon's tilts (lightly pressing in a direction and A), jab (A up to 3 times), and dash attack (dashing and A) are all relatively weak, however his tilts are decently quick, and can be good for preventing someone from grabbing the ledge.
Captain Falcon's smash attacks (smash the control stick in a direction and A) are very strong with alright speed, however they have decent starting and ending lag, and his up smash has relatively low range.
Captain Falcon's aerial attacks (A attacks in the air) are where he really shines. His neutral aerial is good for starting combos, his up aerial has a great knockback angle and is powerful, his down aerial sends enemies rocketing downwards while having amazing range and power, his back aerial is strong and is good for preventing the opponent from landing back on stage, and his forward aerial is one of his best aerials, dealing extreme damage and knockback when sweet-spotted, and being one of Captain Falcon's best finishing moves.;
, Captain Falcon has the fastest running speed out of all character in Super Smash Bros. Melee, so make sure to use it to help extend combos and rush opponents!

, Learn how to do techniques such as wavedash, dash dance, L-cancel, and tech chasing, and learn how to incorporate them into your game.


Wavedashing is jumping and immediately air-dodging into the ground diagonally. If done correctly, Captain Falcon will slide along the stage a bit. This is a useful movement option as it allows you to do any ground attack right after, unlike a dash, and is a quicker movement option than turning around or dashing.
Dash dancing is when you quickly flick the control stick back and forth quickly. This cancels the starting animation of dashing, allowing the character to turn back and forth quickly. Useful for tricking the opponent.
L-cancelling is when you half the landing lag of an aerial attack by pressing the shield button right as you land. This should be done whenever possible, as it allows you to act quicker after using an attack. Only attacks using the A button in the air can be L-cancelled, not attacks using the B button.
Tech chasing is the act of predicting and chasing the opponent after they roll away, or land after tumbling to the ground. Wavedashing and dash dancing can be very important in effective tech-chasing. Captain Falcon has many moves that can initiate a tech chase, including down throw, down aerial, neutral air, and sweetspotted forward aerial (at lower percentages)

Bowser is a heavy character, which means he will require more damage to be KOed.,
Bowser's arsenal is almost entirely made up of slow attacks with large amounts of recovery time, so you should be careful not to give the opponent too many opportunities to damage you.

,
Bowser's recovery is good, considering he can't be KO'd through the top of the screen due to his weight, and his up-B is focused on horizontal recovery, but if he gets meteor smashed, he's a goner.

,
Bowser's up-B is a key part of his gameplay, as it gives a decent amount of damage, and lets Bowser easily move around the stage and cause damage (fortress).

,
The side-B is slow, but acts as a grab if the opponent is close enough.,
Some of Bowser's attacks cause him to pull backwards, upwards, or downwards.",How to Play As Bowser in Super Smash Bros. Melee,";
,,,, Use this on players who like to guard most attacks.

, These slight movements can dodge incoming attacks and allow you to damage them. These include his forward-smash, forward-A, aerial down-B, and up-air.

"
"
Pit: Use his Up-B while on the bottom platform, and press the jump button rapidly while steering Pit with the control stick.,
Sonic: Use Spin Charge on the bottom platform, and let go.,
Wario: Wait roughly two minutes until Wario has charged his Waft (he will be flashing yellow).,
Metaknight: Jump off the bottom platform and jump about 3 times in midair, then start gliding.,
R.O.B.,
Mewtwo: The psychic Pokémon does not, sadly, return in Brawl, due to a number of inherent flaws.,
Jigglypuff: Jigglypuff takes advantage of its forward-B, the Pound, in recovery.",How to Perform the Reverse Hyrule Jump," (Don't use the control stick to jump mid-Up-B; this cancels it.);
, Immediately, jump, and use your second jump when you start falling. When you are almost under the upper ledge, use your Up-B. The next part can be tricky, but you should be high enough to wall jump off the small wall under the edge, and barely grab the edge. There are rumors that Sonic can perform the Reverse Hyrule Jump without using his Up-B, but these are unconfirmed.

, Jump off the bottom platform and double jump at the right time. Use the Wario Bike, and jump off at the apex of the bike's ascent. Use the Waft, and your flatulence will rocket you up so high that you should not need to use his Up-B.

, (Note: Use the jump button, not the control stick, to start gliding.) Dive down then swoop up to just below the edge. Finally, use the Shuttle Loop, Mach Tornado, or even the Dimensional Cape. Meta Knight can also claim the honor of doing the RHJ without using his Up-B.

, (Robot in Japan): Jump, double jump, then use your Up-B once. (Stop using the Up-B by not pushing the control stick up.) Use your backwards aerial attack, which pushes you forward. Use the Up-B/B-Air combo until you are on top.

, However, he was great at jumping. First, fully charge your Shadow Ball and save the charge. Then, jump backwards and fire off the Shadow Ball, and the recoil will push you back fairly far. Then double jump and use your Up-B, and you should grab the edge.

, When you use Pound in mid-air, if you press Up on the control stick immediately afterwards, you will lose no height; this is called the Rising Pound. So, follow this pattern for the RHJ: Jump, Rising Pound, Jump, Rising Pound, etc. Jigglypuff can also perform the RHJ without her Up-B (as it does not raise her height in the slightest.

Or maybe you'd prefer a jack-of-all-trades, such as Link, Doc, or Luigi. Play with everyone, and play through the single player modes with every character to find out who you play best with.;
, This can be done by quickly tilting UP on the control stick, or by pressing X or Y on the controller. X or Y tend to offer more control.


You can also double jump by pressing the jump button again in mid-air.

, While every character has a relatively different set of attacks from each other, all attacks are based from one simple set of controls.



Basic Attack – Press A. Many characters will have a simple array of attacks that is achieved by pressing A many times in a row. For example, Link will repeatedly thrust his sword if you continuously press A.

You can also execute a basic air attack by jumping and pressing A.



Directional Attack – Slowly tilt the control stick in a direction, and press A. This executes a basic moving attack.

Note that you can also execute different directional attacks by jumping and tilting the control stick in the appropriate direction while pressing A.



Dash Attack – Quickly tilt the control stick in a direction to start your character off running, then press A to execute an attack.

Smash Attack – While standing still, Press A and a direction at the same time . Each character has 3 unique smash attacks .

You can also hold down A to ""charge up"" your smash attack. Release A to execute the attack.



, These attacks highly vary between characters, and reflect more on the character, compared to basic attack maneuvers, which are somewhat similar.


There are four executable moves with the B button:

B + UP
B + DOWN
B + LEFT/RIGHT
B, Alone


Most of the ""B"" attacks vary from character to character, but almost every character's ""B + UP"" acts as a third jump. This is an ""attack"" that is used to help get your character back onto the stage if you have been knocked off.
Note that, unlike A attacks, B attacks do not change, whether you are on the ground or in the air.

, To grab a player, run up next to a player and press ""Z"" on the controller. To throw, tilt the control stick in any direction .


You can also execute a ""running"" grab by quickly tilting the control stick to run, and pressing ""Z"". This gives you a greater range for which to grab a player.
While having a player grabbed, you can press A to hit your opponent a few times before throwing.
Grabbing and throwing is a useful tactic to help set players up for combos and further attacks.
If you have your shield up (holding L or R), you can also grab a player by pressing ""A"". This is a good way to quickly grab a player that has just attacked you, who will be slightly fazed by hitting your shield .

, It's important to know how to damage another player, but it's even more important to know how to fend off attacks.


Use your shield barrier. This is achieved by pressing L or R. Don't rely heavily on it, though, as because it can break, leaving your character stunned and vulnerable to attack! Characters can also easily grab and throw you when you have your shield up. This is called sheild-grabbing, and it is done by holding r or l to shield and then pressing a which makes you grab. This technique can be used against a person who tries for example to hit you with their repeated basic 'a' attack. When they stop (figuring of course that they aren't hitting you) you immediately press A and you grab them. (Don't use repeated a, it doesn't work on anyone but beginners.
Know how to roll. Rolling is a critical defensive technique that will help not only to evade oncoming attacks, but also to set yourself up to counter your opponent's attack. While your shield is up (pressing L/R), tilt your control stick LEFT or RIGHT.
Know how to ""spot dodge"". Spot dodging is good for evading enemy attacks without moving out of place. This is done by putting up your shield (L/R) and tilting DOWN on the control stick.

You can spot dodge in the air by pressing L/R while in the air. You can influence movement in your character by pressing in any of the eight directions, or you can press L/R, alone. Remember though that this will disable your up-b move which is usually you main recovery move which brings us to...


Be able to recover when knocked off the stage. This is done by properly timing your jumps back onto the stage, including your ""third"" jump .

, The act of grabbing edges is useful because it provides your character with a brief ""invincibility"", per se. Every character can execute different techniques by pressing different buttons while hanging from an edge. Here are some examples:


UP – Your character will climb up the ledge.
DOWN – Your character will drop straight down. Note that you will only have your second jump when dropping from the ledge.
AWAY - Your character will move away from the ledge. Note that you will only have your second jump when dropping from the ledge.
A or B – Your character will climb up and attack.
X/Y – Your character will leap into the air.
L/R – Your character will climb up the ledge and roll forward a short distance.
Depending on the amount of damage your character has, they will attack weaker or stronger. If their damage is 100% or higher, then their edge-grabbing-attacks will be weaker than usual. Example: Normally, Mario does a mini-cartwheel for pressing A. When he has 100% damage, he only does a small kick.
Timing is also critical when pressing these buttons. Depending on how quickly or slowly you press the button, your character will react accordingly.

, It's best to start in VS mode against a computer, so that you can get an easy feel for the gameplay. Adjust the skill of the computer accordingly, to a level that best suits you.


Even as a very talented player, you should limit your skill to a maximum of level 8. Level 9 computers are essentially the same as level 8, only with inhuman reaction time, which is impractical to rely upon when playing with human players.

, It's tough (try impossible) to get good at Super Smash Brothers Melee by only playing against the computer, since the computer can only do so much. Practice playing with your friends!

,


This is not necessary, but it makes the game a whole lot more fun. see the advanced how to play video on youtube, practice what you see slowly, and then you'll be able to kick your friends butts. Don't expect it to happen overnight though, practice practice practice, and watch professionals like Mango, ken, pc Chris, mew2king (m2k for short), Azen, Isai and others.

Remember to use Samus's regular special.,
Use Samus's side special if all your opponent is doing is trying to stay away from you.,
Avoid using Samus's grab unless you're 100% positive you'll grab.,
Try not to use her down smash as often.,
Try to avoid using her up special on opponents.,
Avoid using dash attacks.,
Use your up air if your opponent is in the air and they don't dodge much.,
Use Samus more often!",How to Get Good with Samus at Super Smash Bros. Melee," It can punish if your opponent isn't expecting it. Make sure you always remember to charge it up and don't use it right away. Your opponent will begin to get nervous, will forget about it, and you could easily strike them when they least expect it.;
, However, don't use it as much, because that move is slow when releasing the missile and could cause a blind spot and a free spot for your opponent to grab you or just attack you.

, Even though her grabbing range is great, it's slow and you could be grabbed yourself if you don't use it carefully.

, Her side smash is best to use to send an opponent flying. Her up smash is mostly best for racking up damage. Same with her forward air attack (racking up damage).

, This isn't the best move, because if you miss your opponent, that leaves you falling to the ground and no dodging till you get to the ground. Characters could easily use their back air to send you flying if you have plenty of damage already done to you.

, Samus is fast, but not fast enough that you should use her dash attack. It's not the best and you most likely miss a lot.

, This is a powerful combo attack that will send them flying if you use it right.

, She's a great character. Even if you main other characters, give her a chance! If you follow these steps and are prone to reacting quickly, you should be able to do great with her.

Neutral air: One of Link's best moves.,
Dominate Hit-time: To master Link, you must keep your opponent off balance.,

Defensive techniques: Offense is the best defense, but if you must defend, stay near the edges (unless you have very high damage!).,
Offensive techniques: Keep your opponents off balance.,
Have fun: The more relaxed you are, the better you play.

, Use frequently to cancel out opponents' attacks and to edge guard like a pro.
Side smash, A: Use this combo after unbalancing an opponent. Very useful for KOs and lengthening your smash hit time.
Boomerang (side-B): Try using the boomerang to unbalance an opponent. Great in the air and for edges.
Spin attack (up-B): Last but not least, Link's spin attack is wonderful for edge guarding, area effect attacks, ending combos, and most everything else. Be careful of lag time. Try this combo on an edge: Z, throw, up-B. If timed right, it can be an instant kill.

, Do this by using bombs, neutral airs, boomerangs, down As, and the spin attack. Try Link's dash grab.

, Make up for this with these moves:


The roll (side-R/L): Link's roll makes him hard to attack and can lead to some great combo opportunities. Roll frequently.
The dodge (down-R/L): Essential to Link's technique, the dodge can cut your attack time in half. Master the dodge.
Tech (press R/L when you hit a wall or floor): like L--canceling (another useful technique), teaching will cut your recovery time from a powerful move when you hit the ground in half.

, This will increase your probability of a kill with Link's fantastic edgeguarding skills. Grab your opponent and throw him/her off the edge, setting yourself up for an easy air combo game (use neutral air).

, Use boomerangs, bombs, and the neutral air to work your opponent to the edge. Finish off with a side smash, A combo.

You can include the keyword ""Fox"" to find more matches against Fox players., When Fox is at low percents, you have to be very careful. He's hard to hit in the first place since his movement is so fast and versatile, and if you miss an attack, he's fast enough to come in and punish you for it. Even if you do hit him, at low enough percents, he might be able to hit you anyway before your attack animation even finishes. You have to find an attack that's fast enough to hit him in the split-second window that he isn't ready, but strong enough that he can't just shrug off the hit. All while not getting opened up by the Fox in the process. This is called the ""neutral"" game.
, Luigi can put out two aerials in a single short hop. To prevent the other player from catching on to your timings, use different combinations of aerials and fast falling. You can also WL after the first aerial, freeing you up to throw out a hitbox in one place and move somewhere else smoothly.

Nair comes out the fastest, is a great combo-starter, and stays out for a while as a weaker hit.
Bair comes out fast too and has a fairly short animation. It doesn't have very strong knockback growth, but its base knockback makes it a good damage builder at low percents.
Fair can cover space above your head and stuff one of Fox's aerial approaches if you do it preemptively. Another good trick is to WL off of a platform, fast fall and L-cancel Fair or Dair.
Bair has great range below your feet and also covers all the way up to Luigi's waist. It comes out later than Fair, but the entire animation is slightly shorter. If you hit someone with only the ""hip"" hitbox, basically Luigi's butt, the move is a meteor smash (it knocks the opponent straight downward). This means hitting someone on the ground will stun them and put them in a great position for you to combo, hitting them in the air above the stage will start a tech chase, and hitting them off the stage forces them either to meteor cancel or lose their stock. However, it's hard to hit with this hitbox consistently, people can meteor cancel, and usually when you use this move you'd rather just get the normal hitbox.
Uair hits sooner than Fair directly above you and can start a combo. However, unlike many other characters that have similar-looking Uair attacks (Falcon/Ganon, Mario/Doc), Luigi's hits only above him while the rest reach further in front and behind.

, Once they're at a high enough percentage that your moves stun them for a while (say above 10%) use a DSmash, Nair, or Uthrow to knock them up into the air., This bounces them back up and is hard for them to DI out of, because it hits them forward if they're behind you and back if they're in front, keeping them above you. You can get 3 or maybe even 4 in before their percent is too high and you have to chase them down., UTilt has a hitbox above you and is weaker than DSmash, so you can sometimes alternate between the two. Hit them with DSmash when they're on or near the ground, then UTilt when they fall back down above your head. Since the UTilt doesn't hit them as hard, they'll come back down sooner and you can DSmash them again. This means you can keep this part of the combo going a little bit longer and put on a little bit more damage before going for the finish.,,, If they DI behind you, WD back and turn around like normal but FSmash, USmash or Up-B them. If they DI in front, jump up and hit them with Fair, Dair, or Up-B., When a character is hit with a strong move and then hits a surface (floor, wall, or ceiling), they will bounce off of that surface and be stuck in a ""down"" animation. However, they can prevent this by pressing ""L"" or ""R"" within 20 frames (1/3 of a second) before they would hit the ground. Instead, they will enter an animation known as a ""tech"".

They can tech in place simply by pressing the button, or they can roll to the right or left by holding the stick in that direction when they land. When someone is down, they can also get up in place, roll to the left or right, or do a get-up attack. These roll and stand-up animations all have invincibility, but there are a few frames at the beginning and end that are not invincible, and this is when you want to hit or grab them.

, You can either try to predict where they're going to go based on their previous patterns and their position on the stage, or you can wait and see what they do and react.

Predicting, or ""reading"", is good because you can decide what to do sooner and get a more rewarding punish if your prediction is correct, like when you start charging up a smash attack and then release it when they end up vulnerable and in range. The downside is that if your prediction is wrong, you don't get your punish and they might be able to punish you instead.
Reacting, on the other hand, is good because they can choose any option and you can cover it without having to predict what they were going to do. The downside is that it is harder and requires more precise timing, and messing it up can get you punished even harder than just getting a wrong read.

,

If they roll, immediately wave dash to where they are. At a mid percent, use DSmash or UTilt to pop them back up, or grab them. Out of the grab you can either chain grab, continue to tech chase with down throw, or try setting up an edge guard.
If they tech in place, you can use the same options as covering the roll, but without wave dashing first. Just grab, DSmash or UTilt.
If they miss the tech and then roll or stand up, do the exact same thing as covering a tech
If they miss the tech and you can react fast enough, hit them with jab or a fireball. This will cause a ""jab reset"", which forces them to do a normal stand-up in place. Because they are locked into this option, it's much easier for you to punish it. This is a great way to set up Shoryukens at kill percent.

, When your opponent is knocked down on a platform, it is even harder for them to escape than on the ground, as long as you know how to follow up.

If they tech in place, neutral standup or roll into the edge of a platform (which makes them do the roll animation but they don't go anywhere) then you can FH and stick out a Nair. You don't have to try very hard to time this, because the Nair stays out for a long time and will hit them whenever their invincibility goes away. You can do this to getup attack as well, but you actually have to time it to avoid the attack.
In a lot of situations, you can FH Bair and it will cover tech in place and roll one way with the normal hitbox, and hit them with the reverse side of the hitbox if they roll the other way
If you make it to the platform before or just as the opponent hits the surface and chooses their tech option, then you can tech chase them the same way you would on the ground, but here they have even less room to escape. This is a great place to go for a grab. To make it to the platform faster try wave landing in place, and also experiment with timings for normal landing, ""aerial interrupts"" and ""no-impact landings"".

, Some people say edge guarding Fox is hard, because they have too many different options for how to get back to the stage. Edge guarding Fox with Luigi is not as hard as people think—and super fun, too. The key is systematically taking away all of the best options they have, forcing them to choose a bad one, and repeating the process until their stock is gone., The first question you have to ask is how far they are from the stage, and whether they still have their double jump. If they do have the jump and are close enough to the stage to make it back without using any special moves or air dodging, you either need to hit them further away before they come back, or find where they jump to and hit them there. If you knock them off so that they're near the stage but below the ledge, you can either DTilt at the ledge or run off the stage and Dair. This will hit them if they immediately try to jump back up and grab the ledge, and if they don't, you should have time to back up and prepare for their other option.

If you get them in this position with no jump, they are forced to use their Up-B to recover. You can punish this by hitting him with Dair or Bair on the way up (depending on the angle), or when they fall back down (if they go above the ledge) with FTilt, FSmash, Dair, Fair, Bair, or maybe Uair if it's the only thing that will reach. If you force them to do a high angled Up-B and put themselves in free-fall and they're at a high enough percent, you can also use USmash or Up-B to kill them off the top. DSmash (easier to land) can also kill if they're at a really high percent, but Up-B (hardest to land) can kill them as low as 60% on some stages.
If they're at a medium distance from the stage, far enough that they can't make it back just by jumping, then they will have to use an Up-B or Side-B to get back on stage. Up-B goes further and can be done at a chosen angle, while Side-B is completely horizontal and shorter but is faster and therefore harder to react to. Both animations have the ability to grab the ledge, but Up-B can only grab if Fox is moving downward.
If they start an up-b too close to the stage, it can be very easy for you to jump or slide off the stage and hit him in the startup animation. Otherwise, you have to hit them out of their angle. If they side-B near you when you are already offstage, then you can hit them in the startup of that, but it's easier to hit them in the middle or end of it.

, This makes it so that they can't choose to grab the ledge out of side-b or up-b unless you release the ledge before they get to it.

If Fox is high in the air above the stage, he can choose to Up-B down diagonally to the ledge, straight horizontally onto the stage, or at a high angle so he can fall back down either onto the stage or a platform or back to the ledge.

, This way, if they go to the ledge, you'll still be holding it and they'll miss.

If they go horizontal, you can WD to follow them and hit them. If they're at a low or mid percent, you can combo them some more to build up damage before trying to hit them off again; otherwise, just try to hit them off the stage again or kill off the top. Fair has a great hitbox above Luigi's head, and Uair works if Fair won't reach. Bair has a good extended hitbox for if they're behind you and should knock them back off if their percent is high enough. At some heights you can jump above them and Dair. If they actually do land on the ground, there's still some landing lag during which you can grab, jab or Ftilt. You can do the same thing if he does a side-b, you just have to react faster.
If you can tell he's doing side-b, and therefore can't angle down to the ledge, instead of doing ledge stand you can do a ledge dash to get on stage faster to catch him. He then might be able to shorten the side-b and then fall down to the ledge, so try to mix it up and predict if he'll go for this.
If he goes high, then you should have plenty of time to hit him while he's falling, but instead of WDing toward the middle of the stage to follow, you should just jump straight up. If he's really high up and double jumping from the ground won't work, jump and WL on a platform and then Double jump from there to get him.

,

From this position, Fox can sometimes grab the ledge by doing a horizontal Up-b or Side-b, or angle upward, but the downward angle is no longer available. Both a horizontal angle and a slightly up angle can be interrupted by a ledge hop Bair or Uair (depending on the angle).

,, Then use a ledge hop aerial to hit him out if he's about to make it onto the stage. Grabbing the ledge and landing on stage are his only options, so you take away the ledge option first then stop him from making it back on stage.

You can sometimes cover these angles by doing a fast fall from ledge-double jump Bair or even releasing the ledge and Bairing without double jumping first. This is for if he's slightly closer.
If they aim high and try to fall back down to ledge, just grab the ledge again and hold it.
If they aim high and try to fall down onto the stage, but aren't close enough to make it to a platform, then stand at the ledge and hit them back off the stage.

Knowing all your characters' options will give you the best chance to counter your opponents' strategies.


Learn the smash attack. To perform a smash attack, flick the left control stick either up, to the side, or down and press the A button at the same time. You can charge your smash attack by holding A.
Alternatively, you can use the C-stick to throw out an uncharged smash attack, which is usually easier, faster, and therefore safer.;
, Special moves often add essential tactics to your character -- for example, Fox's Down Special (Down + B) reflects projectiles.


The Up Special (Up + B) is a particularly important move, since (for most characters) it acts like an extra jump to help get back onto a stage. If knocked off, it doubles as an attack, but not effectively.
Use your shield (press the L or R button). Shields block all attacks, except grabs (Z, or Shield + A). Warning: Your shield will break after too much use, leading to free damage or even a KO. Your shield regenerates automatically, so if you use it wisely, shield breaking will not be a problem.

, Grabs are a powerful tactic since they always beat shield. In addition, throws often can be combined or strung into other attacks, leading to additional damage.

, These are powerful moves because they let you attack your opponent while you are in the air.

, Simply running up to your opponent and throwing out attacks is easily countered. Sometimes, it's more effective to sit back and let your opponent come to you.

, Find out ways to counter them. (Example: If they shield a lot, grab him, since grabs always beat shields) Always look for opportunities when your opponent has few options.


For example, if you hit your opponent off the stage, and use their third jump, you have a chance at free damage and KOs because your opponent cannot dodge you.

, This is an obvious tip, but meaningful. You always want to have less damage than your opponent, since greater damage means greater knockback.

, (Pressure: controlling the match by being in a more powerful position than your opponent.) For example, if have a throwable item, keep it. Your opponent will know that you can throw it at any time, and will try to avoid it.

, (Juggling: attacking your opponent while he is in the air and above you, usually to the effect of sending your opponent back into the air.) This is a subset of pressuring. You are empowered whenever you opponent is above you, because you have many options, and your opponent has few. Take advantage of this.

, Note that this is also a subset of pressuring.

, The cable can only connect to one port on the back of the Wii, and has a red, a white, and a yellow plug at the other end. Look for a group of sockets on the back or side of your TV with matching colors. Firmly push each plug into its matching socket. The Wii requires Wii-specific cables in order to connect to your TV; standard A/V cables will not work.


The group of sockets that make up the connection will usually be separated from other sockets on the TV. The group will also be labeled INPUT, IN, or AV and may be numbered.
The yellow socket may be separate from the red and white sockets. It should be clearly labeled which Input the yellow socket belongs to.
You can purchase component (five-pronged) cables to connect the Wii to your TV for better picture quality. Your TV will need to support component connections.

, The power adapter only plugs into one port on the back of the Wii.

, There will be a specially-shaped port for it to connect to. The sensor bar is thin with a black front and gray back. It will sense the signals from your Wii Remotes (Wiimotes) and show your cursor on the screen. Center the bar at the top or bottom of the TV, and remove the covers over the sticky pads to secure it in place.


If the sensor bar won't stay in place on the top of your TV, you can secure it with small rolls of Scotch tape.
Make sure that the sensors are pointed towards the players.

, Remove the back panel from the Wiimote. Put two AA batteries in the remote; these are included with the console if you bought it new. Use the printed + and - guides to ensure that the batteries are inserted correctly.


If your Wii remotes have rubber jackets, you will need to remove it before you can access the battery cover.

Don't just press it for half a second and let go. This will only put it in sleep mode. You need to hold it down until the green light turns red. If you put it into sleep mode, the green light will turn yellow. You can't hold down the circle with a line on your Wii Remote to turn the Wii off. This will only put it in sleep mode, no matter how long you hold it down. And don't just do this step for your Wii, do it to save energy for your bills and for the world.;
, On the front of the Wii, there is a disk chamber to slide in your game. This doesn't need to be cleaned too often because there is an anti-dust curtain. But you should still slide a tissue over this to get rid of dust every month or so.


On the back of your Wii, there are a few openings for things like USB cords and other wires that connect to your television. These don't have an anti-dust cover, so make sure you wipe these down with a tissue or cloth every three weeks. Consider unplugging all of the wires and cleaning all of the openings. You can never be too clean.







, This is for the Wii's sake, and for organization. Don't try to stick things into the disk chamber to try to get your game out. Simply press the up arrow with a line under it that's to the left of the chamber. This will eject your disk, and won't cause any harm to your Wii. The same goes for any Game Cube disks you have in the slot. These are easily forgotten because they have a plastic cover over the opening. If you consistently forget to eject these, write yourself a note so you'll remember where you put it. You don't want to lose your game disks.

, This could range from one of your disks not starting up to the console randomly catching on fire. Although it could be a bug everyone's Wii has, in some cases it could just be yours. Report your bugs to Nintendo.

, You don't want to accidentally drop your Wii into a volcano just to hear you didn't secure your warranty. The warranty can be found in the owner's manual, but if you're having trouble finding it, email someone for help at Nintendo, or ask a fellow Wii owner in their neighbourhood where they found theirs. It's worth the trouble.

, Use the Wii Remote jacket as well. This is extremely important. People have broken their television screens because they ""followed-through"" with their baseball swing. Nintendo does not cover any of these accidents with their warranty because they provide cautions at the beginning of every game to put on and secure your wrist strap.


When the Wii was first released, the wrist straps were too thin, and they received many complaints of broken straps. Now they had made a new style of wrist strap that is more secure. Make sure that if you bought your Wii early that you go to a Nintendo store near you and update your wrist strap. It's much better than constantly flailing your Wii Remote across the room.

Press the HOME button.,
Select the Wii Remote Settings option from the Home Button menu.,
Select the Reconnect option.,
Press the 1 and 2 Buttons at the same time.",How to Synchronize a Wii Remote to the Console2," This is much different than syncing in the standard mode and is not permanent.


One-Time Mode synchronization lets you use your remote on a different Wii console (say a friend's) or a different remote on your console. You can also use it to change the order of players without turning off the Wii and starting over.
This does not get rid of the settings in Standard Mode. Once you turn the power off, the settings used in One-Time Mode will go away, never to return. If you accidentally turn the power off, you will have to start the process all over again, as your Standard settings have taken effect., Be sure you're using a Wii remote that is synchronized with the Wii console you're currently using.


Make sure both the console and the remote are on and working.

, Your other options are ""Wii Menu,"" ""Operations Guide,"" ""Reset,"" and ""Close.""

, This is also where you change the volume and rumble.


It's only temporary. If you're syncing to someone else's console, your remote will unsync when the power is turned off.

, Important: Use the Wii remote that you want to synchronize with the console. Should be a no-brainer, but you never know.


The Player LED will blink during the syncing process. When the blinking stops, the connection is complete.
If you are syncing multiple Wii Remotes, press the 1 and 2 Buttons on the Wii Remote you want to be player 1. Immediately after (without a significant pause), press the 1 and 2 buttons on the remote you want to be player 2. The order in which you push the buttons determines the order of the players in multiplayer games.

Shooting Mega Strikes: Mega strikes are shots in which multiple balls are fired towards the goal for the goalie to block.,
Defending Mega Strikes: If your opponent attempts a mega strike, try to stop them with either a hit/tackle or a steal.,
Charging the Ball.,
Nintendo Wi-Fi.",How to Play Mario Strikers Charged," It's basically a tutorial showing you how to play. Here you learn the basics for the game. Here are some controls:


A button: Pass ball, switch control of players when not in possession of the ball. During a mega strike, use A to block the ball.
B button: Charge/Shoot ball. When the Mega Strike meter is activated, the B button also controls your selection (more on mega strikes later).
Analog stick: Move, point in the direction you want to go
Z Button: Chip ball ahead
Z+A: Air pass
Z+B: Lob shot
C button: Use items
Shake remote: hit/tackle players
D-Pad: On offense, use a deke to throw defenders off, on defense, use for slide tackle/steal.;
, Try going to Domination Mode to improve your skills against the computer. Start with the skill level low, and work your way up as you begin to improve.

, All the captains and their sidekicks have their own set of skills, talents, and weaknesses. Each team has one captain, three sidekicks and a goalkeeper (who is controlled by the computer, except during opposing mega strikes and when the goalkeeper has the ball).


Balanced: These characters are average in all aspects of the game which include shooting, passing, defense, and movement (speed). Balanced captains: Mario, Luigi, Yoshi. Balanced sidekicks: Shy Guy, Koopa Troopa.
Power: Players with excellent shooting and defensive skills, but lack in terms of speed and passing. Power captains: Bowser, DK, Petey. Power sidekicks: Birdo, Monty Mole.
Offensive: Offensive characters are great shooters and passers, but are slow and lacking on defense. Offensive Captains: Wario, Bowser Jr. Offensive Sidekicks: Hammer Bro.
Defensive: Players who are quick and play great defense, but are poor on offense and can't do much when the have the ball. Defensive Captains: Waluigi, Daisy. Defensive Sidekicks: Dry Bones.
Playmakers: Players who can pass well and are quick. They are good for setting up goals but don't shoot or play defense well. Playmaker Captains: Peach, Diddy Kong. Playmaker Sidekicks: Boo, Toad.

, It's a tournament that's all about the road to the top...the ultimate prize of the game being the Striker Cup Trophy. You start out on the relatively easy Fire Cup, being one of four teams. Play each team twice, and the top two teams compete in an elimination game. The winner plays the Fire Cup Champion in a 3-game series. The champion is Bowser Jr, and if you win you unlock him as a playable character. You can then move forward to the Crystal Cup. The difficulty level is increased and there are now six teams. Play each team twice, top four teams advance. A two-round playoff system determines who plays the Champion (Diddy Kong) in a 3 game series. If you win, you unlock Diddy Kong an move on to the Striker Cup. The Striker Cup is tough and there are ten teams fighting for the trophy. Play each once, the best eight advance to playoffs. The winner in the playoffs faces the games final boss, Petey, in a series for the Cup. If you win, you have beaten the game and unlock Petey.

, It is possible to score up to six points from a megastrike. To do one, when you are open, charge the ball as much as you can. Then, a meter will appear with different colored sections. A marker will begin to move up the meter. To stop the meter, press B. The farther up the meter goes, the more shots will be fired. The marker then comes back, and most of the meter is gray, with a small orange spot in the middle and green sections just outside the orange. If you get the meter to stop (by pressing B) in the gray, the shots will be fired slowly, giving the goalie a better chance of blocking them. Landing in the green results in a medium speed mega strike, and orange is very fast. Be careful when trying to select a high number of shots, the longer the meter goes, the more time your opponent has to stop you by stealing the ball. If you go too far, the meter will give you a default minimum three shots.

, If the mega striker is successful in completing the move, you then act as the goalie to block the incoming balls. You take control of the goalie's hands with the Wii remote's motion detector function allowing you to point the remote at the screen and block each shot as it comes through. Remember to act fast and once your goalie's hands are over the ball, press A to destroy the ball.

, Press B to charge the ball. The more charged the ball is the faster it moves between players and the more likely you are to score. You can tell how charged the ball is by its color. An uncharged ball is purple and a fully charged one is white, representing the best scoring opportunity. Besides just pressing B, you can also charge the ball by passing it to teammates and chipping it ahead with Z.

, Mario Strikers Charged is playable online. Playing matches against real players can be very fun and challenging, as most online players are very experienced and many have found ways to take advantage of glitches in the game. Be informed that there are many cheaters online. The game keeps track of your wins and losses, and ranks players according to points. You are awarded ten points for a victory, and one point for defeat. You also get a point bonus of the number of goals you scored. So if you won 5-3, you would get 15 points and your opponent would receive four. Every seven days is a new ""season"". The stats and rankings are cleared every new season.

HAVE FUN!

",How to Play Just Dance 2 on Wii," This may seem silly to do for just a video game, but you'd be surprised by how tiring it gets, and before certain songs you should certainly stretch your arms and your legs, and maybe your wrists, fingers, and neck, too. You don't have to, but it's a great idea to do so.;
, Anything that is comfortable will work fine, like gym shorts and a tank top, or a T-shirt. For girls with long hair, I suggest that you tie back your hair, but it's not required. As long as you aren't wearing anything tight or really long (or layered), you'll be good.

, Pick a song you like, or one that looks cool. There are many songs to choose from. If you are playing with more than one person, press A on a remote to add you. You'll start to play. All you have to do is copy the person dancing. It's not difficult at all. Many times the moves are simple hand motions, or spinning, or something like that. Also, the moves repeat themselves many times. To know when to change moves, a small person will appear at the bottom of the screen showing you the next move. Note: Foot motions are not required, because the Wii Remote can only sense your hand. However, it's still fun to do!

, The goal is to get the most points. At each move, you can get an ""X"", an ""OK"", a ""Good"", or a ""Perfect"". An X means you didn't really get the move. OK means you're not quite there, but you tried. Good means almost there! And perfect means you did an awesome job on the move. Some moves are called gold moves. Every song has at least one, and many songs have several gold moves. A gold move is a special dance move, and it may or may not be harder than a regular move. If you execute the gold move well, you'll get a ""YEAH!"". If you don't, you'll get an ""X"".

,
Many songs are duets.

,
Although individual scores are the basis of the overall team scores, the extreme multiplayer basis of the mode changes what can be the individual nature of dance into something very different.

, You can copy any Wii or GameCube game by using the CFG USB Loader. Insert the disc and it will appear in the Loader program., You'll be using this homebrew program to rip the games from your Wii and GameCube discs to your USB drive., This will open the installation screen for the game that is inserted., This will begin copying the game files to your USB drive. This may take a while to complete, especially for newer, larger games., Once you have some games installed, they'll appear in the main CFG Loader window. Select one to view details and launch it., With the game selected, press ""A"" to start playing. You'll see some text as the game loads, and then it will start., You can keep installing games from any disc, legitimate or burned. All of the games will be added to your USB drive, and you won't need the discs to play them., Besides the convenience that a USB Loader and external drive provide, newer Wii models cannot read DVD-R discs. This means that a burned disc is useless on Wiis that were made in 2008 or later.

If you download games, you can copy them to the USB drive that your USB Loader uses and they will appear in your CFG Loader program library. You don't need to burn them just to rip them onto your Wii.

, If you do want to burn games to disc instead of using your USB Loader, you'll need the game image files. There are a couple of ways you can obtain these:

Wii and GameCube ISO files can be downloaded from many different torrent sites. See Download Torrents for details on finding and downloading torrents. It is illegal in most areas to download games you do not own.
If you followed the above methods, you can use games that you've installed to your USB drive with CFG Loader. Plug the USB drive into your computer and open the ""games"" directory. Games will be named by their GAMEID, so perform a quick Google search if you're not sure which is which. Drag the file you want to your computer. It may take a while to copy.

, If you ripped games using your Wii and copied the files to your computer, you'll likely notice that the files are in WBFS format. This will need to be converted to ISO before you can burn it:

Visit wbfstoiso.com and download the free program. Run the installer after downloading it and follow the prompts. No adware will be installed.
Open WBFS to ISO and select your WBFS file. You can click the ""Open"" button to browse for it.
Click ""Convert"" to begin converting the file. This may take a while to complete. You'll find the ISO file in the same location as your WBFS file.

, This disc burning utility will allow you to burn the ISO file to a blank DVD-/+R. Download the latest version from the ImgBurn website., Double-click the installer to begin the installation., After you select the location to install ImgBurn, you'll see a screen for the Ask Toolbar. Make sure to uncheck all of the boxes before proceeding., Once the installation is finished, launch ImgBurn from the shortcut on your desktop., This will open the disc writer tool., You'll need to have a DVD burner installed for ImgBurn to work. Be aware that if your Wii is newer than 2008, the burned discs will not work., Click the Browse button to navigate to it, or drag it into the window., To help ensure that the burn process works, select a slow writing speed such as 1X. This will result in a longer burn but will increase your chances of the disc working., This will begin writing the file to your disc., This may take a while, especially for larger games. The disc will eject when it is finished., Once the disc is finished burning, you can load it in your USB Loader. This will allow you to play it without having to install any additional hacks. See the previous section for details."

When it comes to Wracktail (Floor 100), use Luigi.",How to Beat the Flipside Pit in Super Paper Mario," You can get these by cooking a Shroom Shake and a Fire Burst in Flopside. These heal 10 HP outside the Pit, but heal 50 in the the pit.;
, Thunder Rage, Fire Burst, Ice Storm, etc. Just not Shell Shock or Ghost Shroom. (Ghost Shroom doesn't exactly work right.)

, Level 30 can be very good too.

, But Dottie can be a better idea because you can sneak up on enemies that normally attack when you get close up. You can use Barry too. Peach and Cudge is good too, and Mario is good for getting to the bottom of the room by flipping to 3-d. Use Luigi for those pesky Cherbils and Tiloids, since you can use his super jump.

, Use an attack item to deal with them.

, Use your super jump to smash the antenna and keep bouncing on it until his HP is gone. If you don't have Luigi, deal with him like you did Fracktail.

Learn the formula: FSM=(512÷THB)×FSB, where FSM is the total file size in MB, THB is total hard disk capacity in blocks, and FSB is file size in blocks.,
Determine the total amount of blocks on your Wii's hard disk.,
You should now have the total amount of blocks on the Wii's hard disc.,
Look to see that you should now have the approximate size of a channel, or game save, etc.

",How to Calculate the Size of Files Saved on Your Wii in Megabytes,";
, You must do this by looking at the bottom-left of the screen when you open 'data management' in Wii Settings. This tells you the amount of empty space. Go through each game save and channel save and add their amount of blocks to this total empty amount.

,


Use a calculator, divide 512 by the total amount of blocks. This amount is what one block is equal to in megabytes (remember, it must be 512 ÷ the total blocks, if you do total blocks ÷ 512 it will work out wrong).
Multiply this number by the amount of blocks the file is worth (for example, Internet Channel=250x(one block)).

Check out some websites that might have We Ski, such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and Target.,
Ask your friends/relatives if they have the game in their house.,
Visit a store, such as Best Buy, Walmart, Target, or GameStop.,
You never know unless you try, but it's possible that you can find it at a garage sale.

",How to Buy We Ski," Depending on the demand of the game, they may have it available for online purchases only or available at the store's location. There are some websites that you can also request a reserve copy and pick it up at a store.;
, See if you can borrow the game for a while or have it if they're not interested in it or don't want it anymore.

, If you don't see any on the shelves, always ask an assistant if they have copies in the back or advice on other stores they might know where to get the game from.

,"
"
Use your phone book first.,
Ask whether or not any of those stores have one.,
Go to some of the stores you know carry Wiis (see tips) and if you are very lucky, there might actually be a Wii there!,
Return to the stores right before shipping time and ask another employee about shipping again.,
Be patient and persistent.,
Wii Trackers.",How to Buy a Wii," Call any store that sells video games, game consoles and accessories to game systems.;
, Ask , ""I was wondering if you have any Wiis in stock. If the answer is 'no,' ask ""When do you expect to have one?"" If one is in stock, go to the store right away. If you are not legally allowed to drive a car by yourself, ask your parents or guardians to drive you to the store right away. Wiis sell very quickly when they are in stock!

, Otherwise, try to find an employee or a manager and ask them some questions about when they get their Wii shipments.

, If they don't know, hang around a little bit in case some get put out on the sales floor.

, These are the key to getting the Wii. Be at the store earlier than they expect to get the Wii in case they quickly sell out. They can't guarantee when they will have one. If it comes a little later, keep waiting till one comes in. If a Wii doesn't come in stock, keep calling stores and keep using steps one and two. You will get one eventually.

, There are also some pretty good wii trackers online that will help you track down a Nintendo Wii and also send you alerts when they become available.

Find secret exits.",How to Play New Super Mario Bros. Wii," This is one of Wii's hottest sellers, but it's far different than any other video game you'll find on sale. Today's games are mostly 3D, but this one is 2D (it's technically a blend between 2 and 3D, nicknamed ""2.5D""). You can only go in one of two directions: Forwards and backwards. If you don't feel like jumping right in, you could play some of the game's ancestors to get a feel for it.;
, Being a classic side-scroller, the controls are simplistic and easy to learn. The controller is held sideways, so that your right thumb should be near the 1 and 2 buttons and your left thumb is near the arrow pad and A button.


Directional Arrows: Select the direction to move in (left/right). When in the air, the down arrow does a ground-pound. When climbing on a wire fence (found in castles), all four arrows are used to move around.
The 2 key: This button is used to jump. Holding it down longer results in a better jump.
The 1 key: Hold 1 to dash. When combined with pressing 2, your jumps are much longer than they normally would be. When in possession of either a fire flower or an ice flower, 1 is used both to dash and to shoot.
The A key: Put yourself in a bubble. This is a great tactic to know in multi-player games. When you are about to lose a life (falling into a pit, about to run into an inevitable enemy), press A to save yourself. Another player can pop the bubble once you are in a safe area and you can resume playing without losing a life. This will not work in single-player games (you will lose a life).
The + key: Pause/Menu;
Wall Jump: Jump towards the wall then press 2 and the directional arrow away from the wall at the same time.
Shake: Makes your character spin. When in possession of either a fire flower or an ice flower, this will release two respective balls of either fire or ice to both the left and the right.
Lifting: While holding 1 and shaking the remote, you can lift by nearby objects including small ice cubes, turtle shells, and power blocks. This is an effective move when playing multiplayer as the character above can assist the character below.
Triple Jumping: Jump while dashing. Keep holding the 1 key. Directly jump again when your character touches the ground. Do it again to get your character to triple jump.
Simultaneous Ground Pound: This works only for multiplayer gameplay and is great for defeating difficult enemies such as wigglers or piranha plants. Have at least 2 players ground pound and hit the ground at the same time. All on-screen enemies will then disappear.

, New Super Mario Bros. Wii has many new and returning items that come in handy over the course of a game. They can make or break your game, so it's important to know how they work.


Mushroom: Turns Mario into Super Mario. Super Mario is taller and stronger. Super Mario can take two hits before dying instead of one.
Fire Flower: A useful item that allows Mario to shoot fireballs. Press 1 to shoot fire. Hitting an enemy with a fire ball leaves behind a coin to collect. Most (but not all) enemies can be killed with this.
Ice Flower: A new item to Mario side-scrollers. This allows you to freeze enemies inside blocks of ice. The blocks can be picked up and thrown (and can be used for many purposes).
Mini Mushroom: An item that first made its debut in this game's prequel for the handheld DS, New Super Mario Bros. This shrinks the player down to minuscule size. With the mini-mushroom you can fit into small spaces and your jumps are extra high. Mini Mario can dash on water. He needs to ground pound to kill an enemy. Be careful with this item, though. It takes only one hit to kill Mario.
Propeller Hat: A brand-new item that allows Mario to launch up into the air and float much longer than a regular jump. To use this, shake the Wii remote. Mario can be hit by enemies three times before dying.
Penguin Suit. Another new item. It allows you to slide on ice and shoot ice balls at enemies. Like the Propeller Hat, it can take three hits before losing a life.
1-Up Mushrooms: Gives you an extra life. They look just like regular Mushrooms except that they are green.
Power Star: Makes Mario invincible. Any enemies you run into while it is in effect immediately die. It also lights up the cavern in certain ""dark"" underground levels. When playing multiplayer, make this effective by allowing the invincible character lift up the other character. Both will become invincible.

, There are a lot of classic Mario enemies in this game. Knowing how to avoid or defeat each can help you significantly. Here are some of the most common ones:


Koopa Troopa: The most common enemy you will come across. Stomp on their shells to immobilize them, and you can kick them away if you wish. Kicking a Koopa shell near other enemies will knock out anything in its path. Just be sure it doesn't come back it you, because Koopa shells are dangerous. Koopa Paratroopas have small white wings, allowing them to hop around or hover in the air. Stomp on them to take their wings off, and they will walk around like a normal Koopa.
Note: The difference between Koopas with red shells and green shells is that red ones stay put on the ledge they walk on, while green Koopas walk continuously in a straight line, only turning if they hit a dead-end.
Goomba: Goombas are brown mushroom-like beings that waddle many of the game's levels. They are the weakest opponents in the game and can be killed by stomping them. Paragoombas, like Paratroopas, have wings, which allow them to hop around.
Spikies: Strange creatures that pull spiked balls out of their mouths and throw them at you. They are often positioned on high ground, making them somewhat tough to defeat. But if you have good timing and can avoid its throws, a simple stomp to the head will eliminate it. Just be careful you don't try to stomp it while it's pulling a spiked ball out of its mouth!
Bullet Bill/Banzai Bill: As their names imply, they are black bullets with eyes and arms, shot out of a launcher (usually with a Bullet Bill shooter on either side). They can be frozen with an Ice Flower, which will allow you jump on them and reach hard-to reach places. Banzai Bills are immense, grinning versions of Bullet Bills, found only in two levels (looking even bigger when they appear a second time). Although they are huge, they are fairly easy to defeat. Jump on them, like Bullet Bills, and you will kill them.
Swoopers: In the underground levels, bat-like creatures will fly from the roof of the cave at you. A simple jump can avoid them, and a single stomp will kill them.
Lakitu: Bespectacled Koopas riding on top of smiling clouds. They throw down enemies like Spikes, which can get frustrating as they throw them down very quickly at some points during levels. If you manage to stomp on the Koopa, usually using Yoshi to hover, you can jump on the cloud and ride it using the directional pad. However, after a few seconds the cloud will disappear, and a new Lakitu will return shortly.
Wigglers: Found only in the poisonous swamps of World 5, these yellow caterpillar-like enemies seem harmless, but will still take away a life if you touch them. The only way to defeat them is to ground pound on top of them, for if you merely stomp on them, they will become angry, turn red, and walk a little faster. Giant wigglers can also be found underground. They are much faster than normal ones and can walk right into the swamp. You can bounce on them without having them become angry, but make sure they don't lead you right into the swamp.
Podoboos: In the fiery levels, balls of fire with eyes will hop around or jump out of lava. Be sure to avoid them. They can be frozen, they die when you freeze them.
Cheep-Cheeps: Many kinds of fish, called ""Cheep-Cheeps,"" dwell the aquatic levels of Mario Bros Wii. Despite their harmless appearance, they are not friendly. The only way to get past them is to swim around them and avoid them or shoot them with either ice or fire balls. There are several kinds, so learn all their habits!
Dry Bones: Found in the fortress and castle levels, these walking skeletons, assuming the look of Koopas, can only be defeated with a star or by being frozen and thrown or ground-pounded upon.
Pokeys: Segmented, spikey, cactus-like enemies lurking in the desert world. The only way to defeat them is with a star, which will turn you invincible, or have Yoshi eat them. If Yoshi eats their head, then their entire body will collapse. Sometimes, their spikes will disappear for about 2 seconds. If Yoshi eats any part of their body at this point, no matter how tall they are, he will gobble up the entire Pokey, and lay an egg which will contain items like coins, Mushrooms, 1-Up Mushrooms, or Fire Flowers.
Hammer Bros: Elite members of the Koopa army who are usually found in groups of two or three. They toss hammers at you, so be very cautious about your timing. Some of them stand on floating block platforms and can be hit from underneath. For the rest, they can be killed by stomping on them or shooting them with fire.
Fire and Ice Bros: Hammer Bros that shoot ice or fire. You can always tell what kind of ""Bro"" it is by its shell. Hammer Bros have green shells and the fire and ice varieties have red and blue shells, respectively. They are best avoided since their attacks (especially the Fire Bros) have excellent range. They can be killed with a stomp or, ironically, with ice and fire balls.
Piranha Plants: Common enemies that usually come out of pipes. Some shoot fire.

, Every level is different and unique in some way or another. Don't get discouraged if you don't pass a level on your first few tries. If you get stuck on a level for long enough, you have the option to use the Super Guide in which Luigi appears and shows you through the level. When playing with more than one player, work together to get through levels.

, This is very important. Without beating bosses, you will advance nowhere in this game. Each boss is a Koopaling, a son of Bowser. They make their first appearance since Super Mario World. Each one has its own routine that it uses to defeat you, so watch first and observe its patterns. When you see an opening, stomp it on the head three times.

, This is the first Mario platform game to feature 4-player simultaneous gameplay. You and three friends can play through the game together, as if on a team. Player one is always Mario and the other players can choose between Luigi and Blue and Yellow Toad. All players' abilities are exactly alike, so picking your character is just a matter of preference.

, At these houses, you have the chance to gain either lives or items by playing short mini-games. The items you win can be accessed on the map by pressing 1. Use your items in levels you're having trouble with.

, For example, you can freeze enemies in blocks of ice and use them as stepping stones. Use propeller hats to gain ground faster and bypass enemies below.

, You can only do this after defeating a castle. You cannot save during the middle of a level or during a world except after beating a castle/fortress level (as stated before). You may ""Quick Save"" only once during your game, meaning you can save between castles.

, Some levels have more than one way out. If you discover a secret exit, there may be some extra benefits from it!

To get started, keep playing as Mario until you have at least 60 stars, then ask Rosalina to let you fight Bowser. You must defeat Bowser in order to succeed on the next step.

, Once Bowser is defeated, a number appears next to Rosalina showing you how many stars you have left to collect, out of the 120 total. Once you've got all 120 stars, the number next to Rosalina will be 0.


There are quite a few hidden stars throughout the galaxies. You can follow detailed guides, or try to explore, smash, collect, and play with everything you find to discover them yourself.

, After all that effort, return to Rosalina and defeat Bowser again. At the end of the credits, Luigi will be unlocked.

, Luigi is faster and more powerful than Mario, but begins again in a new save file with 0 stars and nothing unlocked. If you manage to collect all 120 stars again while playing as Luigi, you'll unlock a final secret galaxy to play through., In the 2010 Galaxy sequel, Luigi will show up occasionally at the start of some levels, but only once you have approximately 30 stars. You can talk to Luigi to play as him for that level only.


Beating a level with Luigi will cause an extra-fast ""Luigi ghost"" to appear whenever you visit the level again. Touch the ghost to set it moving. There are no rewards for beating a level more quickly than the ghost, but you might like the challenge.

Unlock characters by playing offline Brawl matches.,
Speed up Versus matches.",How to Unlock All Characters in Brawl1," As you play through the Subspace story, new characters will join your team. This is a straightforward way to unlock most (but not all) characters.


Subspace Emissary automatically unlocks these characters in this order: Marth, Falco, Captain Falcon, Lucario, Snake, Mr. Game & Watch, R.O.B., Luigi, Ness, and Sonic.;
, This is the one Subspace unlock that requires you to do something special to get the character. On the 30th stage, ""Subspace (Part II),"" collect both the Link and Zelda trophies to unlock Ganondorf. Look for the trophies at these locations:Zelda's trophy is near the beginning of the stage, to the right of a column of green quark mines.
To get Link's trophy, go through the first door, then break the bomb block directly beneath you. Link is on the next platform below.

, You can also unlock characters by playing Brawl mode. To check your total number of Brawl matches, go the main menu, select Data → Records. Scroll to the last page for Brawl Records, then check the number after ""Offline Vs. Matches Played"" (online matches do not count).Raise this number to these milestones to unlock these characters:5 – Ness
10 – Marth
22 – Luigi
50 – Falco
70 – Captain Falcon
100 – Lucario
130 – Snake (or just 15 matches on Shadow Moses Island)
160 – R.O.B.
200 – Ganondorf
250 – Mr. Game & Watch
300 – Sonic

350 – Jigglypuff (These last three cannot be unlocked in Subspace.)
400 – Toon Link
450 – Wolf

, If you're playing Versus matches just to unlock characters, go to Special Brawl and turn on Stamina and Flower. Set a computer opponent's stamina to 1 and the flower should defeat it immediately when you start the game."

Complete Subspace Emissary before trying any of these unlocks.,
Unlock Jigglypuff.,
Unlock Toon Link.,
Unlock Wolf.,
Engage these characters in close range.",How to Unlock All Characters in Brawl2," These three characters are the most difficult to unlock. If you don't want to play hundreds of offline Brawl matches, you must complete Subspace Emissary, then try the special unlocks below. None of these unlocks will work if you have not finished Subspace Emissary.

As with all unlock methods except for playing Subspace Emissary, these will trigger a fight with the character you're trying to unlock. You must defeat the character to add it to your team.

, After beating Subspace, there are two special ways to unlock Jigglypuff:Complete Event matches 1 through 20.

Or replay The Swamp (Stage 18) in Subspace Emissary. Play through most of the level until you reach the barrels you can fire yourself out of. Enter the door between the barrels to fight Jigglypuff., Besides playing 400 Brawl matches, there are two ways to unlock Toon Link:Complete all twelve stages of Classic mode. You may select any difficulty level and character.

Or replay The Forest (Stage 9) in Subspace Emissary. Enter the door that has appeared near the beginning of the level and defeat Toon Link., Wolf is the hardest character to unlock. Here are two options to choose from:Beat Boss Rush Mode. This mode unlocks after you beat Classic mode. You will have to defeat ten bosses in a row without losing a stock.Or replay The Ruins (Stage 14) in Subspace Emissary. You'll see a new door once the falling platform reaches the bottom of the spike-filled elevator shaft.(This is not the door halfway down the shaft.) Enter the door and defeat Wolf to unlock him.

, If you're worried about reaching the unlock fight but failing to defeat the computer opponent, pick your strongest close range character. All three of these characters are weak at close range, and lightweight. Land a couple of hard hits, and smash attacks should take care of the rest."

Beat Classic to get Marth.
Reflect 10 projectiles to unlock Ness. For example, use Fox's down special.

buttons) should be by your left., Press the right and left buttons on the Control Pad to move right and left, press up on the Control Pad to jump, or tap down on the Control Pad while on a platform to pass through it. Most characters can only use two jumps while in the air, but characters such as Kirby, Meta Knight, and King Dedede can use 5 midair jumps. Charizard can jump 3, and Pit can jump 4., Press the 2 button to use a standard attack. Also, try attacking your stationary opponent with standard attacks while moving to use a different attack. When using a GameCube controller, a Classic Controller, or a Wii remote with a Nunchuk, press the





button instead., This is also covered at SSB Brawl Info. To use a special move, press the





button. Each character has four special moves, and no two characters have the exact same set of special moves (even though the Star Fox characters are pretty similar, and Link and Toon Link, and others...). The four types are:

Standard special move, by pressing 1 without moving.
Side special move, by pressing





while moving sideways.
Up special move, by pressing





while pressing up. (not necessarily jumping)
Down special move, by pressing





while pressing down. Most up special moves can be used for recovery (see below). When using a GameCube controller, a Classic Controller, or a Wii remote with a Nunchuk, press the B button instead. You can also grab another fighter, by using the

, You will notice a percentage meter at the bottom of the screen which increases with every hit taken; the higher a character's percentage meter, the farther they fly when hit. You will also notice that if the CPU character is not killed, they will jump back up to the stage. This is called recovery, and is vital when trying to return to the main platform of a stage after being knocked off. When knocked off, use both or all air jumps and then, mostly, your Up special move to get back to the stage. Try jumping off and returning to the stage., Go to ""Items"" and click on ""Beam Sword."" Use a standard attack to pick up the Beam Sword that appears. That is how to grab an item. To use an item, also use a standard attack. To drop an item, use a grab (see later; for now, with the basic Wii remote, press 2 while holding B). Other basic items include the Fan and the Star Rod. Next, try using a power-up item. Get a Bunny Hood, and try moving and jumping. Other power-up items include the Franklin Badge and the Super Mushroom. Last, release a Smash Ball. The Smash Ball will fly around the screen, and you need to beat it until it breaks, at which point you will begin to glow. While glowing, use a Standard Special move to perform a Final Smash, a powerful, unique, attack. For a detailed list of all items click here., Play 5 Brawls to unlock Ness, beat Classic to unlock Marth, beat the first 10 or so Events, play a bit of Stadium, use the Coin Launcher to get some trophies, and check out the Challenges screen to see what you need to unlock.

Go one of two paths: You can become a better fighter in the basic mode, or you can clear Adventure Mode: The Subspace Emissary. Either one is fine, and you will have to do both eventually, but the order you take care of them in matters. The first will be covered here, but that does not suggest that it comes before the other.

, By this point, you should have gone to Controls in Options and seen the controls for Wii Remote with Nunchuk, GameCube controller, and Classic Controller. If you want to advance, you should have already switched to one of these three. The GameCube controller is recommended, but a Wii Remote with Nunchuk or a Classic Controller work just as well., These matches come down to raw skill of the player. The most important rule for these matches (as with all other matches) is to know your character. Go for many quick combo strikes to rack up your opponent's percent damage. Focus heavily on dodging (explained in Tips) in one-on-one matches. Special attacks are useful mostly for quick, single hits in one-on-one matches; Normal attacks are usually the better way to go. There are such things as Final Smashes; each character has a different one. They are the strongest attacks., Not much to say here, but try to juggle opponents with your teammate. Special attacks are a bit better here as well. This is more of an ""any way you like"" kind of fight., These matches are where anything can happen. Try to use group attacks and heavy attacks. Our favorite characters for these matches are Lucas, Sonic, Ike, and Snake. Chances are items will be on, so these are matches where anything can happen."

Once you've done that, make the enemies always random, and test your worth.

,
You've mastered Lucario!

",How to Play As Lucario in Brawl," You need to unlock him first!


To get Lucario, play 100 brawls in Versus Mode and then defeat him in combat.
Play through the Subspace Emissary! You'll unlock him on the way.
Unlock all 5 levels of Target Test, then beat all 5. Defeat Lucario afterwards.;
, Now to begin playing. Go to Training, pick Lucario, and set your opponent to Pokémon Trainer. With Pokémon Trainer as your enemy, you can take on 3 different battle styles.

, Practice your moves.


Aura Sphere (Neutral B) can be charged up. Listen to the sound it makes, and when the sound changes a bit, you're fully charged. Dodge out of the way while charging to continue your charge whenever you press B again. If it is already fully charged, you'll launch it when you push B. This tends to be effective when the opponent is not expecting it.






Force Palm (Side + B) is a special move. If an enemy is close enough, you'll grab them and force aura into them, damaging them and throwing them back. If nobody is close by, you'll shoot aura out that can be walked into, which has the same effect as previously stated, only without being grabbed.






Extreme Speed (Up + B) is Lucario's recovery move. This move is considered the best of the best, since you can curve it around and massively change your path in several ways. It's like a knight in chess.






Double Team (Down + B) is Lucario's counterattack. If you're about to be hit, hit Down + B. If hit while the move is in use, Lucario vanishes, appears behind the enemy, and strikes with incredible force. If several enemies are crowded together, you'll hit all of them!







, Get a Smash Ball and unleash Aura Storm! You'll jump to the top of the screen, in the center. Quickly aim at your target, and then you can move the incredible beam you fire.

, Slow down gameplay and set Pokémon Trainer to attack.

, Become familiar with all moves. Try new combos.

, You need to know bad spots to fight at while playing on certain stages.

, It's time to go into a real battle. Maybe against yourself- Item less? Start with a Level 3 Lucario, then go up and see how high you can go before you lose. Keep practicing on the highest leveled Lucario possible until you can defeat a Level 9 CPU.

, Repeat the previous step.

First, play a brawl with a time limit.,
Have both players have the same amount of points before time runs out.

First of all, you need to unlock characters.,
Find a character you like.,
Once you've found a character you may take interest in, begin learning the basics.,
Find a stage you like, or build your own.,
Practice!,
Invite some friends over and play.,
Take it online!,
Try out all of the control schemes.,
Find a play style that works for you!",How to Play Super Smash Bros. Brawl,";
, Here's a few suggestions.


If you like a tank that takes the pain, try Bowser. If you want pure fight and carry the target, give Donkey Kong a shot.
All-arounder? Try Mario out. Mario's F.L.U.D.D. and Final Smash aren't too good, so you might want to have a few Brawl and unlock Luigi. Luigi not your style? How about Link? Toon Link?
How about the speeder striker? Give Fox a shot, or maybe you'd like to try out Sonic or Wolf O'Donnel. If you want the fast run, slow strike, power- go for Captain Falcon. If you aren't too crazy about Captain Falcon, you probably won't like the slower but stronger Ganondorf.
Want the power-no-range slomo? Ike is for you. Then again, you might like Solid Snake.
Transformations? They've got them! Samus is a well-rounded character that can transform into nimble Zero Suit Samus. Pokémon Trainer commands his Pokémon: Ivysaur, Charizard, and Squirtle, and can swap them out. Then there's Zelda and Shiek. Zelda has magic powers, and Shiek is mostly a ninja.

, You can check out Smash Bros. Dojo for some ideas.

, You may need to unlock parts to build a good Custom Stage. If you want a dead-on, no holding-me-back stage, go for a one-stock, one-on-one fight on the Final Destination. If you want a chase-me-down, try out the Hyrule Temple.

, Try killing CPUs of a certain level, then rise through the ranks. Keep going until you can defeat 3 Level 9 CPU's.

, This is a party game.

, Wi-Fi is a bit slow, so type in some Friend Codes and make things good.

, Most people prefer the Gamecube Controller, a select few like the Wii Remote, the Nunchuk and Remote is not too great, and the Classic Controller is a bit awkward.

, Maybe you want nothing but Motion Sensor Bombs set to high on the Hyrule Temple? Or maybe you want a 1-on-1, 1 stock match with no items on the Final Destination.

The key to success with any character, know your moves.,
Figure out combo moves that work for you.,
Learn some of Marth's advanced techniques.,
Get down the spacing.,
Edge hug.",How to Play As Marth in Super Smash Bros. Brawl," Mainly the ones you should try to remember are grabs, specials, aerials, and tilts. Make it your first priority to familiarize yourself with them if you haven't already done so.;
, Which moves can lead you to a follow-up attack? Can that attack lead you to another follow up attack? And maybe another? This is where Training mode comes into play. Grabs are always a pretty good approach. For example, most Marth users down throw opponents into a forward air. If you're not able to put in the time to piece together combos, watch a Marth combo video to give you a good idea of which work best for you.

, Techniques like pivot walking and dash dancing are great for playing mind games and confusing opponents. Other techniques which are quite general and can be used with a number of other characters are glide tossing (Marth doesn't have any projectiles for this to come into play, so you may not need it.) and SHFF (Short hop fast fall - essential for using Marth's aerials, most of which you can quickly cancel out of into another attack.) also work with this character.

, Basically, hitting opponent with the tip of the sword, lands you a critical. Spacing is commonly associated with smash attacks, mainly forward/back smash attacks or Marth's D-air. His D-air, if spaced correctly, will spike your opponents downward with no chance of successful vertical recovery. If it's used off stage, of course. (Although his d-air used from the back has a higher hit box than if used in the front.)

, (Or ledge hogging) It's a good technique to know if you don't already have it down. Once your character connects with the ledge, they get a half a second invincibility advantage. Say, for example, a wolf is trying to make a safe vertical recovery. At the second you see him start his up-special, you grab the ledge. Because of that half second invincibility, you won't be harmed by his special, and he'll descend off-screen. See how useful it is? You must time it right. If you edge hug too early, you'll have to time it right so you don't take any additional damage, and safely make it back on the stage. Edge hug too late, and you'll be unable to recover to the ledge, as your opponent has already grabbed it. Be wary of your timing.

For Red/ Green Shells, keep a banana peel behind you at all times; the shells will hit the banana peel instead of you!,
At the last second the red/green shell is almost about to hit you, throw another red/green shell behind you to hit the attacking shell!

",How to Use Items As Shields in Mario Kart Wii1," If you don't have a banana peel, then use the same thing!;
,"
"
Be sure to have boost mushrooms for this method.

,
Blue Shell: This one is a little bit more tricky then the red or green shells.,
At the last second before the blue shell is about to hit the ground, use the boost to direct you out of the blasting range of the shell.

",How to Use Items As Shields in Mario Kart Wii2,", Before you try this move out, make sure you have one or more boost mushrooms in your item box.

Pow Blocks: For this, you need perfect timing.

,
At the final millisecond when the block hits everyone, jerk the remote up, like you would when doing a trick in the air to perform a wheelie.

,
Otherwise, press the drift button when riding a kart to hop at the last millisecond to dodge it.

,
You'll still get hit, but it won't last as long as the other ones!

",How to Use Items As Shields in Mario Kart Wii3,",,,"
"
For this you need a hawk eye to see this.,
The first way is to stop all completely, but only do it when it is still in the air or you will still be in the blast range.

,
The second way is to use a speed boost at the last second, you'll get out the way while the players behind you get a face-full of ash.

,
And the final way, is to swerve to the side as fast as you can, I can't promise it will work all the time, but it is a good last resort!

",How to Use Items As Shields in Mario Kart Wii4," There are three ways to dodge this if it is put in your way.

Start up Mario Kart Wii, pick your license, & choose 2 player.,
Pick your character, kart, & drift.,
Pick a track & begin!,
The first way to use bananas are outmaneuvering characters when they are chasing you.,
The second way to use banana is by blocking the road.,
The third way to use bananas is by blocking.,
The fourth way to use bananas is by surprising your opponents.",How to Use Banana Peels in Mario Kart Wii,";
, For 2 player (unless your friend is playing) select a random character, kart, & drift.

, Go to the nearest item boxes. Normally when in first place, you get bananas or green shells. After getting bananas, continue racing.

,


Often, other players try to get behind you when you're in first place in order to slip-stream you. This can be avoided by swerving, but you might crash.
Pick up an item box & hope you get a banana. If you do, carefully watch the person behind you.
Wait till they're right behind your kart, then activate the banana, causing them to spin out.

, When in first place, you often get lots of bananas. One of the ways you can make use of them is to carefully place the bananas across the road. If driving on a curvy track with not much room, simply drop the bananas. If the track is straight, slowly move to the left or right, dropping bananas as you go to create a 'wall'.

, In the game, red shells are often thrown at you. If you have bananas, hold on to at least one, and drop the others. However if someone has a red shell shield, keep all 3 bananas. If not, throw all bananas back except one.

, When driving, carefully drop a banana into an item box (so it's hidden). Usually the 2nd & sometimes (if not to far apart) 3rd place racers see you, and avoid the box. However not everyone sees you do it, and some racers may hit the box. If you have a lead, this trick is more fun.

Play on!",How to Play As Greninja in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U," If your'e using the Wii U Gamepad, there are two joysticks, one on the left and one on the right. The one on the left is used to move your character. On the right side of the controller there are four buttons labeled A, B, X, and Y. These are used to perform various moves.


The top of the controller also has buttons. On the upper left head of the controller there are the L and ZL buttons and on the upper right head are the R and ZR buttons. The START key is used to pause and end the current game session.;
,


Using the left joystick, move the cursor on the screen to Greninja's icon. His icon can be found in the third row, fourth from the last.

, Before you get to learn Greninja's moves, you must first learn how to control him. Using the left joystick will move him in the direction you want to go.


Moving the joystick to the left and right will move him in those directions. Quickly moving the joystick twice in the same direction causes your character to start running, which is helpful in dire situations.
Moving the joystick down makes your character duck down. Holding the joystick down and moving it to the left and right allows them to crawl.
Moving the joystick upwards will make Greninja jump, and moving it up twice will cause a double-jump.

, These moves are performed with the A button on the controller.


The jab, or also known as the neutral attack, is done by pressing A one time. This is great for close combat and keeping enemies away. Try pressing A multiple times to continually jab opponents, inflicting even higher damage than just pressing it once.
While running, pressing A will cause Greninja to slide and inflict damage to foes.
The combination of A and the joystick can also be quite useful. Slightly tilting the joystick upward and pressing A will perform an up attack, which can be used to hit enemies that are falling. Tilting downwards and pressing A allows you to do a low blow to your enemy. Tilting to the left and right and pressing A can perform a side attack.

, These moves are performed with the B button on the controller.


Press B to perform Greninja's neutral B, also known as his water shuriken. Holding B increases the size of his shuriken and also inflicts more damage.
Like the basic attack moves, the use of the joystick and B can provide you with more moves. Tilting to the left or right and pressing B will allow you to perform a shadow dash. This inflicts a lot of damage, but pay attention to your shadow when using it. If your shadow falls off the map then so do you!
Moving the joystick down and pressing or holding B allows you to protect yourself for just a couple seconds. If an enemy hits you in this time, then you will block their attack and inflict damage on them instead. Moving up and pressing B allows you to perform the single-shot pump, which can be used to push enemies away.

, These moves are done by tilting the joystick all the way and holding A in whichever direction you want.



Holding Up A will shoot enemies far upwards. The longer you hold A, the more damage inflicted.
Combine holding the A button with any direction to cause major damage to your opponent, and to keep them away. Decide which direction to tilt the joystick based on where your opponent is coming from.

, Grabbing can be done by pressing the ZR or ZL button when close to an enemy.


Once you grab the enemy, you have to decide what you want to do with them. Continuing to press ZR or ZL while they're in your grasp makes Greninja jab them repeatedly.
Pressing the A button when their grabbed will cause Greninja to punch them away from him.
You can throw your opponent up, smash them down, fling them behind you, or toss them forward by using the joystick when they are grabbed. Just move the joystick to the desired direction.

, Land battling can get boring, so use Greninja's aerial attacks to spice things up on the battlefield. These can be performed in midair or after jumping.



Jumping and pressing the A button will perform the neutral aerial move, which launches any enemies in its reach.
Moving the joystick in midair while pressing A will cause Greninja to swing his water sword in that direction. Moving the joystick downward and pressing the A button makes him dive straight down for a powerful aerial attack.

, Every character has a final smash with different ranges and power. To obtain the power to perform this move, one must break the smash ball that appears randomly throughout the game. You can break it with all the attacks you've learned in this WikiHow so far.



You'll know you broke it when Greninja starts glowing. Trust me, you'll know when you see it.
Greninja's final smash requires you to be close to your enemy. Once you get close, press the B button and watch him destroy his opponent off the map.

, Assuming you aren't an expert player yet, you should definitely expect other players to knock you off the map as well. However, do not give up right away. You can recover when pushed off the map with the single shot pump move you learned earlier.


To remind you, press B while holding the joystick upward to shoot yourself back on the map. You can also choose the direction you want to go and do a double-shot pump.
After the first shot pump is done, move the joystick left or right to shoot yourself again in that direction.

, Now that you have learned every attack, mix things up. Do not wait for your enemy to let you hit them. Play offensive and defensive.


Combine your upward grab with an upward special attack to double the damage and shoot your opponent even further upwards.
Get creative. Every player is unique and utilizes the same moves in different ways.

, You learned how to play offense, now it is time to learn to play defensive. You can shield enemy hits, and even evade them.



Pressing and holding the L or R button on the top of the controller will make Greninja shield enemy attacks. However, do not overuse this because there is a limited amount of time one is allowed to shield. If used too long, Greninja will be temporarily stunned.
Holding the L or R button combined with moving the joystick in any direction will make Greninja swiftly dodge oncoming enemy attacks.

, You cannot fully experience the fun in this game without taunting your enemies after you have killed them. Use the control pad on the left side of the controller to perform these taunts.


Every character has four taunts, one for each direction you press on the control pad.
Experiment with these taunts and use them wisely.

, Now that you are a Greninja master, continue to practice and show them who's boss.

;
, An effective way of doing this is by grabbing and throwing your opponent offstage with throws that have good knockback, such as Mario's back throw.
, If the meteor smash is an aerial move, jump towards your opponent to intercept them, and then use the meteor smash. If the meteor smash is a ground attack, position yourself close to the edge and then wait until the opponent is close to grabbing the ledge or on the ledge (depending on the range of the meteor smash) and then use it.

Set up the game by starting up Super Smash Bros. Brawl in your Nintendo Wii.,
Select ""Solo"" mode, then ""The Subspace Emissary"".,
Watch the cutscenes as they play.,
When each cutscene ends, the scene stops and you can pick your favorite four characters out of the group.,
There are two different types of stages in the game.,
If you find glowing blue or orange cubes, break them!,
When you finish a level, you will see a map of all the levels you have played through so far.,
If you are finding a level difficult, you can add stickers by selecting ""Stickers"" on the map screen.,
At any point when you return to the map screen, you can save your progress by selecting the ""Save"" option.,
Play through each level in the story, including the very long one at the end.",How to Beat The Subspace Emissary on Super Smash Bros Brawl,";
, Create a file, setting your profile name if you have one and the difficulty you would like to play. Generally, it's best for new players to start on ""Normal"", but if you have played the previous games in the series, you may start at ""Hard"". Remember that the difficulty can be changed later on.

, The story may be tough to understand because none of the characters speak, but it becomes more clear later on as you see more scenes and find more trophies.

, In some matches (such as the first one), you may have less than four choices, in which case the lineup you picked will simply repeat until you are out of stock lives. Also, some fights may have you pick either side of a one-on-one match; when this happens, you can pick either side, but you must win with the character you picked.

, If you are on a single secluded stage, you must either KO normal characters by launching them off the stage, unplayable Subspace characters by doing enough damage to them, or occasionally bosses by doing a lot of damage to them. In the other type of stage, (which is most of the game) you must fight your way through rooms of enemies to the last door in the level. The enemies here do not have to be defeated, so sometimes it's best just to avoid them or jump over them to keep your damage percent low.

, The blue ones, which reappear each time you play the level, usually hold useful food or stickers while the orange ones, which hold rare items like special trophies, disappear forever once their contents have been taken. Orange boxes count toward the game's completion percentage, so they are required to beat the game with 100% completion. Keep in mind that you can always come back to a level to get ones you missed.

, Green flags represent completed levels, glowing crowns are levels where you have found every orange cube, and the level with a (!) symbol above it is the next one you must do. If you replay a previous level, you can use any character in the party at the current point in the story.

, Stickers can be put on any characters you want to make stronger. The word in brackets next to a sticker is its function, and the number is its strength. For example, a +10 sticker would make PK attacks stronger, while a +20 sticker would make you flinch less when hit.

, Always do this before you stop playing.

, After defeating the final boss, you have completed the Subspace Emissary and unlocked almost every character! If you wish, you can still play through each level, for 100% completion and the remaining characters.

",How to Install Project M Without Hacking Your Wii," Remember, just because you haven't created any custom stages doesn't mean that you don't have any. There are three stages that are generated whenever a new saved file is created.;
, Alternatively, you could download the ""Hackless Launcher"" file from the site and use the launcher to generate the folder.

Understand the difference between Olimar's different Pikmin and their powers.,
There may be times you need to kill off your Pikmin to get new ones.,
Pikmin grow.,
Olimar has many, many decent attacks.,
As you know white and purple pikmin are the best ones go to the ledge and pull out pikmin if you are at the right distance from the ledge Olimar will chuck red blue and yellow pikmin off the edge and purple and white pikmin will land on the edge keep pulling pikmin up until you can't anymore.

",How to Be a Pro at Using Olimar in Super Smash Bros. Brawl," White Pikmin are the most powerful when latched onto an opponent, with their poison dealing a great deal of damage, but are killed in one hit.;
, By using Pikmin Throw of his side-smash off a ledge is a good tactic, but it is more efficient to jump into water (such as on Delfino Plaza) which will kill off all but Blue Pikmin.

, If you keep your Pikmin alive for a while, they will become Bud Pikmin and then Flower Pikmin. It takes twenty seconds for each stage. This slightly boosts knockback and damage.

, His up-tilt is a powerful multi-hit move, as well as his up-air. His side smash is exceptionally powerful when used with a Yellow Pikmin or Purple Pikmin. Pikmin Throw is good for long-range. His down-air is a powerful spike.

There are 37 characters to choose from, and each has different fighting styles and strategies.,
After you have decided on a character, try testing if it fits your playing style by fighting against some level 1 to 3 CPU-controlled characters.,

If you're up to the challenge try beating up some level 7 to 9 CPU-controlled characters.

",How to Choose Characters for Super Smash Bros. Brawl on Nintendo Wii2," Think about what kind of character you like to use. Do you want a character that's more speed-inclined, power-inclined, or all around?


Speed inclined: Diddy Kong, Falco, Fox, Marth, Meta Knight, Pikachu, Sonic, and Sheik.
Power inclined: Bowser, Donkey Kong, Ganondorf, Ike, King Dedede, Lucario, and Wolf.

, Try it against multiple characters before deciding if you want to use it.

This may seem tedious, however this will quickly give you an idea of what your opponents will be able to attack you with, or what characters you may enjoy using.

, This is what gives Super Smash Bros its challenge- the test of speedy eye movement and unusually quick finger speed. There are many ways to improve this, mainly during matches. Practicing things such as ""ukemi"", ""directional influence"", and ""perfect-shielding"" might yield the quickest results.

If you are new to Mario Kart Double Dash!,
Next, you need to choose the kind of characters can suit you best.,
Once you have chosen the characters, you will want to choose a kart.,
After you select your kart, it's time to select a track or cup to race on.,
Now that you have done all that, it's time for the race to start!,
One of the most important things to know is how all of the items work.,
Besides all those listed above, each character has his/her own special weapon for use in a race.,
Learn to stay on track at all times, going off course slows you down greatly.,
Take advantage of the Drift feature.,
Keep racing!",How to Win a Race in Mario Kart Double Dash,"!, you may want to choose the ""Mushroom Cup"" as it is the most basic and easiest to learn of all the circuits. Then you want to choose the 50cc level, because 100cc and 150cc are much more challenging. These ""cc"" levels determine how easy your kart is to control, so, the lower the number the easier your kart is to navigate.;
, It's true, the racer you choose will affect what kind of kart you can drive, but we'll get to that later. There are three kinds of drivers you can choose from: Light, Medium, and Heavy. Light drivers can ride in any kind of kart. Medium weight drivers can ride in medium karts and heavy karts. And Heavy characters can only ride in karts that are heavy as well, so choose wisely.

Light Characters: Diddy Kong, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Koopa Troopa, ParaTroopa, Bowser Jr., Toad, Toadette.






Medium Characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Birdo, Waluigi.






Heavy Characters: Donkey Kong, Bowser, Wario, Petey Piranha, King Boo.







, Depending on your selection, you will be able to race in certain karts.

Light Karts: Have good acceleration but lower overall top speeds. Only light characters can ride in these karts.






Medium Karts: Average in all aspects of racing. Light and Medium characters can ride in these.






Heavy Karts: Have poor acceleration but have the highest overall top speeds. Heavy, Medium, and Light characters can ride in Heavy Karts.







, In the game, there are 16 courses divided up into 4 cups: Mushroom, Flower, Star, and Special. Each cup holds 4 tracks and you have to select the entire cup to play in Grand Prix mode, or a single course in the other modes. There is another cup that allows you to play all of the courses at the same time in Grand Prix mode only and that's the All-Cup Tour.

, For a big power boost at the start of the race, you must press ""A"" (which acts as the gas pedal) exactly when the screen says, ""Start!"". This can be done easily since the screen counts down from 3, 2, and then 1, at a steady pace. You should be able to get the timing right with practice if at first you don't get it. There is also the Double Dash starting boost and it works the same way as the rocket start, except that you and your teammate must press the gas pedal button at the same time.

, Learn which can be used for you own benefit, or to slow down other racers. Here are some basic items to know:


Green Shells: Move in straight lines and will roll over a kart briefly. Can be thrown backwards or forwards.
Red Shells: Home in automatically on the Kart in front of you and flip them over when it strikes if thrown forward. If thrown backwards it acts as a green shell traveling in straight lines only.
Banana: Can be dropped for other karts to run over, causing them to spin out.
Spiny Shell: These blue colored spiny shells fly above the track at ultra-fast speeds until it finds the leader and explodes them and anyone near them.
Fake Item: These look like real item boxes from afar but shocks anyone who is foolish enough to touch them.
Mushroom: Can be used to give your kart a short speed-boost.
Star: Makes you invincible for a period of time and makes you faster. Karts that are touched by a star-kart will be sent flying.
Thunderbolt: Shrinks everyone but the user in size and speed.

, These fun extras can be fireballs, eggs, bombs, and others depending on your character!

, Also look out for Dash Panels. Your kart will go much faster when driving over one!

, This allows your car to ""drift"" or steer around without losing speed.

, You're not going to win your first race unless you've had a lot of other Mario Kart experience, so the more you practice the better you get, just like with everything else.

, Mirror Mode takes all of the regular tracks and reverses the turns so that rights become lefts and vice-versa. Star rankings are determined by a number of factors as you complete the four races in each cup. Basically, race as fast and as cleanly as possible and you shouldn't have much difficulty getting a single Star, but keep the following in mind:Avoid hitting walls and obstacles (you can hit a couple per race and still get one Star).
Avoid going off-road.
Don't fall off the track. Falling off twice during a cup will essentially guarantee no Stars.

, You can unlock Leaf Cup with any character and vehicle.

, The retro cups are the two cups on the lower row of the cup selection screen. You start out with two retro cups unlocked: Shell Cup and Banana Cup. Once you finish third place or better on both of these cups, Leaf Cup will unlock., Each cup has four tracks, which you race through in order. Your final standing is determined by how well you do in all four races. This means you can get fourth or fifth place on one or two tracks, and still succeed if you do very well on the others.


You get 15 points for winning a track, 12 points for second place, 10 points for third, and 8 points for fourth. After that, the points go down by 1 for each position.
You'll usually need roughly 40 points to get 3rd place.

, The first track of the Shell Cup has three shortcuts to speed you along:Close to the start, before the beach, drive around a crate with a Pianta standing on it, to find a hidden ramp.
At the beach, drive onto the sand strip to the left to skip the water and duck monsters completely. There's another ramp at the end of this. The first shortcut leads you straight to this area.
If you have a speed boost item, use it to go straight through the water! Just avoid the dark water, which is out of bounds.

, There are three different places in this track where you can drive through waterfalls. Each one is on the inward slope of the track, so keep an eye on the inner edge to look for these routes.These shortcuts might slow you down if you don't have enough speed. Save your speed boost items for the waterfalls.

, When you approach the top right corner of the map, go straight ahead instead of turning left. There's a jump here that you can cross if you perform a stunt or use a speed powerup.If you look closely at the map you'll see the ledge you can land on.

, The final track of the Shell Cup is pretty straightforward. The best way to reduce your time is to pick up as many items as you can, and use the speed boosts to cut across grassy and sandy areas.


Speed items can also let you shoot up seemingly impossible slopes.This can take some practice to avoid going out of bounds, so don't try it if you're already going to get a good enough score.

, This first track of the Banana Cup has two hidden speed ramps. One is to the right of a large boulder, at the top of the map. The other is near the end of the cavern, to the right of a pillar.Both of these can shave off time as long as you avoid disaster in the wide, open stretches that follow.

, At the top of the map, take the left path around the grass. If you have enough speed, you can zoom straight ahead from that point through the water, skipping the top left corner.The cannonballs hit random locations, but the ground will glow before they strike.

, At the end of town, take a hard left and use a speed boost item to jump over the water and land on the dock — or even the street beyond it, if you have two mushrooms. If this shortcut is too difficult, you can take the normal route and keep your eyes peeled for an alleyway to your right instead.Trapping the small alleyways is an excellent strategy on this map.

, This map is more about technical skill than shortcuts. Try to stay in the exact line of the flaming hoops, and (if you can) jump off the halfpipe walls to get powerups. When you get a speed boost item, the best places to use it are corner-cutting shortcuts across the mud.

, This is the fastest and 2nd hardest mode in Mario Kart Wii. Your opponents will be smarter, and you'll need to take full advantage of shortcuts and advanced driving techniques. Because you'll be shooting for a Star rating, it will be even more difficult.

, One of the most important things to avoid when going for a Star rating is hitting anything stationary. You are allowed one or two hits per cup before you are no longer eligible for a single Star. This means you'll need to be at the top of your game and know the tracks like the back of your hands.


Avoid going off the road as much as possible as well.

, The longer you are in 1st place, the more points you are earning towards your Star. Try to get the boost start at the beginning of each race, and then do everything you can to maintain that lead. A kart or bike with good acceleration will help give you an early start on the competition.

, It may seem hard, but you'll want to avoid using weapons if you're behind the pack. You're only really allowed to get away with this once per cup. If you find yourself behind, use all of your driving skills to catch up, not items.

, Faster times will be rewarded with more Stars. Drive as fast as you possibly can. Again, this means you'll need to know all of the courses inside and out, especially since 150cc is already faster than any other mode.


Babies (Peach, Mario,Luigi, or Daisy), Rosalina, and other small characters are best for speed with the bullet bike or Mini Beast.

, If you get less than 50 total points in the cup, there's very little chance that you'll get a single Star. If you find that you're not going to end up with that many, you can restart and try again., Many players report having to restart Mario Kart Wii in order to actually unlock Dry Bowser, even after earning at least one Star on all eight 150cc Grand Prix cups. Once you know you've gotten all the ratings, press the Home button on the Wii Remote to exit back to the Wii main menu.

, If you've gotten at least one Star on each 150cc Grand Prix cup, you'll receive a notification that Dry Bowser is now available.

Alternatively, play 250 games on the online multiplayer to unlock Birdo.",How to Unlock Birdo on Mario Kart Wii1," From here you will see several options including ""Grand Prix, ""Time Trial,"" ""Vs,"" and ""Battle."" Birdo can be unlocked right off the bat, since you start the game with 16 courses, and you need to race a time trial on 16 different courses to unlock her. As such, Birdo is often one of the first characters you unlock.;
, The driver and kart you use does not matter. You will need to actually race, as you need to post a time in order to count the track towards your 16, but luckily enough posting times is not incredibly difficult. You just need to finish the race. To keep track of things just race the courses in order, doing all 4 tracks in the first 4 cups. Some tips for good time trial times include:


Use heavy riders (Bowser, Wario, Donkey Kong), as they have the best top speeds and there are no items or other riders to slow you down. This minimizes the impact of their slow accelerations
Perfect the start boost -- hit the A button right when the ""GO"" pops up to speed up fast and shave precious seconds off your time.
Learn all the shortcuts on the track. While you won't need them to unlock Birdo, you will need them to unlock other characters from time trials., Hit the ""B"" button to back all the way out of the time trial screen back to the main menu. Log back in using the same profile you raced the time trials in and you should get a notification that you've unlocked Birdo.


Remember, you need to do a time trial on 16 different courses, not just 16 trials.
If you are sure you raced 16 courses, but can't get Birdo unlocked, race a full Grand Prix. You should unlock Birdo when you are done., This will likely take longer than racing the time trials, but if you love playing online it may be the best use of your time.You can also race 1,350 unique races (any race, any time) in any mode to unlock the pink dino through sheer time spent playing."
"
Know that Birdo is a medium-weight driver.,
Understand Birdo's defining driver stat is her ""Mini-Turbo."",
Use the best cars for Birdo.",How to Unlock Birdo on Mario Kart Wii2," Medium drivers have relatively balanced stats, meaning they work well on a variety of tracks and can ride both karts and bikes. This makes Birdo versatile on a variety of tracks no matter your skill levels, but she is especially good for beginners.


Because she is medium weight, she can push around light drivers, like Baby Luigi. She will, however, still get knocked around by heavies like Bowser.

, Each driver has a series of stats that affect their driving. These stats carry over from kart to kart, no matter what you are driving. Birdo is, overall, average in most regards, but she has two distinct advantages:



Mini-Turbo: This is the boost you get after a successful drift around a corner. Birdo has one of the highest mini-turbos in the game, though not the highest.

Off-Road: Birdo will only lose a moderate amount of speed when off the track. While not as good off road as some other drivers, like Yoshi, her moderately high off-road stat means she can handle the occasional deviation off road without major repercussions., Try and maximize the bonuses given to Birdo by using cars that have high drifting potential (for her Mini-Turbo) and high off-road stats. The best types of cars for her are often the Rally cars and the Control Vehicles. Specifically, you should drive:



Best Karts: Wild Wing or Daytripper.

Best Bikes: Mach Bike or Sugarscoot."

, If you're fairly experienced at Mario Kart games, try the popular Mach Bike. This is a great vehicle, but its low acceleration can punish you if you get hit or run into a wall. If you're having trouble with the Mach Bike, pick a bike with better acceleration, or just choose the bike you have the most experience with.Characters have a smaller effect than vehicles, so pick the one you play most in your chosen size category., Your goal is to get 1st place overall for the four tracks of Leaf Cup. You can still win if you get 2nd or 3rd on a race, but if you drop too far in the standings, quit to the main menu and try again.


If you haven't unlocked Leaf Cup yet, play Banana and Shell Cups. Once you have at least 3rd place in both of those cups, Leaf Cup will unlock., This track does not have many shortcuts, so you'll have to win this with technique. Drift as close to the inside of the bends as possible, starting with the very first curve. Item boxes at the outside of the curve will cost you a couple seconds to get.Skip them for tighter turns if you're already in first or second., The best opportunity to cut a corner in this track is at the start of a lap. If you have two mushrooms, you can offroad behind the pyramid and skip a large curve., The curves at the end of each lap are a good opportunity to use a mushroom. Boost straight ahead across the dirt to skip a curve., Stick to the left edge of the first two turns and drift to get a lead. Return closer to the center of the track after that so you can avoid the thwomps stomping on the next few turns., Near the top left corner of the map, watch for a passageway going to the left, right behind a thwomp. This leads to a shortcut full of ramps.

You'll get a big speed boost here if you do a trick on each ramp.

, If you have a mushroom, stop in front of the last ramp and turn left. You'll see the wall of another track across the lava. Use a mushroom as you drive off the left corner of the ramp, and you can clear the lava and land on the track.It's even possible to make this jump without a mushroom, but this is difficult.

, Near the top right corner of the map, the track spirals around a tall hill leading to a jump over the river. If you have a mushroom, you can skip the trip up the mountain. Stop when you see the top of the ramp ahead of you. Angle your bike to the right and mushroom boost your way up over the rails.You'll land facing the wrong direction. Turn around to face the ramp.

, The narrow bridge is an excellent place to drop fake item boxes and similar booby traps.Save these items for this spot unless you're behind and trying to collect something more useful., The end of the track has a switchback turn leading up out of the cave. Use a mushroom to skip this turn and drive directly up the side of the track instead., Mario Circuit is a straightforward course, but there a couple offroad opportunities. Boosting across the grass behind the Chain Chomp will save you a few seconds, but this is a little farther than one mushroom can get you. Drive onto the grass a short distance before boosting to maximize the time saved., Past the middle of the track, when you see the tunnel entrance in the distance, you can drive offroad to the right and over a ramp. This will only get you to the tunnel if you use a mushroom as well., You can do tricks off any of the bumps in the road near the end of the track. Do another trick off the top of the bridge just past those bumps., Once you've finished Mario Circuit, if you are first in the overall placement for Leaf Cup, you'll get a message saying that Dry Bones has been unlocked.

At the end of each cup (four tracks), you will receive a rating from F (worst) to Three Stars (best). Earn One Star or better on all four of these cups, and you'll unlock Bowser Jr.


The general requirements for a One Star rating are described in the strategy section below.;
, To unlock all these cups, finish in third place or better in Shell Cup and Banana Cup, then in Leaf Cup. You'll need to unlock them again in 100cc mode, even if you have them in 50cc.


Initially, only bike vehicles are allowed in 100cc difficulty, not karts.To unlock the ability to play with karts, you'll need to finish in first place in all eight cups — but if you try that, you'll probably unlock Bowser Jr. along the way.

, Alternatively, you can unlock Bowser Jr by completing 3,450 races.Practicing your Retro Cup skills will get you there faster, but if you're more interested in other cups or challenges, Bowser Jr will show up eventually, as will the other characters.


Check your current number of races from the Main Menu by selecting License Settings in the top right corner, then Records., A One Star rating requires a solid performance on all four tracks of the Cup. While the game doesn't tell you the exact requirements, there are a few general guidelines to follow.If you're partway through a cup and fall way behind these goals, you may want to quit and retry to save time.


Finish the cup with at least 53 points total across the four tracks. For instance, you could place 1st, 1st, 1st, 4th, or 1st, 1st, 2nd, 3rd (the order does not matter). You have a high chance of success if you place 1st, 1st, 1st, 2nd or better. Faster completion time will also help.
Avoid leaving the road more than two or three times in the entire cup, unless using a boost item.
Avoid banging into a wall or an obstacle more than once or twice in the cup.
Avoid falling off the track more than once in the cup.
Stay in first for a significant amount of each race. When behind, try to catch up without using items whenever possible.

, If you are hit with many blue shells and similar items in a short amount of time, the game will take this into account and relax the above guidelines a little. If this happens, you may still be able to get a One Star ranking even if you use items to get in first, or if you don't finish in the rank or time limit normally required.

, If you are having trouble finishing in 1st or 2nd, play a Medium or Large character and a vehicle with good speed. If you can stay in 1st for much of the race, but you frequently hit obstacles or walls, play a Medium or Small character and a vehicle with good handling and acceleration.

, Before racing, you can set your drifting mode to Automatic or Manual. For best results, set it to Manual and be prepared to press the B button (and shake the Wii mote, if in use) to start drifting sideways when you notice sparks from your wheels. However, if you are using the Wii Wheel, Automatic may give better results do to increased manual drifting difficulty with that controller., Mario Kart Wii allows you to cut down your time and dodge obstacles by doing tricks, ""snaking,"" ""drifting,"" and using the rear camera view. Find out more at this article.

, Many race tracks have hidden shortcuts and opportunities for creative driving techniques. Discover more of these by playing Time Trials and following the ghost driver to see what it does, or search online for videos of the race tracks you find difficult.


Remember, going off-road will not hurt your ranking if you use a Mushroom or other boost item. This can save you a lot of time on some maps, such as by boosting through the Peach Garden flower patch or across the grass near the start of Bowser's Castle."

When Lakitu counts down just to 2 and right before it goes away to 1, press down and hold the acceleration button.,
After the Go!",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart1," When doing this trick, you can charge up your gas and hold it off until the race begins. This way, you can get an early boost in the race without even drifting, snaking, or moving at all, and get ahead of those behind and ahead of you at the start-up line.  From Mario Kart Wii and onwards, start holding accelerate about 2 seconds before the race starts.  Too late, and nothing happens; too early, and you'll burn out!
, When he appears, he will do the usual countdown before the race begins to prepare you for the upcoming lap. Make sure you start this trick here as doing it too early or too late will either make your kart not boost at all, or it will even make it slow down and get stuck in your current position., As soon as you see the 2 appear on the screen and Lakitu making a beeping noise, immediately press it now!, message appears on the screen and Lakitu shines the green light, let go of the button to do a boost!

Drifting is an essential yet great technique to winning any race as fast as possible.,
To drift the kart, simply press and hold the drift button.,
You will now begin turning.,
Drifting longer is much better than drifting shorter!,
When you are drifting and want to go back to normal, simply let go of the button to boost and continue on!",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart2," It lets you make tighter turns without slowing downs and makes you faster when turning. It even lets you have a nice speed boost after drifting., This varies based on what controller or what game you are playing, but it is usually the B button for most games. Press and hold the button when at a turning point in the track to start boosting., The blue or orange stuff you see from the drifting is the friction produced from the speed of turning tightly on the track. The longer you drift, the longer you will turn and boost afterwards., To turn a large turn or to even boost through what seems to be a straight path but is actually part of a turn, simply steer the kart in the opposite direction you are drifting; and vice versa to make sharper turns than before. When you drift long enough, the blue friction sparks will turn to orange!, Make sure you let go only when (if possible) when the kart has orange sparks behind it and try to cover a large portion of the track when drifting. You can also and should drift when on a ramp, taking a shortcut, or going over a boost."
"
This is an actual legitimate driving technique used by professional racers.,
Get behind a racer at an average distance.,
As the front racer speeds up, you should speed up as well.,
After a certain amount of time, a blue aerodynamic shape will form around your kart, signifying that you are beginning to streamline!",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart3," It basically is trailing a fast racer, and due to the lower pressure and resistance, you can reach and even surpass your maximum speed. This helps a lot especially when trying to catch up or getting ahead of everybody by half a lap., Don't stay too close and don't stay too far away either or else nothing will happen. Make sure you are directly behind the racer as well., Try to copy the speed of the front driver while avoiding going too fast or you will crash, or too slow or you will be left behind., Once this happens, you should drive to the side and start streamlining baby! You will go so fast as if you just used a boost or a mushroom!"
"
Dragging items behind your kart can allow you to hold up to two items and protects you against incoming shells.,
When you get an item that can be dragged such as a shell or a banana, press and hold onto the use item button.,
Now when the time comes, another opponent will fall for your trap!",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart4," This allows you to reduce the chances of getting hit as well as allowing you to quickly use up another item after you used it up. Turns out those items that you get in first and second place weren't useless after all., Make sure you hold it down completely and not let go or you will lose your item. Some items can be pressed once to drag it behind you., When a shell or even another player tries to ram into you, they will meet the fate of your shell, banana, or even an item box. This allows you to perform better in races and not get slowed down."

Tricks are performed after boosting off from the ground and into the air.,
Simply race to a ramp, half-pipe, speed booster or any other thing on the track that allows you to boost off the ground.,
As soon as you jump off from the ramp, half-pipe, or boost, shake the Wii Remote.,
Once you successfully pull off a trick, you will land on the ground and have a speed boost once touching the ground.",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart5," It allows you to have a speed boost when you land on the ground, which makes you go faster than before. You can also use tricks to get past shortcuts that are off-road. However, this is only available in Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 7, and even Mario Kart 8., You can usually tell just by looking at the shape of it and to see if it has arrows on it or not., What most people don't realize is that tricks can only be performed when you launch from the ground, not when you are in the air. With correct timing, shake it either up, down, left, or right to perform different tricks., You can tell whether you pull off a trick by seeing the character do a little stunt animation and the vehicle showing off a sun shining effect. If you do it correctly, it will allow you to speed boost once you reach the ground."
"
Turning on the back camera during a race allows you to watch and avoid incoming dangers.,
When a racer or item is close by behind you, press the camera button to look backwards.,
Once the time is right, quickly avoid the incoming item or racer.",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart6," Usually most items and racers will attack from behind, so unless you're dragging items or using an invincibility power-up, you will most likely get hit. But with this technique, you will learn how to dodge them without breaking a sweat., Now you can see the race-track from a completely new different perspective. You can now see how close or far the racers are, which is more accurate than the map. You can even see how close the items are and where they are heading., If it is a racer trying to streamline, move out of the way so they cannot do it. If it is a racer with a power-up, quickly dodge them. If it is an offensive item, find a strategy to evade the item. And if it is a homing item like a red shell, hope for the best and drag any items you have with you."

Simply life the wheel up to perform a wheelie.",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart7," Wheelie is basically a real life technique used by professional bikers and regular bikers. It is basically lifting your bike high enough to only have your rear wheel on the ground and lets you go faster. This technique is only available for bikes in Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8., This will lift the character's bike up high enough to get a nice speed boost for a brief moment. Since bikes do not let you super-drift, you can use this instead and use even when there are no turns. The wheelie is also useful for off-road bikes since it allows you to take off-road shortcuts without slowing down."

Dodging items or countering them is one of the greatest techniques and can actually help you improve drastically.,
When there is a blue shell coming, it seems as if there's nothing you can do.,
If a shell or banana is homing in on you, there are many ways to defend against it.,
Looks like a bo-omb is coming at you, what do you do?,
POW Blocks are pesky things and although appearing in Mario Kart, Wii only, they are still very annoying.,
Bloopers are annoying and although they don't do much, sometimes they just get in your way and make you fall behind!,
A racer has suddenly got and is using the Star-Man, Mega Mushroom, Bullet Bill or other related OP items - what do you do?",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart8," Since there are several, each step will be used to explain to dodge one item only for time and space's sake., If it comes and you happen to be having a boosting item, simply activate the boost when the shell goes to you and does a spinning animation to get out of the way. Or you can always reverse and let the blue shell explode with the other racers as well., You can either drag items with you. Or you can quickly cut corners where there are walls and ditches. Or even using the rear camera view to dodge it manually. You can always evade it at the last second as a last resort!, Simply just drive around it and get away as quickly as possible before it detonates. Or just like when a blue shell strikes, wait for other racers to come and drive into the bomb to invite them into the fun as well., If you are riding a kart, press the drifting button at the last second; if a bike, do a wheelie at the last second as well. If you are too lazy or poorly skilled to do either, simply shake the Wii Remote to protect yourself (it actually works!), If you have a boosting item, such as a Mushroom, use it as soon as you are sprayed with ink. Or you can even go to the nearest half-pipe, ramp, boost-pad, or giant cannon, if possible to clean out the ink., Though it may seem impossible to dodge, you can still evade those racers entirely by simply moving to the far left or right moments before they appear on screen, or stopping at the edge of the track or an off-road location."
"
Snaking is a difficult and expert technique that allows you to drift while on a straight pathway without stopping, making you as skilled as online competitors and hackers!,
Begin by drifting at a turn or curve.,
Keep ""balancing"" the vehicle until you cannot do it anymore.,Repeat steps 2-3 to continue to snake or until you decide to not snake anymore - some areas and some tracks are not compatible with snaking and will actually slow you down, so know when and where to use this complex technique.",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart9," It is recommended that you first master drifting and super-drifting, as well as choosing a vehicle with good drift/boost and handling before snaking., Once you exit the turn, continue to drift on the straight pathway. Continuously tilt the control stick left and right to ""balance"" the vehicle so that it doesn't go too far to the left or too far to the right., When that happens, quickly let go of the drifting button and immediately press it again, slightly before you start tilting the control stick. When you begin to tilt the control stick, make sure to tilt it in the opposite direction of what you tilted last time before you let go of the drift.,"
"
Fire-hopping is another ""pro"" technique, allowing you to go faster than ever to achieve impossible time records that may seem only possible for hackers to pull off.,
While you drift and then start snaking, let go of the stick and the drift button instead of just letting go of the drift button.,
Congratulations!",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart10," You basically start by drifting and slowly descend into snaking, but instead of snaking completely, you must do some ""adjustments"" to do fire-hopping instead., Now, you must immediately press the drift button and tilt the control stick again within under a second. Instead of tilting the stick in the opposite direction, you must tilt in the exact same direction as before., You have just done fire-hopping. To know and verify that you have done this technique, your vehicle should have been drifting, and then suddenly boosting while you are in the middle of a drift, and then drifting again. If you still do not understand, it's snaking but never changing the direction of the drift to go faster while drifting."
"
Ironically enough, stopping or slowing down the vehicle when racing can actually help you in certain situations.,The only times where you should slow down is when you are about to collide, crash, or move right into a track hazard, bottomless/dangerous pit, or a slow-down item such as the Banana or False Item Box.,You should stop completely when you are just behind the first few racers that are seconds away from being blasted from a Blue Shell, when near a dropped Bob-omb, or when about to crash into a wall or obstacle.",How to Perform Expert Driving Techniques in Mario Kart11," To slow down, simply let go and press the acceleration button repeatedly.

Beat the track as fast as possible.,
Make it to first place in every race.,
Don't get beat by other racers!,

Use and trigger expert techniques.,
Don't go off-road too often!",How to Get a Star (or Higher Rank) in Mario Kart," Beat the race track like you normally would in Time Trial without messing up or getting hit a lot by the opponents or even getting affected by the track's hazards. You should try to drift frequently, or do major shortcuts. You should even attempt to use the head start or use a wheelie.;
, When completing a Grand Prix cup, make sure to always be in first place for every track, not just having the most racing points. Also, make sure that you even are first at the end of each lap, and if you can't, try not to change positions a lot or drop ranks all the time. Making it to first at the last second for each race track will also decrease your overall performance.

, The worst thing that can happen to you in any game is constantly losing to your opponents. Make sure that you use a lot of defensive and evasive strategies to protect against the enemy. Be farther from each opponent as possible, or even be a troll to them if need be. Luck is needed to achieve this goal.

, If you keep falling or getting hindered by the track's hazards and obstacles, or even the enemies, then avoid them as much as possible. Use strategies to help protect and prevent yourself from losing. If you do get hit, try to be as quick as possible or use items to recover or zoom past the track when it happens.

, Learn and perfect helpful driving techniques such as boosting start, drifting, super drifting, snaking, trick maneuvering, wheelie, short-cuts, streamlining, item holding, and so on. This will make you seem better than you already are and actually helps in perfecting the other methods mentioned above.

, By going off road, not only does it slow you down but you get penalized by the game for doing so. Unless all you are doing is cutting corners or taking a quick shortcut, or using a boost or speed items to get by, don't ever go off-road or you will get penalized by the game.

One thing you can do is dodge a blue shell.",How to Make the Best of Your Time Using Mega Mushroom on Mario Kart Wii1," You can be in blue shell position by being first or simply the closest to finishing at the finish line.


Start with your mega mushroom. For advanced items, get it in 5th or 6th position. For Balanced, 6th or 7th and Strategic, 7th, 8th, or 9th.

When you have your Mega Mushroom, Move into ""Blue Shell Position."" Once you see the blue shell ""Warning"" and you hear the repetitive bleeping noise press up on d-pad for Wii Wheel and also up on the nunchucks. If timed and done right, the blue shell should explode on you and you should come out unharmed.

Second thing is you can take shortcuts.",How to Make the Best of Your Time Using Mega Mushroom on Mario Kart Wii2," The mega mushroom is not slowed down in the grass, sand, mud, or dirt. If you see a shortcut take it!


Warning, You may be to big to fit in or through some shortcuts, and getting hit by lightning will make you back to normal, which can result in slowing down or even dying.

"
"
Third thing is of course, crush people!",How to Make the Best of Your Time Using Mega Mushroom on Mario Kart Wii3," That results in your opponent slowing down, and losing items they have on hand. Best result if there is a group of people. You can not crush people that are using star, bullet, or another mega mushroom.

Use one of the following methods to avoid a POW block.",How to Avoid the Pow Block in Mario Kart Wii,"


Count the number of POW Block strikes to three. Wheelie up by flicking your Wii Remote upward (Wii Nunchuk w/Wii Remote) or your Wii Wheel or by pressing Up arrow button (GameCube or Wii Classic controller). A blue force field protects you, so you will spin only once, but you will not slow down. However, you will lose your items, so be sure to use them before the POW block disappears.
Hop many times if you are using a kart. You won't lose items that you carry. This only works if you set your drift mode to manual.
Use the Mega Mushroom, Star, or Bullet Bill.
Go on a ramp/jump and into the air if you see the POW block. With this method you retain all your items.
Go into the cannon in DK Summit/Snowboard Cross, Maple Treeway or DK Mountain, go on the ramp over the river on DK Jungle Parkway, or go into the Launch Star in Rainbow Road.;

Your score for this training game will be determined how many successful lanes you have completed in the 5 chances.

, With 10 chances, you are given the chance to knock down as many pins as you can. The first lane consists of 10 pins and adds an additional row on each chance, resulting in 91 pins on the last lane. Your score is determined by how many total pins you knock down; strikes double the score. For example, if you get a strike on the first lane, your total is 20 (10 pins times 2).

Watch the top ranking Time Trials, and learn from what you see.",How to Be Good at Mario Kart Wii," Do you want something that can make sharp turns easily without bumping into walls, or do you want a speedy, drifting vehicle? There are even karts and bikes that are great at going off-road. Statistics play a bigger part in this game than you may think! Note that for beginners, a kart with good acceleration and handling is easier to use, while for more experienced players, speed tends to dominate a gamer's preference. Keep this in mind as you select what karts and bikes to use. The competitive Mario Kart Wii community has generally agreed on Funky Kong and the Flame Runner as the best combination to use, so keep that in mind.;
, All of the Mario Kart Characters have stats that are not listed in game. Although these certainly do not make too much of a difference (with some characters it's really not even noticeable), it's fine to look them up in depth. More important to take into consideration is the weight class, divided up into Light, Medium or Heavy characters. Light characters give less speed and weight, but better everything else. Because they are light they can be bumped around more often. Medium characters have the most balanced stats (though once again, this usually depends on the bike/kart you choose.) Big characters give more speed and more weight but less everything else, as well as an increased resistance to getting bumped around.

As an example, take the Bullet Bike and the Bowser Bike/Flame Runner. They both have similar statistics, but since they're from different weight classes they have slight differences. The Bullet Bike, which a light vehicle, has slightly less speed and a lot less weight then the other, but makes up for it with better overall stats. The Bowser Bike/Flame Runner has better speed and a much higher weight, but it's other stats are not as good as the Bullet Bike's.

, Automatic allows you to drift (turn easily at corners) automatically without pressing buttons, but does not allow the usage of Mini-Turbos, which are miniature speed boosts. Manual drifting does allow you to use Mini-Turbos, which can be activated by releasing B (the drift button) when you see blue or orange sparks from behind your vehicle as you drift. Shaking your Wii remote from side to side while holding B and turning makes the mini-turbo charge faster. Automatic is better for beginners, as you do not have to constantly hold B whenever you turn but Manual allows you to use mini-turbo which can be used very cleverly. Try and play on Manual as soon as you feel comfortable as it is a huge advantage and will help you get better at the game. Keep in mind that bikes and karts drift differently, so try out both and see which one you prefer, although it is accepted in the Mario Kart Wii community that bikes are generally better to use.

, To do a rocket start, press the acceleration button (either A or 2, depending on your controls) just as the number 2 on the screen fades at the countdown before the race. Then, as you start the race, you zoom forward, giving you a quick advantage. A similar advantage is a boost you can get after you fall off the track and Lakitu (the turtle on a cloud) drops you back into the race: simply press 2 exactly when you hit the ground. It is difficult and takes practice, but is very useful.

, This is a great new technique introduced in Mario Kart Wii that was not present in older Mario Kart games. Simply shake the Wii Remote up, down, left, or right when you go off a ramp or jump, indicated by multicolored or sometimes blue arrows going into the air, to perform a certain trick. Upon landing, you will get a short speed boost. A common mistake is shaking the remote while you are in the air--you must do it right as you are taking off from the launch pad. You will hear a noise emitting from the Wii Remote itself, letting you know that the trick was successful. Doing a successful trick earns you another speed boost.

, Air time in Mario Kart Wii is generally slower. You want to stay as low as possible most of the time. There is a way to preform a trick, but still stay very low to the ground, called a low trick. To do this, simply hop just before a bump that you could normally trick off of, and you will barely clip the bump and trick while not going up in the air. Note that you must be using Manual Drift to do this, and that you generally cannot do this off of ramps/jumps that have orange or blue boost panels on them (with a few exceptions). This takes time to learn, but is very useful., Many courses, including Mushroom Gorge, Peach Beach, Mario Raceway, Mario Circuit, Coconut Mall, Wario's Gold Mine, Shy Guy Beach, Delfino Square, and more contain hidden (intended) shortcuts and jumps. They are extremely useful, however, many of them are covered in mud or grass that slow you down. They require some sort of Mushroom boost or Starman (which make you unaffected by grass or mud) to get across. See the video below for all the shortcuts in the game.


There are also many unintended, but useful shortcuts in Mario Kart Wii. They include the Mushroom Gorge Gap Jump, the Toad's Factory Lake Jump, The DK Summit Single and Double, and many more. They are generally a lot harder to do than the intended shortcuts, and some of them even require you to use certain vehicles, but keep practicing and you will get better. There are even shortcuts that allow you to skip almost the entire course, but I recommend you don't do these online, as other players might get mad at you. To learn how to do these kinds of shortcuts, go to YouTube and look for videos about them!

, If you get a Mushroom, look for ways you can cut corners with them, as discussed above. Bananas are useful when shells are coming from behind, as they protect you and destroy the shell. Use your shells very wisely--don't throw a red shell to the person in front of you, two inches away, when you will likely pass them in a moment anyhow. Wait until you really need it. Blue spiny shells search for the player in first place and create an explosion, spinning any character in the explosion radius. If you see a blue shell coming to you, there is not much you can do about it. If you have a red mushroom or a golden mushroom at the time, wait until the blue shell is about to slam down on you, and then use the mushroom. Once you know the perfect time, it will become more simple. Or you cold also try slowing down and catching other players, so they get hit in the explosion and suffer the same fate. When you have a power-up like the Mega Mushroom, which turns you giant, or Starman, which makes you invincible and faster, try hitting other players to knock them over or even flatten them. The storm cloud is a mixed bag; it gives you a constant boost to speed and allows you to ignore terrain effects, but after a while it will ""strike"" and shrink you! Depending on your ability, you can either pass this off ASAP by bumping another character or ""ride the lightning"" and take advantage of the benefits before passing it off. Don't wait too long, though! Be aware that all other characters can use these items, too, so watch out for them trying to hit you. You will always hear a warning and see an icon of an item whenever a character with the item is coming up from behind. If you can be mid-air when the block detonates, it will keep you from getting hit by the effect.

, To view the Time Trial rankings you will need to have your Wi-fi connected to the Wii. After selecting your licence you should see the Mario Kart Channel in the bottom right corner of the screen. Once you're there go into rankings. From there you can look at the top ranking time trials and perfect your route on each track and learn new short-cuts and tricks. If you can't connect your Wii to the internet for one reason or another then you can just search for the top ranking time trials on your computer but they may not be up-to-date.

Star Swings/Pitches: Each captain (Mario, Peach, DK, Bowser, Wario, and Yoshi) along with all the secondary captains (Luigi, Daisy, Diddy Kong, Bowser Jr., Waluigi, and Birdo) have their own special hits and pitches called Star Abilities.,
Nice Plays are especially tough outs that are usually made with a diving or leaping catch, or by a buddy move.,
Buddy Moves can save home runs and help your fielders make lightning fast throws.",How to Play Mario Super Sluggers," It is a tutorial that can be accessed on the games main menu. In practice, you will be walked through all the basic gameplay and mechanics needed to play. You don't have to go to Practice, especially if you played Mario Superstar Baseball (2005) and are already familiar with how the game works. But if you do choose to go to Practice you will have a much easier time. What's a few extra minutes learning? Here are some controls:


A Button: While fielding, press A to jump/dive. In pitching press A (while using a throwing motion with the remote) to throw a changeup. (2x) Buddy jump.
B Button: Attack, buddy toss.
A+B Button: Star Swing/Pitch.
+ Button: Pause/Resume.
Shake Wii remote: While fielding, throw. While running, dash.
Swinging Motion: Swing bat. Hold back longer to ""charge"".
Throwing motion (while pitching): Pitch ball. Hold back longer to charge.;
, You're allowed to choose any players you wish. Start with the CPU level low (levels 1-2) and work your way up to difficulty levels 3 and 4 when you begin to improve.

, The storyline of challenge mode is that Bowser Jr. and his bumbling minions have taken over Baseball Island, and that it's up to you, Mario, to gather other captains and players to battle Bowser Jr. in a game of Baseball. As you play, you will unlock many new characters.

, A star pitch is harder for the batter to hit and each has its own twist to it. Same goes for the Star Swings. Try them out, they could help you greatly. Keep in mind that regular characters have no Star Hits/Pitches. Each one has a basic Ability that can still be very effective, but no unique twist to it. Star Hits will usual force infielders to misplay the ball (they will rarely catch it, if ever), and if a Star Pitch is hit it will most likely be either a pop fly or weak grounder. Star Abilities cost Stars, which can be earned by making Nice Plays.

, Nice Plays refill your Star Meter.

, To make a buddy catch (to save a home run) get two of your outfielders with good chemistry to the part of the outfield wall the ball will pass over. When the ball is directly over you AND YOUR DAD, press A twice and watch your as one of your fielders boost the other up in the air to attempt the catch. These can require a lot of precision and timing, so they won't always work. Players with good chemistry should be in the outfield. A Buddy Throw can be done when the player you're controlling is near the ball. Press B to ""attack"" the ball and flip it to a nearby player. Then throw. Only use this ultra-fast throw when you need it (such as for long-distance throws or emergencies) because you could end up just wasting time. You may also miss frequently.

Avoid standing on the edge of the Wii Fit balance board.,
Make sure that you warm up before you start playing.,
Make sure that the area around you is clear of both people and objects before you start.,
Avoid placing all of your weight on one side while you are playing balance games.,
Glance at the instruction booklet that comes with your Wii Fit balance board.",How to Prevent Injuries from Playing Wii Fit," Instead, stand on the rough patches, which are designed to create friction and help prevent you from falling off of the balance board.;
, Do some stretches before you step onto the board to help prevent you from hurting yourself, especially during some of the yoga exercise.

, If it isn't, especially if you are standing on one foot at some point, you risk hurting the person or damaging the objects around you.


However, if you do need to hold onto a steady object such as a chair to help keep your balance, then bring one over before you start the activity you'll think you need it for.

, Avoid making sharp, jerky moves, either. Instead, go smoothly, steadily and slowly. This reduces the chances of you potentially spraining something or pulling a muscle.

, This has a few health and safety warnings, and it may give your more tips for preventing injuries while you are playing the game.

Weigh yourself accurately in the body tests.,
Spend time performing the yoga exercises.,
Perform aerobics.,
Challenge the trainer in strength training and yoga.,
Engage your core in order to stay balanced.",How to Master Wii Fit," The balance board can be remarkably sensitive. The balance board must record your weight before you can perform most exercises or play most games. To ensure that the balance board weighs you accurately, place it on a hard, flat, and clean surface such as a tiled/wooden floor. Uneven surfaces such as carpets can interfere with weight measurements.;
, It starts off with only some basic poses such as: cobra, tree, and downward-facing dog. In order to unlock more poses, you will need to master the yoga basics. Then you will be able to perform yoga poses such as spinal twist, chair, and palm tree. Be sure to focus on your core and make sure that you breathe. Furthermore, you should try to distribute your body-weight evenly in order to avoid causing one part of your body to bear the brunt of the exercise. Despite the fact that you have already mastered some yoga poses, you will need to go back and ""review"" previous yoga poses.


Before doing exercises like aerobics and strength-training, do yoga. It will stretch out your body and prepare you for the more difficult exercises that lie ahead.

, When you try the aerobics, you will probably notice that you can gain more points and unlock activities more quickly by having good form. For example, when you are signaled to catch the hula-hoops that are thrown, raise both of your arms up to the sky and lean your body over in the direction that the hula-hoop is coming from. Time your movements to the same beat of the music that is played in order to get perfect timing on the basic step game. During the running exercises, keeping a steady speed will help you exceed 100 percent and unlock more levels.

, The strength training exercises were designed in a matter consistent to build the muscles in your arms, legs, chest and core. Increase the amount of repetitions that you do and motivate yourself by listening to music, and unlock the trainer challenge mode. Then challenge your trainer head to head in the jackknife, parallel stretch, and the push-up exercises. A competitor motivates you to push your limits, and if you win you will feel great.

, When playing the balance games, move your abdominal muscles minimally while you move your weight to the left and right. If you are trying to gain momentum in the ski jump game, shift your balance to the blue dot that is shown on the screen. For the soccer ball dodging game, try not to get hit by the shoes and panda heads, but shift your weight to the left or right side in order to touch the soccer balls with your head. Try to not randomly move around, and if you are behind on timing, skip the ball that is coming at you and wait for the next soccer ball to come at you.

Many great games are exclusive to the Wii U, such as Mario Kart 8 and Bayonetta 2.
This system is aimed at ""core"" gamers rather than the family.  Many games such as Nintendo Land have the same family feeling as the ones on the Old Wii.
Many have initially said that the console is a flop.  This is up to you to decide, and whether you do still want the console.  Wii Us are actually really fun and bring the DS kind of gameplay onto the big screen, so you are in for the time of your life!
Wii stuff (Wii Remotes and Nunchuk, Balance Board, etc.) are perfectly compatible with the Wii U, and it is encouraged to have such. GameCube and 3DS don't have backwards compatibility or linking features, however, even if you use the built in Wii emulator.;
,  This could be Walmart, gaming stores, anywhere that would likely sell Wii U consoles.  If they sell PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, 99% of the time they will also sell Wii U consoles.,  Make sure that the Wii U you buy is brand new, and only to buy pre-owned consoles if you are ready to take risks such as broken and/or missing compartments.  There is a Standard and Deluxe set.  The Deluxe set will contain a black Wii U with Nintendo Land packaged in with some Wii Remote accessories, whereas the Standard only contains the white Wii U, the absolute necessities of accessories and nothing else.,  There should be heaps!  Unlike the 3DS, the Wii U is boring without games, so consider buying at least 2.  Also buy some Nintendo eShop gift cards to add credit to the online shop.,  Mario Kart 8 and/or Need for Speed players should consider buying a Wii Wheel accessory."

, This is required in order for the virtual Wii to read your card. Formatting the card will erase everything on it. If you are using the same card from the previous section, it doesn't need to be formatted.

Mac - Open the Disk Utility from the Utilities folder in your Applications directory. Select the SD card in the left frame, then click the ""Erase"" button. Select ""FAT32"" from the ""Format"" menu and then click ""Erase.""

, Find and download the Hackmii Installer v1.2. This ZIP file contains the software necessary to install the homebrew channel. You can download it from bootmii.org/download/., Each of the games listed above requires a different hack file. You can find these files in various locations online. Look for the following hack files depending on the game you are planning on using to exploit:

LEGO Batman - bathaxx

LEGO Indiana Jones - Indiana Pwns

LEGO Star Wars - Return of the Jodi

Super Smash Bros. Brawl - Smash Stack

Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of a New World - Eri HaKawai

Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Wheelie Breakers - Yu-Gi-Vah!

Insert your SD card into the Wii U and launch Smash Bros. Brawl from the virtual Wii.
Open the ""Vault"" on the SSB main menu and then select ""Stage Builder.""
Select each stage and move it to the SD card. You need to do this for every stage, including those that came installed with the game.
Close the game and move the SD card to your computer. Open the SD card in your file explorer and name the ""private"" folder to ""private.old""

, Double-click the Hackmii ZIP file that you downloaded and then click the ""Extract"" button. Point the extractor to the root folder of your SD card. When extracted, you'll see a folder called ""private"" appear in the root of the SD card., Double-click the ZIP file that contains your game-specific hack files and click ""Extract."" Extract the files to the SD card, just like you did the Hackmii installer. If you get a warning that the ""private"" directory already exists, just confirm that you want to continue.

Your SD card should now have a ""private"" folder when you first open it on your computer. This folder contains the Hackmii files as well as the game-specific hack files.

, At this point, you have successfully installed the Homebrew Channel in your virtual Wii console, and should be able to select it from the Wii menu. There won't be anything in it at this point, as you'll have to install different homebrew applications separately. This will involve extracting the installation files to your SD card and then running the installer in the Homebrew Channel. Here are a few to look for to get started:cIOS - This is required for certain other homebrew applications to run. You'll need ""d2x cIOS Installer Mod v2.2"" installed and able to run from your Homebrew Channel. You'll also need ""IOS236 Installer MOD v8 Special vWii Edition"" installed for the virtual Wii.
USB Loader GX - This is a backup launcher that will allow you to create and load game backups so that you can play without the disc. You'll need a USB external drive in order to dump and store game files.
Nintendon't - This homebrew program allows you to play Gamecube discs and files, and can be installed directly from USB Loader GX.

Doing this can help you to perform sliding ground attacks, making effective ground attacks that have mobility., This can give you a faster way of pulling of back aerials."

Special moves are activated with the B button and standard moves use the A button. It is important to know all of these moves and how to use them to your advantage.
, Just like every other character, Duck Hunt has 4 specials.


Neutral B, Trick Shot. Use this to pressure your opponent, edge guard, and combo after grabs. Another good trick is to catch your opponent off guard by hitting the can into them when they least expect it.

Side B, Clay Pigeon. This is good for racking up early damage. At early percentage, you can grab your opponent after the pigeon hits and follow up with some F-airs.

Down B, Wild Gunman. This special is a great wall for other projectiles that are hurled your way. It also good for setting up into U-air at high percentage or gimping in some rare cases

Up B, Duck Jump. This special is only good for recovering and has no offensive purposes. It's wise to throw out a trick shot can (Neutral B) before recovering to try to prevent your opponent from attacking you in the air.

, Duck Hunt's aerials are very good and can be used to string together combos.


F-air. This move has very good reach and can hit your opponent from a safe distance. Stringing together multiple F-airs are a good way to rack up damage.

B-air. Same as F-air but has more power behind it and can be used as a kill move

U-air. One of Duck Hunt's few good kill moves. Can combo into itself at low percentage. Will start to kill at around 100% depending on the character.

D-air. Like most D-airs, this one can spike and is really satisfying to pull off. Spiking is this moves only real person, so use it when you are able to.

N-air. This move can launch your opponent far and can kill if you land the sweet spot. It does soft damage if you barely land it.

, Duck Hunt's grab is good. It comes out pretty quickly and you usually won't get punished if you miss. His throws aren't anything to write home about but can be used to get some good early damage.


Forward Throw. This can be used to rack up about 40% early damage if done correctly. Use the clay pigeon when your opponent is at low percentage then grab right after. Use forward throw then follow up with a dash attack and finish the combo with 1 or 2 F-airs. This is a good opening combo if you can land it.

Backward Throw. This throw is mainly for throwing your opponent off the stage. It's Duck Hunt's most powerful throw but it's hard to combo off of it.

Up-Throw. This is Duck Hunt's most useless throw. It's hard to combo off of and only kills at around 200%. Avoid using this throw.

Down-Throw. His down-throw isn't that great either. If you're lucky, you can follow up with an up-air to kill but this it's hard to land since his down throw launches the opponent at an awkward distance.

, There's no need to go into depth about Duck Hunt's smash attacks. They can kill like every other smash attack but unlike the rest Duck Hunt's are very unreliable and leave you wide open. Unless you are certain you can land one, it's best to avoid using them., Duck Hunt has 2 different jab combos. Mashing the A button will make him do a rapid jab that is very difficult to get out of. Hitting the A button like 1,2,3 will make Duck Hunt kick the opponent away. Try the rapid jab, since it is good at racking up damage., Lastly are Duck Hunt's tilt attacks. His left and right tilts have good reach and can be used to edge guard. His down tilt isn't too useful but can be used to poke opponents away from you. His up tilt can combo into itself at early percentages just like Mario's up tilt. At high percentages it is able to kill so remember to utilize that when you are able to., The only way to get better is to fight others. Invite some friends over and try your Duck Hunt out on them. Be sure to utilize all of his good moves and little combos while doing so., If you have Internet, a good place to hone your skills is For Glory 1 on 1. Tons of experienced players are on there so it's a spectacular place to train., If you don't have friends or Internet, just fight Level 9 CPUs! They're no push over and will get the best out of your Duck Hunt for sure."

Defeat bosses.,
Consider remakes before buying the original game.",How to Play Super Mario Bros 2," Being a retro game, Bros. 2's controls are very simplistic. Move with the arrows and press A to jump and B to pull plants and other items out of the ground. The controls can be set up differently depending on what version of the game you have.;
, It's not like the other Super Mario titles in the least bit. You can't eliminate a foe by stomping it. Instead you must kill it using plants that can be pulled from the ground. Throwing the plants at enemies will kill them. Alternatively, you can also jump on an enemy's head and press B as you would to pull up a plant, and throwing it into another enemy getting rid of them both.

, Each playable character has their own strengths and weaknesses. Mario is good for beginners because he is average at everything. Luigi can jump extremely far and high but is hard to control (due to his lack of traction). Luigi is also average in speed and strength (e.g. how fast he can pick up a plant from the ground or an enemy). Toad is the fastest, strongest, and has the best traction but has a terrible jump. Peach (known as ""Princess"" in versions before GBA) is the slowest and weakest but can hover in the air for as far as Luigi can jump, giving her her own unique advantage. Some players are better than others in different areas. For instance, in the snow/ice world Toad and Mario are favorable due to their superior traction and low jumps. In areas where control is not an issue, Luigi may be better to use because of his jump, and so on.

, You won't go anywhere in this game if you don't know how to battle the bosses of each level. The most common are Birdos, bosses who shoot eggs from their mouth. To kill Birdo you must jump on her egg and throw it at her three times. In later levels Birdos will (besides eggs) also shoot fire, so be careful! In addition to fighting a Birdo at the end of each level, each world has its own boss. Each one is different, so watch carefully and look for a way to defeat them. Often there are props or weapons nearby that can be used (for instance, Mouser throws bombs at you. You have to defeat him by giving the bombs right back to him).

, There have been three re-releases of Super Mario 2. The Super Nintendo version (from the game ""Super Mario All Stars, 1993) has improved graphics and gameplay over the NES version. It comes along with three other updated retro games as well (Super Mario Bros, Lost Levels, and Super Mario Bros 3). There was a remake for Game Boy Advance in 2001 called Super Mario Advance with the addition of voice acting. The game in its original form can also be bought on the Wii's Virtual Console.

Level up.,
Always use PSI!,
Don't be afraid to run.,
Have additional life.,
Keep your equipment upgraded.,
Buy items.,
Level up to stay alive longer and your HP or PP or your damage will help later!

",How to Stay Alive in Earthbound," You may struggle in the beginning of the game with the Sharks near the arcade, who are much higher in level than you. You are better off leveling up your character as best as you can by killing them one by one. Don't get upset if you die from time to time.;
, Your best PSI is PK Freeze - it's very helpful during the game, which does about 150-500 damage.

, It's difficult to run in Earthbound, so use it as a last resort. Don't completely ditch the idea, though, as it may just save you the trouble.

, To stay alive, make sure you have PSI Life up.

, Make sure that your party has the most powerful equipment available, be it weapons or armor.

, Food is a good replacement for healing if you don't have PP to spare.

Determine which games you want to enjoy.,
When you decide on a game, give yourself a few hours to really get involved.,
Take some time to learn the mechanics of the game.,
Customize the game to fit your personality.,
Save often.,
Enjoy the game, and have fun!

",How to Enjoy a RPG for Super Nintendo," Do you prefer turn-based battles or an open environment that lets you move around freely? Do you want a modern setting or a medieval kingdom? Do you want a great story? Strong character development? Or a game that lets you hack away at enemies and earn some serious experience points?;
, Don't judge the game on your first ten minutes of play. Often, there is boring exposition that involves reading a lot of text. Try to submerge yourself in the story.

, Each RPG has its own unique style. Taking the time to practice on weaker enemies early on will level your character(s) up faster, making the game easier later on.

, You often have the option to choose the protagonist's name, as well as other characters'. You can name them after yourself and your friends, create your own unique names, or leave the default names. If you can change the menu colors, battle speeds, borders, button control scheme, etc., feel free to adjust to whatever options you enjoy.

, Many games have difficult bosses, and nothing is more frustrating than having to repeat steps you already completed. A good rule of thumb is to save at every opportunity the game presents. If you can, keep multiple save files. That way, if you missed something, you won't need to backtrack, but can just load one of the older files.

Dodge the fireballs.,
Grab the power-up from the princess.,
Jump over the bowling balls.,
Hit Bowser with two more mechakoopas.,
Avoid Bowser.,
Finish the fight using the same tactics.",How to Beat Bowser in Super Mario World1," Soon after the boss fight begins, Bowser will toss a pair of mechakoopas out of his clown car. These will hurt Mario if they touch him.;
, Unlike a normal koopa, a mechakoopa will become frozen and squished when you jump on it. It won't stay in this state forever, so move fast.Spin jumping (the A button) will destroy the mechakoopa. If you do this, you'll have to wait for Bowser to release more mechakoopas.

, Pick up the stunned mechakoopa, aim upward while Bowser is approaching, and throw it. This will hurt Bowser only if the mechakoopa lands on him from above. Hitting the clown car is not good enough., Repeat the same steps to throw a second mechakoopa at Bowser. This will trigger the next phase of the fight.

, Bowser will fly away, then fireballs will fall from the sky. Stay on the ground so you can see them coming and get out of their way. Two lines of fireballs will fall before Bowser returns., Bowser's clown car will return to the screen, but the princess will pop her head out and throw a super mushroom to the left. Pick this up if you need it.

, Bowser's car will float over you, turn upside down, and drop a large bowling ball (a ""Big Steely"") that rolls toward you.Get out of the car's way when it turns over, and spin jump with A to leap over the ball. Use the same tactic to avoid the second bowling ball.


You can jump over the ball with a regular jump, but spin jumping allows you to touch the top of the ball without getting damaged.

, Stun and throw the mechakoopas just as you did before. Bowser will fly away again after the second hit. The clown car will return and give you a second super mushroom.

, Bowser will now follow you around and stomp on the floor, trying to crush you. Since Bowser bounces off the edge of the stage, it's usually impossible for him to reach you if you run to the left edge and duck until he stops stomping.This does not work in the Gameboy Advance version of the game, so you'll need to dodge his jumps instead. Bowser jumps in a steady rhythm, so it's not too hard to time it correctly. The moment after he starts an upward jump is a good time to run under him. Keep running after you're through, as Bowser changes direction quickly.


Avoid the propeller of the clown car, which can damage you.

, Bowser will drop another bowling ball, then toss out more mechakoopas. Throw two more mechakoopas at Bowser to win the game. This time, Bowser will keep stomping on the ground while the mechakoopas are around. This is the toughest part of the fight, so it may take a few attempts.


Bowser will destroy stunned mechakoopas if he bounces too near them.If you can, grab a mechakoopa when you're at the opposite side of the screen from browser.

Get the cape power-up.,
Practice flying.,
Enter 7-2.,
Unlock Valley Fortress.,
Beat Valley Fortress to unlock the Back Door.,
Beat the Back Door to reach Bowser.,
Defeat Bowser using the cape.",How to Beat Bowser in Super Mario World2," The easiest place to do this is level 2-1, the first level of Donut Plains. Jump on the ""super koopa"" with a flashing cape at the very start of the level. Collect the feather that pops out to get the cape.The cape win is usually used for speedruns or just for fun. Since you need to keep the cape power-up the whole time on your way to Bowser, the normal method above is usually easier.

, When you have the cape, you can launch yourself into the air by pressing B while Mario is running. The more speed Mario picks up, the higher you'll go. To keep flying, hold the B button and alternate hitting the left and right arrows of the D-pad to rock Mario back and forth.Press forward on the D-pad to make Mario dive and pick up speed, then press back to use this speed to ascend higher again. Practice this until you can stay in the air for any length of time without falling. You can also use these moves:Use X or Y to spin around, knocking objects and enemies next to you with the cape.
Spin jump with A while Mario is running at maximum speed to launch yourself very high.
Glide down slowly by holding A or B.

, This is the second level in the Valley of Bowser, and it contains a secret that lets you skip most of Bowser's Castle. (This will make keeping the cape power-up easier.) Play through the first two screens as usual, until you enter the second pipe.


If you lose the cape early on, you can get it back. Right after you enter the second screen, jump up the steps to your left and look for a hidden block up near the top left corner of the stage., On the third screen, the pipe spits you out in the middle of the moving yellow ""maze."" Jump through this quickly, and you'll soon reach a gap with a mole in it. At this point, use your cape to fly up through the top of the screen, and go left. Walk left across the top of the stage, and you'll fall into a room with a secret door leading to a secret level, Valley Fortress., Most of this level involves timed jumps or movement to run through skewers, or to avoid spikes that fall from the ceiling (which are a slightly different color from normal spikes). Once you beat this level, and the familiar fortress boss at the end (Reznors), you'll unlock the secret Back Door level.You can get a cape here as well. Hit the green block right after the first set of skewers.You do not need to keep your cape to beat this level.

, The Back Door skips over most of Bowser's Castle, and does not add any new challenges. Just make sure to keep your cape throughout this whole level if you want to use it for the boss fight.

, The cape makes it easy to avoid most of Bowser's attacks by flying over him, and allows you to spin the cape to stun the mechakoopas.


The fastest way to defeat Bowser using a cape involves jumping on him from above, timing it so you land on a mechakoopa right as he releases it.This can take quite a bit of practice and precise timing.

Join a clan.,
Learn the technicalities.",How to Get Competitive at Mario Kart 8," If you haven't done so, this is probably the first step you will want to do. Playing through all the Grand Prix's and doing good at them will make you familiar with each track. The things you unlock will also let you pick your combination from a wider variety, which also helps.;
, This is probably the easiest way to get better at the game for those who are just starting out as a casual player. In a worldwide, you play against other random people across the world, and you have a ""VR"", or versus rating.


You lose a bit of rating when you get a bad position, and you gain some when you get a good position. It is key to worldwide a lot and increase your vr as much as possible. Though everyone starts at 1000vr, it is highly recommended that you get to the 8000-9999 range. By doing this, you will gain more skill when playing, and people will also see you as more competitive.

, This is easily the number 1 most important step in this whole article, and it is the most easily ignored one. By getting an account on this website, you can meet a vast community of other competitive players.

, There is an ample supply of people on the forums, and there will always be some that will happily add you. By adding people on the forums to your Wii U, you can join their worldwide, and you can improve your skills even more by joining good worldwide.

, By this time, you've hopefully gotten fairly accustomed to the game, and you've differentiated yourself from casual players. At this point, there is much room for improvement. On many websites, (like mariokartwii.com), there are articles that provide advanced tips for racers. Racing in more good worldwide races is also a great way to improve. Even though this step can be done at any time, it is easier to do it once you've built up some friends and gotten used to the basics of the game.

, This is another very important step in becoming a competitive racer. By getting a Skype, you unlock a whole new world of possibilities. You can talk with other competitive racer without having to budge with the forums, and it is especially important for the upcoming step.

, Besides VR, being in a clan is the other element that sets you apart from most casual players. In short, a clan is a group of members that have fun within the clan and race against other clans as a team. Usually, each clan has its own skype chat in which members talk and discuss Mario Kart 8.


Also, a clan does a ""clan war"" in which members of a clan race against members of another clan to see which clan can get more points in 12 races.
As there are a vast number of clans that are recruiting, it can be hard for people to decide what clan to join. To help with that, here a few things to look for in clan threads. However, many clans have requirements. Some of the most common ones are listed below.

A good war record
An ample number of active members
A lot of activity on the thread


Now, here are some common requirements:

Have a Skype
Be a certain age. There is no specific age requirement for getting into any clan, but it is generally accepted that one should be at least 11 or 12 to join a clan. Some clans also set higher age requirements such as 16 or 18.
Be active
Be good at racing
Don't trash talk or ""hurt"" the clan.



, There are multiple vital strategies to keep in mind that will separate yourself from casual players and help with your skill overall in Mario Kart 8. Taking the time to master these skills is very much worth it. Below are some examples.


Fire hopping. This is probably the key to skill and speed. Also known as ""bunny hopping"" and ""frogging"" (though more commonly known as the former), this is a tactic that karts, ATVs, and outward drifting bikes specialize, which allows you to increase your speed while boosting. The usage of boost pads laid around the tracks, mushrooms, mini-turbos (MTs), and super mini-turbos (SMTs) are examples of boosting. Fire hopping also varies from course to course, so patterns of hops will differ. To begin fire hopping, utilize the following steps:

Initiate a boost, whether it'd be an SMT around a turn or a mushroom on a straightaway.
Hop left and right. Hopping is just pressing the drift button every time your kart touches the ground without holding it. The left and right movement prevents hitting walls or falling out of bounds.
Hop 4 to 5 times. This will maximize your boost speed if done correctly.
Practice. Don't quit after your first attempt if you don't succeed. This technique will take time to master.


Soft drifting. This is a skill that lets you decrease the amount of time it takes to build up an MT or SMT without turning as sharply.
Sliding. Similar to fire hopping, this strategy is specifically used on downhill sections or on straight ways when you think your boost has run out. Yeah, it's faster.

Dismantle your Game Boy.,

Dismantle your spare 2.5″ external HDD enclosure.,

Remove the battery chamber.,

Remove height knobs and walls from the front piece.,

Plugging in your hard-drive and fitting into case.,
Before you place the hard drive enclosure in the case, you may want to print out a piece of paper with the game boy screen color to stick on the inside of the screen lens, as the screen may not fit in with the hard drive.,

Finishing up.,

Plug it in!,

Customize the drive for fun!.",How to Convert Your Game Boy Into a Portable Hard Drive," There are 6 screws on your Game Boy holding the case together. They are tri-wing screws, but you can undo these with a small flat blade if you don’t have one.

Alternatively, you can drill them out carefully, you’re not going to need them for the hard-drive.
The main motherboard has quite a few Phillips head screws. Undo them all and remove the contents of the Game Boy.;
, It may be held in with two screws. Take the controller board out and check that it will fit inside the Game Boy with a hard-drive plugged in.,







For your hard-drive and controller to fit in height wise, you will need to remove the battery holding chamber to allow for extra depth. Using a small blade or saw is recommended do this, however, you can achieve this with small pliers and some extra time.

, You will also need to remove some knobs and wall encasing from the front piece by using some small pliers. Be careful not to bend the actual case!, Plug in your hard drive to the 2.5″ portable USB controller. Screw it down.

If you would like an LED to appear where the Game Boy’s power light was, you can remove the LED from your HDD controller board, solder some wire to the pads, and run the wire to the power light hole in the front case.
Next, you will need to secure the original buttons back to the front of the case.

,

Cut your piece of paper to size, and stick it on the inside of the lens cover.
Find the best fitting spot inside the front case piece for the hard-drive and controller. It is also a good idea to test that a USB cable will fit into the controller whilst in the game boy case.

, You’re almost done now. If you have any wires from the LED, bundle them up and push them underneath your controller to prevent them shorting when the lid is closed.Run the USB cable out of the headphone jack slot, and ensure it isn’t going to move around too much.Put the case together and see if the controller is loose. If it is, perhaps put some foam in the back cover to use as a packer and stop the hard drive moving around. My controller however, was a tight fit and does not move.Now, there would be more than one way to close the lid on this, but I just used superglue for now. Put superglue all around the edges of both case sides, and then join them together, ensuring no cables are being squashed. Keep pressure on it for a good two minutes., Congratulations, you now have a Game Boy portable hard drive., Get creative, and make a cool icon for your device!"

You shut the window to avoid any more candles being blown out.

Clear some space in your design space if possible.,
Think of themed clothing designs for the villagers to wear.,
Try to find and use some furniture and other things supplied in the game that go with your town theme.,
Try to change the flag and town-tune to fit with the theme, even grow themed flowers and trees that are not your native and cut down normal ones!

",How to Theme Your Animal Crossing Wild World Town," The theme can be anything, from candyland to a zoo. However, remember that this is a lasting decision, as once finished, themes are time consuming (but not impossible!) to reverse, as you must pick up EVERY pattern in your town!;
, For example, if you want a city town, you might want some paving, manholes, zebra crossings and parking designs. Try to chose a town theme that isn't too hard to make, such as ""The world is about to end!"". Although it does sound cool, you'd have to use up a lot of time and bells making that theme. Once you've made other designs, place them around town.

, If this isn't possible, you may have to create extra or select characters to hold the designs. (A top tip: Place designs worth keeping on the clothes rack, or even another memory card, if you have one!)

, For example, if your theme is ""Rainbow"", then you might want to consider making rainbow clothing for the villagers.br>
, For example, if your town theme is ""Iron"", you'll probably want some gyroids or lab flooring.

, When your puppy is standing in front of you, touch the stylus between its ears and quickly down its snout. Slightly rub the dog a bit and slide your stylus down to the bottom of the screen. The pup should place its rear on the floor.

Use the Training Icon, located in the upper right corner of the screen. Touch it and speak clearly in the microphone and say ""sit"", or ""sit down"", whatever you want to call it. You can # repeat this action until your dog learns it for any trick. Once the dog masters it, type in what the trick is, in this case ""sit"", or whatever.

, When your puppy is sitting, rub the top of its head again and slide the stylus down the dog's snout, to the bottom of the screen. Your puppy should now lay his whole body on the floor. Touch the training icon., When your puppy is lying down, touch its chest and move the stylus either to the left or right. The puppy will lay on its side to the direction you want.

When you play dead to the left, it counts as a separate trick from playing dead to the right.

, When your puppy plays dead, touch its belly near the ground. Slide your stylus to the top of the screen and watch it roll onto their back., Tell your puppy to beg, and then grab a front paw while begging and lift it up. Once the dog is standing fully, let go of the paw and touch the training icon. Notice that the training icon appears only after you have let go of the paw. You have to do it at the right time, because of you let go too soon, he will just drop back down to all fours, and if you hold it too long, he will get mad and not let you touch him., You can't coax your puppy to do this, but since they are always so playful, they'll naturally come up and do this a lot. Just touch the training icon when they do. Remember, bowing facing you and bowing away from you are different things., Touch and hold one of your puppy's ears and eventually it'll rub at it with a paw. Left and right ears are different, as are rubbing when standing, sitting, and lying down.

There are six ear rubbing tricks in all.

, Pick up and hold your one of your puppy's front feet. Touch the training icon.

There are ten handshaking tricks.
Be aware that it may be hard for your dogs to learn this one.
Touch the training icon and say ""shake"".

, When your puppy is standing, touch its belly and slide your stylus up. It will beg for you if it's happy and will love you a great deal. If not, it will simply rear on its hind legs for a bit, which doesn't count as a trick.

If your puppy is fed, watered, clean, and happy, it will more likely to beg. This is one of the more difficult tricks simply because the puppy must love you a lot and it takes time to make a bond that strong.

, Grab your puppy's tail and hold it. It will spin, chasing its tail. Spinning left is different than spinning to the right, Tell your puppy to roll over and then spin it. If it is happy, it will spin on its back and break-dance. Your puppy must first know the ""roll over"" and ""spin"" tricks and be able to hold them for 10+ seconds.. It's also helpful to have a fed, watered, and clean puppy., When your puppy bows, touch above its head. It will leap into the air. However, using ""jump up"" with ""beg up"" or ""stand up"" will confuse them., Ask your puppy to sit and then jump. If it is happy, it will do a back flip for you. An alternate way to do this is put on the Flower Waltz record and wait until the end, and your dog will backflip. Go to the main screen before it does, then press the bulb after the dog flips. This is much easier than the former method., Sometimes in overview mode, your puppy will yawn. Press the training icon and say ""yawn"". This may take a while, as do most. Have patience and your dog will have it in no time!, If you hear a dog bark, quickly zoom into your dog, as he/she will answer back in a howl! This is very rare, so it takes 1 to 2 times for her to learn it., You can only do this with two or three dogs. If your dogs start to play/fight together, zoom in on one of them, as they should eventually rear up on each other., You can either zoom in as your dog is sniffing the ground and press the training icon, or have your puppy sniff another dog. You can only do this at home, as you cannot teach your puppy tricks at the park!, If your puppy is very dirty, you should see little black specks flying around him/her. She will eventually scratch, and she will do it frequently. Just simply touch the training icon from far away zoom mode, it zoomed in on that particular dog from your home page., When your puppy is standing, touch its back foot. It will shake it., Have your puppy roll over, and then have it jump. It will spring up onto its paws like a fighter recovering from a fall. It'll lose interest in being told the name of the trick almost as soon as it's done, though, so touch that training icon quick!, Have your puppy beg, then grab a paw and pull it to the top of the screen. Your puppy will now stand on its back paws and fidget around. The left and right paws are counted different, though once your puppy's up, there's no difference in the appearance of the trick., Have your puppy beg, then have it spin. It should now turn around on its haunches, looking like a crazy version of a toy top. Your puppy also needs to be even happier than it was when it learned beg - this trick is more difficult. It may just get down and spin on all fours., Have your puppy lay down, then beg. It'll get up on its front two paws in a handstand. This is another difficult trick, requiring happy, clean, well-fed puppies., Make your puppy dance, and then ask it to jump. It'll hop around on its back legs like Peter Cottontail. Probably the most difficult trick to get, just because the dog's happiness must be through the roof. You may also, during a walk, meet another trainer and then just jerk your dog's leash up to the top-right corner of the screen and it may hop three times., Your puppy can be either standing, sitting or lying down to perform this trick. While they are performing any of the pre-mentioned commands/tricks tap your puppy on the nose and they will sneeze. This trick is one of the easiest to teach to your puppy., Sometimes a happy puppy will spread its front paws apart and bark at you. You can then tap the training icon and teach your puppy to speak., Have a puppy lie on it's side. Before your puppy rolls over, cross his/her paws together and teach it charm!"

Have petting and playtime!",How to Set up a Routine on Nintendogs," Do you go to school or work? Can you bring your DS to the 'workplace'? Do you want to? What do you do at weekends? What time do you get up and go to sleep? Think about these things before starting to draw up your routine.;
, Walks, bath time, and eating/drinking are all required for a happy, healthy dog, but also think about anything extra, like contests, playtime, and petting time.

, Let's begin with food/water. Since real-life dogs tend to need to have three meals a day, and then maybe an extra water bowl after a walk, try doing the same thing. Pick a morning time, afternoon time, and evening time if your can. For example, 7 AM, 4:30 PM, and 8 PM are some typical feeding times. The extra water will be discussed later.

, Try walking your dog at least once a day on weekdays, and twice on weekends. Choose a time that you will not be interrupted at, and have a few spare minutes at. Don't let it collide with your normal dinnertime or favorite TV show, or your attention might dwindle and Dog will munch on garbage! Walk your dog at 5 PM, and at 5 PM and 9 AM on weekends.


Add the extra water in 10-40 minutes after your walk time.

, Your dog should be bathed daily, so fit this in sometime during the day; preferably after a walk or mealtime, not before, as these activities are what make your dog dirty. 5:30 PM is a simple time. You can also add in a time straight after bath time for brushing.

, Make sure all of these has the 30 minute time gap between them.

, These don't need to be in your set routine, but try to think about when you are able to fit these in.

Select a breed, colour and gender you like. Pay close attention to the personality descriptions- if it's your first time playing the game, avoid dogs described as tomboyish, naughty, boisterous etc. Instead, opt for dogs that are described as being patient and having a good temperament. This makes teaching your dog it's name much easier, as well as teaching it tricks later on. If the ideal dog doesn't show up, simply exit out of the selection screen and click on the breed again to have a new randomized set.

, You can try rubbing it's stomach, it's butt, behind it's ears etc. Note that the dog may sparkle- this means you're petting it well!





, This should happen quite quickly





, The best names are between two and four syllables, and sound very distinct. Don't choose something too short like ""Bee"" or ""Pip"" (while they may be cute) or ""Captain Death Overlord the Third"" (even though it may sound epic). Too long or too short names make it hard for your dog to learn it's name. Cute names may be foods like ""Toffee"", flowers like ""Daisy"", human names like ""Maxwell"" or anything you can imagine!





, Speak clearly and be sure to remember how you pronounced it the first time. The tone you use the first time will need to be repeated again and again so make sure you like the sound of it.





, If your dog understands what you said, a faint yellow light will appear around it and a chime will sound. If it's confused, orange question marks appear and a mumbled noise will sound. If your dog keeps being confused, you aren't pronouncing it identically each time. You may want to rethink it's name if it's not working., Well done, you're getting closer!





, Ensure it's spelled correctly- for an extra special touch, add a little star, heart or other symbol to it.





, This is where it get's tricky- many people have trouble and get frustrated with this step. You need to keep calling it as instructed, petting it, clicking back and calling it again. If successful, the game will announce that the dog is familiar with it's name and you can start teaching your dog how to sit. However, if you aren't successful, you will need to restart from step three and repeat the process., Remember to use the dog's name regularly to keep it in mind, as it is possible your dog will forget it's own name."

, Competitions are the supreme way to make money and get out of the house simultaneously.


Train for disc competitions. To train for a disc competition, take at least one walk everyday to the park with no dogs, and practice throwing some discs. Do this for one or two days to get him prepared.
Train for agility trials. Upon arrival to the gym, let your dog run the entire field by slowly guiding it around once. Go through the obstacle course until each obstacle has received an 'excellent' position. Run one lap and go thoroughly through the course.
Train for obedience competitions. Learn five new tricks upon entering (check the internet for special bonus moves). Spend a chunk of time practicing.

, When your dog is hungry or famished, feed it a whole bowl. Dog food ranges from two to four dollars at both the store and discount shop. Make sure you've always got a handful of dog biscuits around.


Give your dog water and milk all the time. If you're living under one hundred dollars, try to save up some money and buy at the discount shop for a while. It's not the best, but it's enough to make sure your pup won't go hungry or thirsty.

, Shampoo can go up to two dollars, but don't worry about the price: worry about which type of shampoo to get. There are two kinds: for long hair and short hair, so check what kind your dog is and stock up on that kind. Shampoo at least once a week, and use your brush, but don't rely on it.

, Make your dog run only a short distance and let it walk and enjoy. Stop for restroom breaks, and when you meet another trainer, let them play for a few minutes. Avoid fighting! When things seem tense between the dogs, walk them away. Take it to the dog park with other dogs there and let the dogs bond.

, Look around. When things seem to get boring around your home, go out to the Interior Designer, save some money up, and buy a new place which should come arrive a few days later.

, Take a chance to enjoy some quality time with your dog. Have fun and let him know you love him.

Head to the Nookling Store.,
Check the center shelf where the tools are displayed.,
Purchase the shovel.,
Equip the shovel.,
Look for rocks.,
Prevent kickbacks.,
Hit the rock.",How to Prevent Kick Back in Animal Crossing: Wild World," It is in the shopping district—simply head north, past the train station, and follow the cobblestone under the arch. The Nookling Store can be found to the left.


Unlike shaking trees for bells, getting money from rocks requires more than just your bare hands. You can use either a shovel or an axe to hit the rock, which will cause it to drop bells. Because the axe is incredibly brittle and breaks after so many uses, it is recommended that you use the indestructible shovel instead.;
, If there is no shovel, you will have to either wait for a day to pass, or manually change the date yourself, for it to appear.


To manually change the date, save the game and go to the starting screen. While talking to Isabelle, you can change the date. After changing the date a few times, the shovel should be available for purchase.

, To purchase the shovel, approach it, and hit the A button. Tom Nook will ask if you’d like to purchase it; select “Buy” to purchase the shovel. It costs 500 bells.

, Open your inventory by pressing Y. Select the Shovel, then select your character, and drop the shovel in the character’s slot. The character image will change to show it holding a shovel.

, Rocks are scattered all over town; run around and look for them. Once you find one, approach it.

, There are two ways to prevent kickbacks in Wild World. The first, and usually the most-used method is to dig holes around you. This means that once you’re facing the rock, do an about-face and then hit the A button. Your character will dig a hole in the area he is facing. Face the side, and dig a hole there; do so on the other side too! If you dig a hole in the wrong space, simply hit the A button while facing the hole to fill it in. Once you’re finished, your character should be facing the rock with a hole behind him and to his sides.


The second method is to stand between the rock and a stationary object. That is, if the rock is near a tree or a cliff or another stationary object (a house for instance or another rock), just wedge your character between the rock and the object. The object behind your character will prevent kickbacks as well as digging holes, only this time, you didn’t have to go through so much trouble.

, Now that you’ve dug the holes, or positioned yourself between a stationary object and the rock, you won’t get kickback when you hit the rock. Face the rock and press A. If you’re lucky, the rock will be a Money Rock! If it is, continuously hit the rock as fast as you can with your shovel until the rock will no longer produce bells.


If you didn’t get a Money Rock, run to another rock, dig more holes the same way as described here, and hit the rock. Continue until you get the Money Rock!

Your second option is to use the Stylus and the touch screen. To change a note in this manner, simply tap and hold the note you want to change and drag the Stylus up to choose a higher note or down to select one of a lower pitch.
There are two different scales for the pitch of each note, a note randomizer, a pause, and a “drag.” The randomizer can be accessed by scrolling the pitch to the highest, the pause can be accessed by scrolling to the lowest, and the drag is the second to the last lowest note when you scroll.

, You can modify a total of 15 notes for your melody, with two scales for their pitch. Simply input one of the three patterns:

Learn the process.,
Plant various flowers and trees.,
Remove weeds.,
Pick up items lying on the ground outdoors.,
Water flowers.,
Consult the Town Hall.,
Pick Roses.,
Breed a Black Rose.,
Let your Black Rose wilt.,
Water it with your Golden Watering Can.,
Leave it until the next day.",How to Make Golden Roses in Animal Crossing: Wild World," A Golden Watering Can is the most essential part of the process, and also the most difficult. To gain one, one must maintain a Perfect Town status for 14 days straight, and on the 15th day, you will be rewarded the elusive tool. The following steps must be followed to maintain the status.;
, Planting various trees and flowers will generally increase the rating of the town. You can buy saplings or seeds from the town store, which is placed randomly for every town, or you could plant fruit trees.


To plant saplings, flower seeds, and flowers, simply head to the area of your choice. Pull up the menu with the Y button, tap the item or scroll to it with your D-pad and press A, then pick “Drop.” This will automatically plant your flora into the ground.
To plant fruit trees, you need a shovel and some fruit. Shovels are available in the town store for 500 bells, but are not available every day, so you might need to wait. Get some fruit by pressing A against a tree with fruit in it. Pick up the fruits with B, pull up your inventory, and equip your shovel by selecting it with your stylus or D-pad. Bring it up to your character icon, press A or tap the character icon to equip it, and exit your inventory. Tap the ground or press A to dig a hole. Go back to your inventory and select the fruit, and choose “Bury.”
Don’t clump too many trees too closely to each other. They need at least one space between each or you’ll be told to get rid of some of them. If you do manage to overcrowd an area with trees, buy an Axe from the town store, equip it, then press A or tap the offending tree to get rid of it. Then equip your Shovel and press A, or tap on the stump to completely clear the area.

, Weeds pop up every day in random parts of the town, usually 3 or 4 at a time. Though all you really need to uproot are the weeds that resemble long tufts of grass. Simply go up to the weed and press A or tap the weed to get rid of them.


The other kinds of weeds that pop up are Dandelions and Clovers, but aren’t necessary to remove. Dandelions can be worn after you pick them up, and uprooting Clovers occasionally yields four-leafed clovers, which you can sell or keep to increase your luck.

, Anything and everything you leave lying on the ground outside must be picked up and either stored or sold. They are considered trash and would affect the rating of the town. Seashells on the beach and fruit do not affect this, although picking them up might make the town look more tidy.

, Flowers tend to wilt if it hasn’t rained in a few days. To amend this, you need to buy a Watering Can from the town store. Once you equip it, press A to water the flowers. Wilted flowers have a brownish tint to them and look slightly shriveled compared to healthy flowers. Properly watered flowers have water droplets dropping into the ground and a sparkling animation to indicate it has been watered.

, To be sure you’re on the right track, talk to the pelican in the first counter of the Town Hall, which is a nice looking building with a clock tower. Depending on the time you visit, a different Pelican will be at the counter, though the difference is merely the appearance and the dialogue. In any case, if you go up to the first counter and tap the pelican, or press A, you’ll be given a few options. Choose “The environment,” and they’ll comment on the opinions of the townsfolk. The pelicans also offer advice on how to improve your town.


Sometimes, the advice overlaps, so you may receive a “too many trees” comment at first consultation, then when you chop down a tree, they’d give you a “not enough trees/flowers” comment. It only means that you overcrowded an area with trees and should spread your gardening more evenly.

, Since you’re aiming for a Golden Rose, you obviously need to invest in Roses. Roses can be found all over the town, or their seeds can be bought from the town store for 80 bells. Red roses are the ones you’ll be needing for this, and luckily enough, they’re fairly common. Just walk up to the Rose and press B or tap on the flower to take them for replanting. You’ll be needing about 4 Roses to maximize your production, but at the very least, you need 2 red Roses.

, Black Roses are unusual offspring of two red Roses bred together and is absolutely necessary to make a Golden Rose.


Place your Roses side by side on a clear area. Make sure it’s clear enough that other flowers can spawn and bloom around them, which is the point of flower breeding.
You’ll need to wait at least a day before new flowers start popping up beside the original two flowers, and water them regularly. It might take you a while before it yields a Black Rose, however.
The most efficient system of breeding is by placing 4 of your chosen flowers of the same type in a 4x4 pattern in a clear area, with at least 2 spaces between them and other flowers to prevent accidental cross-pollination. The colors can be different, as long as it’s limited to two color combinations per “group.” This is to ensure the colors of the flowers that bloom are controlled.

, Leave it alone for a few days. Don’t water it at all and let it shrivel. As mentioned in the “Getting a Golden Watering Can” section, a shriveled flower is brown and wilted. This may sound strange or counter-productive after you read the next step, but this is essential for the Black Rose to transform into a Golden Rose.

, Once it’s considerably wilted, equip your Golden Watering Can and sprinkle the life-giving liquid onto the poor flower. This will trigger the transformation.

, After waiting for a day, check on your Black Rose. Except your Black Rose will be replaced by a Golden Rose! Surprise!

Follow these methods to be on your way to achieve the perfect bell wallet.",How to Make Bells in Animal Crossing Wild World Without Cheating1," You don't have to use all of them, it is your choice.

Understand the two terms used in defining the fruits.,
Then, once the trees have grown their foreign fruits, you sell them to Tom Nook's for 500 bells.,
Continue to use the last step.",How to Make Bells in Animal Crossing Wild World Without Cheating2,"


Native fruits are the fruit you first receive when arriving to your town. These would be either an orange, apple, pear, peach or cherry.
Foreign fruits are the other fruits that did not appear in your original town, plus a coconut which washes up ashore on your beach randomly. For example, if your Native Fruit was a peach, your Foreign Fruits would be the orange, apple, pear, cherry and the coconut. You get Foreign fruits either from a visitor from another town which owns that fruit or an attachment to a rare letter from your Mom. You could also write a letter that says,"" How are you?"" to a neighbor with your native fruit as a present. They will either send you a Foreign Fruit or a rare outfit. Foreign fruits generally are more valuable than Native fruits, and can be sold for a higher price.

If you have a few friends who also own a DS and an Animal Crossing: Wild World game cartilage, connect with each other by DS to DS or Nintendo WiFi and swap a few fruits from your trees to some from your friend's. Plant them around your town, and eventually they should grow fruits. If in doubt that your tree won't survive or bloom fruits, use an Axe from Tom Nook's to chop down an existing tree that doesn't bare any fruit, dig out the stump, and replace the old tree by planting the other fruit in the exact spot, it will definitely grow.

;
, You are selling them for 5 times the price of a native fruit (100 bells. So, if you sold 2 foreign fruits, you would receive 1,000 bells while if you sold 2 native fruits, you would earn only 200 bells.

, Fruits will regrow every 3 or so days, so there is no need to plant more foreign fruits unless you want a larger supply.

"
"
Sell.",How to Make Bells in Animal Crossing Wild World Without Cheating3," Selling things you don't need is probably one of the most effective ways to earn bells. A few ways to do so...



Fish, catch bugs, shoot presents, or get digging.
Use tools. Using tools that can be purchased from Tom Nook's store located in your town, catch, shoot or dig up some treasures that Nook loves.
Check with Blathers. Before you run off to the stores, check if Blathers has your bug, fish or fossil in the museum. If so, donate it. If not, feel free to sell it!
Get a 'Loid'.If you go digging, and dig up one of those ""Loids"", sell it if you don't want it. They can be sold for around 880 bells each.
Check for presents. If you are shooting down things from the sky, check what present you got - if it's not going towards your house project because it's something you don't need, sell it for its price according to Tom Nook. Doing this is not only fun and enjoyable, but your work definitely gets rewarded.
Go through your drawers and cupboards because who knows what things you have tucked away in them. There may be things in there that you don't want or need anymore. If so, go ahead and sell them. Old flooring and wallpapers in your pockets might already have a copy in your drawers - if so, sell the spare. If you happen to sell anything that you may regret later on, you can always buy it back from the catalog if you're desperate.
Sell at a flea market. Flea Markets are always handy. Sell any of your old furniture that you are trying to get rid of to neighbors on the First Saturday of Every Month. The good thing is, YOU choose the price, as long as it's in the buyer's budget range. So, this means you may be able to sell it for more than Nook would pay you anyway.

Head around town between 6am-12pm on a Sunday morning, find Joan carrying her sack of turnips, buy some red or white turnips and sell them.",How to Make Bells in Animal Crossing Wild World Without Cheating4," Sounds simple, right? Wrong... the idea is based on the real-life Stock Market, except in the game, we use turnips instead of shares. So, we should all know that you can't guarantee what will happen in situations like these. You can earn a healthy profit of around 16,000 - or you could lose a few coins. Or bell bags.


White Turnips are a slightly easier method than Red Turnips in some cases, but it can be the opposite. Firstly, you don't have to cater their every needs. Just sell it when Nook prices them right. But this is the hard part. The idea is to earn more than you paid for them, so if Joan offers a good price, reap. Buy enough white turnips that you will earn a good amount, but not so many that if you do have to sell them for less you won't lose as much. The trick is you have to sell before Sunday or they rot, so if you see a deal better than you paid for your turnips on Monday, but the rest of the days offer a price under what you paid, Monday would give you the best profits. But if you buy on the first day, sometimes later days offer a better price. It's confusing, but it's a game of chance. A trick to keep your turnips from rotting is to store them on a table in your Animal Crossing house. But this will reduce Happy Room Academy points and neighbor's star ratings they rate your room if they visit.
Red Turnips cost 1,000 bells per turnip. Some say that Red Turnips are easy money. Easy. Cinch. Not always the case, because unless you water your Red Turnip daily and look after it too well, it will die, losing 1,000 bells as a result.

To look after a red turnip, put it in a corner or place where villagers usually don't walk on, but make sure you will remember where it is. Then, simply boot up your DS to this game daily for about a week to water it. On the Sunday after you bought your turnip, dig it up. If it is healthy and you kept up your patronage to it properly, you will earn a large Red Turnip, worth around 16,000 bells, which earns you a 15,000 bell profit (since the turnip cost 1,000b to start with). So, if you are ready to be dedicated to your turnip, the results are pleasing.

Hit a rock with a shovel (or alternatively an axe) you bought from Tom Nook's shop.,
Use Money Trees.",How to Make Bells in Animal Crossing Wild World Without Cheating5," Weirdly enough, one rock out of your many rocks scattered around your town will store money. It's as simple as hitting a rock a few times, but the question is how well you can do it. Well, what people don't know is that you actually only have 10 seconds to get out as many bell bags from the rock as possible. To achieve more bell bags flying out of the rock, you need to keep yourself to the rock, because every time you hit the rock the pressure bounces you back. If you ""bounce/fall back"" you will waste time that could be used getting bells, which reduces the number of bells you make. This can be fixed by digging three holes in a straight row behind your character while it is right against the rock, stopping your character from falling back so you have more time to hit. Only one rock per character per day holds money, and if you are quick enough, you can make up to 8,000 bells per character per rock, or 32,000 bells if all 4 of your characters do it perfectly.
, They do exist in the Wild World. If you are lucky enough to have earned a golden shovel, you may be able to earn a few bells. Firstly, with your axe, cut down a tree and dig out the stump. Replace it with a bell bag. If you are lucky, in a few days it will grow into a tree bearing bells. If you succeed, there will be 3 bell bags hanging on the tree. Shake the tree to retrieve them. Each bell bag will be worth the price that you 'planted' in the first place divided by three, so altogether you will re-earn the bells, but note the bells won't regrow! But, like most methods of bell earning in this game, this can be risky and may not work. View some more articles on how to do this for more depth.

"
Understand that, as mayor, you must talk to all of your citizens.,
Press the ‘A’ button to talk to a citizen.,
Decide whether you want to ask the citizen how they are doing, or choose the ‘nevermind’ option.,
Try again if you accidentally choose “nevermind”.,
Be prepared to complete a task if the citizen asks you to do so.,
Understand that you can say no to the favor if you want to.",How to Maintain Your Animal Crossing Town1," Talking to everyone simply requires that you check all the areas in your town (shops, homes, outdoors, etc.) until you have found and spoken to each one of your citizens.


How to talk to each citizen is described in the following steps.;
, In order to talk to a citizen, you just need to be standing next to him or her and press the “a” button. You can talk to a citizen with or without a tool (such as a shovel), but if you gauge the distance wrong you might end up smacking them with your shovel instead of talking to them, so be careful when walking around with tools.

, When talking to a citizen, they will greet you first and then you will have two options: to ask “how are you?” or to say “nevermind”.


Answering with “nevermind” will end the conversation, which will still count as having talked to that citizen for the day, but is missing out on the opportunity to befriend them further.

, Often, responding with “nevermind” will result in the citizen reacting as though you’ve slighted them, but Animal Crossing characters are quick to forgive. If you accidentally hit “nevermind”, you can still initiate a new conversation by pressing “a” again. Pick “how are you?” this time instead and it will be like nothing ever happened.

, Sometimes, when you ask a citizen how they’re doing, they’ll respond with a few lines about how their day is going. Other times, they may ask you for a favor.


Citizens ask for a range of favors: they may ask you to fetch a type of fruit, insect, or fish; they may also ask you to return something that they borrowed to another citizen. The tasks are all relatively straightforward and if you forget what you are supposed to do, you can always go back and ask that citizen what they asked for.

, While it is advised that you try to complete the tasks when you can in order to increase citizen approval and net rewards, you can decline. If you say no, the citizen will seem disappointed, but again, Animal Crossing characters are quick to forgive and they won’t hold a grudge.

"
"
Press ‘B’ to pull weeds.,
Understand that the number of weeds you have can affect your citizen satisfaction.,
Keep the flowers in your town well-watered to keep your citizens happy.,
Select the watering can from your inventory.,
Water your flowers with the watering can.",How to Maintain Your Animal Crossing Town2," All you need to do in order to pull weeds in Animal Crossing is to stand next to a weed and press the “b” button. This will cause your character to bend over and pull the weed out of the ground.


If you don’t play for a long stretch of time, there will be a lot of weeds in your town and you may have to spend longer on this step.

, Citizens don’t like weeds. They detract from the beautiful scenery otherwise created by flowers and trees. If you leave the weeds alone, it will cause your citizen satisfaction to decrease.

, Both you and your citizens are capable of planting and watering flowers. However, your citizens won’t be able to keep all of the flowers happy. When a flower doesn’t get enough water, it will begin to wilt and turn grey. This also causes a decrease in citizen satisfaction.

, If you do not have a watering can yet, scroll down to Method 3 to learn how to get one. If you have a watering can, you can press “x” to bring up your character’s inventory. In the inventory, find the icon for the watering can and equip your character with it by dragging and dropping it onto your character’s icon.


Alternately, you can tap on the watering can and then choose the option “hold” to get your character to hold the can.

, With your character equipped with a watering can, position your character so that he or she is standing next to the wilted flower. When your character is in position, press the “a” button. This button will trigger the action and your character will water the flower.


Again, if you don’t have a watering can, read the next section to find out how to get one.

"
"
Understand that you will have to talk to your secretary to get a watering can.,
Find Isabelle.,
Ask Isabelle for advice.,
Complete the tasks that Isabelle gives you.,
Ask Isabelle for new advice if you know how to write a letter.,
Ask for advice again if you are not carrying a shovel with you.,
Catch fish or bugs.",How to Maintain Your Animal Crossing Town3," You can obtain a watering can from Isabelle, the mayor’s secretary, by repeatedly asking her for “advice living here” and then completing the tasks she gives you. Asking Isabelle questions will be covered in the following steps.


Try to do this early on in the game so that you keep maintain your town and keep your citizens happy.

, Isabelle can be found in the town hall, which will be in a determined place depending on your map. The map of your city is displayed on the bottom screen of the DS. Look for the purple building icon on your map, which represents the town hall.

, In order to talk to Isabelle, you must approach the front counter that she is standing behind. There is a green mat that you can step on; once you’re there, press “a” to initiate the conversation.


Isabelle will then ask if there is anything she can help you with today. Respond by choosing “advice for living here”.

, Isabelle will give you advice in the form of tasks. For the first task, she will give you stationary (a consumable item that goes to your inventory) and suggest that you send someone a letter. Go ahead and use the stationary to send a letter to complete the task. It does not matter what you write or who you send it to.

, If you need to know more about sending letters, Isabelle will explain—all you have to do is ask her. Otherwise you can talk to her again and ask for new advice. This time, she’ll talk about seashells on the beach and subtly request that you bring her one. To do this, head to the beach and pick up a seashell. To pick up the seashell, stand next to one and press “b”.


Return to Isabelle with the seashell in your inventory; she’ll be delighted and hand you a basket of non-native fruits, which you can then plant. If you’re carrying a shovel, she will explain how to plant trees.
To plant any fruit, equip your character with the shovel and then find a spot of ground that you like. When you find a spot, press “a” to dig a hole with your shovel. Then, go into your inventory and find the fruit you want. Tap on the fruit and click the option “bury”. This will cause a sapling to appear and in a few days it will be a full tree that produces three of that fruit every day.

, If you do not have a shovel to plant the fruits discussed in the previous step, you can ask Isabelle for advice again and she will ask whether you’re interested in fishing or bug catching. The answer you give will determine your next task.


If you already have one tool and not the other (a fishing rod, but not a net, for example) you may want to pick the task you’re prepared for.
However, if you don’t have either or want the other one, you can talk to Isabelle again. Tell her you’re missing the fishing rod or bug net and she will sell you one for 500 bells, which is the standard price.

, If you picked fishing, Isabelle will ask you to catch three different kinds of fish. She will explain how to fish if you don’t know. If you picked bug catching, she will ask you to catch three different kinds of insects. Again, if you don’t know how, she will give you a brief explanation.


Once you’ve caught either three types of fish or bugs, you will have finished all of Isabelle’s tasks. She will reward you with the watering can and consider you suitably prepared to go forth.
Once you have the watering can, read Method 3 to find out how to water your plants.

"
"
Understand that your town requires regular maintenance.,
Be aware that your Animal Crossing town has the same time and date as your real life does.,
Try to spend at least 10 or 15 minutes a day maintaining your town.",How to Maintain Your Animal Crossing Town4," Animal Crossing can be a demanding game. If you do not visit regularly, weeds will take over your town’s landscape and citizens will wonder where you’ve been.


Furthermore, if you aren’t playing regularly, then you will miss opportunities to make your town better.

, Time functions in the game Animal Crossing in the same way that it does for you. This means that if your 3DS is set to the current time and date, then that is the time and date that it will be in your town.


If your 3DS is set to a different time and date, then your Animal Crossing town will be set to that date instead.

, 10 to 15 minutes should be plenty of time to keep your town well maintained each day. During that time, you should try to pull weeds and talk with all of your citizens.


Talking to your citizens is covered in Method 1, while gardening is covered in Methods 2 and 3.

Invest in the Stalk Market.,
Visit the Lost and Found.,
Visit The Money Rock.,
Shoot off.,
Go to the Flea Market.,

Check the Recycling Bin.",How to Make Bells on Animal Crossing: Wild World1," Depending on what kind of sea shells you collect at your town beach, you can see those and get bells for them. For instance, a pearl oyster is worth 1,500 bells!;
, Sometimes, when you shake trees, 100 bells could fall out! Be careful though, a bee hive could also fall too!

, If you go to a friend's town through Wi-fi or Wireless Communications, make sure you grab some fruit that isn't native to your town. Non-native fruit will sell more than fruit that is already in your town. It's 500 bells for non-native fruit, but only 100 bells for native fruit. Plant one of the fruits you collect, so you can keep selling it in your town.

, If you are good at fishing, you can earn a lot of money! You can get some rare fish if you fish a lot. Sell them to Tom Nook. If it's junk like boots, tires, or cans, throw it back or try and sell that too.

, With your trusty net, go catch some bugs! Note that, most bugs don't appear in the Winter, and some bugs are only native to one season. If you really wanna press your luck, so around and shake trees. Maybe, bees will come out, and if you are really lucky (and quick), you can catch one and sell it for major cash!

, Look for a crack in the ground. Take out your shovel and dig it up! You can sell up to 3 fossils a day to Tom Nook, so, choose your fossils wisely.

, On Sundays, Joan travels into your town to sell White and Red Turnips. Red Turnips sell more than White Turnips. Unfortunately, she only sell one pack of those for 1,000 bells. Get it, then go and plant it. Make sure you water it everyday. If you forget to water on any day, it will have wilted. The price varies on a White Turnip. You can only buy White Turnips in bunches of 10. White Turnips go rotten if you don't sell them buy next Sunday. Now, dig it up at anytime during the week and go sell it to Tom Nook. Depending on what price they are buying them for during the week, you could make more than you spent on the turnips or lose more.

, Go to the gate and talk to Booker, to see if has found anything. Most of the time, he finds pretty rare items that you can go sell.

, There's a special rock in town that, when you hit it with your shovel, throws out bells! If you do it quickly enough, your could get 8,000 bells at one time! But, if you do if without digging holes around you, you will keep scooting back! And, you'll waste time running back up to the rock. You only have about 6-10 seconds to hit as much as you can. So, here's what you can do. Dig holes around the rock you are going to hit. Make sure you are inside first. Then, hit the rock! If the rock you chose wasn't the one, just turn around and put the dirt back in the hole.

, If you have a slingshot, look out for a balloon every time the last digit on the game clock ends in 4. (Ex. 1:04, 1:14, 1:24, etc.). When you have shot it down, open the present and go sell it.

, When villagers come by your house on Flea Market day, they could be interested in some of the furniture you have displayed in your house. You could take their offer, or come up with one of your own. You couldn't make it too high, otherwise they won't buy it. Either make it lower than what they offered or about 100-200 bells higher than they offered.

, This works similar to the Flea Market, except your friends come over from Wireless Connection or Wi-fi. They can look around at all of your stuff and negotiate a price.

, Located in the Town Hall, you could look in the Recycling Bin for items other villagers have left in there.

Sometimes it is possible that the bells will disappear during the transaction, and you can't get them back, but this is very rare.
Scorpions, tarantulas, grasshoppers, long locusts, migratory locus, crickets and bell crickets can't be caught while doing this.

,, With the other character, pick it up.,, The game will say wireless communications has ended, so tap the screen/press A., The bells should have been cloned., Once the pockets are full, write 10 letters in the visitors pocket, and add the money as presents., Finally, once your town has been completely filled with bells, put it all in the bank to get rewards (after you reach a total of about 25,000.000, your monthly interest will be at it's highest, which is 99,999 bells)."

Wait overnight and dig the shovel up after 6 am.;
, Note that planting 99,999 bells in a hole will have a 99 percent chance of success. Each 10 percent down (88, 77, etc) will also be that rate of success.

, Depending on how many bells you planted will determine on the odds and waiting time of your money tree. Do other activities in Animal Crossing, such as fishing or do present trading with neighbors.

, Money trees are not continuously growing, like fruit trees in the game. If you wish to do this again, you must start from the beginning of planting the money.

Buy some turnips from Joan.,
Plant them!,
Use the 'Everlasting Turnip' method to store your white turnips for ever.",How to Keep Turnips Fresh on Animal Crossing Wild World," Joan comes on Sundays from 6 am to 12 pm through your town gate to sell them. She only has one packet a week of red turnips, but you can buy as many white turnips as you want. There are two types of turnips


Red turnips. Price: 1,000 Bells each
White turnips. Price: usually 70-150 each.;
, After you have bought your turnips, you can plant them. It would be a good idea to plant them near your home, so you can easily water them everyday. Maybe you can clear an area near your house and use it just for turnips.


Red turnips. You have to water red turnips EVERY day. If you miss even one day, they will wither and die. You would have lost 1,000 Bells in the process, too.
White turnips. You don't have to plant them, just keep them in your inventory and check Tom Nook's store often. He sets 2 prices every day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, so it is a good idea to check twice. Try to sell your turnips for more than what you pain to make a profit. If you do not sell them in a week, they will rot and you might as well throw them away or recycle.

, Buy a table and put it in your house. Place your white turnips on the table and wait until Nook has a good buying price for turnips (i.e. over 100 Bells). This will NOT work with red turnips.

Buy a red turnip from Joan.(Plant the turnip and be careful...the plant could die easily). After a week, the red turnip will be nice and big.;
,


Wendell should give you the Turban or Country Guitar. If you get the Turban, take it to Sahara when she comes to town. If he gives you a guitar, then give it to K.K. Slider.
Sahara should give you either the Massage Chair or Red Vase. If you get the Massage Chair, let Tortimer have it the next holiday and he should give you the scallop. Then just wait for Pascal to show up and give him the scallop.
If you got the Country Guitar, give it to K.K. Slider to get K.K.'s Picture
If you got the Red Vase, give it to Crazy Redd in exchange for the Safe. Give the safe to Tom Nook for the Tom Nook Picture.
The animals will ask for the guitar, vase, safe, or any other item only if it is in your pockets.

First you can wait for your mom to mail you-this rarely happens, so don't expect this to work. Sometimes she might send you a fruit that doesn't come from your town.
Another way is to go to a friend's town and take some of their fruit if it is different than your native fruit.
The third and easiest way is to mail a couple of people in your town. Attach your native fruit, and most likely they will send you a reply with a non-native fruit attached.
And the fourth is to wait for one to wash up on the beach, this is usually a coconut, and they are hard to grow. (Non-native fruit sells for 500 bells. Native fruit sells for 100.);
, If you play the game on December 31, Mom will mail you 10,000 bells. Many people set the time to 23:59 for this to work.

, Some of these bugs and fish are worth lots of money when you sell them to Tom Nook.

, If you bought something and changed your mind about it, sell it. You might not get much, but everything helps.


Find as many fossils as you can then sell them: Golden Shovel (rare); axe (available at Nook's store).

, Every month, you will get interest.

, A good money cheat is to put all your money in your savings account, turn it up 100 years and you will get to keep tons of interest.

",How to Have a Beautiful Community in Animal Crossing," It's always important to set the time and date correctly so that you can enjoy events and happenings at the right time.;
, The residents are the animals that wander around your town and are sometimes located in their homes. You'll find out that they never visit shops nor your home unless you have agreed to it through chatting. Visiting your home can't be agreed upon in letters.

, They might be asking you a question. Sometimes, you may get a gift if you fulfill their request. Answer any question sensibly; if you make them happy, they may give you a present, such as clothes or furniture. Your answer will also may make them wander around town singing with joy and glee in a happy mood.

, Don't just talk to the residents you like best. Otherwise, the ones you don't talk to will feel rejected and will probably move to another town. However, there is a way to stop them moving. See 'tips' for more information on this.

, Boondox is a poor town far west that you can never visit, but donating bells will help them.

, Plant flowers and trees, but don't overdo it. Make sure that there is an equal ratio between the two. You might want to plant them around resident's houses or your own, in a pattern or something.

Before we start, here's the lowdown on Tom Nook.,
Think to yourself: How long have you had the store?,
Have a friend visit your town via tag mode and make them buy something from your store - even if it is something as cheap as a pack of flower seeds!

,
Buy, buy, buy!

,
Look out for special offers like the 5 Times Point Special - buy one day for five times the points for every purchase and Spotlight Products - rare items!

,
After about 3 weeks at least, if this hasn't kicked in, keep trying and waiting.,
Note: if you have not bought at 5 times point special you can see how much money you spent by multiplying your points by 100

",How to Get Nookingtons on Animal Crossing," Nook is a shop owner and he always wanted to be from when he was a little boy! There are a few levels to get to the top shop, Nookingtons. Level 1 is Nook's Cranny. That's the little store you got when you first started your Animal Crossing Game. It stocks 2 furniture items each day and very little of the other items. Keep shopping each day and in no time, your store will upgrade to Level 2, Nook 'n' Go! This spin off of the first store is more modern than Nook's Cranny, some 'groovier' music and much more to receive. Level 3 is Nookway and that is the store you are most likely stuck on now if you are reading this. Nookway is the store before Nookingtons, the best, and it surely sticks around a long, long time. Read on to help clear up this problem! Nookingtons has a:


Hair salon - do your hair differently!
An extra level - meet Nook's nephews as they guide you through furniture etc and even the newly added paint - recolor your roof!
New music
Every single tool is sold every day - no waiting daily for your tool to arrive in the store!
Even more!;
, If you have only just recently had your store upgrade to Nookway, there is a good chance you will have to wait.

Decide which villager you want to build a strong friendship with.,
Talk to the villager or villagers that you chose often.,
Send them nice letters often that include thoughtful gifts.,
Avoid pushing them, hitting them with any of your tools, such as your net or axe, pushing them into pitfall seeds, or talking to them so much that they get annoyed.,
Say yes to any errands that they ask you to do for them.,
Try your best to make them stay if they tell you that they're leaving in a conversation.,
Keep repeating these steps for awhile.",How to Get Villager's Pictures on Animal Crossing," This can be any villager that lives in your town. Also, decide how many villagers you'd like to build strong friendships with. This is completely up to you. Are you looking for just one picture, for the top of a table in your house, or multiple, to show how sociable you are?;
, You won't build a friendship with them if you never bother talking with them.

, Don't just throw in a measly Pitfall Seed, even though they'll still be grateful for it. Give them nice furniture, carpets or wallpaper, or maybe even bells.

, Doing those things will not only get them annoyed with you, but if you continue, it may make them leave your town.

,

If they give you a package to give to another villager, do not open the package. This will make them get upset with you.







, When talking to them, instead of choosing options like ""Goodbye!"", choose the option that convinces them to stay.

, Sooner or later, in a conversation with them, they'll give you their picture.

First, find a place in your town that is suitable for you to plant trees.,
Collect at least 5 of each fruit.,
Bury your fruit in the ground, then water it.,
Once the trees are grown, shake the tree & pick up the fruit.",How to Grow an Orchard in Animal Crossing Wild World," Use the Axe if there are trees in your way.;
, You can obtain them through wifi and ds to ds if you pick them from others towns. You could also send a letter to a resident in your town which has your native fruit attached. They may then send a non-native fruit (or a shirt) back, that is, if your letter is only 1 row long. For example you could send the letter with the line ""This is a fruit gift."" and they would happily send you either a fruit or shirt back.

, Hopefully, in 5 days, the tree should have grown and bear fruit.


If the tree wilts, water it and wait another day to see if it perks up. If not, dig it up and start the tree over with another piece of fruit. (Note: This will restart the whole process)

, Just 1 tree of non native fruit is 1,500 bells! Sell it to Nook and rake in the cash!

Pick flowers.,
Buy flower seeds.,
Talk to Tortimer in the Plaza outside the Town Hall.,
Clear out the area.,
Place flowers or plant flower seeds around your House.,
Cheat!,
Take care of your flowers.,
Be careful when running.,
Keep this up until the next Monday.",How to Get the Flower Trophy in Animal Crossing: Wild World," Since this is the Flower Fest, you obviously need to invest in flowers! Normally, you can find them scattered everywhere in the town. To pick them up, simply tap the flower or press X while standing near or on the Flower.;
, You can also buy flower seeds from the town store for 80 Bells if you’re running short on flowers. The town store is run by Tom Nook and is randomly placed in every town. Simply go up to a sack with a red label in the store, and say yes when Tom Nook asks if you want to buy it.

, Do this every day for the entire week, and he will give you different flower seeds every day.

, You might also need to clear out nearby trees if you run out of room to plant your flowers in. You’ll be needing an Axe and a Shovel from the town store to clear out trees, and they can be bought for 500 bells each.


To chop down trees, equip your Axe, and tap or press and hold A until the tree falls, then equip your shovel and dig it out with A or by tapping it.

, Plant a bountiful array at least 3 spaces around the sides of your house. To plant your flowers, stand on the spot you want them placed in, access your inventory with the Y button, and select the flower or flower seed by tapping on it or scrolling to it with your D-pad and pressing A. Choose the “Plant” option, and the flower will then immediately spring up on the ground.


To equip your tools, go to your inventory, select your chosen tool, then drop in on your character’s icon. The icon will change to your character holding your tool.
It’s best if you have a variety of flowers and colors arranged in a pleasing manner. Even if you don’t win this year, at least your garden would look pretty!

, While this is definitely not recommended, you can cheat by placing patterns on the ground and stealing flowers planted around other villager’s houses every day and planting them around your house. While they don’t actually get mad at you, sabotage is still a bad thing, and you should be ashamed of yourself if you do this.


To place patterns on the ground, once you’ve gone outside to the area of your choosing, pull up your inventory and tap or scroll to the red pencil symbol at the very top. Right at the bottom of the screen are a bunch of designs; select one. Any of those designs would do. Go to the rightmost symbol in the second row of circular options. The icon would resemble an inclined plane with an arrow pointing downwards beside it and a leaf symbol on the plane itself. Press A or tap on it to place it on the ground, and there you have it, a pattern resembling a flower!

, Water your flowers daily, and uproot weeds nearby. You can water your flowers by buying a Watering Can from the town store for 500 bells, equipping it, and pressing A or tapping the flowers. Properly watered flowers drip water and sparkle once you sprinkle them.


Weeds pop up every day, about 3 or 4 at a time. They look like long tufts of grass. You can uproot them by pressing A or B or tapping them.

, While running is a fun activity and gets you where you want to as quickly as possible, you run the risk of trampling on the flower and destroying it completely. Flowers have a chance of being destroyed when you run through them, and running through them a lot increases this chance. So once you’re near your house, slow down and stick to walking, unless you want your precious garden to be ruined.

, The Flower Fest ends at the dawn of the third monday of April. At the end of the Flower Fest, if you’re lucky enough (or ruthless enough) to win, you’ll get a shiny new Flower Trophy! Check your mailbox in front of your house, and a letter will tell you if you won or not. If you win, you’ll receive the trophy with the letter as well. If you didn’t, don’t fret, you still tried your best and you’ve got a beautiful garden to boot! And there’s always next year to try again!

Run errands.",How to Get Bells in Animal Crossing: Wild World," When you first arrive in your new Animal Crossing town, you'll need to purchase a house, on loan from Tom Nook for around 20,000 bells. Through the game's tutorial, you'll learn how to pay off your home loan, which includes earning and finding bells. Throughout the game, you'll have the opportunity to remodel and expand your house with the bells you earn.;
, The best way to earn bells is by using tools. However, you need bells to buy tools, so you'll need to find a few bells first. The easiest way to find bells is to shake trees for their fruit. Your town's native fruit could be anything from apples to pears, which Tom Nook will buy for 100 bells each. But, if you have a non-native fruit in your town, such as a coconut, those sell for 500 bells. The second option is to find shells, which are located down at the beach.

, As soon as you've earned enough bells, you can buy tools, which will help you earn bells at a much faster rate. You can buy a net to catch bugs and a pole to catch fish, either in the river or at the beach. There are a lot of rare bugs and fish in AC:WW, so search high and low for high bell earners like coelacanths, sharks and Hercules bugs. Note: Most bugs don't come out during the winter, when there's snow on the ground.

, Look for stars in the ground around your town. These star-shaped patterns on the ground contain fossils, gyroids (self-playing musical instruments native to Animal Crossing) or pitfall seeds. Fossils are great to sell if you're not planning on donating them to your town's museum. Gyroids don't earn as much as fossils, but the rare ones earn more.

, Sometimes, when running errands for your little animal neighbors, they can give your about 500 bells or pieces of furniture you can sell to Tom Nook.

Head to Nooks.,
Purchase medicine.,
Apply the medicine.",How to Deal with Getting Stung in Animal Crossing: Wild World1," The fastest way of healing a bee sting is pretty similar to how one would deal with it in the real world—by using medicine. You can get the medicine from Tom Nook’s store for 400 bells.


The location of Nook’s store varies from game to game; however, it can easily be located by looking at the map on the bottom screen and finding the leaf shaped icon.;
, Once you enter the store, simply approach the white bag displayed on one of the shelves, and press the “A” button to talk to Tom Nook, who will ask if you want to purchase it. Select “Yes.”


Although medicine can be purchased every day, you can only get one dose per day. So if you give your medicine to a sick villager, you won’t get another one for that day.

, After buying the medicine, hit the “X” button to open your inventory. Select the medicine with your stylus, and drag it over to your character. After dragging the medicine, your character’s bee sting should automatically disappear.

, Approach your bed and press the “A” button, and you will be asked if you want to “Save and End” or “Continue.”

,


After the game has finished saving, tap “Continue” on the start screen to start up your game again.

, Tap your resting character with the stylus to rouse them. When your character gets out of bed, he/she should be completely healed and bee-sting free."

Go to Tom Nook's and find one there.
At the acorn festival, give Cornimer 150 acorns (find them under trees), and he will give you a 'Mush bed.'
Shake trees, to find furniture and check if it is a bed.;
,, It will ask you if you want to change it, press 'Yes', it will then go to your pockets., Now you can sleep in your new bed!"

Get yourself a fishing rod.,
Know when octopuses are in season.,
Head to the ocean.,
Equip the fishing rod.,
Keep an eye out for large silhouettes.,
Start fishing.,
Be patient!",How to Catch Octopus in Animal Crossing: Wild World," If you still don’t have one, or accidentally misplaced yours, just head on over to the Town Store. It’s one of the main structures in the game and is generated randomly when your town is created. Like many of the other tools, it costs 500 Bells, so make sure you have enough!


Note that if your store is Nook's Cranny, the fishing rod may not be in the store, as Nook's Cranny only sells two tools per day.;
, Since the game runs in real-time, even when shut off, it’s best to keep an eye on dates, times, and seasons, especially if you’re trying to catch a specific fish. Octopuses are generally available from September to January and from March to July, making them available for most of the year. Some fish are only available during certain times in the day, but thankfully octopuses are available in any hour of the day.

, The ocean is always found south of the town proper, and often has an abundance of fish swimming around in it. The ocean is also where you can find your octopuses, as well as assorted other fish, and is often the best fishing spot in the game if you’re just catching fish to sell.

, To do this, press Y to open your inventory. Select the rod with the D-pad and A, or by tapping it with your stylus. Scroll to your character until he or she is highlighted, and drop the rod there. The character’s icon will then be holding the fishing rod.

, There are eight kinds of fish silhouettes: tiny fish, small fish, medium fish, large fish, very large, eel, huge and shark. Tiny and small fish are just about as small as your bobber, medium fish are barely bigger than your bobber, and large fish are just about as long as your character. Eels are very thin, snaky shadows, and both huge fish and sharks are considerably bigger than the large fish. Sharks have a distinctive large fin poking out of the water. In Wild World, octopuses use the large fish silhouette, so make sure to try and catch the larger fish!

, Press A or tap the water to cast your bobber, preferably in front of the fish silhouette you think is an octopus.


Fish are tenacious creatures, so once your bobber goes down, tap the screen or press A as fast as you can to reel it in!

, Octopuses, while fairly common, are still tricky to catch at times if you don’t have the best reflexes. Be patient and don’t be disappointed if you keep catching Sea Bass or other, more common large fish before you find your octopus!

Make space in your letter slots in your mail.,
Talk to Gracie.,
Accept the quiz.,
Take the quiz.,
Check your mail.,
Always pick the first answer to any question.,
Try to answer the way that Gracie would.,
Dress well.,
Have fun trying to answer Gracie.",How to Answer Gracie’s Questions on Animal Crossing: Wild World," Most likely, you will have a free spot open in your letter slots; however, if you don’t, you will need to discard a letter in order to make a free spot. You cannot initiate the quiz with Gracie unless you have a spot open.


To discard a letter, click on it, and then choose “Discard” by pressing “A” over that option.
You need an available letter slot because if you successfully complete a quiz, Gracie will send you a certificate via mail. If there is no room in your letter slots to accept the mail, then she will not even give you the option of taking the quiz (she will also say something along the lines that indicates this).;
, Gracie will visit your town randomly in Animal Crossing, so you will have to check to see if she’s there. If she is in town, she will appear in front of the Town Hall where her car is parked.


Talk to her by pressing “A.”

, There are no prerequisites to engaging in the quiz other than having an open letter slot. So even if this is your very first time encountering Gracie, she should ask you if you want a Fashionista Badge. Choose “You know it!” in order to start a quiz.


If you want to know a bit more about Gracie’s fashion mission to help prepare yourself for the quiz, select “Uhhh…...what?” which prompts Gracie to tell you a little bit about the fashionista check.

, The questions and answer set are always completely randomized. Her response provides the key components she’ll be looking for:


“These brave, immaculately dressed warriors must display exceptional style…and be masters of the accessorizing arts. Oh, and darling, they have GOT to answer one question about true style.”
Gracie’s response indicates that you must wear an outfit that incorporates accessories and matches well within one style, and you have to answer the question to her quiz.

, If you are successful, you will receive the Fashionista Badge in one of your letter slots, and you’ll be able to give Gracie bells on future visits in exchange for potentially rare Gracie items!

, Many players report this as being the most successful method. There is no solid reasoning behind this method other than the apparent results.

, Gracie is a snobbish/snooty giraffe. You can tell by conversation with her that she dislikes small towns and things she perceives to be associated with them. Instead, she likes extravagant and glamorous things.

, The outcome may not be entirely dependent on your answers; as noted above, Gracie is also looking at your outfit, so this theory supports that there is a hidden overall score comprised of both how Gracie values your outfit and how well you answer the questions that determines whether or not you get the Fashionista badge.


To impress Gracie, follow her standards of wearing only clothes that match (i.e., do not wear clothes of different styles at the same time) and by properly accessorizing and incorporating hat or glasses or other items into your outfit.

, Remember, her questions are random; there are no set questions that have set answers. The first two ideas on how to succeed at Gracie’s fashion check often contradict each other, and they often both work. Though results could be random, don’t forget to have fun with the game.


As an example of the randomness, a player uploaded a video to youtube of his interaction with Gracie’s quiz. He does not choose the first answer to every question, yet he does receive the Fashionista Badge, thus directly contradicting the mandate to answer every question with the first choice.
However, other players could encounter the same set of questions, answer all of them with the first choice, and potentially still get the Fashionista Badge.

Place the furniture.,
Change the wallpaper and flooring.,
Admire the view.",How to Change Furniture Themes in Animal Crossing: Wild World," There are various themes available in the game. You can choose a nice blue theme, set up a scientist’s lab, or even make it look like a really swanky cafe! In any case, it’s best if you make sure what you want is exactly the theme you want for your house.


Themed furniture have similar names, so if you liked the look of a certain chair and found yourself kind of happy with the matching table, then you’ll know what set to get.;
, Once you choose your theme, you can reliably gather the furniture for it by looking out for items that share names (blue dresser, blue bed, blue table, etc.). You can gather your furnishings by buying them from the town store. The furniture is displayed in full inside the store.


To buy your furnishings, head over to the town store (located randomly in town in most games and located in Main Street in New Leaf) or Re-Tail in New Leaf, and then walk up to whatever catches your eye and press A. Whoever is running the store will then ask you if you want it. Accept to buy the item.
Rare furnishing costs more, while cheaper or simpler sets cost less. Prices vary for each item, so at the very least, bring 4,000 bells every time you check out the store.

, You can also buy wallpaper and flooring at the town store. They’ll be displayed as a roll of wallpaper and a rolled-up carpet, respectively. Walk up to the flooring/wallpaper you want to buy, and press A. Whoever is running the store will then ask you if you want it. Accept to buy the item.


You can also choose to see what the wallpaper or flooring looks like before buying (it’ll be one of the options in the dialogue).

, If you’re lucky, you can get furniture (and only furniture) from shaking trees. They’ll just drop down on you! You can shake trees (the fruitless ones) by going up to them and pressing A. There are 2 pieces of free furniture hidden in the trees per day. Be careful though! There are 5 Beehives hidden in the trees every day, and you might get stung!

, Sometimes, when you interact with villagers (going up to them and pressing A), they will request some tasks, items, or simply ask you a few questions. If you deliver, they may give you a random item, ranging from clothes, to wallpaper, to furniture.

, Letters appear daily in your mailbox, usually with a tiny blinking icon above it. Once you press A on it, you can see if the letter has a present or not if it has a tiny gift box on the letter icon. To receive the present, go to your inventory, select the letter, then choose “Present.” The gift will be moved to your inventory, and you can open it by selecting it and choosing “Open.” Hopefully you’ll get the furniture, wallpaper or flooring that you wanted.

, Before placing your stuff in your room, try and figure out how you want things to look. Some themes have more furniture in their list, some have less. So depending how big or small your house is, you have to take into account how everything would go. It would be a shame to have a nice theme, but to be unable to go in and out of the house!


Wallpaper and flooring don’t take up space at all, since it just changes the look of the walls and floor.
At the very least, leave a path to the stairs and doorway free from obstruction.

, Once you’ve completed your collection, or at least gathered enough of it to resemble your theme, start decorating! You can place your furniture by going to the area of your choosing and pulling up your inventory (- on City Folk, X in New Leaf, and Y in both the original and Wild World versions). Select your chosen furniture, and then choose “Place in Room.”


You can turn or nudge your furniture around by pressing A, then pressing a direction on the D-pad.
If you don’t like where you placed your furniture, pick it up with B and place it somewhere else! Note that if you put something on top of your furniture, you pick the one on the top first before taking the one on the bottom.

, When selecting your wallpaper and flooring, pull up your inventory and choose “Spread on Wall/Floor,” instead of “Place on Room.” If you select the latter, it will just place the roll of wallpaper or flooring on the floor of your room.

, Once you’re done fixing up the interior, simply take the time to bask in the beauty of your new home theme!


If you chose to join the Happy Room Academy at the start of the game, come Sunday, you’ll get a good rating from them. While the points are simply bragging rights at first, you can get rewards if you gain enough!

Learn to use mini-turbos on straight tracks.,
Choose a Kart.",How to Snake in Mario Kart DS," The mini turbo is the basis of snaking, and when you condense it all down, all snaking really is, is enhanced use of it. First, when going around a corner, press and hold ""R"" to begin drifting. This allows you to take on corners without losing speed. Next, to perform the mini-turbo, press on of the arrows on the D Pad (what you use to steer) back and forth to make the sparks under the back wheels turn blue, and subsequently red. Once they are red, let go for a mini-turbo. It gives you a small speed boost.;
, On long turns, use the mini-turbo over and over to maintain a high speed. In doing this, you are almost snaking, and already using the concept of it to your advantage. Because you're still turning in a certain direction, this is a good way to get comfortable with mini-turbos. Try to fit as many mini-turbos into a turn as possible to further prepare yourself for actually snaking.

, A good course for this is Figure-8 Circuit due to its long, straight, and decently wide track. Do a mini turbo just as you would on a turn. Then once it has been completed, let go of R and quickly steer your car towards the opposite way you were drifting, and hold down R again and do another mini-turbo. If you've done this, you're snaking! Just learn to use more and more in a row until you feel good about it. Once you have been doing it a lot, it becomes second nature and without even thinking you'll suddenly be able to defeat even some of the best online racers.

, If you thought snaking was all about technique, think again. Your kart has a huge impact on how well you snake. Choose a light kart with good acceleration for the best results. Dry Bones karts ""Dry Bomber"" and ""Standard DB"" are famous online for their superior snaking abilities. Avoid using heavy karts.

When you get to the roundabout, don't use the normal exit, keep going round and you will go past lasers and get to another exit. Go through that path minding the thwomp and it will cut off the corner.;
, This only works if you have a speed mushroom. Near the beginning of a lap, there is a gap with a river flowing under it. Use the mushroom to speed over the gap and you will cut the corner. It's also possible to do it with a drift boost, but only certain karts can do this mushroom-less cut.

, There are 2 shortcuts in this race. The first one is when you get to the bridge. Use a mushroom to speed over the water to the dock. The second is over the bridge and behind a crate. You have to use a mushroom because it will slow you down otherwise.

, After the tunnel to the left is a hill and you can use a mushroom to get up that hill. Go across and back down and it will cut the corner. Mind the cars when you come back down to the road.

, This is a racing technique that involves constant mini-turbos, so you're always at a higher speed.

, The best karts for snaking are Dry Bones' karts, Dry Bomber and Standard DB. If you are just beginning, a more balanced kart might suit you better.

, Online matches are a great way to see how you stack up against other racers! Even if you aren't very good at first, be sure to take note of the strategies and techniques used by others so you can use them to improve your game.

Fire your shells at the right time.",How to Improve at Mario Kart DS,";
, There are three ways that you can do this, but the most important way is to hold the A button as soon as two gets as large as possible. If you hold it too early, you'll stall and puff smoke, so be careful. You know if you have a perfect start because your character will accelerate.

, To do this, wiggle the Control-Pad left and right while drifting twice. (You don't need to wiggle the Control-Pad fast. Try to do these around every corner.)

,, Snaking is performing Mini Turbos on a straight road. This helps your catch ahead immensely. (If you want to be a snaker, practice on the Figure 8 Circuit, because it has wide roads.)

, For instance, use Mushrooms to boost across grass or dirt.

, You can do this by dragging things behind you by holding the Left Trigger. This does not work with dragging fake boxes behind you. Drag a Green Shell, Banana, Triple Bananas, or Red Shell.

, Let's say a blue shell was just fired from a racer in 4th place. You'll hear the 'whooshing' sound a blue shell makes as soon as it is launched. You should get yourself ready or start to position yourself for a powerslide depending on how far ahead you are from that racer. The blue shell noise should dissipate briefly. As soon as you hear it again, you should begin your powerslide, or already have the blue sparks appearing. The blue shell noise should begin to pulsate rapidly. By now, you should have the orange sparks. Be ready to release them at no more than a moment's notice because that is what you will have. This is where it gets tricky. The blue shell should be directly overhead by now. You'll be able to see it hovering at the top of your DS screen. Using your peripheral vision, you should be able to see the blue shell suddenly stop at the top of your screen and then begin its descent to the ground. At this point, let go of the 'R' trigger. Press it again to jump and lean into the natural direction of your powerslide. With the proper timing and a little luck, you will successfully dodge the infamous blue shell. Don't let it get to your head though. Just because you did it once, doesn't mean you'll be able to do it again with the same results. Besides, the race isn't over yet! You can also watch the video in Sources and Citations.

, Staying directly behind a driver in front of you for a few seconds will help speed you up a lot. You will see white lines around your driver while you are doing this, signifying the wind is passing above you. Be careful that they don't drop a banana in your face!

, There's a good one on Bowser's Castle! Try to find it.

,, It is also useful to hit your enemies when your Star power-up is activated.

, Fire your Red Shell when you are sure that your enemy in front of you isn't dragging anything behind them that could defeat your Red Shell. If they are dragging a box, feel free to shoot it at them, because the boxes can't stop a Red Shell. Fire your Green Shell behind you when your opponent is trying to Draft behind you.

I highly recommend using our cleaning paste to clean the contacts, it will get rid of all the dirt and corrosion and bring back the contact to a smooth shiny surface. Using the paste, apply a small amount on a Non-Static Cleaning Pad and scrub both the top and bottom side of the motherboard connector. You should see a lot of black dirt and corrosion coming up from the connector - This will continue to come up for quite some time, however in our experience you only need to continue cleaning until both sides of the motherboard connector appear clear of dirt and corrosion. After the Nintendo NES Repair Cleaning Paste has been successfully applied, BE SURE to wipe the motherboard connectors totally clean with a Non-Static Cleaning Pad and some Nintendo NES Repair Cleaning Rinse. Make sure you remove any left over residue from the cleaning paste, and remember to clean and rinse both sides of the contacts by flipping the mainboard over and repeating the process (if you haven't already). Once both sides have been cleaned and rinsed, dry with an unused cleaning cloth., Again, the 72 Pin NES Connector will be a tight fit, so make sure to push it on all the way or it won't make proper contact. From this point, just reverse order and put it all back together. One important note is to make sure the plastic tab at the front of the spring loader snaps in place, underneath the motherboard. If not, you will notice that the spring loader will either become stuck in the locked down position, or will not lock down at all. In any case I recommend testing the unit out with a game to make sure everything works before putting the casing and RF Shield back on.

Your NES game should now work, so put the game into your NES and play.",How to Clean NES Games," If you don't know which cartridges work or not, take your cartridges and try to play them. If some don't work, put them off to the side because we'll be cleaning them later.
, If you've seen the back of an NES cartridge, you probably noticed little screws in there. These are a special type of security screw that require a security bit in order to remove. You can remove those screws in either one of two ways.

The first option is to take a dremel tool and carve a grove in a flat head bit so the prongs of the bit can grip the screw head.
The second is to take a cheap pen you don't use anymore and heat the end with a lighter and press it into the hole once the tip is thick but not liquid.

, Once dismantled, just blow away the dust with the blower, this would make cleaning a lot easier.,, Be sure to only dip one side of the Q-Tip into the window cleaner.

, Rub the side of the Q-Tip with the window cleaner on these contacts. Make sure you rub both sides of the contacts.


Don't go so light on the alcohol at this point. Be sure to wipe away the alcohol before moving on. After that, take your eraser and rub the contacts two to three times. Take a business card and put it between a piece of 800 grit sandpaper and rub the contacts three times in the same direction on both sides.

, This dries off the contacts. If you have a one sided Q-Tip just use another Q-Tip.

, Once you have the contacts dirt-free, put the circuit board back in and reinsert the screws and the game should work normally., You can use the extra window cleaner in the cup for another game, but make sure you use a new Q-Tip.

, Enjoy!

, Right from the git-go you are bombarded with a plethora of stage options. Struggle through them. Find an order that works for you.

, Mega Man games are quite predictable. The first part of the game usually constitutes 8 levels which you can play in any order followed by 4-8 more levels which must be played in order. These levels usually test your ability to implement the equipment you've gathered.

, Throughout the game you will be picking up all sorts of useful items and weapons to help you along. Be familiar with each item in your inventory. Know that E Tanks restore your health to full. Know how your weapons work and use them in the stages.

, These are the keys to your success in a boss room. Most bosses can be extremely predictable if you pay 2 seconds of attention to their pattern. If you know their pattern, you can guess what's coming next and how to respond appropriately. Also, each boss has a weapon that it is weak to, which will be gained from beating another boss. Experiment with your weapons. Some bosses will have multiple weaknesses.

, Explore your environment. Find out new tricks. There can be several ways out of a sticky situation. If you're familiar with your weapons and items and use a little creativity and logic, the impossible becomes possible.

The D-pad controls the direction that the character is moving.

A is for attacks, or sticking out Yoshi's tongue.

B is to jump. Press B three times in a row to do a triple jump.

X zooms the camera in and out. When the camera is zoomed in, you can change the direction you're looking in by using the D-pad.

Y is for dashing.

LT (the left tab button on the back of the DS) turns the camera to the left.

RT (the right tab button on the back of the DS) turns the camera to the right.

RT and LT are used for crouching, when pressed at the exact same time.

RT and B are used for ground pounding, when pressed at the exact same time.;
, Standard mode is all the same controls seen above, but there are two other modes, known as touch mode and dual-hand mode.

In touch mode, you control your character's movements by moving one of your fingers or your stylus across the touch screen. The other movements, like jumping, crouching and attacking are still executed the same way as in standard mode.
In dual-hand mode, you control your character's movements again by using the stylus, and movements such as jumping, attacking, and crouching are done by using the buttons if you are left handed, or the control pad if you are right handed. All camera adjustments are done by using the touch screen, and the LT and RT buttons are not used at all.
If you don't like either of the two methods that aren't standard mode, or are confused by them, then just stick with standard mode.
To switch between control modes, press the Select button on your Nintendo DS and pick your desired control mode.

, Some are required for certain stars, and most you have to unlock at some point in the game. There are also multiple differences between each character:

Yoshi is the character that you start off with when you first begin the game. He has the ability to swallow enemies, as well as breath fire when he obtains a power flower, which can burn ice blocks and kill enemies. However, he cannot punch or kick, so keep that in mind.

Mario is the first character that you unlock after Yoshi, and the only character who can use the Wing Cap and wall jump. His power flower ability causes him to blow up like a balloon, which can be helpful if you want to skip a point in a level.
Luigi is the second character that you unlock in the game. His jumping style is similar to Yoshi's, and his power flower ability causes him to turn invisible, which can be helpful for certain stars in the game.
Wario is the final character that you unlock, and the only one who can break black brick boxes. These black bricks will house certain stars, so you will need him. When Wario obtains a power flower, he turns into metal, which means although he cannot swim, he sinks to the bottom of water, which can be helpful when obtaining certain stars.

, When you turn on your game for the very first time, you'll see a star on the screen that says ""Touch to start!"" However, if you've started the game before, the star will travel around the screen before opening the title screen.

If you want to start the game quicker when the star is traveling around the screen, touch it with your stylus or finger and you should automatically see the title screen.

, There will be three save files to choose from for the game, all of which will be empty if you have a new copy of the game.

If you want to clear an old save file, select ""File Options"" at the bottom the files screen, and then select ""Delete"", and choose which file you would like to delete.
If you want to copy a save file to another file, select ""File Options"" once again at the bottom of the files screen, and select one file. Then select which file you would like to copy the first file to.

, The cutscene is officially complete once Yoshi jumps out of the green pipe, so when you see that, you're free to start the game., When you start the game, you'll walk up to the castle and Lakitu will talk to you. He'll say that you need to find the key to unlock the castle. Know then that there will be a yellow rabbit hopping around in the courtyard. Run after him and catch him by pressing A to stick your tongue out when you're close enough. He'll then give you the key to the castle, and you are free to enter and officially start your adventure., A brief message from Bowser will pop up, but nothing will happen. If you'd like, you can speak to the Toad near the door, and he'll give you some backstory of the game., This is the door to the left that has a star on it, but no number. Jump inside of the painting to be taken to the level-select screen., To do this, make your way to the top of the mountain in this level. A battle with King Bob-Omb will then start up. To beat him, as Yoshi simply eat the Bob-Ombs that he throws at you, and quickly spit them out back at him. Once you do this three times, he will finally cough up your first star., You can either go in and obtain the second star of Bob-Omb Battlefield, or you can move on to the second level, Whomp's Fortress. You can also attempt a secret star level, the Princess's Secret Slide, if you'd like., As you get more stars in levels, more levels should open up, and you'll have a lot more freedom for what you can do. However, note that some stars require certain characters, so if you don't have that character, then you won't be able to get that particular star., In order to be able to even enter the level, you must have Mario unlocked and be playing as him, as well as 8 stars. Once you've met those requirements, head to the giant door with a star on it, which is up the staircase in the middle of the castle and to the left. Once you've opened the door, walk towards the painting, which looks like Princess Peach. As you get closer, the painting changes to Bowser, and a trap door opens beneath you, and you fall into the level. To beat the level, travel all the way through it, and go into the green warp pipe at the end. You will then enter the battle after a brief message from him. In order to beat him, grab him by pressing the A button, then swing him around by drawing circles on the touch screen using the stylus or your fingers. Once you throw him into one of the spikes on the edge of the Arena, you'll have won the battle. Take the key that he turns into, and you'll leave the level., This key will open the door to the basement, which is through the brown door in the castle, with nothing on it, not even a star, and down the stairs that are in there. This will open up multiple new levels for you to try., There are multiple to choose from, with multiple different themes, so play as many of them as you'd like. Once you have achieved 30 stars, you're able to tackle the second boss battle of the game., As said above you need 30 stars to open this door, which looks the same as the door to the first Bowser battle. In case you missed it, when you first walk into the basement, go to the left and you should notice the door. You must again also must be playing as Mario. When the door opens, you should notice a blue portal. In order to officially unlock the second Bowser boss battle, you must get the first star this course, Dire Dire Docks. The first star is pretty easy, and all you have to do is travel through a tunnel that can be found once you go underwater, and find a sub with a Bowser logo on it at the other side of the tunnel. Once you've found it, climb on the sub and obtain the star. Once you have it, you should notice the portal moved back and a hole appeared, jump in this hole to enter the level. Navigate this tricky course until you get to a green funnel looking thing, jump in it and enter the battle with Bowser. The procedure to beat him is the exact same, except now Bowser has added teleportation and moving the arena to his list of tricks. Beat him and he'll give you another key., This key opens that door with a keyhole that you probably noticed at the top of the first castle staircase. This will lead to another room with stairs. Walk up those stairs and enter to find even more levels for you to play through., Once you've reached 50 stars, you will be able to open yet another big star door that you may have noticed upon entering the new area. It is slightly to the right and up another staircase. You don't need Mario for this door to open, however., These are the last levels in the game, and you don't need to jump into typical paintings for any of them. One of the levels, Tick Tock Clock, is found when you jump into a clock that you should see when you first walk into the room, and the two others, Rainbow Ride and a secret star (explained later) level, are found by jumping into holes that you'll find in the two alcove-like areas at the sides of the room. Accessing them might be easier with Luigi or Yoshi because of their flutter jump ability., To do this, you may need to go back to previous levels, but these new levels will also provide you with stars. Once you have 70 stars, you'll be able to open the door to the final Bowser boss battle, which will mean you're one step closer to saving the princess., As stated above, you must have 70 stars, and yet again be playing as Mario. Walk up to the door, and watch the cutscene for a third time, and enter. Begin the ascent up the stairs and you'll see a painting of Bowser, and a hole in front of it. Go in the hole, and you'll be in the final battle. This course is very tricky, but navigate it the best you can, even though it may take you a couple tries. Keep going until you reach the final green warp pipe. Enter it, and you'll be in the final boss battle of the game. Scroll through Bowser's message again and start the battle. The procedure is almost the same, but now he has more tricks, such as jumping and producing electric shock waves, and new fire breathing techniques. Also, you must hit him into spikes three times instead of the usual one. After the second time, he will break the arena into a star, so be prepared. Once you've beat him, collect the final star, and you'll automatically have a wing cap, and fly out of the level and outside the castle. Congratulations, you've beaten Super Mario 64 DS!, These can be annoying, but while they're going, celebrate because you've officially beaten the game., This is a fun, extra sidequest type adventure that you can have.

Each character has their own unique rabbits. Yoshi's rabbits are yellow, Mario's rabbits are pink, Luigi's rabbits are green, and Wario's rabbits are orange. There are also some white, glowing rabbits that can appear when playing as any character, and they're needed to access a secret room in the character selection area (the one with no logo above it), and get a star.

, These are hidden stars around the castle that are needed if you are attempting to obtain all 150 stars.

All ""character unlock"" levels - the levels played to unlock Mario, Luigi, and Wario - have Red Coin stars. There is also a switch star in the Mario Level, a star in the Luigi level which needs to be obtained by grabbing a power flower as Luigi, and going into the boo picture in the last room before the boss, and a star in the Wario level that needs to be obtained by punching a black box as Wario.
All Bowser boss battles have red coin stars as well as switch stars to obtain.
The are two stars in Peach's Secret Slide, located in the right-hand stained-glass window in the character select room. Jump into the window, and you'll get one star for simply beating the slide and hitting the yellow box at the end, and one for beating the slide in under 21 seconds.
There are two stars in the switch tower, located in the foyer. Playing as Mario, step into the painting of the sun, hit X, and use the D-pad to look up. By activating the switch at the center of the level, you'll get a star. You can also get another star by gathering the red coins.
In the minigame room, jump into the painting on the left-hand wall. Collect all 5 silver stars in this level to obtain a star of your own.
In the courtyard, which can be found by following the Boo that you'll see when you enter the first door that leads the basement, kill all the Boos and collect their 8 red coins to obtain a star. Also in the courtyard, head off to the side until you see three red brick blocks. Break them, enter the level and collect the five silver stars. However, be aware that these can be quite hard to obtain.
There are three stars located throughout the castle being held by toads. One is the toad near the pool that leads to Hazy Maze Cave, one is the toad located near the painting for Tall Tall Mountain, and the last one is the toad that is slightly to the right of the clock for Tick Tock Clock.
Located in the castle's moat, make sure that you have lowered the water level for this. Play as Wario, find the black brick, and punch it. Then fall into the hole where the brick was. There are two stars here, one of them can be found by going through a series of platforming, and the other is an 8 red coin star.
In the room for Jolly Roger bay, look to the side, and there should be an alcove. Jump into this to enter an 8 red coin level. Swim through the level and collect all 8 red coins to achieve a star. However, be aware that you won't have an opportunity to come up for air, so make sure you constantly collect coins.
In the room with the mirrors that you go in to unlock Wario, go in as Luigi, and collect a power flower. Go to the other side of the mirror and enter the door to get a star.
In the alcove opposite of the Rainbow ride level, there are two stars to obtain in this secret level. First off, you can get 8 red coins, by playing as Mario and using the wing cap. You can also play as Wario and get a star by shooting out of a cannon to other various clouds in the level.
In behind the waterfall, which is a level that can be accessed through Hazy Maze Cave, there is an 8 red coin star, which can be only obtained by becoming Wario and grabbing a power flower, as well as a star which can only be obtained by grabbing a power flower as Mario, and floating directly up from the spot you got the flower.

, You may notice a map at the bottom of your screen. This map is super helpful when you're obtaining stars as it will show you where they are located. Also, if you talk to a pink Bob-Omb, it will show you where 8 red coins are if you are going for that star., This is important to know in case you forget how much progress you've made. When you've already collected a star, it will appear as a shadow on the map at the bottom of your screen."

If you have not unlocked Luigi, read our article on how to unlock Luigi.;
, You can't get Wario until you can get to the second highest floor of the castle, and you can't get there until you've beaten Bowser a second time. When you defeat him, you'll get the key to the upper floors of the castle.The first Bowser level is ""Bowser in the Dark World."" It's behind the star door on the main floor of the castle. Grab Bowser's tail and throw him into the bombs at the edge of the arena to win!
The second Bowser level is ""Bowser in the Fire Sea."" To get there, you need to fall into the hole in the floor in the same room as the blue portal to Dire, Dire Docks. Once you get the first star in Dire Dire, Docks, the portal will move back, which lets you fall into the hole. Be careful — Bowser has learned a teleportation move and the entire arena will shift from side to side as he jumps around.

, From the castle's front lobby, run up the stairs and open the big door with the lock on it. This will lead you straight to the second floor.

, On the second floor, look for a door with a star on it, but no number. If you're in the right place, you'll be in a room with several different paintings and a large mirror on one wall.


If you're in a cross-shaped room with three copies of the same painting in different sizes, you're in the room for Tiny-Huge Island.Leave and try the other door.

, This power-up is in the mirror room with you. Luigi should now be invisible.

, You should now be on the other side of it! This is why you needed Luigi — the other characters can't get here.

, This will take you to a secret area where you can unlock Wario.

, This level is fairly short, but you still need to make it to the end to have a shot at unlocking Wario. Use the instructions below to make it through in one piece:Go down the slide to the lower platform, then cross the gap to the next platform. Hop onto the moving metal platform.
Hop off onto the ledge. Turn right and go over the gap. You'll be caught by a gust of air and lifted up.
Land and cross the two platforms to the ice pillars. Continue until you reach the other side.
Climb to the top and go into the hole to reach the boss for this level.

, The boss for unlocking Wario is Chief Chilly. To beat him, you need to knock him into the water three times. Avoid falling into the water yourself — like lava, it will damage you on contact.


Chilly is fought basically the same way you fight the Bullies in the lava level. You can walk up to him and punch him, but this makes it easy for him to hit you. Each time you push him into the water, he gets weaker. If you're confident, you can use the tackle (attack while running) to knock him back far. Once he's hanging off the edge, knock him into the water with a normal punch.Once you have beaten him, grab the key that he drops.

, This is the room downstairs where you originally switched to Luigi for this challenge. Enter the door with a W above it. You'll use the key you got from Chief Chilly.


Congratulations! You've unlocked Wario.

, Wario is bulkier than the other characters. All that bulk means that he hits harder than the other characters. You may find that you're able to beat enemies quicker and knock them back farther than normal. This strength makes him a good choice for fighting and breaking things that the other characters can't. He moves the fastest when carrying enemies.On the other hand, Wario is less agile than the other characters, meaning that he moves slower than them and doesn't jump as well, making him a bad choice for exploring new places.

, Wario's special ability is to turn completely metal. This makes him extremely heavy and invincible to enemy attacks. It also makes him sink in water. When he reaches the bottom of a body of water, he'll be able to walk around instead of swimming.


For example, you need to make Wario metal for star seven of Jolly Roger Bay. This lets him walk under the water and through the jet stream so that he can reach the star.

, Wario has a few different moves than other characters that compliment his bulk. Knowing how to use these moves is essential for getting all 150 stars in the game. See below:Press a to give a powerful whack. This allows you to break things other players can't. You can also use Wario's ground pound (done the same way as the other characters) to break things. For instance, you need to do this on star seven of Cool, Cool, Mountain to break the ice on the pond so you can reach the star. He can ground pound posts and signs once rather than two-three times. He is also the only character that can grab signs and throw them.
Wario can knock out opponents slightly longer and grab them. Press A to grab an opponent, then use the Touch Screen in a circular pad to swing them around, then press A again to throw them. This only works in VS. Mode.

Look at the label.,
Check the color.,
Hold it up in the light.,
Look inside the circuit board.,
Look for typos.,
Play the game!,
Check if it should say 'Licensed by Nintendo' or just Nintendo.,
If something on the cartridge is missing, and should be there, then that game is a fake.

,
Check if your game has a battery in it.,
Sometimes a fake game cartridge has trouble fitting in a Game Boy Advance/Game Boy Advance SP/Game Boy Micro.

",How to Tell if a GBA Game Is Fake," Sometimes, the label will be a custom one different from the official one. There are many things that can be altered: the Nintendo loo, the ESRB rating icon, and the Game Boy Advance logo. Search the cartridge on Google Images and compare them.;
, Most GBA games are grey, excluding the label. Some games, like the Pokémon Games, will have a certain colour, whether it is solid orange (FireRed) or green (LeafGreen), or translucent ruby (Ruby), green (Emerald) and blue (Sapphire) colors.

, If there is a small number imprint on the label, it most likely is official. Almost all (if not all) legit games have this. If there isn't, it's a fake.

, There should be a certain copyright text there. If there isn't, it's a fake.

, Mainly check the label, for such errors as Licensed or on the back Nintendo.

, Generally, these fakes won't save properly, and come up with a message when you start it. Pokémon fakes are generally always gonna do this.

, A good example is Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3. Which on the fake says 'Licensed By', but the regular cartridge just has ""Nintendo"" on it.

,, If your game does has a battery inside, it's a fake.

Make your way to the attic.,

Proceed through the maze.,

Head to the character selection room.,
Go into the door with the green ""L"" above it.,
Get a feel for Luigi's features.",How to Get Luigi on Super Mario 64 DS," To get Luigi, you'll need to have Mario unlocked already. There's no exception to this rule — you simply can't get Luigi as Wario, unless you do a glitch, since he's the last character you can unlock. Don't forget to switch to Mario before starting this process if you haven't already done so.


To unlock Mario, you'll need to have eight stars. Jump into the Mario portrait in the room connected to the minigame room as Yoshi, then battle the Goomboss in the level you're transported to. Once you defeat him, you'll get the Mario key.;
, As Mario, head to the castle's courtyard. From the castle foyer, this is located through the plain wooden doors and down the long hallway. You'll know you're going the right way if you see a Boo (ghost) in the hallway. Once you're in the backyard, start killing Boos until one drops a metal cage. Then after you've already beaten the Big Boo, bump into the cage to enter Big Boo's Haunt.


Note that you'll need to collect the first star in Big Boo's Haunt before you can get Luigi. The stairway to the second floor of the mansion (where the entrance to Luigi's level is located) only appears from the second star onward.

, Select the second star (or, if you have access to them, one of the stars after it). When the level starts, run into the mansion in front of you. Climb the staircase to the second floor and enter the door on the far right. You should enter a room with a raised wooden platform and a red ""?"" block.

, Break open the red ""?"" block. Mario should swell up like a balloon and start to float toward the ceiling. Float into the enclave and head through the door. Note that you can press the ""R"" button on the DS to cancel out of the floating move.


In the Nintendo 64 version, getting up here proved quite challenging — many first-timers weren't aware of this door at first and had trouble getting to it once they found it. However, in the DS version, the balloon block makes this much, much easier.

, In the next room, you should see a large portrait of Luigi. You know what to do — hop into the painting!

, After jumping into Luigi's portrait, you'll appear in a room with a large wooden carousel spinning in the center. You've entered Big Boo's Maze! The trick to making it through this maze is to listen near each door for the sound of Big Boo's laughter. The door that it's loudest next to is the door you'll want to go through!


Note that there are eight red coins scattered throughout the maze. Though they're not required, finding all eight will win you a star.

, In each room of the maze, follow the sound of Big Boo's laughter. If you make a mistake (or fall off a cliff), you'll be brought back to the beginning of the maze. Precise directions for the maze are listed below:


From your starting position, enter the door on the right side of the room.
In the next room, carefully run past the eyeball and go through the door on the left side of the room.
In this room, get the ""?"" block if you wish to collect the coins on the ceiling, then head through the door on the right.
Use the platforms to make it to the door on the left side of the room.
Finally, run across the collapsing bridge and use the platforms to scale the wall. Head down the chimney at the top.

, You'll fall into a room with a large mirror in front of you. Run up to the mirror and you'll see Mario's reflection turn into Luigi. After this, a battle with Big Boo will begin. Defeat Big Boo to get the Luigi key! He's not especially difficult, but you'll need to keep an eye on both Mario and Luigi to win.


During the fight, Big Boo will switch back and forth between the reflection in the mirror (where Luigi is) and ""real life"" (where Mario is). When he's in the mirror, attack him with Luigi, and vice versa. Use the same strategy as you use for other Boos — kicks and ground pounds should blow him away when you're behind him. If you look at him, he'll hide his face. Watch out for his fireballs!

, After the fight, you'll get the Luigi key and you'll be transported back to the castle courtyard. With this key, you can finally unlock Luigi. Run back to the castle foyer and enter the character selection room — it's the door on the far right of the top floor.


If you've played the original Super Mario 64, the door you want is the one that led to the Princess's Secret Slide in the original game.

, Now that you have the Luigi key, you can unlock Luigi's door! Go through it and Luigi will come out. Congratulations! You've unlocked Luigi in Super Mario 64 DS!

, Compared to the other characters in Super Mario 64 DS, Luigi has several unique abilities. He's better than the other characters in most ways and worse in some others — you may want to take a moment to play around with him in the castle before proceeding to get a sense for these differences. You might use him the most. Luigi's attributes include:Being able to run on water for several seconds
Being able to do a spinning fall after a backflip (which deals damage)
Being able to Scuttle Jump, which is similar to Yoshi's Flutter Jump, to reach further distances, but not as high
Being able to long jump the farthest
Being tied with Mario on the triple jump height
Being a slightly faster runner than Mario, except on an extra star speed run
Being tied with Mario in power, but moves a little slower when carrying objects
Being the fastest swimmer in the game
Being able to turn invisible and pass through certain substances when he collects his power flower

It can clean off dusty or sandy spots (such as those spots of pollen where those walking mushrooms are at; draw in their pollen with the jar until they turn grey, then hit them with your sword) to reveal things like switches. You can also suck up rocks, pots, mushrooms from far away spots, and certain enemies. From here on out, it will become your best friend and become useful in other dungeons., Take the south door to get a piece of heart., Beat the mushroom enemies and clear away the dust to reveal switches, which reveal chests when pressed.

Go through the door to the right and clear away the dust to get yet another chest with mysterious shells., Go inside the barrel. Roll the barrel until there's an exit on the upper left.

You seem to be stuck, but you're not., Start with the one on the right and continue on until you reach the last one.

Remember to use all of the tools and tricks listed below.,
To make a reference to the book, ""Splinter Cell: Checkmate"", remember the six P's.,
Use thermal vision.,
Use your night vision.,
Consider using electromagnetic vision.,
Plan your move before making it, and mentally rehearse it.,
Have a primary (1st) plan, a secondary (2nd) plan, and a tertiary (3rd) plan.,
Check, double-check, and triple-check your surroundings before moving into action.,
When you're set to go, execute your plan.,
If your cover is compromised and you've been spotted and possibly identified or fired upon, don't panic.,
Know when you have been spotted and how.,
Sometimes an enemy or civilian might move close to you or look near you/in your general direction.,
In Double Agent on the Xbox, you can use the map to help you plan your moves and time enemy movement.,
Use your environment.",How to Play Splinter Cell,";
, Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance. Prior planning can allow you to make quick split-second decisions later on. Don't just dive into an area. Take your time to observe it and analyze the environment. Take note of where you can hide, where you'll be exposed, and where enemies travel. When analyzing your environment, use night vision, thermal, and the electromagnetic vision. Each mode is suited to certain conditions.

, Thermal vision is excellent for identifying laser beams and spotting people quickly. Thermal can spot people regardless of lighting conditions. It's best used for obtaining a quick body count and looking ""through"" a door. In addition to spotting warm bodies and laser beams, the thermal vision can, within a certain range, pick up cameras and light fixtures. This can help you verify the locations of such items.

, The night vision gives you enhanced vision in areas with low lighting. Use it to allow you to distinguish your environment in such cases. This helps you with movement. While this vision mode will be used often, do not rely on it. It is very prone to washouts in moderate and bright lighting conditions. A washout is when your field of view begins to turn white due to excessive light reflection. In the instance of a washout, you will not be able to discern any shapes visually and will effectively be blinded.

, The electromagnetic vision can feel the most cumbersome since it gives you very little information. That ""little"" amount of information is, however, extremely important. It allows you to identify any electronic devices in the area. This includes, and is not limited to cameras and lights. The reason those are mentioned is because they are your greatest electronic threats. Cameras may be difficult to spot due to poor lighting and positioning. Use the electromagnetic vision to determine the location of electronic devices, then use the night vision or regular vision to determine exactly what each device is.

, As you play the game more, you'll get a better feel for what you can and can't do in a certain time span. If your planned action involves shooting several objects or enemies, whether it be lethal or non-lethal, practice the motion of moving from target to target first. When planning, also take into account the consequences and repercussions of your planned actions.

, Sometimes, things just don't go the way you want. If you plan for multiple scenarios, you're less likely to be caught off guard. When planning your secondary and tertiary plans, they shouldn't duplicate the primary plan. Rather, they should branch off of the primary plan. The secondary plan is what you'll fall back to if something happens during the primary plan. The tertiary plan is what you'll fall back to if something happens during your secondary plan.


Sometimes the backup plans may consist of moving to a predetermined hiding location such as climbing onto something, or jumping up and grabbing onto an overhead pipe. They may also consist of direct action against the hostile forces. This may include attacking them with your weapons or with hand-to-hand combat techniques. In the case that you use your weapon, have it equipped for your preference prior to taking action. If you want to use sticky shockers, have the SC-20K set up with the launcher attachment and sticky shockers active before taking action.







, Use the optic cable if necessary before going through a door. Most doors can be ""seen through"" with the thermal vision. When double and triple checking, you needn't take as much time (as the primary check), but you need to check for obvious, and preferably obscure, changes. Quick sweeps around should suffice.

, Don't hesitate during your execution, but don't charge through with your plan if something goes awry or wrong. Be prepared to switch to your secondary or tertiary plans.

, Quickly assess the situation. Enemies will respond more aggressively if they spot you and identify you as an intruder.

, If they spot you, but do not cleanly identify you, they will behave more apprehensively. They will talk to each other and move slowly. Sometimes an enemy will fire at different things it perceives to have moved. For example, if you make something like an aluminum can move just at the edge of an enemy's field of view, he may fire on it out of nervousness. The same goes for you. In such cases and cases where enemies aren't quite sure where you are, but know you're around, they may hit you with a few rounds (bullets). Should this happen, the hits will only be glancing and the damage minimal.


If you are positively identified as an intruder, enemies will work aggressively to neutralize you. They will take cover and open fire on your position. They will also yell various things at you rather than talk to each other. If they hit you, their shots will be direct hits and cause significant damage to you.






In either situation, it is possible to avoid returning fire altogether depending on certain things. If you're backed into a corner with nowhere to go, then you have to return fire, either lethally or non-lethally. If you're in the shadows, you can move to a different location and avoid further damage and having to return fire. Enemies will remain on alert in this situation.







, Don't assume that they know where you are or that they've seen you as this can cause you to take action when not necessary, but prepare for the event that they do.

, While it won't give you 'real-time' information on enemy movements. It will let you map out the different movement patterns and find openings. Think of it as a loose ""connect the dots"". Every time the map refreshes, a dot is made. Connect each of the dots to get the entire picture for each enemy.

, Use the split-jump in narrow corridors to avoid being trapped. Be open to the ideas of hanging off ledge and hiding behind objects to avoid detection.

Find a canteen.",How to Play Unturned," It can be found on Steam for both Windows and Mac OS X, and downloadable for free. Simply follow the Steam client's instructions and it should be installed fairly painlessly.
, For example, you can select your preferred hand, hit marker colors and graphical options. Browse through and customise the game to your preferences.

The higher the graphics are, the slower your computer will run the game. If you have just a modest PC, it is recommended to keep the graphics at an average level.

, This can be done by clicking ""Play"" at the main menu, then clicking the ""Survivors"" button. You can change the face, hair, hair colour, beard and skin tone to a few different options. You may change your name and your skillset. Skillsets each grant two skills to cost half the experience, and will remain fully when you die. They will also determine the clothes that you will spawn with in single-player mode.

You and other players' skillsets can be seen by pressing ""M"" in-game and viewing the small icon near their name.
Buying the Gold Upgrade, which costs $4.99 USD, will grant you access to many more customisation options, but this is not necessary to gameplay.

, This will teach you the basic skills, such as shooting, driving and fishing, and the default controls. Once you have the hang of this, you can move on to the real game., Blood, hunger, thirst, immunity, stamina and oxygen should all ideally be at 100% for easy survival, but they probably won't remain full for long. Most of these bars will cause your blood to decrease upon reaching 0%., Pretty much anything that can harm you in real life will harm you in the game. Once your blood reaches 0%, you're dead. Medkits, dressings, vaccines and many other items will increase your blood. Your blood will also begin to increase when your hunger, thirst and immunity bars are all at a minimum 90%, Once either bar reaches 0%, you will begin losing blood, so keep it up with food and drinks. Some foods will increase only one bar, but some watery foods, like lettuce and corn, will increase both., Once this bar reaches 50%, it will begin slowly decreasing, and once it reaches 0%, you'll begin losing blood. Getting hit by zombies and drinking dangerous liquids will decrease your immunity. Use things like vaccines, antibiotics and vitamins to increase your immunity., Sprinting, jumping and special attacks will decrease your stamina, and you can't perform these movements if you don't have enough remaining. Adrenaline can be used to immediately return your stamina bar to full., Oxygen decreases quickly while underwater, and decreases slowly when you have been at high altitude (i.e. flying an aircraft) for an extended period of time, and running out will result in a quick loss of blood. Standing on the surface will restore your oxygen quite quickly., Shops specialise in different things, and will contain different items to others. For example, food and drink is found in grocers, medicine is found in hospitals and guns are found in gun shops., Military bases and convoys (trails of destroyed military vehicles) are likely to contain powerful ranged and melee weapons. At Summerside Military Base in PEI, for example, you can find Maplestrikes, frag grenades and Desert Falcons, powerful items which cannot be found in civilian locations., Fishing is a quick way to get nourishing food, as long as you have the skill and the patience.

Be sure to cook the fish at a campfire, as eating raw seafood will lower your immunity to disease.

, They can be found in campgrounds and farms, and will allow you to collect water from most water sources as many times as you want.

If the water is unclean, do not drink it as it will drastically lower your immunity. Use purification tablets to clean the water and make it safe to drink.

Power off the Xbox.",How to Mod an Xbox1," This piece of software cracks open the Xbox’s programming and gives you full control. Because of the legal gray-area that console modding exists in, these files are not easily found through websites. Instead, you’ll need to connect to IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and download the files directly from the community with an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client.


Download an IRC client. mIRC is the most widely-used client. After installing, you will be prompted for a Nickname and Alternative when you first start the program. Select any name you want, but avoid using any real names.
After selecting your name, you will be greeted with a blank console. Type “/server irc.efnet.net” and press Enter. This will connect you to a chat server. A list of rooms to join will open; close this window.
In the console type “/j #xbins” and press Enter. This will take you to a chat room for the Xbox modding community. On the right will be a list of all the users in the channel. Towards the top, you should see a user named “xbins”.
Type “/msg xbins !list” in the channel’s console. This will open a private message with xbins, which is an automated messenger. You will receive a private message containing login info for the FTP server. Keep this window open.;
, FlashFXP or FileZilla are two of the more popular clients. Once you are in the FTP program, click the Connect or Quick Connect button.


Login to distribution.xbins.org with the username and password provided by xbins. The port should be set to 21 by default. This login information works once, so if you get disconnected you must message xbins again.
You will see a list of folders in the right frame of the program. Navigate to /XBOX/Console Based Applications/exploits/_Packages/Softmod Installer Deluxe/. Browsing through folders using FTP is much like navigating folders on your computer.
Download the Softmod.Installer.Deluxe.v2.0.Xbox-Hq.rar file. Drag it from the right frame to the left frame to download it. Open the .rar file with WinRAR. The archive contains several different files. For this process, you will need SID.Splinter.Cell.v2.0.NTSC.Xbox-Hq.zip and SID.Splinter.Cell.v2.0.Xbox-Hq.zip. These are save game files that will act as the installer for the new dashboard.

, Plug the Pro Action Replay into your computer and install the necessary software. Insert your Xbox memory card into the Pro Action Replay. You can now access the contents of the card from your computer.


Click and drag the .zip files onto the Xbox memory card.
Remove the memory card from the Pro Action Replay and insert it into the Xbox. Copy the gamesaves from the Xbox memory card onto the Xbox’s internal hard drive. There should be two save files that need to be copied. One is 4 blocks and the other is 489 blocks. You will need both on your Xbox’s hard drive to proceed with the installation.

, Splinter Cell is an exploitable game that allows custom software to be loaded through it. This process will not work with Pandora Tomorrow or Chaos Theory; it must be the original version of the game.


From the Main Menu, select Start Game. In the Profiles screen select “Linux”.
In the Load Check Point screen, select Check Points. Selecting Levels may cause the system to crash.
The screen will turn black and a few seconds later you will see the UnleashX intro screen, followed by the control panel.

, Do not turn off the console during this process, or your machine will most likely become useless. When the status bar disappears, the installation process is finished.

, Included in the Softmod install are two different custom dashboards, Evox and UnleashX. Both have the same basic function, so install whichever appeals to you more.


There are other dashboards available online. Be sure to check reliable sources. The #xbins IRC channel that you connected to earlier has a wide variety of homebrewed dashboards and applications.

, Once the install of the dashboard is complete, you need to turn off and restart the Xbox. If the installation was successful, you will see your new custom dashboard instead of the Xbox dashboard.

Understand that softmodding an Xbox 360 is a significantly more complex process.,
Flash your 360’s DVD drive.,
Disassemble the Xbox 360.,
Attach the DVD drive to your computer using a SATA cable.,
Flash the drive through Windows.",How to Mod an Xbox2," Due to the extreme number of variances between models, it is highly recommended that you research how the process will work for your specific model. These steps will give you a basic rundown of the process.

, To mod a 360, you will have to load custom firmware onto the DVD drive that is installed in your console. Changing the firmware on the DVD drive is referred to as “flashing.” This will allow the drive to read burnt discs.


To flash the DVD drive, you have to identify which drive you are using. There are 4 different vendors for the 360 DVD drive: Samsung, Hitachi, Benq, and Lite-on. Samsung disc drives have long notches cut out of the center opening of the tray. Hitachi trays have several small holes and two distinct small notches in the center opening. Benq and Lite-on have the same tray with a smooth center opening.
To differentiate between a benq and Lite-on drive, you have to pop out the bezel located in the front and center of your console, right underneath the disc drive. If you see white wires then it’s a Benq; if you see yellow wires then it’s a Lite-On. If the Xbox is from before April 2008, then it is a Benq as Lite-on was not introduced until then.
From the 4 vendors there are 12 different models of disc drive, each requiring slight variations in the process. Samsungs are the most simple to flash, Lite-ons in general are the most complex.

, In order to flash the drive, it will need to be connected to a PC. To get access to the drive so that you can do this, you will need to take apart the 360.


Remove the front panel first by turning the 360 upside vertically and pulling the panel out from the bottom.
Remove the vent plates on both ends of the console. These are attached with tabs that have to be popped out one at a time. Gently pull on the plates while releasing the tabs.
With the plates removed, lay the 360 upside down. Remove the bottom place by pressing in the tabs around the console.
Once the plate is removed, undo the screws from the steel chassis. Turn the 360 back over and remove the top plate. You can now access the DVD drive.

, Most computer SATA ports are located inside the case, physically attached to the motherboard. You will need to open your computer to run a cable from the 360 DVD drive to your SATA port.


The DVD drive will need to be powered in order to flash. While you can run the power from the 360, this is not recommended, as the 360 logs each time that the system powers on with no DVD drive connected. This will most likely lead to your console being banned.
Since the power connector is not a standard one, you will need an adapter that will let you connect your PC power supply to the 360 DVD drive.

, There are multiple ways to flash a drive, including command line prompts. The easiest way is to download and run JungleFlasher which combines all the different flashing methods into one program that runs through Windows.


Be sure to follow the guide available on the JungleFlasher website so that you perform the correct flash according to your DVD drive model.

Creating a full game engine from scratch can take years, so most independent developers use an existing engine. You'll only need to follow one of the following steps in this section, depending on how comfortable you are with programming and how much time you want to spend on the little details.;
, These tools require very little programming knowledge, so they may not be for you if you're interested in the coding aspects of game-making. On the other hand, a simple dive-right-in approach could teach you a lot about your game, and let you tweak the higher-level concept before you move on to a larger prototype. Here are several free options:


For mobile games, try MIT App Inventor or Game Salad
For browser games, try Scratch, or the more serious version Snap! intended as an introductory programming tool
For adventure games, use Visionaire.
If you want a drag-and-drop program with the option to delve into coding as well, try the free version of GameMaker

, This is a great option for getting your hands dirty, getting game-coding experience without having to start completely from scratch. Many professional independent game developers start at this level. While there are many engines and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) available, the following are free and relatively easy to learn:


For mobile games: ProjectAnarchy
For 3D games on any platform: Unity
For more advanced coders: LWJGL (based in Java), SFML (based in C++)

, If you already have some programming knowledge and are dead set on building your own engine, here are a few places to get started. If this is your first attempt, you'll likely need tutorials


ActionScript will let you make a Flash-based engine. This is a good place to start for intermediate programmers.
Java is relatively simple to learn. You'll need a Java Development Kit (JDK), plus Eclipse or another Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java. If you're not sure how to get started.
If you already know a programming language (especially a C language or Python), look for an IDE for that language. It should include a compiler and the ability to easily work on graphics, audio, and other code in the same project.

, If you are up to the challenge and chose one of the advanced tools in the previous step, you will most likely need to find a tutorial, a help forum, or an experienced game developer for advice specific to your language. If you're not sure where to start or what to ask about, here are a few basic components you'll need to build early on:


A client-side server, which interprets user input and processes the result. Make the input system responding correctly before you put serious work into graphics and gameplay. (Try researching ""action listeners"" if you're stuck.)
AI for other characters, so they react to the user's actions. For a simpler project, just have the characters move and act in a set path.
Ability to render graphics (put together and send instructions to the graphics card).
A game loop that runs constantly while the game is executed. This should take user input, process it, process other game logic (such as enemy movement, background animation, and triggered events), calculate what needs to be drawn (displayed on screen), and send the information to the graphics card. Run this at least 30 times per second (30 fps) if your system can handle it.

, Spend a good amount of time nailing down what your game is before you touch a line of code. What genre is it? Is it 2D or 3D? Does the player progress in the game by solving puzzles, following/creating the story, fighting enemies, and/or exploring? The more questions you answer and the more detail you give your ideas, the more time you'll save in the long run. If you decide to make a major change after you've already started coding, the change can take many times longer to implement.


Pare this down to something way, way simpler than your original idea. A small prototype that explores how your game works and gives a couple levels to play is an excellent start. Once it’s finished, you can use it as a foundation to expand into a full game, or incorporate what you learned into a new project.

, At this point, there are weeks or months of hard but rewarding work ahead of you. While a team of people will generally divide up the tasks below and work on them simultaneously, an individual will have to decide which task is easiest to start with or most important at each stage. Read through all the steps below and start on the task that appeals to you most.

, Unless you're making at text-base game, you'll need 2D images, and possibly 3D models and textures (patterns you apply to the models). Music and sound effects you can delay until a bit later in the process, but they are highly recommended if you plan to publish your game. Simple icons, user interface, and fonts are lowest-priority when your game is young, but a little effort here can greatly improve the player experience.


There are many places to find free or cheap art assets online. Try this list at makeschool.com.
Hiring an artist will make a big difference. If you can't afford to, gather the assets yourself and show the result to artistic friends or post it to game development or art forums online for advice.

, Much of this will be written as planning documents outside the game code itself, although a story-based game may need to include branching dialogue trees. Even a game without a traditional story should have a sense of progression that you need to plan around. A platformer could involve a series of movement and weapon upgrades, while a puzzle game might add more features as it ramps up the complexity and difficulty of the puzzles.

, Start with a small, simple level or area. Focus on constructing the path the player takes through the level, then add side paths (optional), more detailed graphics, and tweak the difficulty (such as by adjusting platform heights or moving enemies around).


Use light sources and item drops to guide the player to the next spot in the area. Use shadows to discourage players from entering dead-ends or awkward paths, and use enemies for both purposes (depending on how the game teaches you to bypass enemies). A well-designed area makes the player feel like he is making his own decisions or exploring, but guides him along the most straightforward route using subtle clues.

, This is not necessary if you are using simple game-making software. If you are willing to delve into the deeper end of graphics systems, you can start by creating shaders and particle effects, or going through the graphics code and removing tasks that are unnecessary for your game. Because graphics are almost always the choke point that determines processing speed, even a 2D game usually goes through significant optimization tweaks and rewrites in order to minimize the burden on the graphics card and processor.

, Once you have a simple level or a prototype of gameplay, have your friends play the game and offer feedback. Find out what people think is fun, and what frustrates them. Later on in the process, when the game is more polished, feedback from strangers or acquaintances can be an excellent source of honest advice, as they are less invested in your success or encouraging you.


Players are not trained to offer feedback from a developer's perspective. If players dislike an aspect of the game, there's usually something about it that could be improved... but the specific suggestions the players make are often not useful. Ask them very specific questions to discover the exact features that bother them.

, You'll want a good video card It is needed for newer games to operate well. For Nvidia, go for a GTX 700 series.

, You'll want to save as much as you can on the case. Just make sure that the case has enough room for air-ventilation to prevent overheating.

, Western Digital, Seagate and Samsung hard drives are the most widely-used ones. Depending on your needs, 1TB with 7200RPM should be enough for an average gamer considering most games range from 5-30 GB of storage.

, ASUS, Gigabyte, EVGA, XFX and plenty more are out there. Just make sure it is fully compatible with your CPU and video card.

You can get to the home screen at any time by pressing the Xbox button on your controller or by saying, ""Xbox, go home."", On the home screen, scrolling right should reveal the Friends hub. Select the ""Friends"" tile to proceed.

, Input the gamertag of the user you want to add to your friends list. Be careful of spelling and spacing mistakes — errors can make it tricky for Xbox to find the person you're looking for.


You need to know users' gamertags to be able to find them on Xbox Live — unfortunately, you aren't able to search by real names, personal information, and so on.

, When you find the profile of the user you want to add, select it, then select ""Add Friend."" This will send them a request which they are able to accept or decline at their convenience.


Sending someone a friend request will make you their follower and they will be able to see the profile information you have set to display to friends. However, you will not be recognized as friends until they accept your request., Adding a friend on an Xbox 360 is just as easy as on an Xbox One, but the process is slightly different because of differences in the consoles' interfaces. Start by signing in to Xbox Live., From the main Xbox Live screen, select the ""Social"" option. Next, select ""Friends.""

, On the ""Friends"" menu, select ""Add Friend."" Use the on-screen keyboard (or, if you wish, a USB peripheral) to type in the gamertag of the user you want to friend. Select ""Done"" when finished.


Once again, you'll want to be careful to get the spelling and spacing in the gamertag correct.

, After finding the profile of the user you want to add, you can write a short message explaining your friend request or simply use the default message provided.


When you're finished, select ""Send Request"" to finish and send your friend request.

, Inviting people to be your Xbox Live friends with the steps above is easy — actually making and keeping friends in your games can be a little more challenging, however. There's no nice way to put it: for a variety of reasons, online game communities, including Xbox Live, tend to attract jerks. Your best bet at building a good circle of online friends is to separate yourself from these jerks by behaving like a class act while you play. The best way to do this is simply to follow the Golden Rule: treat others the way you'd want them to treat you!


Below, you'll find tips for what to do and what not to do on Xbox Live. Keep in mind that all of these suggestions are just specific applications of the Golden Rule.

, Playing a game on Xbox Live should be something that players can do to relax — not to argue, fight, or threaten each other. The quality of the in-game conversation can determine the enjoyment of the game for everyone playing, so do your best to keep things lighthearted and fun so that everyone can enjoy themselves. Think: would you be likely to accept a friend request from someone who went out of his way to start an argument during a game? Probably not.


Good conversation topics:
Funny stories and jokes
Strategies for the game being played
Gaming in general
Pop culture (movies, music, etc.)
Casual, good-natured trash-talking
Bad conversation topics:
Controversial political issues
Racial and religious issues
Morbid/obscene stories
Bashing the worst player in the game

, While immature players may get upset when you beat them, the sorts of Xbox players that are worth befriending won't ever put you down for being good at the game. Being a competent player marks you as a valuable person to have in the game — people on your team will want you on their team again and people playing against you will (usually) respect your ability.


This doesn't mean that you should stress out about having a perfect record. In fact, having a loss-free record can be a sign of a cheater — almost everyone loses some games.
On the other hand, if it's obvious after a few games that you're not a great player, simply make an effort to improve over time — wise players will respect that you're trying your best.

, No one is born a great gamer — everyone was once a ""noob."" Don't be harsh on players who aren't yet as skilled as you. Instead, make an effort to help them learn from their mistakes. Though they may not improve immediately, you're helping a new player get enjoyment out of the game (and, if this player is on your team, improving your chances for winning!) Making fun of this player helps no one.


One common way that new players get bashed in online games is as follows: an unskilled player joins a game and immediately makes a few rookie mistakes or gets herself killed. The other players on her team, now at a disadvantage, complain to everyone in the game that they have a noob on their team and can't possibly win. Especially sore losers may even ""rage quit"" the game in disgust. Don't be like this. Getting partnered with players who aren't very good is part of the online gaming experience. Make the best of a bad situation by helping this player get better.

, No one like losing. Everyone likes winning. This doesn't mean that losing has to be a humiliating experience or that winning has to be an opportunity to rub your success in your opponent's face. Xbox Live players who want to get friends should make a habit of being polite and dignified no matter how well or poorly they do. This doesn't mean you can't celebrate a win or complain about a loss — just that you shouldn't be a jerk about it!


If you win, do:

Offer your opponents a friendly ""good game,"" compliment any good plays they made.
Don't:
Gloat about how great you played, tell your opponents that they played like amateurs, spend lots of time breaking down every mistake your opponents made.
If you lose, do:

Offer your opponents a friendly ""good game,"" compliment any good plays they made.
Don't:
Complain that your opponents cheated, blame the loss on your other teammates, use obscene insults.

, No matter how well you behave on Xbox Live, eventually, you'll run into a player who is just a rude, name-calling, inconsiderate jerk and who doesn't care at all about it. It may be tempting, but it's a bad idea to use the same sort of behavior as this player to get back at him — you may earn a bad reputation for yourself in the process. When in doubt, remember the old saying: ""Never argue with a fool. From a distance, you can't tell who's who.""


It's also worth noting that retaliating against an annoying player can be considered a breach of XBox Live's code of conduct.If a player is being so rude or troublesome that it's impossible to enjoy the game, simply leave and encourage other players to do the same. If no one will play with the abusive player, he can't enjoy the game, so he loses. You may also want to report this player if he was breaking the code of conduct. Click here for the complete document.See also our article on dealing with annoying XBox Live players.

, Almost everyone has gotten so involved in a heated competition that they've said or done something they later regretted. Don't let a video game ruin your day or someone else's. While games are usually most fun when everyone does their best, they're not life-and-death situations. Unless you're actually participating in a pro gaming competition, whether you win or lose won't affect you personally in any way unless you let it.


If you feel your adrenaline levels rising, wait for a good opportunity to stop playing, then turn off your Xbox, take a few deep breaths, and go do something else. Games exist to provide entertainment, not to be sources of stress, so if you're stressed out about one, that game isn't a good choice for you to play right now.

, In online games, ""trolls"" and ""griefers"" are players who get enjoyment out of ruining the game for other people. They may do this in many ways: deliberately refusing to play by the rules, spouting offensive images or messages, ruining other players' progress, and much more. It may seem like it goes without saying, but if you're looking to make friends, don't be like this. Most serious players hate trolls (especially when they're in a game with one.)


Note that deliberate trolling is a violation of the XBox live code of conduct and that repeated violations can result in suspensions and bans., Playing against someone who's more skilled than you can be a challenge, but playing against someone with an unfair advantage just isn't very fun. No one likes to play with cheaters (except, sometimes, other cheaters), so this sort of behavior won't win you many friends. Imagine, for instance, that you're playing the latest Call of Duty game and you get killed over and over again by someone who has hacked his game to make his character invisible. Would you want to play with this person again? Of course not.


The XBox Live Code of Conduct defines cheating as using ""unauthorized hardware or modifications,"" exploiting ""game vulnerabilities or glitches,"" and much more.

, It's joke that's a bit of a cliché today, but it's often true: give a pre-teen player a microphone and drop him into a heated online game and he'll suddenly have the mouth of a full-grown sailor. Insults, threats, slurs, and bad language are unfortunately common in XBox Live games even though this behavior is against the code of conduct.Luckily, it's easy to mute and ignore these sorts of players, which means that if you become abusive, this can quickly happen to you, ruining your chances of making friends.

, When it comes to making friends and enemies in online games, sometimes it's not what you say, but how you say it. It's natural to get a little excited about a competitive game. However, if you're playing with a headset, it's important to remember that there's a microphone an inch from your mouth and that anyone else with a headset has tiny speakers pressed against their ears. Try to avoid frequent shouting, cheering, or screaming — this is a good way to get yourself muted or kicked from the game, which will ruin your chances for making friends.


If you're playing a close game with a large group of people on voice chat that's coming down to the wire, some sort of noise at the end of the game is almost inevitable — who wouldn't be excited about a last-second win? Try to make the distinction between reasonable noise and annoying noise. For instance, it's OK to give a ""whoo!"" after an amazing victory. It's not OK to scream every time you die (as many hilarious YouTube videos can attest, yes, some people actually do this.)

, Online games are supposed to give everyone an equal opportunity to relax and have a good time. Making them inhospitable to other people because of things they can't control isn't just something that will lose you potential friends — it's outright wrong. Don't insult other players for aspects of their personal identity, use hate speech, or promote hateful violence on XBox Live. This behavior will instantly mark you as a bad apple to any sensible players in your game (and is grounds for a ban or suspension.) Just a few things that don't affect a person's ability to play XBox games include:


Race
Nationality
Language
Gender
Orientation
Religion

, The best way to learn how to draw is to do it.


You can take classes at a local art school to develop your skills, but you can also teach yourself through observation, reading and practice.
It's a good idea to study anatomy and exterior settings so you understand the basics before trying to animate them, as every animation starts with a sketch, which is then scanned into the computer and developed in Photoshop before going through the animation process.

, For example, many universities in the United States, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), are now offering video game courses as part of comparative media studies or software engineering.

,


Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are essential 2-D programs to develop characters, while 3ds Max and Maya are some of the most popular 3-D modeling programs.
You can teach yourself by means of tutorials from sites such as Computer Arts, or you can take courses to learn how to use the software. There are also animation certificate programs that last between 6 months and 2 years.

,


A concept artist comes up with original ideas for settings and characters.
A 2-D animator takes the concept artist's sketches and creates 2-dimensional animation from them.
A 3-D animator takes the work a step further and adds the modeling and building to create 3-D animations.
A 2-D texture artist creates all of the different textures used in a video game, from the hairs on a characters head to the scales on a reptilian character.

, Your portfolio should consist of a number of different designs or creations, and if possible, demonstrate their use in video games. You can save your files on a CD-ROM, a website, or both, so long as you can provide potential employers with samples of your work upon request.

You can also consider taking a course in Microsoft Visual Basic that teaches you to learn programming for Windows operating systems.

, You’ll encounter several problems; you should develop an attitude to solve these problems in a calm and composed manner.

, Do practice as much as possible to get into the programming mode. Start with basic level games and then move on when you achieve perfection in that level. Take help of books, online tutorials to develop your skill and achieve mastery in programming.

, So you can also get some summer learning on video game programming as well.

, Try to look for local programmers in your area. If you do not know any local programmers, try to contact these programmers that are able to help:

Decide between school and self-taught.,
Choose your major carefully.,
Learn computer languages.,
Design your own game.,
Narrow down your focus.",How to Become a Game Developer1," Expect employers to value technical know-how most of all. So don’t fret if the cost of tuition for higher education is beyond your means, because a degree isn’t strictly necessary to find employment. At the same time, though, recognize that technical proficiency coupled with a degree will probably make you stand out over other candidates.Whichever route you choose, put all your emphasis on becoming a proficient programmer. Coasting will only leave you ill-equipped for interviews and the job in question.;
, If you decide on college, be wary about specialized degrees in game programming. Expect these to cover all of the many different aspects of game programming in a relatively short amount of time. Favor a major in Computer Science instead if you aren’t already proficient in the subject.Each aspect of game programming takes a lot of time to master. Studying computer science in depth is more likely to equip you with the necessary skills to tackle each one, even if those skills aren’t directly applied to games during the course of your studies.
If you do consider a specialized degree, research the people who are teaching it. Professors who understand the concepts of game programming, but who have never worked in the field themselves, may not be the best people to learn from.

, Whether you go to school or teach yourself, aim to master at least one computer language. Focus on C++ to increase your chances of being hired, since this is used the most often in game programming. Other languages that are helpful include:Actionscript
Assembly
C
Java
Objective-C
Python
Swift

, Remember: the best way to learn how to do something is to actually do it! Once you learn how to code in computer languages, apply your skills. Build a game from the ground up to grow more familiar with the whole process, from start to finish. As you do, you should:Keep it basic. Don’t worry about revolutionizing games as you know it. To make an analogy, write a simple short story, not James Joyce’s Ulysses.
Copy another game if needed. The purpose here is to learn, not to be original. Borrow another game’s concept and build on it if you’re stuck for ideas.
Do everything yourself. Don’t rely on using outside vector/math libraries. Make all aspects a DIY project in order to increase your proficiency.
Finish it! You want to grow familiar with the whole process, so follow through all the way to the end. Don’t abandon it just because you’ve already finished your favorite aspect of programming.

, Remember: as a professional game developer, you’ll be part of a team tasked with specific aspects. So as you learn to code and build your own games, decide on which areas you want to concentrate on when hired. Once you do, continue to work on personal projects and place more attention to these areas.Titles and departments may vary from company to company, but generally programming is divided between: artificial intelligence; animation; audio; build systems; engines; gameplay; networking; physics; rendering; tools; and user interface.

Intern first.,
Have demos ready.,
Focus on start-ups at first.,
Research each company you apply to.,
Network.,
Make the most of failed interviews.",How to Become a Game Developer2," Before you apply for a paid position, put in some time with an unpaid one. Search online or through your school for open internships. Gain working experience to bolster your resume when it comes time for the job hunt. Other benefits of an internship include:References from industry insiders.
Extended contacts with people in the field.
More familiarity with the day-to-day reality of the job.

, Since you don’t have any published games to point to, prepare some examples on your own to submit along with your cover letter and resume. Continue developing personal projects and publish them online in a public Git repository where employers can check them out. Don’t worry about creating whole games. Instead, develop short-and-sweet demos that highlight the specific areas that you want to specialize in.Whatever your demo might be, make it perfect. Don’t try to wow interviewers with something overly complex if you can’t get it right. Showcase something simple and flawless instead.

, This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t apply to positions with established, well-known, successful companies. However, such companies are better situated to offer higher pay and possibly more job security, so expect your competition here to be pretty fierce. Concentrate instead on newer, smaller companies, who, like you, probably have to be less choosy.This isn’t a guarantee that you’ll get hired, but you’re less likely to be up against programming rockstars with way more experience than you.

, First of all, look for job postings on company websites. Then, after you submit an application, brush up on the company. Read their own published profile, as well as any write-ups from outside sources. Jot down any questions that occur to you so you can pose them in your interview.In addition to your technical skills, demonstrating a working knowledge of both the company and the game business at large in your interview should raise your standing among other candidates., Expect to face a lot of competition for each position. Use each and every personal connection that you have with industry insiders to get a step ahead. Find out about potential openings before they’re posted. Ask your contacts to provide recommendations if they have an inside track with employers. Extend your network by:Reaching out through online forums, social media, and professional networks to meet people in the field.
Staying in frequent contact with current or former classmates and professors.
Attending conferences and conventions.

, First of all, keep in mind that with so much competition, you’ll probably face a lot of rejection. Accept it as a given, take it in stride, and learn from it by:Reflecting on your interviews, resume, and demos to identify and improve weak points.
Following up with a thank-you letter or email to interviewers for being considered at all.
Asking for pointers on areas in which they think you need improvement.

Love games.,
Expect a long road ahead of you.,
Don’t do it for the money.,
Anticipate a heavy emphasis on math.,
Be a team player.,
Be flexible about location.",How to Become a Game Developer3," Keep in mind that programming can be a demanding and stressful field to work in, as well as a difficult career to break into. It will require a lot of passion on your part, so take stock of just how much you have. Muster up every last drop that you can in order to succeed., Value patience and persistence. Plan on taking a few years to acquire the necessary technical know-how, either on your own or through formal education. Then, when you’re ready to enter the workforce, expect a lot of competition for each opening, which means it might take a while to find work. Then, once hired, anticipate having to do a lot of grunt work before advancing to your desired position., If you go the formal education route, bear in mind that its cost will probably exceed a game programmer’s average yearly salary by a pretty hefty amount. Also keep in mind that the field lacks job security, which means you may have gaps in your employment. Again, this career definitely requires you to be passionate about it, so do it for the love, not a quick buck., Expect most, if not all, aspects of game programming to require strong math skills. If you’re still in school, double down on your math courses. If you’re out of school and need to brush up, definitely do so.Obviously, taking math courses is a great way to strengthen your skills. But perhaps even better for the aspiring game developer are the multitude of math games available for download. Kill two birds with one stone and explore games that you may not have otherwise sampled.

, Before you enter the field professionally, you should spend a lot of time developing programming skills on your own. But don’t grow too accustomed to working solo. Once hired, expect to become one member of a much larger team. Prioritize clear communication and the ability to accept criticism as two essential skillsets., Depending on where you live, this may not be as much of an issue. But if your hometown isn’t already a booming tech haven, be willing to move to where the work is. Also remember that job stability is pretty iffy, which means you may have to relocate again for a new job."

Find some games you REALLY don't want.,
Sell games online.,
Have a garage sale.,
If your games are very old, DO NOT sell them.",How to Sell Video Games for Cash," Then find some gamers around your neighborhood and try to make some deals with them. If they are very picky try to give them some lower deals. Don't make the deals go too low because people try to get the lowest and you don't it to low or it won't be worth it. Just make a reasonable deal and keep it cool.;
, There are lots of online shop sites so get out and start to look. Even sites that sell all items is a good place because it will be visible to the earth so you might get a quicker deal coming from people all over the world.

, Who says you need to have junk in your garage sale. You can have a all video game garage sell. Put it out in front of your house and put signs all over. Some people are serious gamers these days and will try to get their hands on any video game that's low discount. Refer to step one and keep your deals reasonable. Lots of people will come and look so keep them coming and throw a lemonade stand or something to make a little extra cash.

, They could be worth a lot more in the future then now. You will regret it when that person sells the old game 50 years in the future and becomes a rich person. Keep it for emergency purposes. If you're low on money and can't get those bills and taxes paid sell the game and you will be getting those frustrating extra payments done and over with.

Don't think you're alone.,
Determine what credit cards are accepted by the company you want to pre-order your video game from.,
Figure out how much you're going to need to pre-order your game.,
Find a retailer or bank that sells the card you want to buy and buy your card.,
Order your game!",How to Preorder Games When You Don't Have a Credit Card," More people today than any other time in history don't qualify for a bank issued credit card. This might be to poor choices when they were younger, medical bills that trashed their credit, or a variety of other reasons both in and out of their control. Thankfully, an entire industry has cropped up to serve these people by offering affordable, easy to use, prepaid credit cards.;
, All prepaid credit cards are branded as one of the ""big three"" - VISA, Mastercard, or American Express. But not all merchants take all of those cards. Speak to the store or website you want to pre-order your game from and find out what cards they take. This will save you the headache of buying a card only to find out it's not accepted where you want to use it.

, Game purchases, like everything else, often have taxes associated with them. So a game that's priced at $59 might actually be closer to $67 by the time taxes are added. Since you're going to need to have enough on your prepaid credit card to cover the entire costs of the game, find out how much it will be with taxes. You should be able to find out an exact price from the merchant you plan on pre-ordering from.

, Grocery stores, pharmacies, and even many corner gas stations and convenience stores now sell prepaid credit cards. Once you know what card you want to buy (VISA, Mastercard, etc), go to one of those merchants and purchase your card for at least the an amount that will cover the costs of the game. Most cards allow you to buy any amount you want on them and that becomes the final cost of the card (plus a fee sometimes). All you need to do in most cases is hand the card to the checkout person and tell them how much you want to put on it. Pay them with cash or a check and you now have a working credit card that you can use to pre-order your game.

, Go back to the store or site you're going to pre-order your game from and do it! You now have a credit card that will be treated no differently than any other credit card being used to pre-order this game. Pre-ordering your game should be a quick and easy process. Now, all you have to do is sit and wait on your new game!

Swap video games with friends and family.,
Sell your video games to a used video game store.,
Use the Internet to buy or sell video games.,
Subscribe to emails or newsletters from video game retailers on the Internet.",How to Save Money On Video Game Purchases," Renting video games will allow you to test and preview video games to determine if you like them enough to buy them. This will prevent you from being disappointed if you spend money on a video game, then discover that you do not enjoy playing the game.


Rent video games from a local video game rental store in your area, or enroll for online rental programs that send video game rentals directly to your mailbox.;
, In most cases, retailers and manufacturers will sell video games at prices that are significantly high after their release dates to generate the highest amount of revenue on new games.


Check the prices of video games you want in local retail stores or online every few weeks or months. This will allow you to monitor any sales or price drops that may occur for the video game you want to purchase.

, Used video games are often priced significantly lower than new video games, and can be purchased from multiple venues; including video game rental stores, stores that specialize strictly in video games, and from online retailers such as Amazon or eBay.


Verify a store's return and refund policies before buying their used video games. These policies will be helpful to you in the event that you receive a defective video game, or a video game disc that contains scratches.

, Swapping video games can save money for all participants; especially when you can swap and trade games that you no longer wish to play.

, Some used video game stores may allow you to choose another game from their stock in return for your video game, or offer you cash or a credit for your game.

, Since the Internet expands your buying and selling options to include the entire country and not just your local area, you can often purchase video games from retailers for a much lower price, or find a buyer for your used video game.


Use websites such as eBay or Amazon to buy or sell your used video games, or enter keyword phrases into any Internet search engine that include the words ""buy"" or ""for sale."" For example, if you want to buy the latest Final Fantasy video game, type ""buy Final Fantasy"" or ""Final Fantasy for sale"" to review a large number of pricing options.

, Sometimes, manufacturers or retailers of video games will send you discount notices or coupons for video games when you subscribe to their emails.


Go to the website for your favorite video game retailer (such as Best Buy), and look for a link that allows you to sign up for coupons, store updates, and newsletters.

If you frequently buy or trade in games, you may consider upgrading to a PowerUp rewards Pro card for $14.99/year. You’ll get 10% off used games and an added 10% on all trade-ins, which makes for killer bonuses. You also get a 12-month Game Informer subscription.;

Some offers will be of better value to you than others, depending on what you’d like to purchase and what you have to trade in. Read the offers carefully and try to find the best one.

, GS already pays down on trade ins (about 30 percent of used price) and if you choose cash, you get 20 percent less, so only 24 percent if you choose cash, so any bonus definitely helps. Fifty percent extra trade in value is equal to about 45 percent of the used price.

Your items must be in full working condition to get full value, but items not in full working condition may still be eligible for trade.
The newer the game or console, the more credit you’ll receive.

, The most valuable games are those in demand. Anything related to Mario, Pokémon, or Zelda is usually worth decent money, as long as it's a Wii, Wii U, or DS game.


For example, as of July 2014, Pokémon Platinum for the DS is still worth around $16, and New Super Mario Brothers for the Wii is also worth around $18, while less popular games like Wii Play are only worth $0.25.
Don't bother trading games like Wii Sports (Wii Sports Resort is okay, though), Sports Champions, or Skylanders (you can trade it as long as you have the portal and bundled characters) because they sell in GS for $1 or less, and everyone already has them, and they most likely won't take it.
Don't bother with sports games if they are over a year old.
GS won't take everything. They don't take PS1/2 games, original Xbox games, or Gamecube games, but they do still take PSP (as of July 2014) and DS games.

, They just charge a refurbishing fee from $1-$5. That said, don't expect to walk in with two or three broken Wii games and expect to walk out with 3 brand new PS4 releases. Even with 50 percent extra promotions, three broken Mario Wii games will maybe pay for one used PS3 game.

Some of the most famous free games include the battle arena League of Legends, the collectible card game Hearthstone, the first-person shooter Team Fortress 2, and the Diablo-like Path of Exile.

, These technically fall into the free-to-play category, but there are so many of these they deserve a separate mention. If you are at all interested in online role-playing games, there's probably something out there you can spend hundreds of hours on for free. From Lord of the Rings Online to Star Wars: The Old Republic to the first twenty levels of World of Warcraft, you have many options available., Unlike free-to-play games, these don't even have an obnoxious message trying to convince you to purchase in-game perks. It's almost the default now for games to become free eventually, although you may have to wait a few years after the release date. Browse huge collections of these games at the following sites:



The GOG free games section occasionally includes more high-profile games than other sites.Reddit free games and Reddit efreebies.

, EA's Origin game store client might be a little desperate for users. Visit their ongoing promotions and download the free Origin software. Check back regularly to see which games are up for grabs, as these rotate frequently:

Consider actually getting your parents' consent by demonstrating to them that you can act as a mature adult, or try simply waiting until you are of legal age to purchase the game.,
Have someone who is of age buy it for you.,
Order it online!,
Go to the store in person to buy it if you can't get a hold of a gift card.,
Rent it!,
Borrow it!,
Reserve the game with your parents before the game gets a rating (but you know it's going to be M-rated), then pay it off in full.,
If you look old enough, tell them you turned the legal age the previous day, then keep talking, usually they get annoyed and just want you to leave.,
Go to CVS or 7/11 and buy a prepaid credit card and put the money on there and buy the game online.

Check in your local public library, if they have M+ rated video games for PS3 or Xbox 360, just grab the game you want and check it out.",How to Buy M Rated Games," ESRB Ratings exist for a reason.;
, However, use someone you trust. Do not trust more than one dollar with a complete stranger; you're better off not having the game at all.

, This is the easiest way to buy M-rated games. Buy a gift card with sufficient funds and order the game online. You never have to show your ID to get a gift card or to order M-rated games online. Also you won't need a credit card or billing information!

, This is the second most difficult way to buy an M-rated game as most places will ask you for ID.

, Most movie rental places like Blockbuster or Redbox let your parents let you have a copy of the card. They can choose to allow you to rent and buy M-rated games and R-rated movies. If the game is for Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, then you can save it to your hard drive.

, Do you have a friend that has the game? If so, ask them whether you can borrow it (it's better than nothing).

, Return to the game store without your parents and simply pick it up. If they ask you to have a parent with you, tell them that you already have your parents' consent and chances are they will let you walk. If not, simply put the money toward a T-rated game.

, They'll ring up the game without valid ID.

,, A lot of smaller shops that sell games don't bother checking IDs like chain stores do.

Play the game for at least 7 days.,
Visit Re-Tail.",How to Wake Up Cyrus in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," One of the quickest ways to sell 100,000 bells worth of items to Reese is by selling her identified fossils. Another great way is by catching a lot of the bugs on the island at nighttime, bringing them back, and selling them.


You can sell almost anything to Reese over at Re-Tail. In order to do so, enter Re-Tail and talk to Reese by pressing “A.”
Choose the option “I want to sell!” then select the items that you wish to sell by tapping on them.
Hit “Confirm” located in the lower right-hand side of the window, and Reese will then tell you how much she’s willing to pay; to complete the sale choose “deal!”;
, The catalog in Animal Crossing: A New Leaf keeps track of how many items you have obtained at one point or another in the game.


This prerequisite does NOT require that you have 100 items of furniture on your person at one time, merely that you have obtained 100 unique pieces of furniture at some point throughout the game. Therefore, if you got a kiddie couch from a villager as a reward and immediately sold it, it would be required in your catalog and count towards this goal.

, This works the same way as the step above. You need to have come across 50 unique kinds of clothing throughout the game in order to fulfill this requirement.

, You will likely fulfill this requirement while attempting to fill the others, but just in case you zoom through the above steps, make sure it has been seven days since you started your Animal Crossing game.

, Once you have fulfilled all of the above requirements, just visit Re-Tail again, and this time you will be informed that Cyrus has woken up and is available to work for you.

Gulliver will respond, indicating that he’s confused and doesn’t remember how he arrived on your town’s beach.

, If you talk to Gulliver enough times and effectively wake him up, he’ll ask if you’re willing to help him figure out where he was heading. You should always say yes, considering there is no penalty for getting the answer wrong.


Upon agreeing to help Gulliver, he will describe things he remembers about his destination. Then you will have to choose between four different locations.
The answer can be figured out using common knowledge.

, If you answered Gulliver’s question successfully, then he will send you a letter the next day with a gift that represents the country he’s visiting.


His gifts are usually unique furniture pieces that cannot be obtained otherwise.

There is also a second machine located on Tortimer Island. You can find this one on the right side of the Tour Office. This machine has limited options though. While you can still deposit and withdraw bells here, you won't be able to make payments.;
, Step up to the front of the machine and press the action button on your DS. This will open up a window with the various options available to you. Depending on which machine you’re using, you’ll either see options to “Deposit” and “Make payments,” or just “Deposit.”

, The main function of the ABD is to allow players to deposit their bells into a savings account at the ""Bank of Nintendo."" Bells can be deposited and withdrawn at any time. As you deposit a certain amount of Bells, you'll earn some unique rewards. They will arrive attached to a letter in your mailbox.


100,000 Bells - Tissue Box
500,000 Bells - Letter Set
1,000,000 Bells - Piggy Bank
5,000,000 Bells - Aluminum Briefcase
10,000,000 Bells - Post Office Poster
20,000,000 Bells - Safe
50,000,000 Bells - Postman Hat
100,000,000 Bells - Automatic Bell Dispenser

, As you deposit bells into your savings account, you will start to earn interest from the bank. You'll earn a 0.5% on the amount you have deposited on the first of every month.For example, if you have 1,000 bells deposited, you'll earn 5 extra bells of interest each month. 1,000 x .005 = 5.
You can earn a maximum of 99,999 bells each month from interest. In order to receive this amount, you must have 19,999,800 bells in the bank.

, The last thing you can do at a ABD is pay off your loan to Tom Nook. To do this, select the ABD and choose that option. You'll then need to choose how much you want to pay. Remember, you can use as many bells as you have, but it's always good to save some for yourself too.

Gather enough items.,
Select them all.,
Stack fruit together.",How to Sell or Donate in Bulk in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," If you want sell or donate a ton of things all at once, then just fill your inventory with the items you want to sell or donate. You don’t actually have to fill your entire inventory, but carry more than one. You can sell nearly anything you get you hands on, aside from certain objects, but you can only donate fossils, artwork, bugs and fish to the museum;
, Now, when you’re in the shop or the museum, when prompted to sell or donate the items in your inventory, you simply highlight everything you want to get rid of then press confirm.


Note that you can only donate fossils, art, fish and bugs you haven’t donated yet to the museum. Blathers will refuse the items you already donated, or tell you outright that you have nothing to donate if your inventory is full of things you already donated.

, Another way you can sell in bulk is by stacking items together! While you can only stack bells in all the games and and fruit in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, this can be useful when conducting trades with your friends. Just drag the individual items into one slot. Bells can be stacked near-indefinitely, but in increments. You can’t stack a 100 bell coin into a 1000 bell “bag,” but you can stack 10 units of 100 bell coins until you get 1000 bells. Fruit can be stacked into “bunches” of nine, taking up a single slot for every bunch.

Enjoy your new villager.",How to Trade Villagers in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," You must have less than 10 villagers in your town currently. 10 is the maximum number, and thus, you cannot trade if you’re at capacity!;
, If arranging a trade online, you need to make sure that you can connect to faraway towns. Essentially, you need to have an Internet connection.

, Any time you talk to a villager by pressing “A,” there is a small chance that villager will tell you she’s thinking of moving. When you are faced with that news and you are okay with that, choose the option that essentially wishes them luck with their move.


The text will always be different; it is the second option on the list (the first option attempts to convince him to stay).

, That villager will then tell you when he or she plans to move out. This is a relevant date to remember when initiating the trade process, so you may want to write it down.


Once your villager has started packing up, which you will be able to see when you visit his or her house, he or she will be ready for trade.

, If you want to make a trade with someone you know in real life, then things are pretty easy. The two of you can come to an agreement about what you’ll trade. If you don’t have someone you know personally that you want to trade with, then you’ll have to choose how you want to proceed.


There are many websites dedicated to Animal Crossing villager trades. Do note, however, that each one has different rules about posting. Reddit, for example, has a sub-Reddit dedicated to posting for trades, where users will specify what kind of trade they are seeking.

, Completing the trade will require the other person to visit your village, and when someone visits your village they have power to cut down trees, dig holes, and essentially give you grief.


Some of the online sites dedicated to trading have a system in place to try to assess the quality of the mayor you’re about to trade with. Most trades end up fine; it’s just good to be aware.

, In order for a trade to go through, the person who is accepting your villager must visit your town. In order to do that, you’ll need to give them your friend code, which can be found within the 3DS home menu on your friend card.

, Your friend will then go to the train station in their town, on the north end of the map, just to the left of the exit to Main Street. Talking to Porter the monkey by pressing “A” will then allow them to choose “Visit a faraway town,” which is how you travel to towns over the Internet (and why you need that friend code).


Soon, this person will arrive in your village!

, Do this by pressing “A.” The villager will say something along the lines of not having a destination yet. Then, the visitor has the opportunity to invite that villager to their town through a dialogue choice.


Shortly, your villager will be moved out, and the visitor will be welcoming that villager into their town instead.

, All of this works in reverse as well! If you’re looking online and see that someone is offering a villager that you want in a deal that you find suitable, then you visit their town and talk to that villager in order to get them to move in.


Again, remember that this only works if you currently have less than 10 villagers in your Animal Crossing town! You won’t be able to persuade the villager to come to your town if you’re already at capacity.

, Make smart decisions in trading. This guide has been operating under the given of trading one villager for another villager, but that’s not always the way it works. Sometimes, people just give away their villagers. Other times, people sell their villagers for bells. It all depends.


Either way, if you’re participating in the community of villager trade, then you’ll have a new villager to enjoy in your Animal Crossing town! Or perhaps you’ve just gotten rid of that one villager you didn’t like. Either way, via trading, you can get closer and closer to your ideal village makeup.

Enjoy swimming and diving.",How to Swim and Dive in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," To get to the island, visit the south-most region of your town map where there will be docks. You will need 1,000 bells in order to visit the island.


Kapp’n, the frog who mans the docks, will not allow you to take any of your belongings with you.;
, When you arrive on the island, you’ll be inside a small hut. Walk outside the hut, and directly to your left will be the gyroid. It rents out equipment that you can use for the duration of your visit, but you cannot take the equipment back with you.

, In order to swim and dive, you first need a wetsuit. One of the items that the gyroid offers is the wetsuit.


It will also offer you a tutorial if you need to learn how to use it.

, In order to use the wetsuit, you first need to equip it. Do this by pressing “X” to open your inventory screen. Then drag and drop the wetsuit on top of your character’s avatar.

, Getting into the water is easy. Simply walk up to the edge of the ocean. Instead of hitting an invisible barrier like your character would have before, he or she will now continue walking into the water and continue to swim.

, Swim around by continually pressing “A.” Every time you press “A,” your character will inch forward just a little bit, effectively swimming.

, You want to be looking for little black dots in the water. These will also be noted by small bubbles that rise up to the surface. These spots indicate critters that you can catch.


You can also encounter jellyfish in the ocean. If you run into them, they will sting you, and you will be unable to move for a short time.

, Once you’ve spotted a critter, swim towards. Once you’re reasonably close, go ahead and press “Y,” which will cause you to dive.


When diving, your character can only stay underwater for a short period of time, which is why you want to be as close as possible to your prey on the surface.

, Often times, these critters will continue to move, and in order to catch them, you’ll need to continue swimming in their direction by pressing “A” and holding the directional stick towards them.


To succeed in catching, your character needs to take up the same spot as the critter. If successful, your character will grab the critter and rise to the surface with her catch, and it will appear in your inventory.

, The frog is behind the desk on the lefthand side of the hut. This is the same frog that will take you back home to the village.

, When you talk to him, instead of choosing “Go home,” you need to choose “Go on a tour.”


Every tour is different, and at the beginning of it, Tortimer will explain the goal and rules.
The number of medals you receive at the end is dependent on how well you perform in the mini-game.

, You will then use these medals to purchase a wetsuit. You need 40 of them.

, The diving suit will not always be available in the island shop, so you may have to check back multiple days to wait for it. Once it arrives, press “A” when standing next to the wetsuit and choose the correct dialogue options to purchase it.

, Make sure that you put the wetsuit into the island basket so that it travels with you when you return home. The frog at the counter will remind you of this if you attempt to leave with anything in your inventory.


Things do not travel in your inventory, they only travel in the basket beside the counter.

, Return home and enjoy swimming and diving in your own village in addition to on the island!

, Kapp’n will ask if you want to go to the island and inform you that the trip costs 1,000 bells round-trip. As long as you have the bells on hand, choose yes in order to start heading to the island.

, Once you’re in the boat, Kapp’n will start to sing his song. Skip the song by pressing “B” repeatedly while he is singing. After pressing “B” enough times, Kapp’n will talk a little bit about how you’re in such a rush, but it will cause you to immediately land at the island and exit into the shop.


If you do nothing, Kapp’n will continue to sing, and you will simply have to wait for him to finish.
