Try to predict long term trends.",How to Play the Stalk Market in Animal Crossing New Leaf," Hit the Power button on your 3DS, which can be found in the bottom right corner, and select Animal Crossing: New Leaf from the homescreen. After the brief beginning credits play, you will be brought to Isabelle.;
, She will exchange pleasantries with you, and then ask if there’s anything you’d like to do before starting.

, Unlike the stores in the shopping plaza, the turnip vendor is not open on a daily basis; she will only appear in the player’s town only on Sundays, from 6AM until noon, so if you don’t want to wait up for the next Sunday to come, set the date and time to somewhere in this 6-hour span.


Select “Yes” by pressing the A button, and then select the “Change time/date” option. A screen that will allow you to change the date by using the Up/Down buttons on the D-pad will appear. After you are satisfied with the date, hit A to move on to the Time screen, which can be adjusted similarly with the Up/Down buttons. Hit A once more to save your changes.

, A boar named Joan is the go-to source for turnips. She will be wandering around town from 6AM to 12PM on Sundays. Simply walk around the town a bit to find her.

, Approach Joan, and hit the “A” button to interact with her. The dialogue will display a few reply options.

, Joan sells batches of 10 turnips. Its price range between 90 and 110 bells. This price will not change during the day, but it will change by week.


Turnips can be stored in drawers within your home or held in your inventory.

, When playing the stalk market, fresh is best, so make sure that the turnips you’re selling are not rotten. The turnips that you purchase will rot at exactly 6AM the next Sunday, so be sure to sell them before then. If they do end up rotting, you will have to pay Reese to dispose of them.


If you change the date again after purchasing the turnips, this can make them rot instantly, so be sure to sell them first.

, You can check the turnip prices by asking Reese at Re-Tail (it is the blue store icon on the town map). The price of turnips changes twice a day—when Re-tail opens at 9AM and again at noon.


Throughout the week, the price of the turnips will change drastically. They adhere to one of four different fluctuation patterns. You can normally discern the pattern by the fourth day of the week and make the decision on which day to sell your turnips.

, The declining trend is the most useless of the 4 trends, and the most difficult to profit off of, and recognizing the signs of a declining trend early can save you major bells in the long run. A declining trend’s Monday morning price will always be less than 100 bells per turnip. The price will continue to decline a few bells each day, throughout the entire week. If the bell per turnip price is around 90 by the second day, sell all of your turnips ASAP.


The random trend is characterized by arbitrary increases and decreases in turnip prices. Despite its name, it follows a fairly steady pattern of increasing and decreasing. If the turnip price on Monday morning is over 100 bells or higher than the buying price, it means the trend for the week is random. Try and keep track of the increases and decreases. It is best to sell the turnips fairly early in the week, during one of the increases. Sometimes, as the week progresses, the price can drop severely.

, The high spike trend is characterized by a gradual increase in price, a sudden increase by 300 bells, and finally a gradual decrease in price. Pay careful attention to turnip prices for the first two days. If the price is gradually increasing, be sure to check for the spike on the third day.


For example, the price may go from 120 bells to 130 bells and then 450 bells. Make sure to sell all your turnips during the third-day spike, because by the fourth day, the prices will go down again.

, The low spike trend is characterized by the selling price gradually increasing over the span of the first 4 days, with a less than 300 bell spike occurring on the fourth day, and finally a drop in prices after the spike.


Unlike the high spike trend, which drastically increases on the third day, this trend is much more gradual. It would look something like: 115 bells, 140 bells, 160 bells, 260 bells, and then a drop in price.
If you do not see the 300+ bell spike on the third day, you can correctly identify the trend as low spike instead of high spike, and sell all your turnips on the fourth day.

, Aside from predicting the best price to sell turnips for the week, it is also possible to predict what the trend for next week will be. Although there is no guarantee that the trends will follow this pattern, certain trends are more likely to happen after each other.


A declining trend is likely to be followed by a high spike trend, while there are average chances of a random and low spike trend occurring, and a low chance of another declining trend occurring.
A random trend is likely to be followed by a high spike and low spike trend, while it is unlikely to be followed by a declining or random trend.
A high spike trend is likely to be followed by a random trend and is unlikely to be followed by another high spike trend, a low spike trend, or declining trend.
Finally, a low spike trend is likely to be followed by a random trend, averagely likely to be followed by a high spike trend, and unlikely to be followed by another low spike or declining trend.

Check how much you owe.,
Pay your loan.",How to Pay Off Loans in Animal Crossing New Leaf," Although your position as a mayor is not paid, there are still many ways to make a profit in New Leaf. One of the easiest ways to make money is by selling fish and bugs to Reese at the Re-Tail Shop, which can be found by locating the pink recycling icon on the map at the bottom screen.


To catch fish, get a fishing rod at the Nookling Junction on Main Street. Open your inventory while standing in front of a body of water (either a river or ocean), and equip the fishing rod by dragging it over to your character. When you see a shadow moving below the water’s surface, hit the “A” button to cast your bait. Wait until the fish approaches your bait, and you hear a dripping sound. Upon hearing the sound, hold down the “A” button to reel in the fish
Bugs can be found in the air, on the ground, on trees, and around flowers. To catch bugs, first get a bug net at the Nookling Junction. If you find a bug, sneak up on them by gently pressing the analog stick forward. Equip the net by opening your inventory and dragging it to your character, then hit the “A” button when you are 3-4 steps away from the bug to capture it.
The most valuable fish and bugs can be found on the island at night, from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. If you have not already unlocked the island, you must pay 10,000 bells to Tom Nook to transform your tent into a home. Afterwards, talk to Tortimer on the docks and wait a day for Kapp’n to appear with the boat.
While some fish and bugs are only worth about 500 bells each, others can be worth up to 32,000 bells.
If you have already caught some things for Reese, enter the shop, and hit the “A” button to talk with her. Select the “I want to sell” option, and select items from your inventory (you can select multiple items by tapping them with the stylus), then hit the “Done” button at the bottom of the screen to finish your selection.;
, You can also make bells by selling your town’s fruit (each piece sells for about 100 bells) to Reese in bulk. Go from fruit tree to fruit tree, and hit “A” to shake them.


Collect the fruit and group them into bushels by opening your inventory and dragging matching fruit into piles. Up to 9 fruits can be stored under one inventory space.

, You can get bells from a certain rock in New Leaf. These rocks look like ordinary rocks, but if you hit it with a shovel, bells will come out. To learn more on how to get bells from rocks, check out this article.

, There is a machine that functions like an electronic bank located on the left side of the Post Office (which can be found on the left side of Main Street).


Although the Post Office is open 24/7, to pay off a loan, you must use the machine while Nook’s home is open, which is from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

, To check how much you still owe Tom Nook, face the machine, press “A,” and select “Pay Off Loan” option. The machine will displays exactly how much you still owe.

, Using the bottom touchscreen, enter the numerical value you wish to deposit, and hit the “Enter” button to finalize the transaction.


A loan can be paid off in as many transactions as you need.
Once a loan has successfully been paid off, you will be able to purchase further expansions for your home; however, the prices of these expansions will continue to increase.

Choose between hair or makeup.",How to Make Your Character Look Different in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," One of the easiest facets of your character’s appearance that you can change is his or her clothing. There are different clothing types and parts: dress, shirt, pants, skirt, shoes, and socks.


Wearing a dress disables you from wearing pants or a skirt. You can wear socks no matter what (even if they’re not visible).;
, It’s the easiest way to get new clothes. Their shop is on Main Street, which can be found by running north across the train tracks at the edge of your village.


You will see a variety of clothing on display at the Able Sisters’ shop. Any item on display can be purchased. To find out the price, simply face the piece of clothing you’re interested in and press “A.” This will start a dialogue with Sabel, who will then ask if you want to buy the item.
The shop is open from 10am to 9pm by default, and will be that way for you unless you have the Early Bird or Night Owl Town ordinances active.

, The store’s stock changes every day, so it’s a good idea to check back often especially if you have a particular look in mind.

, Walking next door will take you into the accessories section of the Able Sisters’ shop. Here, the final Able sister sells things like wigs, glasses, umbrellas, and other face accessories.


The same mechanics apply here. When you want to know the price on something, simply face that item and press “A.”
In the dialogue options with the Able sisters, you can always request to try an item on so that you can see just how it would look on you before you splurge and decide to buy.

, You can get them as rewards for completing tasks, but that’s completely random.

, Kicks isn’t present at the beginning of the game, and you will have to unlock it. In order to have Kicks built, you must have spent 8,000 bells at the Able Sisters shop.

, In the same way that there are many, many shirts to choose from in the Animal Crossing: A New Leaf game, there are also lots of socks and shoes available for sale from the Kicks shop on Main Street.

, The mechanics work the same way in this store as they do at the Able Sisters shop. There will be a number of shoes and socks on display that change daily. To inquire about an item, face it and press “A.”

, You can try socks and shoes on, but depending on what else your character is wearing, it might be difficult to see. So if you want to really get a look at some long socks, make sure you aren’t wearing pants that will just hide them.

, Another way to change your character’s appearance is by taking advantage of the services over at Shampoodle. However, just like Kicks, Shampoodle isn’t built at the start of your game, and you will need to unlock it.


To unlock Shampoodle, you must have spent 10,000 bells between the Able Sisters and Kicks. In addition, Kicks must have been open for at least 7 days before Shampoodle can begin construction.

, Once Shampoodle is open, have a chat with Harriet by facing her and pressing “A.” She will let you know that there are two different options (at first): hairstyle or makeup. Both options will end up costing you 3,000 bells, and you can only choose one a day.

, Choosing hairstyle means you have to change both your hairstyle and color. Choosing makeup will create a mask for your character to wear based on any Mii’s you have on your DS.


Having a different hairstyle and color makes a big difference to your character’s appearance, and having him or her wear a Mii mask will make him or her look very different as well. It is worth noting, however, that if you wear a Mii mask, you cannot wear any accessories (such as those purchased at the Able Sisters) over it.

If you are just starting out, try collecting fruit and seashells.,
Once you are able to travel and go see friends, collect their fruit.,
Once you get the island, you are able to make money like gold.,
Perfect fruit.,
Once you get your hands on a shovel, look for rocks.,
If you have the Dream Suite, make sure your town is able to be dreamed about.",How to Make Bells Quick on Animal Crossing New Leaf," Selling them to Retail will get you money fast! Try to also get your hands on tools from Timmy and Tommy Nook, prices ranging at 200 - 500 bells for tools. Catching rare bugs, fish, or finding the money rock or ores can get you thousands easily.;
, Foreign fruit is sold for more at Retail than your native fruit.


At the island, there is a lot of foreign fruit that you will not see anywhere else! Collect it and take it back. Don't worry, it grows back.

, You can sell the foreign fruit to Retail. You can also catch beetles at night (they range from 6,000 to 12,000 bells) and sharks (8,000 to 15,000). Selling them would get you tons of bells!


Also, once you get to the island, you can buy a wetsuit. A wetsuit allows you to go into the water, and catch sea creatures (crabs, seaweed, things that are not fish)

, Perfect fruit will grow on your native fruit trees, and it will look shiny, sparkly or different from the normal fruit. You can plant it for more perfect fruit, sell it, or eat it (not recommend to eat it) It can be sold for a big number (600 Bells each for a native fruit and 3,000 Bells each for a non-native fruit).

, One rock in your town will be a money rock. Hit it multiple times and money should come out! The money rock will change every day. Memorize the rocks that your town started with, because the ore rock will be one that you haven't seen before. Hit that new rock with your shovel, and it will blast open. You will see an ore which can be sold within the price range of 1,000 bells to 4,000 bells.

, Each day when you refresh your town, you'll get 5,000 bells! So each day you'll make 5,000 bells for only 1 minute worth of work. Easy-peasy!

Perform the emotion.",How to Learn Emotions from Dr. Shrunk in Animal Crossing New Leaf," To get Dr. Shrunk’s club, Club LOL, you must first upgrade Nookling Junction to T&T Mart, which can only be upgraded if you’ve upgraded your tent to a house. Before you can do this, though, your town must be at least 10 days old.

If you’ve been playing the game for more than 10 days, proceed to Step 2.;
, Do this by giving Tom Nook a down payment of 10,000 bells. Your tent will upgrade to a house the next day., You can find Nookling Junction in Main Street. Once you’ve spent 12,000 bells there, after completing all of the above requirements, Nookling Junction will close for a day of renovations. After this, it will reopen as the T&T Mart., Before you can approve the construction of new stores, your approval rating must be 100%. To know how much approval rating you currently have, journey to the Town Hall (the purple marker on the map at the bottom screen).

Enter the Town Hall and sit in the mayor’s chair located behind Isabelle’s desk. Isabelle will approach you once you sit down, and speak to you, giving you a variety of dialogue options.
Select “Check approval rating” to see how the villagers view you. If it is not yet 100%, there are several things you can do to quickly reach the perfect goal. If it has, proceed to Part 3.

, There are several actions that can raise your approval rating by 3; however, you will only receive points the first time you do the action:

Changing the town music—Speak to Isabelle in the Town Hall. She will give you the option to change the town music, but only if your town is two in-game days old or more.
Changing the town flag—Speak to Isabelle in the Town Hall.
Putting something up for sale at Re-tail—Visiting Re-tail (the pink arrow icon on the map at the bottom of the screen), and talk to Reese, the pink alpaca.
Posting something on the bulletin board—Go to the bulletin board next to the train station (northernmost part of town) and hit “A” on your console, and then enter your message.
Donating a fish, bug, or fossil to the museum—This can be done after capturing a fish with the fishing rod, catching a bug with the net, or digging up a fossil with the shovel. Enter the museum, which is on the far left side of Main Street, and talk to Blathers.

, These actions can be repeated:

Removing trash from the water by fishing—At times when you fish, rather than pulling up an animal, you will come up with a piece of junk, which can later be disposed of. Note that this is a random occurrence.
Introducing yourself to villagers—This can be done by approaching villagers and hitting the “A” button to converse with them.
Sending letters—Buy letter paper at the Nookling Junction. Open it in your inventory, enter a message, and send it by giving it to the duck working at the Post Office (found on the left hand side of Main Street).
Pulling weeds—This can be done by standing over weeds, which appear as brownish green sprouts of grass, and hitting the “Y” button.
Watering flowers—This can only be done if you own a watering can, which can be purchased at the Nookling Junction. With the watering can equipped, stand in front of the flowers and hit the “A” button to water them.

, You will earn 3 extra points per day simply by playing., The day after you completed the requirements mentioned in Parts 1 and 2, Dr. Shrunk will be waiting for you outside your house. He will inform you of what he wants to build and ask your permission for the construction.

After giving him the OK, he will hand you a petition and request that you collect 6 signatures from your villagers.
The petition is an item that cannot be dropped, put into storage, sold, or thrown away; you are stuck with it until you collect the correct amount of signatures.

, Any villager will sign the petition, and they can be asked while wandering around town or while in their homes. When you find a villager, hit “A” to talk to them., One of the options that will pop up after the initial greetings is asking them to sign the petition; select that option, and the villager may sign the petition. Don't worry if they don't, sometimes this happens.

Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the next 5 villagers.

, Once you have collected all 6 signatures, go talk to Dr. Shrunk, who can be found walking around the Main Street in the shopping District, and give him the petition.

Within the next 4 to 8 in-game days, Club LOL will begin its construction and open.

, After Club LOL opens, pay Dr. Shrunk a visit during its daytime hours, 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. The club can be found on the left side of Main Street., Dr. Shrunk will thank you for helping with the construction of the club, and mention his ability to teach emotions.

The first time you talk to Dr. Shrunk after his club opens, he will hand you a joke book, which contains all the emotions you learn.

, If you brought a piece of fruit, when you talk to him, a “I brought you a snack option” will appear. Select this to give him the fruit, and in return, he will teach you an emotion.

Right after the exchange, the new emotion will be accessible to the player.
Only one emotion can be learned per day, and Dr. Shrunk can only teach them before 8 p.m. After 8, the club will become a dance floor.

, Access the joke book by selecting the purple book button on the bottom of the screen. Click an emotion to have your character perform it. Some villagers may respond to emotions such as showmanship, disbelief, heartbreak, mischief, and more, while other emotions won't lead a reaction by villagers, like cold chill, daydreaming, and surprise."
"
Do Time Travel.,
Ignore them.,
Talk to them a lot.",How to Get Villagers to Move in Animal Crossing1," Time Travel involves abusing the time cycle by traveling forward two days, and then rewinding two days, thus speeding up the natural process. This way, you hit the natural cycle of animals moving out.


Be careful, Time Travel has other consequences. It is possible that using this method will result in you losing a villager that you don’t want to move out, especially if you are not vigilant in checking with all of the villagers to see if anyone is moving.
To check with all of the villagers, simply talk to each one, preferably multiple times, by pressing “A” to see if there’s any new gossip or someone brings up moving out.
Remember, before attempting to get any villagers to move out, you must have at least 8 villagers already moved in. All this really means is that if you just started the game, you’ll need to wait a few days for the population to naturally increase before you can convince anyone to move out.;
, This is a very easy method to achieve. Simply ignore the villagers who you want to move out. Don’t talk to them, but continue playing the game and letting time progress. Hopefully, another villager will tell you that the villager you’ve been ignoring is thinking of moving out soon, and you’ll know it worked.


Be careful: If you talk to the ignored villager after hearing she’s going to move out, no matter what you say, the villager will then decide to stay instead of leave.
For example, if you’ve been particularly mean to a villager lately and ignoring him or her, the option “Good luck!” might be replaced with “Who are you?!” which then prompts that animal to stay.

, Playing favorites, although the opposite of ignoring villagers, seems to also produce results in terms of getting residents to move out. To accomplish this, simply talk to the villager multiple times a day, more than any other villagers, by pressing “A.”

Grab some flowers.,
Line them up.,
Water them daily.,
Wait.",How to Grow Flowers in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," You can pick up flowers from around town or buy them from the Gardening Store at Main Street. It’s best if you got flowers of the same species for your flowers to flourish.


You can pick up flowers by walking to them then pressing the Y button.
Flower seeds cost around 80 Bells, and a random selection is available daily from the store.;
, On some clear ground, without any patterns or stone, press the X button, then tap on the flowers, and press “Plant.” This will drop the flower on the ground, fully bloomed. Then just keep placing the flowers in rows, with at least a space between the rows. This is so you can have new flowers sprouting between the spaces.


If you’re unsure if the ground is good to plant in, just dig up the area with a shovel. If the shovel makes a noise or if your character makes an “off-balanced” motion, you can’t plant on it.
It’s best if you sort them by color so that you can breed the same color variations, unless you’re trying to grow hybrid flowers, which normally require you to put two different-colored flowers of the same flower species beside each other. The exact combinations can be found on the Internet, but you can make many basic hybrids just by letting two flowers with different colors “mix” into a new color.
Many players find that diagonal rows are the most optimal for flower breeding and hybrids.

, Of course, you’ll need to water them daily. To do so, you need a Watering Can. You can buy one from the Gardening Store for 500 Bells, or you can get it for free from Isabelle after completing all her “Town Living” tips. In any case, make sure to water your plants regularly so they’ll breed faster. You can only water them once a day, but that’s all you need.


You can equip the watering can by pressing X, then dragging it to your character icon, or by pressing the left or right button on the D-pad. You can unequip it by pressing the Down button, and you can use it by pressing A.
Rainy days count as watering your plant, so don’t bother when it’s raining out since they all get watered at the same time.

, Now all that’s left to do is wait. It can take anywhere from a day to a week for a new flower to sprout, but it’s been noted that more flowers can result in more flowers and hybrids popping up. So go ahead and carry on as usual after planting your flowers and just remember to water them every day so that one day, you can spot quite a few new flowers popping up.

Recruit.,
Build the campsite.,
Do Time Travel.",How to Get Villagers to Move in Animal Crossing2," As mentioned before, if you have less than or equal to 8 villagers, other villagers will naturally want to move in. This happens naturally. However, you can recruit specific characters by participating in villager trade or making use of the campsite public works project.

, If you do, animals will visit your town on occasion, and they can often be convinced to move in.


The campsite is available in your list of public works. Just sit in your mayor chair and choose it from the list of public works to build.
After the camp site is built, it can't be demolished, so choose its location carefully!

, If you want a specific villager, you can again make use of Time Travel. This requires that you check your town every day when you think someone should be moving in.


What you want to be looking for is a post that designates a new villager is moving in. It will have his name on it. If it’s a villager you want, rejoice and move forward. If not, travel back in time, reload the game, and you should have a different villager’s name.

Gather some bells.,
Head to the town store.,
Buy a shovel.,
Equip the shovel.,
Look for rocks.,
Create supports.,
Hit the rock.,
Keep hitting!,
Wait for the next day and try again.",How to Get Rich with the Money Rock in Animal Crossing," Bells are the main currency of the game series, but you start out the game with no bells at all. Since you need bells to buy your primary tool for this venture, it’s going to be a bit of a problem. Thankfully, there are many ways to make bells: the player can sell items and fruit, do favors for villagers, or even shake trees for money. At the very start though, shaking trees down for fruit and bells is the quickest way to get bells. Simply walk up to the tree and press A to shake it down, then press B (Y in New Leaf) to gather whatever falls out. In Wild World and New Leaf, you can also tap the tree with your stylus then tap the items that fall out.


Bells dropped from trees appear as items and take up space in the inventory. You can immediately drop the bells into your wallet (the part of the screen that says how many bells you have) by accessing your inventory (Y on the original game and Wild World, - on City Folk, and X on New Leaf), selecting a bell coin or sack with A, then dropping the held bell coin or sack onto that portion of the screen by pressing A again. You can also stack the bells by scrolling to another bell coin or sack with the D-pad or stylus, then dropping it onto that one.
Trees come in many shapes and sizes, and bells and items drop from them regardless. However, only certain trees bear fruit, and they can be distinguished by a lighter leaf color and the presence of three pieces of fruit when they bear fruit. Fruit grow back every three days.
Sometimes, trees also drop furniture and other items, which can be worth quite a bit if you decide to sell it.
Sometimes, if you shake down trees, Beehives fall down and sting your player, giving them a swollen eye and an unhappy look. This change is purely aesthetic though, and can be removed by saving and quitting the game or by buying medicine from the town store.;
, The thing you need most to take advantage of the Money Rock is a Shovel. Shovels can be bought from the town store run by Tom Nook (all games, excluding New Leaf) or Timmy and Tommy (New Leaf exclusive). This tool is vital because without it, you can’t whack any rocks in the town. The town store is placed randomly in every generated town in every game but New Leaf, where it can be found in the Main Street.

, To buy shovels and other items, walk up to the item in the display, press A or tap it with your stylus (DS and 3DS only), and Tom (or Timmy/Tommy in New Leaf) will ask you if you want to buy it. Reply yes and there you have it! A brand new shovel!


In all games, shovels are worth 500 bells.
Shovels and other tools are stocked randomly by the store, and the store inventory changes every day, so you might have to wait a few days before you can buy one. Since this game is real-time, you may have to literally wait a few real days.
If you’re short on money, selling excess items will help you gain enough. Simply talk to Tom Nook (or Timmy/Tommy in New Leaf) and he will ask you what you want to do. Choose “I’m selling!” and two windows will appear: one is your inventory and is at the bottom, and the other is the trading inventory, where you place whichever goods you wish to sell. Select the items you wish to sell with A, then place them on the trade window by pressing A again and select “Confirm.” You can sell most items you pick up, ranging from fruit to seashells to furniture.

, Equipping the shovel is similar to how you put your bells in your wallet: select the shovel, scroll to your character until the character icon is highlighted, then drop the shovel there. The character’s icon will then be holding your shovel.


In New Leaf, you can scroll through the tools with the D-pad.

, There can be anywhere from 5 to 10 rocks per town, scattered all around the area. As you travel around town, keep an eye out for rocks.

, When you hit a rock with your shovel, your character will bounce backwards, which costs valuable time. To avoid it, face your rock and then dig some holes behind you and on your sides by pressing A. This will keep you from moving when you hit the rock.


If the rock is near some trees, you can use the tree as one of the supports instead of digging another hole.

, Now face your rock and press A. If it doesn’t yield a bell after hitting it once, press A on the holes to fill them up and search for a new rock to hit.

, If the rock you hit suddenly yields a bell, keep hitting it as fast as you can! The Money Rock only lasts for 10 seconds after the first hit and afterwards becomes inert. So keep pressing fast until no more bells come out.


With each hit, the amount of bells that comes out increases! You can make at least 8,500 bells with a single rock if you’re fast enough. The amount varies per game, but it’s still quite a ludicrous haul.

, You only get one Money Rock per day, and once that 10 seconds of riches wear off, you’ll have to wait for the next day before setting off for a new one. As long as you keep it up, you’ll easily make a ton of money this way!

Know when to sell.",How to Make Money in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," Animal Crossing is a game designed to be played throughout the whole year in small bursts, and you can burn yourself out if you spend too much time worrying about earning more Bells. You'll get the most out of the game if you keep coming back to it throughout the year, so don't worry about taking it slow. As you start upgrading your tools and town buildings, you'll find that Bells start flowing in much quicker.
, Every day, one of the rocks in your town will contain a gemstone, and one will contain up to 16,100 Bells. When you hit the rock containing the Bells, a few will pop out and you'll be pushed back a little. You'll need to quickly re-approach the rock and continue to hit it if you want to earn the full amount of Bells.

An advanced technique for not getting pushed back is to dig a hole behind you first, but you'll need to do this before you strike the rock and start the counter. This means digging a hole every time you encounter a rock. You can also plant bushes next to each rock as a more permanent blocker.
When you collect a gemstone, you will immediately earn between 2,000 - 4,000 gems, depending on the stone.
If you're lucky, the money rock, instead of Bells, will produce seven various ores.

, Shaking trees without fruit can result in an immediate 100 Bells. You can do this on up to 20 trees without fruit. Not all trees will contain a prize.

Sometimes shaking a tree will result in you disturbing a beehive. If you can catch the bees with your net, you can sell them for 2,500 Bells. You can also pick up the fallen beehive and sell it for an additional 500 Bells.
Leave some non-fruit trees in your forest so that you can collect these free items. If you replace all of your non-fruit trees with fruit trees, you won't be able to get these free Bells anymore.

, Talk to everyone in town. After getting to know you, characters may offer you small jobs and tasks. Completing these tasks will typically earn you a piece of furniture or clothing. You can take these rewards to the Re-Tail store and sell them for Bells., You can find fossils buried beneath starfish-shaped cracks in the ground. Up to five fossils will appear each day at 6 AM.

Take the fossils to Blathers at the Museum to be identified. If you haven't turned in a fossil of that type before, you'll be asked if you want to donate it. This can unlock new models in the Museum. You can decline the donation if you wish.
You can sell identified fossils to Re-Tail for anywhere from 2,000 to 6,000 Bells, depending on the fossil. You can get a much better price by putting the item for sale on the Flea Market, which you can do at Re-Tail as well. When selling to other villagers, you can usually put the fossil on sale for one Bell less than four times it's resell value, as long as the total is lower than 10,000 Bells.

, Every month, you will earn 0.5% interest on the Bells that you have stored in the Bank of Nintendo. To maximize the interest that you earn, only pull Bells out of your account when you absolutely need them., Before you can fish, you'll need to get a Fishing Rod. At the start of the game, your only chance of getting a Fishing Rod is by hoping that Nookling Junction has one in stock. Nookling Junction can have two different tools out of twelve total in stock at once, of which the Fishing Rod is one. If the Fishing Rod is in stock, it will cost 500 Bells.

Upgrading Nookling Junction will increase the amount of items it can stock. In order to get the first upgrade, you'll need to pay 10,000 on your home loan, spend 12,000 Bells at Nookling Junction, and have lived in the town for ten days.
If you can't seem to get the Fishing Rod from Nookling Junction, talk to Isabelle at the Mayor's Office and select ""Advice for Living Here"". As you follow her instructions, she will eventually offer to sell you a Fishing Rod if you haven't gotten one yet.

, You can fish at any of the bodies of water in New Leaf, including the River, the Small Ponds, and the Ocean. There are 72 different fish and aquatic life that can be caught, and you can sell them for anywhere from 100 - 15,000 Bells. The availability of certain fish depends on the time of day, location, weather, and time of year., You can see shadows of fish underneath the water, indicating where you should cast your line. Casting closer to shadows will make it easier to catch fish., You'll see your bobber appear on the water's surface. It shouldn't take long for the fish to approach your line., In order to determine when to reel your line in, you'll need to watch your bobber. Fish will nibble at your line, which will move the bobber a little. Reeling in during a nibble will cause you to lose the fish., As soon as the bobber is completely submerged, immediately press ""A"".

Fish will never nibble more than four times. If a fish nibbles four times, it will always bite on the next nibble.
Many expert players recommend listening for the bobber splash instead of watching the screen. This can help improve reaction times, especially for the rare fish which require precise timing.

, You can donate fish to the museum or sell the fish to Re-Tail. Trash items such as empty cans, boots, and tires are not worth any money, but Re-Tail will take them off of your hands so that they aren't cluttering up your inventory., To get the Silver Rod, you'll need to donate 30 fish to the Museum. To get the Gold Rod, you'll need to catch all 72 different fish at least once., When you start a new village, it will be randomly assigned a native fruit. These are the only fruits that will be found in your village when you start the game. Native fruits are common, and sell for the least amount of Bells in your own village. Selling fruit in villages where it is not native will earn you much more. You can plant non-native fruits, which allow you to grow and harvest these fruits to sell in your own town for profit.

Sometimes trees will produce Perfect Fruit, which sells for much more than standard fruit. You can only grow Perfect Fruit from native fruit trees.

, The key to making big money from your fruit trees is to plant non-native fruit so that new fruit trees grow. You can sell fruit from these trees for lots of Bells in your own village with minimal effort. There are a couple different ways you can obtain non-native fruit to plant:

Proceeding through Isabelle's tutorial will eventually grant you three non-native fruits. It's tempting to sell these, but make sure you plant them instead so that you can continue making Bells from them.
You can get coconuts and other tropical fruit from Tortimer Island. Click here for details on accessing the island.
Sending a villager a single-line note along with a piece of fruit will generally cause them to send a different fruit back.
During the Harvest Festival, catching the requested fish will reward you with a piece of non-native fruit.

, Each square around the fruit tree will need to be empty in order for it to bear fruit. A planted fruit tree will grow three pieces of fruit every three days. There are a couple of things to keep in mind when planting fruit trees:

Coconut trees must be planted within one acre of the ocean.
Banana trees must be planted on the beach itself.
A native Perfect Fruit will produce a Perfect Fruit tree. A Perfect Fruit tree will give three Perfect Fruit every three days, and you can harvest a Perfect Fruit tree 5-7 times before it runs out of fruit and dies.

, Once your trees are full and the fruit is ready, shake the tree to drop the fruit. The fruit tree will be ready to shake after another three days. You can increase the chances of creating Perfect Fruit by burying fertilizer next to the tree., The best way to make money from your native fruit is to sell it in a friend's village if you are able to play online. Visit your friend's town using the Train Station. You can visit anyone in your vicinity, or enter your friend's Friend Code to visit them over the internet. Your friend will have to have set the Town Gate to allow visitors. You can then sell your native fruits at your friend's Re-Tail for 500 Bells, and sell your native Perfect Fruit for 3,000 Bells (as long as the fruit isn't native there as well)., When you harvest a Perfect Fruit, you can sell it for 600 (native) or 3,000 (non-native). While it will be tempting to sell all of your Perfect Fruit, plant one from each harvest so that you can keep getting more. Planting a non-native perfect fruit will result in a regular tree, so always sell all of your non-native Perfect Fruit., Tortimer Island is one of the best places to earn Bells anywhere in the game. you can catch the rarest fish and bugs on the island, and can compete in mini-games to earn prizes., When you start the game, you will owe 39,800 Bells on your home. You will need to pay this off completely before Tortimer Island is unlocked. Use the methods above to make money every day and pay down the loan., Once you've paid off your loan, the town's previous mayor Tortimer will appear on your dock. Talking to him will allow you to visit Tortimer Island starting on the next day., Kapp'n will appear at the docks on the day after you talk to Tortimer. Taking the boat will cost 1,000 Bells, but the rewards on the island will far outweigh the cost., Some of the most valuable fish are found in the waters around Tortimer Island. In fact, so many of the fish are valuable that you're probably better off throwing back everything that's worth less than 1,000 Bells. On Tortimer Island, the time of day does not affect which fish can appear., Like fishing, hunting for bugs is very lucrative on Tortimer Island. The rare Golden Stag bug, for example, can be sold for 12,000 Bells. you can find different bugs around the island depending on the location and the time of day., The box near the font counter on the island can hold up to 40 items. Everything that isn't in the box when you leave the island will be converted into 10% of the resell value in Bells. Your most valuable items should be put in the box so that they're transferred safely back to your town. This will allow you to sell the items for full price at Re-Tail., The Dream Suite is a way for you to visit dream versions of other towns, as well as update the dream version of your own. You will earn 5,000 Bells every time you update your dream, which you can do once a day. Building the Dream Suite requires being the mayor for seven days, and costs 234,000 Bells.Talk to Isabelle while she's napping to get the prompt to build the Dream Suite.

, Luna will guide you through the dream update process., Once you've updated your dream, you will receive 5,000 Bells. You can do this every day once a day, and you'll start making a profit on the Dream Suite after 47 uploads., Joan is a brown boar, and can be found wandering around the town from 6 AM to noon on Sundays. You can buy Turnips from her for between 90 - 110 Bells. You can then sell these Turnips at some point during the week to make a profit. The Turnips will spoil at 6 AM on the next Sunday.

It is possible that you won't be able to get a price for the Turnips that makes up the cost of you buying the,.

, Storing your Turnips will allow you to easily access them in other players' towns, which is the best way to make a big profit on them. Just make sure you don't forget about them., Talk to Reese at Re-Tail to find out what the Turnip buying price is. This price will change every morning and at noon, so make sure to check twice daily., The best way to make money on Turnips is to try selling them in your friends' towns. This is because every town has a locked price pattern for the week, and access to other towns increases your chances of finding a good pattern., You want to sell your Turnips when the prices are at the highest, netting the greatest return on your investment. There are four different patterns that the pricing of Turnips in your town may take for the week:Decreasing - The price will start between 50 - 99 Bells, and will slowly decrease throughout the week. If the price hasn't increased at all by Thursday, sell your Turnips for whatever you can get.
Small or Big Spikes - The price will start by decreasing, but will then spike up several times throughout the week. A Big Spike will have three spikes of increasing value, with the third spike being the most money you will get. Small Spikes have four spikes that increase in value, with the fourth spike being the maximum amount.
Random - Sometimes prices will jump back and forth between 50 and 200 Bells. This is a random pattern, and can't really be predicted. There are always a couple of times that the price will be 110, which will make you your money back.

, This cat, Rover, will initiate conversation with you. While seemingly inconsequential at times, every response that you choose will have an impact on the game.

, First, you give your name, then you’ll have the option of correcting your name should you want to change it, or prompting Rover on your name being “Cool” or “Cute”.


Choosing “Cool” will default you to male gender and choosing “Cute” will default you to female gender. It will take you to another dialogue option where you can either confirm the assumed gender or tell Rover that he got it wrong.

, Rover will ask where you’re heading, which is your opportunity to name your town. Once you have the name confirmed, Rover will show you a map and ask if that’s the town you’re talking about.


Rover will show you four maps total and you must choose one of them.
Map type is simply up to your preference. Any given map will always have a river that goes through your town and a couple of ponds. In these maps, you’ll see the locations of the Town Hall, event square, Re-Tail, and current villager houses (though you won’t know where new villagers might choose to move in).

, From here, Rover will ask you a series of questions about your travel. These answers dictate what kind of face your character will have.


There are 12 different face types in total (these different face types include different eyes, noses, and hairstyles).
While later on in the game you have the potential to change your hairstyle and eye color, you cannot change the face type that you have.
Once you’re done speaking with Rover, the train will drop you off your town.

, If you are the first person to move into the town, which you will be if you’re the first one to play the game, then Isabelle and a handful of villagers will greet you. They assume that you’re they’re new mayor!


There’s no way of getting out of this, so just enjoy your newfound mayoral status. If you aren’t the first person to move into the town, then you simply become another resident.

, The game will direct towards the Town Hall, so continue speaking with Isabelle, your assistant. The Town Hall is noted on your map by a purple building.


Head there using the directional stick. Enter, and talk to Isabelle by pressing “A”. She’ll tell you that you need to build a home, and will refer you to Tom Nook.

, Tom Nook is located at Nook’s Homes on Main Street, which is just past the train tracks at the north end of your town. Once you’re on Main Street, you can see Nook’s Homes on the map as a blue building with a pink home icon on top of it. Go in there and talk to Nook in order to get a building!

, Once you’re ready, Nook will walk back to town with you in order for you to pick a spot for your home. You can pick anywhere you want, as long as there’s enough room.


When you’re standing on a spot you like, talk to Nook again and he will give you a preview of what your house would look like there.

, Tom Nook is a bit stingy; he’ll only starts you off with a tent and says you’ll need to pay him 10,000 bells in order to upgrade to a house.


10,000 bells is a lot for a beginner, so you’ll need to farm for bells by selling fruit (Part 3) or digging for fossils (Part 4).

, Planting the Town Tree isn't optional, but it is a nice event to really solidify your new status as mayor of this town. Isabelle will prompt you during the ceremony to plant the tree, which you will accomplish via pressing “A”.

, Get fruits by standing next to a fruit-bearing tree and pressing “A” to shake the tree and cause the fruit to fall to the ground. Then press “Y” next to each fallen fruit to pick it up and put it in your inventory.

, Head over to Re-Tail once your inventory is full, denoted on your map by a pink recycle sign, and sell it all off!

, Fossils require a bit more work. First, you need a shovel. You should be able to purchase a shovel from the Convenience Store on Main Street for 500 bells. While you do want to be saving bells, the purchase of any tool (including bug net and fishing rod) should be considered an investment that’s well worth your while.


When you buy the shovel, you can opt to hear instructions on how to use it.

, To find fossils, look for little star marks on the ground in your town. Once you see one, equip the shovel by dragging it onto your character from the inventory screen.

, Stand next to the star and press “A” to dig. If you hit your mark, your character will dig up a fossil!

, However, these fossils are beyond your knowledge, and you’ll need to go get them appraised before they’re worth selling for bells. In order to appraise fossils, head over to the museum on Main Street. The museum is on the far left of the map.


If it’s daytime, the owl inside will be sleeping, but it’s no problem to wake him up by talking to him. He’ll introduce himself as Blathers and explain a bit about the museum if it’s your first time talking to him.
Once prompted, ask him to assess your fossils. Blathers will then tell you what types of fossils you have.

, In order to unlock features such as public works projects and ordinance, you will need to reach 100% approval rating as mayor. In order to see what your approval rating is, speak with Isabelle when she is standing behind the counter in Town Hall and ask her about citizen satisfaction.


She will also give you tips on how to increase your rating.

, Changing the town tune can be found as an option in conversation with Isabelle.


This is 3 points. Points are handed out first time only.

, Re-Tail has empty spots in its store for villagers and you to sell goods. If you want to sell something, simply have it in your inventory and then stand next to one of those empty spots and press “A”.


Reese, the llama that runs the store, will ask if you have something you’d like to put up. Say yes, choose the item you want, set a price, and you’re set!
This is 3 points. Points are handed out first time only.

, This is also found as an option in conversation with Isabelle.


This is 3 points. Points are handed out first time only.

, The bulletin board is located next to the train station. Anyone who visits your town can read bulletin board posts, so while it doesn’t matter what you write, it’s good form to keep it tasteful and leave out personally identifying information.


This is 3 points. Points are handed out first time only.

, We've already been over assessing fossils. You may remember that the other option when speaking with Blathers is to make a donation. Blathers will accept any fish, bug, assessed fossil, or genuine (not the fakes the Redd sometimes sells) art that isn't already on display.


This is 3 points. Points are handed out first time only.

, Pulling weeds keeps the town looking nice and nets you points in approval. To pull a weed, stand next to it and press “Y”. Once you start playing regularly, you’ll see less weeds in your town; that’s a good thing!


This is 1 point per weed.

, Water flowers by equipping the watering can and pressing “A” when next to a flower. You can water a flower when it’s perfectly healthy or if it’s dying (greyed out).


You’ll know a flower has been watered because afterwards it will shine with little water sparkles.
This is 1 point per day.

, Sometimes, when you fish, you will get junk items. Every time you get one, which is random, you’ll get a point.


This is 1 point per trash.

, This involves finding all of the villagers in your town and speaking with them once by pressing “A” when standing next to them. You’ll net one point per villager. Plus, once you’ve introduced yourself, you have the potential to receive requests from them.


You’ll get 1 point each.

, You can send letters to any villager by grabbing some stationary, sold in the Convenience Store. Then, from your inventory panel, tap on the paper and choose write a letter.


You’ll be prompted to choose who you want to send the letter to. Once you choose a recipient, you’ll get to type the message.
Villagers often like when they get sent letters, especially if you attached a present! They will, however, also show anyone else they can find the letters that you send them, so be aware of that.
You will get 1 point each.

, This is the easy, passive way to receive approval! You’ll get up to 3 points per day.


Once you do have 100% approval, which shouldn't take more than a couple of days as long as you’re doing some of the things noted above, then you can go and sit in the mayor chair and Isabelle will tell you about public works projects and ordinances.

, Check it every time you log in. If there’s a new post on the bulletin board, you’ll see a little bird sitting on top of it. If there’s no bird, then you can safely move along knowing that there is nothing new.


If there is a bird, make sure to look! The bulletin board is where town events get announced. Sometimes, there will be sales in the shops on Main Street. Other times, there may be a fishing tournament coming up in a week or so.

, Buy and sell items at the shops. The Convenience Store upgrades over time when you spend certain amounts of money there. The shoe store will open up once you’ve spent a set amount of bells at the Able Sisters shop.


Also, donate items to Blathers. Once you’ve donated one of each type (one bug, one fish, one fossil, and one piece of art), he will talk about opening up a museum shop.
Essentially, if you want things to improve, be willing to spend your money and time cultivating the shops on Main Street.

, Animal Crossing incorporates a number of real life holidays that offer unique events in-game and often the ability to gather fun sets of furniture.


For example, on Easter, a bunny will appear in town and will send you on an egg hunt. Participating results in a set of egg-related furniture.

, Every day, there will be one rock on your map that, when hit with a shovel, produces bells. The number of bells that you receive is based off the hidden Luck stat.


An easy way to keep making money is thus to equip your shovel and go around hitting every rock you find until one gives you a set of bells. Then, hit it until it stops giving you bells.

, The Town Square is where you planted the town tree and it’s an important location to be aware of and check every day. When you hit holidays, that’s where characters will appear and events will be held. Otherwise, there are two visitors that can randomly set up a tent on your Town Square.


This includes Crazy Redd, who sells art. Beware, however, as a good portion of his art is fake and thus won’t be accepted by Blathers for donation in the museum. There is also Katrina, a fortune-telling cat who will tell your fortune for a small bell fee.

, On Sunday, from 6am to noon, a character named Joan will show up and wander around your village. She sells turnips for a random price. If you like the price she’s selling at, you can buy them and then attempt to sell them at Re-Tail during the week.


Selling and buying prices are both random. So while it is possible to make a large profit, it is also possible to operate at a loss.
When speaking with Reese at Re-Tail, you can choose to ask her about turnip prices. Make sure you know what you bought yours for. If she’s offering more, then enjoy the extra bells. If she’s offering less, you may want to hold on to your turnips for a little longer to see if she’ll offer more another day.

, There are various possibilities in Animal Crossing to discover; play the game and enjoy yourself!"
"
Spend 8,000 bells at the Able Sisters’ shop.,
Have Kicks built in your town.,
Wait 10 Days and spend 10,000 bells.,
Have Shampoodle built.",How to Get Shampoodle in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," Most items for sale at Able Sisters ring in around 200–300 bells a piece, so this will require you to buy quite a bit.


You could save these wardrobe choices in your closet to prepare for Gracie’s fashion checks, gift them to your villagers, or you could simply sell them back at Re-Tail for a loss.
By spending money in the shop, you are supporting the town’s local economy and enabling the Kicks shop to open next door.;
, Kicks will be built in your town as long as it has been at least 10 days since you first started the game and created your town.


Kicks sells shoes and socks, which are important items to have down the road to coordinate for Gracie’s fashion checks.

, The 10,000-bell requirement can be split between Kicks and Able Sisters.

, Once you’ve spent 10,000 bells and waited 10 more days, Shampoodle will be built on top of Able Sisters.


Shampoodle will take 4 days to be built, and once it’s done, you can enjoy tweaking your character’s appearance.

Avoid the sun.,
Wear a lot of clothes.,
Wait a few days.",How to Get Rid of a Tan in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," Your tan fades and disappears as long as you’re not exposed to the bright summer sun, which means you need to avoid it. The simplest way to do so is by staying indoors or using an umbrella during noontime in the entire summer period or when visiting the Island. Keeping away from the sun ensures that you don’t get darker and will slowly let your tan fade away.


Exploring during cloudy or rainy days counts as avoiding exposure to the sun, and you can go out and explore without jeopardizing your tan removal.
Between 10 AM and 4 PM is the point where you have the most sun out, so you can safely run around outside of this time period.;
, You can also halt or remove the progression of your tan by equipping certain clothes and accessories. Hats are your best bet, as well as wearing clothes that cover most of your body, like dresses and long-sleeved tops.

, Of course, you’ll need a few days for it to disappear completely. It takes about 15 days for the darkest level of tanning to fade away, which means you need approximately 3 days to lighten your skin by 1 level. Of course, this does not take frequent ventures into the sun without protection into account. If you insist in running out without an umbrella at noon, this will certainly take longer to get rid of the tan.

Find Joan.,
Talk to Joan.,
Get a red turnip seed from her.,
Plant the red turnip seed.,
Water the seed.,
Allow your turnip to grow.,
Dig up your red turnips.,
Talk to Tom Nook.",How to Get Red Turnips in Animal Crossing," Every week, Joan will appear in your Animal Crossing town. To find her, make sure that you check the entire outdoor map by running around.


Joan will only appear on Sunday from 6AM to 12PM.
If you have time traveled, then Joan will NOT be selling her red turnip seeds, and there is no way for you to purchase one until following week (provided that you don’t time travel again).;
, Once you’ve found Joan in your town, talk to her by pressing “A.” She will have options to buy either white turnips or red turnips.

, To acquire a red turnip seed, choose the option for red turnips.


Red turnip seed cost 1,000 bells.

, Unlike white turnips, which Joan sells to the player as grown turnips, the red turnips come in seed form only. This means that you will need to plant the seed and let it grow before you can reap the benefits.


To plant the seed, dig a hole (by pressing “Y”) outside with your shovel and plant the bag of red turnip seeds.
The red turnips take 6 days to grow fully.

, To water the red turnip seed, simply equip your watering can, stand next to the turnip, and press “A.”


Red turnip seeds must be watered every day.
If you don’t water the red turnip every day, it will wither and die, and you will make no money off of it.
Overwatering is also harmful to the red turnip, so you will have to be precise and take care to water it once and only once every day for 6 days.

, Your profit is based directly on how long you allowed the red turnip to grow. The following illustrates how the number of days the seed has been planted affects its selling price:


0 days (same day as planted) — 2 bells
1 day (day after it was planted) — 100 bells
2 days — 500 bells
3 days — 2,000 bells
4 days — 4,000 bells
5 days — 8,000 bells
6 days — 16,000 bells

, Once your red turnip is grown, simply equip your shovel and press “Y” next to the red turnip to dig it up. Then with the red turnip in your inventory, head over to Tom Nook’s store.

, Do this by pressing “A,” and you will be able to sell him your red turnip.

Check your letter slots.,
Buy some paper.,
Make letters.,
Put items in the letters.",How to Get More Room to Hold Items in Animal Crossing," First, open up your inventory by pressing X. Once that is open, you should see a little letter icon in the upper left-hand area (when looking at the bottom screen). Just tap the letter icon, and your letters will pop up.


If you do not have any letters, then you will need to buy some. If you do already have a complete set of letters (there are ten slots), feel free to skip to Step 4.;
, Visit Nook’s shop on Main Street. Every day, there will be some paper for sale. The packs of paper always cost 160 bells, so you should be able to afford it.


Each pack contains four pieces of paper, which translate to four letters. If you’re starting with no letters in your slots, then you will need to repeat this a few times.
You will also passively get letters over time from villagers and your mom. So if you want to, you can also just wait for those.

, Once you have paper in your inventory, tap on it and choose to write a letter. It is easiest to choose to write a letter to your future self since it is the first option on the list, but it is not necessary.


You will then see the keyboard, and have the opportunity to compose a message, but since you’re not actually going to send these letters, you don’t really need to fill out a message. Just hit “Done.”

, Now, these letters should show up in your letter slots, and you can free up space in your inventory by dragging items onto the letters. This will cause the letter to have a present icon next to it.


It can be particularly nice to place all of your tools into the letters, especially those that you don’t use frequently since they take up a fair amount of your inventory space. Then, if you need to access those items or tools again, simply tap on the letter, and choose “Present.” The item will then move from the letter back into your main inventory.

Make sure you know about the tour office storage box.",How to Get on Tortimer Island in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," Upgrade from a tent to a house and pay off all debt.
, When you start your game, you will find Isabelle telling you about him. Be sure to go to the dock to talk to him., Go to the dock again and talk with Kapp'n. He will give you a round trip ride for 1,000 bells.

Kapp'n's story can be skipped at a rapid pace by pressing the X, Y, A, or B buttons.

, Anything that you wish to carry from the island to town, you must place it in the box before leaving the island. This box can store up to 40 items and all stored items will ""transfer"" to a different box, located on the town dock."
"
Go to the island.,
Go on an Easy Tour.,
Pick lots of flowers.,
Put the flowers in the basket.,
Repeat the process.,
Return home.,
Get the flowers from the basket.,
Use the flowers.",How to Get Free Flowers in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," You can reach the island by going to the docks in your village, which are found on the south beach. When you get there, talk to Kapp’n. He will take you to the island in exchange for 1,000 bells.;
, There are a number of tours that you can participate in while on the island. These tours are just mini-games. You can choose any of the tours, except for ones that require you to use tools.


Take note that some tours are better than the others. For example, the Easy Gardening Tour involves a very high number of flowers present on the map, whereas the Hide and Seek Tour will have fewer flowers present on the map.
Talk to the frog behind the counter in the upper-left area of the room that you arrive in when you first get to the island. She will ask you if you want to go on a tour or return home. This is one potential way to take a tour.

, Once you are on the tour, you can ignore the objective of the mini-game, and instead run around and pick flowers until your inventory is full. This trick works for fruit as well.


Once your inventory is full, you can go ahead and complete the objective of the tour if you have time. Otherwise, you can just go talk to Tortimer, who remains in the center of the map, and tell him that you’re done. This will take you back to the hut on the island.

, Remember that items in your inventory will not travel back to town with you; you need to put them in the basket.


Interact with the basket by standing next to it, and pressing A. Next, you would need to drag and drop all of the flowers from your inventory into the basket.

, The basket has a lot more space in it than your character’s inventory does, so you can repeat Steps 2 to 4 until the basket is full.

, Once your basket is entirely filled with flowers, you can return home knowing that you’ve done all you can for this island trip. Talk to the frog behind the counter that has been sending you on tours, and this time just tell her you want to go home.

, When you arrive back at the docks in your village, you can interact with the basket there in the same way as you’ve done before, and you will see all of the flowers that you collected.

, You are now free to use the flowers however you wish! Simply take them out of the basket, drag them back into your inventory, and you’ll be able to sell them, plant them, gift them, and what have you.


You can go to the island an unlimited number of times in a day, so if you still want more flowers, feel free to go back and just keep repeating these steps. You’ll have an impressive flower garden before you know it!

Talk to the villagers often.,
Listen to them.,
Do the requests.,
Buy tools (optional but useful).",How to Get Free Furniture in Animal Crossing1," Villagers, or the funny animals walking around in town and greeting you, are important members of the community. Each one is just dying to befriend you! Simply press A when around them (or tap the villager in Wild World and New Leaf), and select the first dialogue option to get them talking! The more you talk to them, they more they’ll trust you.
, Each and every villager has their own interests and opinions, and while they all fall within 4 personality groups per gender, they all still have their personal interests and unique requests. Make sure you listen to their dialogue closely, and talk to them often.

Sometimes, if you befriend them well enough, they will start handing out furniture for no other reason than friendship! Usually, you can tell if you’re good friends if they always make a surprised animation (exclamation point over the head, cheery “surprise” lines) and immediately walk towards you. The more often this happens, the closer you are to that villager.

, Different villagers have different requests and interests. Some might challenge you to a fishing or bug-catching competition, some might ask you to trade items, and some might just ask you to take a letter or item to another villager. If you’re in the middle of a request or just finished the request, when you talk to the villager who gave or is related to the request, the two options when talking turn into three, with the first option simply either asking about the request or to hand over the requested item. If you hand over the right item, you’ll get a random reward from the villager, usually some furniture!

It sometimes takes a while and some effort to fulfill the requests, like fishing or digging up fossils with your shovel. Other times, you’ll have to give up something from your inventory. But sometimes it’s just as simple as delivering letters or answering them correctly. Don’t be shy when talking to your villagers!

, A Tool would help broaden the scope of your requests, since certain villagers are more into certain hobbies, like bug catching or digging for fossils, than asking you to deliver letters. Tools can be bought for 500 Bells each in the town store, run by Tom Nook or, in New Leaf, Tommy and Timmy. In the previous games, the store is placed randomly in each individual town, but in New Leaf, it’s found in Main Street.

The commonly used Tools you could buy are Shovels, Axes, Nets, and Fishing Rods. Other tools are available in certain games: Watering Cans, Slingshots, and Timers are available from Wild World onwards. Shopping Cards are available only in City Folk, and Tweeters, Megaphones, Hammers and Wet Suits are only currently available in New Leaf.

Go around and locate the money rock.,
Create more money by saving up.

,
Insert any tips you guys have.

",How to Get More Money from the Money Rock in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," It varies to any rock. At every rock, dig to holes to the side, but not next to it (it blocks the bells). Hit the A button as fast and well timed as you can. When you have collected the bells which should be more than 8,100, walk around and find the ore rock. The ore rock is that one rock that wasn't there yesterday. Hit it and an ore will come out. The ore varies. They are all 2,000-5,000 bells. Go to the retail store and sell.;

Know which trees to shake.,
Shake the tree.,
Pick up your loot.,
Watch out for bees.",How to Get Free Furniture in Animal Crossing2," The trees you’d want to shake down are the ones without any fruit hanging on the branches. They come in 2 variants, the upright “triangular” cedar and the traditional branched oak., Go up to the tree and press A (or tap them in Wild World and New Leaf) to shake the tree, and if you’re lucky, you’ll have either a Bell bag or a leaf (signifying a piece of furniture) fall down to the ground!

You can also shake down fruit trees for their fruits as well, not only is it a good way to make quick money early on, sometimes a villager will request a fruit and give you a reward, hopefully furniture, in return.

, Do this by pressing B (or by tapping them again in WW and NL), and enjoy!, There are about 5 Beehives hidden in two random trees per day too, and if you disturb them they start stinging! But don’t worry, all that happens is that you’ll get a miserable expression on your face and a swollen eye, which could be removed by buying medicine from the town store or by saving and quitting your game, and then playing again."
"
Check the mailbox.,
Open the mail.,
Pull up the inventory.,
Open the present.",How to Get Free Furniture in Animal Crossing3," When a letter arrives, a tiny blue blinking icon appears over your house’s mailbox. Interact with it by pressing A (or tapping in WW and NL), and you can see an unopened letter at the side of the screen that pops up.

If the letter has a present in it, the letter icon will have a tiny gift box added to the graphics!

, Select the mail by scrolling with your D-pad (or tapping), and select the “Read” option to see what they said.

If you’re impatient though, you can skip the reading bit, and backtrack with the B button or selecting the “Cancel” button.

, Whether you choose to read it or not, pull up your inventory ( - on City Folk, X in New Leaf, and Y in both the original and Wild World versions). You’ll see your mail in a separated section of the inventory. Select the letter, and select the “Present” option. It will drop a wrapped gift box in your main inventory., Select the present and choose “Open,” and if whoever sent it was feeling extra generous, you’ll find yourself with some new furniture!"
"
Keep up-to-date on events.,
Join the event.,
Win the event.",How to Get Free Furniture in Animal Crossing4," When an event its about to happen, you will be notified through mail or by other characters. Some events line up to actual international holidays (Christmas, Valentine’s Day, Mother’s/Father’s Day, etc.), but some are catered for the game itself., Some events in the games can only be participated in if you join, and you can do that when you talk to Tortimer after you find out about the event, and he’ll offer you the details and even give you some tips!, Mechanics on winning will depend on the type of event. Find out all you can about the event from Tortimer or online sources, and do your best to win it. You might get furniture for your efforts!"
"
Go to the Dump or Recycle Bin.,
Check the Dump or Recycle Bin for free items.,
Grab them before it clears out!",How to Get Free Furniture in Animal Crossing5," Animal Crossing has the Dump, which is a fenced-off area where you can literally just drop items into, Wild World and City Folk has a Recycle Bin located in the Town Hall.

New Leaf replaces the Dump and Recycling Bin with Re-Tail, where you can sell off all unwanted objects and get rid of trash for a fee of 80 Bells. Villagers sell their furniture off there sometimes, but it still requires you to purchase them instead of simply grabbing what you want.

, When you head to the Dump in the original Animal Crossing, the items are just scattered on the ground to be picked up as you please! In Wild World and City Folk, you check the Recycle Bin by pressing A to open it, and the bin’s inventory opens on top of your inventory window., While in the Dump, you can pick items up with the B button, since they’re just lying on the floor. In City Folk and Wild World, once you open the Recycle Bin, you can put useless items there (pitfall seeds, tires, boots, etc.) from your errand running, and take the items that you like and put it into your own inventory. The Recycle Bin clears out every Monday and Thursday at 6 AM, so better make sure you grab all the items you like before then!"
"
Head to the Lost and Found.,
Talk to the dog manning the Lost and Found.,
Find for lost items around town and return it to the owner.",How to Get Free Furniture in Animal Crossing6," In all the games, you have a Lost and Found station manned by a dog. In Animal Crossing, it’s found in the Police Station (like the town store, it is located randomly in each town); and in City Folk and Wild World, it’s stationed in the Gate, at the very back of the town. In New Leaf, you need to build it as a Public Works Project once a random Villager requests it, and costs 264,000 Bells., Every now and then you can approach the dog and inquire if there are any items in the Lost and Found. If the dog replies that there are items, you can choose to pick and take items in the Lost and Found inventory without consequence, since the items are randomly generated and don’t actually belong to anyone.

In all games preceding New Leaf, the dog manning the Lost and Found is a mournful-looking and shy dog named Booker. In New Leaf, you could choose between Booker and Copper (a more confident-looking dog) when creating the Police Station as a Public Works Project by picking if you want a Modern or a Classic Police Station when building it. A Modern Police station has Copper manning it, while the Classic one has Booker.
In New Leaf, to build a Police Station you need a Villager to request it and costs 264,000 bells.

, In New Leaf, you can also look for lost items scattered around town. They look like a mitten, a paper bag with a bear stamp, a book, or a blue bag with yellow string. If you return it to the owner before the day is done, they will reward you with fruit, a picture of themselves, clothes, Bells, or furniture! So be neighborly and give back those items!"
"
Wait for the time.,
Shoot it down.,
Open the gift.",How to Get Free Furniture in Animal Crossing7," Every time your clock’s time ends with 4 (12:14, 8:34, 3:44, etc.), a balloon starts floating in the sky with a gift box tied to it., How to shoot down or get the balloon depends on the game (listed below). If you manage to get one, you’ll find yourself owning a random item, including furniture.

In Animal Crossing, you need to follow the balloon until it gets caught in a tree. Shaking the tree drops the gift box.
From Wild World to New Leaf, you’ll need a Slingshot, which can be bought from the town store for 500 Bells. You don’t need to aim, simply use the slingshot by pressing A in both games or tapping yourself on Wild World, and you’ll immediately shoot it down, dropping the present somewhere in the town.
In New Leaf, if you’re by the Beach Cliff area when the balloon starts floating by, head to the very top and start whacking with your Shovel, Axe, or Net, since it descends near your character at that area.

, Like with the present from a Letter, you’ll find the wrapped gift box in your inventory when you pick it up. Simply select it and choose “Open,” and then you can receive your free item!"
"
Get a spade, and get digging!,
Take a moonlight boat ride to Tortimer's!,
Go fishing at Tortimer's!",How to Get Bells on Animal Crossing: New Leaf," You often see, around your town, star shaped holes. Use your spade, (purchased for 500 bells) to dig these up. There will be an item under these holes, sometimes a fossil or a gyroid. If you find you have dug up a fossil, go to your local museum, (found in plaza) and talk to Blathers. Tell him you want him to 'Asses a fossil'. He will ask if you would consider donating it. When this event occurs, tell him no. Nothings better than telling an owl no, right?


Once you've got the fossil assessed, sell it at the Re-tail. Do not sell it at Timmy and Tommy's shop, as they will give you a lower price. If you have more than one fossil to sell, do not sell them together as you will get a lower price for sure. If you get a gyroid, sell it at the Re-tail. They usually sell for 850 bells.;
, If you have unlocked Tortimer's island, go there at night, (8:00pm or later) and catch some bugs. Catch the bugs on the palm trees, not the regular or mango trees. If it helps, cut down the regular/mango trees with an axe. You can borrow one from Lloyd, the gyroid. Some of the bugs on the palm trees can be worth up to 12500 bells EACH. And by the way, if you don't want to sit around waiting til 8:00pm, you can always change the time in your settings.

, If you have unlocked Tortimer's island, go there. It doesn't matter what time. Fish will be worth more if they are not from your town. If you want even MORE bells for a fish, try going for a shark? Oh, and if you find a Horse Mackerel, do yourself a favor and throw it back in the sea. They are practically worthless!

Upgrade your convenience store.,
Know the different clothing themes.,
Know the clashing themes.,
Have extra clothes nearby.,
Check the theme of clothes.,
Check the theme of accessories.,
Check the theme of shoes.,
Have Gracie fashion-check you.,
Assemble your outfit.,
Return to Gracie.",How to Get Gracie to Like You in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," There is a requirement you must meet in order for Gracie to visit your town: Your convenience store must be at the third upgrade, the Home Center.


To get the Home Center (T.I.Y), you need to have spent 50,000 bells in the shop and waited 21 days since you got the Super T&T, the second upgrade. Once you have T.I.Y, Gracie will be able to visit.
Gracie’s visits are, however, rare, so you may find yourself waiting a long time before you see her. To make sure you don’t miss her, play every day and check the area around the town square thoroughly!;
, Since Gracie will only like you if you pass her fashion check, you must know the different clothing themes that she’ll ask you to wear. Clothing can belong to one of ten different themes: basic, cute, historical, iconic, flashy, modern, official, ornate, rock n’ roll, or sporty.


Often times, it is easy to use common sense to figure out which theme any given piece of clothing will belong to.

, Certain themes can clash with one another. If Gracie tells you to follow the basic theme and you wear something rock n’ roll or flashy along with your other basic clothes, that counts as clashing. Below is a list of clashing themes:


Rock n’ roll and flashy clash with the basic theme.
Nothing clashes with the cute theme.
Nothing clashes with the historical theme.
Nothing clashes with the iconic theme.
Official and basic clash with the flashy theme.
Nothing clashes with the modern theme.
Sporty, rock n’ roll and flashy all clash with the official theme.
Nothing clashes with the ornate theme.
Official and basic clash with the rock n’ roll theme.
Official clashes with the sporty theme.

, Once Gracie has given you a theme, you can strategize on how to pass her check. For these purposes, it is very useful to have a variety of clothing options on hand. You can keep extra clothing on the floor in your home or stored in dressers for a tidier house.

, Before you purchase clothes, accessories, or shoes, you can actually get hints on what type of theme they belong to. Inside the Able Sister’s shops, when you click on an article of clothing by pressing “A” but before you choose any dialogue options, Mable will give you some commentary on the clothes.


As an example, she can say, “The sporty vibe of the rally tank is nice, right?” where “sporty” is the theme and “rally tank” is the name of the item. These will change depending on what you’ve clicked on.

, On the accessory side of the Able Sister’s shop, you will need to try on the item before Labelle will tell you what theme it belongs to. Once you’ve tried on the item, Labelle will say, “Oh wow, that look is great on you.” Then you have the option as to whether or not you’d like to buy it.


You can try on an accessory by standing next to it then pressing “A.”

, Inside Kick’s shop for shoes and socks, you simply need to stand next to the item and press “A,” and Kick will say, “Fan of the look?”

, Once Gracie visits, talk to her by pressing “A.” She will tell you that she can fashion-check you. Then, she will select a theme at random. The theme will be indicated by blue lettering in your dialogue.


As an example, she might say “Keep it basic!” and basic will be in blue, telling you that that’s the theme she will be judging you on.
Your outfit is composed of everything you are wearing: pants/skirt and shirt or dress, socks, shoes, and any hats and accessories. Even if you cannot see your socks, they do count towards the check.

, Once you know the theme, you should attempt to find and wear as many pieces of clothing that fit that theme.


If you cannot assemble a full outfit out of that theme alone, you can supplement your outfit with pieces from other themes as long as that theme doesn’t clash. Only most of the pieces of your outfit need to fit the theme, not all.

, Once you’re wearing the clothes closest to Gracie’s theme, speak to Gracie again. She will then evaluate your outfit according to the theme she chose.


Once you pass her check, it will count towards your Nookling Store upgrade, and Gracie will give you a piece of furniture or clothing for being stylish.
You have three chances to pass the test. If you fail all three times, you will have to wait until the next time Gracie visits. Also, if you fail to pass before midnight, Gracie will leave, and you will have to wait until her next visit.

You have to unlock the island, which happens when you meet Tortimer, the old mayor. He will appear after you expand your home at least once.
Note that you can't bring items to the Island. You will have to borrow them. However, you can ""sneak"" your diving suit there by wearing it to the Island, then taking it off when you arrive.;
, Fish in the sea surrounding the Island, and go diving. You can rent items from Lloid, the gyroid, who is located outside the Island hut. Keep in mind of the fish that are worth more bells in the following:

Hammerhead Shark (8,000 bells)
Blue Marlin (10,000 bells)
Napoleonfish (10,000 bells)
Saw Shark (12,000 bells)
Whale Shark (13,000 bells)
Shark (15,000 bells)

, Deposit Box is in the Island Hut. Next to the counter, there will be a box. This is the Deposit Box. You use it to store all of the items you wish to take back to town with you.

Note that if you try to leave the Island with items in your inventory, you will be warned that the items will be exchanged for Bells and put in your ABD account.
Filter out the fish. If your Deposit Box can't take any more items, sell the fish that are sold at a low price to Leila. Even though Leila doesn't offer the full price as you would sell at the stores in town, you're better off making less than not earning any from releasing the fish.
Another option is to fill half of the Deposit Box with fish, because you will be catching valuable bugs later.

, Cut down all the trees, dig up the bushes, and remove the flowers from every part of the island. This insures that any non-beetles do not make up the majority of the island. After that, plant as many coconuts as possible. Wait 3 days. If you are in a hurry, save and quit the game. When you start up again, skip three days ahead. Your coconut trees will be ready for use. Now that it's mentioned, come back in the evening to start collecting your loot., To insure you make more money in a shorter amount of time, be careful not to scare the beetles! A good rule of thumb is to catch the beetles while outside the tree's shadows and sneaking simultaneously. To sneak, equip your net and press and hold the A button.

There is a special, very rare bug called the Golden Stag. This bug is worth 10,000 Bells at Re-Tail. If you happen to see this bug, be very careful!

, Go inside the Island Hut. Next to the counter there will be a box. This is the Deposit Box. You use it to store all of the items you wish to take back to town with you., Re-Tail is located at the recycling symbol on your map screen when you are in your town. Depending on what you choose to focus on, you may be able to make even more than 100,000 bells in one run.

Don't sell the items to Timmy and Tommy. Your items will sell for more at Re-Tail.

, Inside will be an ATM-like machine. This is the ABD, the Automatic Bell Deposit. You can use the ABD to deposit/withdraw your bells and pay off your debts to Tom Nook., When you continue on your profile for New Leaf, there is always a money rock and an ore rock.

Hit all of the rocks in town with your shovel or axe. Try to memorize where each rock is, so you can easily find the fake ore rock. One of the existing rocks in town will be the money rock. You will know you have hit the money rock if the rock moves when you hit it and Bells (or ore) come out.
If you happen to be lucky, the money rock will give you ore instead of Bells.

, Sell the fruit to Reese.

You can carry more fruit by planting an orchard. Find a big space and plant as many fruit trees as possible. When you harvest, drag the same types of fruit into one space in your inventory. The fruit will stack up. The stack will hold up to nine fruits.

, Chances are that you might shake a tree and have some Bells fall out! However, You can also shake out a beehive. To avoid being stung, run into the nearest building. When you come out retrieve the beehive and sell it to Re-Tail."

Wait for summer.,
Head to the Island.,
Get out a lot.,
Check your clothes.,
Get a Mii Mask.",How to Get a Tan in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," The best time you can get and maintain a tan is during Summer, and the Summer period of the game lasts from July 16 to September 15. After that, your tan fades away, and you can’t maintain it until the next summer rolls around.;
, If you have unlocked and can afford to get to Tortimer’s Island on a regular basis, you can get and maintain a tan year-round by going there in the mornings. You can unlock the island by paying off the first house upgrade, and the following day you’ll be shown a scene. Afterwards, you can then take trips to the Island for 1000 Bells per round-trip.


You can make several round trips to the Island a day as long as you have enough Bells.

, Of course, you’ll need to get out a lot to get a tan. Leave your umbrellas behind, and get some sun on you! The best times to tan are from 10 AM to 4 PM, since it’s when the sun is out. In this particular version, you get darker every 15 minutes until you reach the darkest tan.


When you take a long break from the sun, your tan starts to fade. Staying inside, or venturing out on rainy or cloudy days would make your tan fade much more slowly than getting one. It takes roughly 15 days to go from the darkest tan to no tan at all, and requires you to stay indoors a lot or to use an umbrella constantly.

, Your clothes can determine how fast you’ll tan. Wearing clothes that cover most of your body like dresses and long-sleeved tops, hats, and most facial decorations can slow down or prevent tanning. So you’re better off wearing tank tops or short-sleeved shirts, shorts and skirts if you want to tan.

, If all of this sounds too much effort, just get a Mii Mask with a tanned skin color! You’ll have to make a Mii first in the Mii Maker available in your 3DS, and select a darker skin color, but once you have one, you can head on over to Shampoodle and ask for a makeover. It costs 3000 Bells, and uses a Mii you have stored in your unit. This will only change the color of your face and head. Your actual body would show your actual tan levels, and any hat and face accessories will be removed when equipping a Mii Mask, so make sure you have enough free space for your stuff when you equip it.


To unlock Shampoodle, you need to spend a total of 10,000 Bells between the Able Sisters’ Store and Kicks, and have Kicks open for at least 7 days before building Shampoodle. It’ll take 4 days to be built, and can be found above the Able Sisters’ Store in Main Street.
You can put on your Mii Mask via the Designs window, which you can access by pressing Y and tapping the pencil icon with your stylus. Just select your Mii Mask from the window, and you can walk around with a new face.
You can change the mask for 3000 Bells in Shampoodle, or you can just edit the Mii it’s based on for free.

Get a shovel.,
Equip the shovel.,
Find the rock There are many rocks in the area, but it is impossible to know which one is the money, or bell, rock; its location is completely random.,
Dig a hole behind you.,
Hit the rock.,
Collect the bells.",How to Get Bells from Rocks in Animal Crossing New Leaf," Head to the Nookling Store—north, past the train station, and follow the cobblestone under the arch. The Nookling Store can be found to the left.


Check the center shelf where the tools are displayed. If you find a shovel on the shelf, stand in front of it and hit the “A” button. Timmy or Tommy will ask if you want to buy the shovel. Purchase the shovel for 500 bells.
If there is no shovel, you will have to either wait for a day to pass, or if you’re in a hurry, manually change the date yourself. To change the date, save the game and go to the start screen. Talk to Isabelle and ask to change the date.;
, Open the inventory with the “X” button, and hit “A” over the shovel to equip it.

, When you find a rock, stand in front of it.

, Whenever you hit a rock, you will be knocked back. To prevent this, turn around and dig a hole (“A” button) in the ground.

, Face the rock again after digging a hole, and hit it (“A” button). The hole will prevent you from being knocked back. If you strike a money rock, bells will come out. Continue striking the rock as fast as you can. The more you hit the rock, the more bells you will earn.


If the rock you hit is not a money rock, find another rock, dig a hole behind you, and hit it. Repeat this process until you hit the jackpot.

, After the rock ceases to yield bells, collect what it has dropped. DO NOT stop hitting the rock to collect bells! Wait until it is finished.


To add the bells to your wallet, stand over them and hit “Y.” When you have added the bells to your inventory, open up the menu with the “X” button, and use your stylus to drag the money icons to your main bell supply, which is located above your inventory on the right.

Buy a Slingshot.,
Wait for a balloon.,
Shoot the balloon down.,
Unwrap your present.",How to Get Balloon Furniture in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," Slingshots can be bought from the store for 500 Bells, like the other tools. You can equip it by opening your inventory with X, then dragging it to your character icon, or by pressing the left and right direction buttons.;
, Balloons appear every time the 3DS’s clock hits a time that ends with a 4. It can be 11:34, 3:44, or 5:04, as long as the last digit is 4. They originate from the far edges of your town, so keep an eye out for them. You can usually tell they’ve spawned when you hear a whistling sound.

, Now, when you see one, grab your Slingshot and press A! You might need to chase them down for a bit, but with good timing and persistence, you can definitely down that pesky balloon and loot the rewards.


Just a warning though: if you shoot it down over water or flowers, the present will be destroyed. The present can also be destroyed if it lands in the center of a 3x3 pattern layout. Your character will even make a shocked facial expression when that happens.
If you’re on the town cliffs near the beach, you can pop them with any tool since the balloon will be drifting quite close to the player at this point.

, Pick up the present with Y, then go to your inventory and select the item. Select the “Open” option, and you’ll get a random item from the Balloon Furniture set!


If you’ve popped enough Balloons, sometimes a Toolbox will be attached instead of a present, and will yield a Gold or Silver Slingshot instead. Silver Slingshots fire 2 rocks while Gold ones fire 3.

Wait for the right time.,
Go to the right place.,
Look for the shadow with a fin.,
Catch the shark.",How to Get a Shark in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," The shark only appears between the months of June and September. If you travel to the island, then the shark appears all year, but with the same time of day restrictions: the shark only appears between 4AM to 9AM or 4PM to 4AM.


Make sure you’ve got the right date and time; otherwise you have zero chances whatsoever of catching the shark.
If you really want a shark and it’s not the right time in the real world, you can always time-travel (manually change the date of your Animal Crossing town) to make it the right time.;
, The shark can only be fished up from the ocean. This means that you can use the ocean on the edges of your town, or the island.


Traveling to the island is accomplished by talking to Kapp’n at the docks on the southern edge of your town. For 1,000 bells he will take you to the island. Sharks appear more often on the island than they do in your town.

, The dreaded shadow that sharks make in the water is generally bigger than that of regular fish, and is most easily distinguished by the presence of a fin.


Now, the fin may indicate that you are indeed looking at a shark, but it can be a hammerhead shark or any of the other varieties. There is no guarantee that finding a finned shadow means you will catch “the shark” specifically.

, Once you’ve got your mark, equip your fishing rod, press “A” in order to use it, and cast your rod into the ocean.


The shark often requires more precision with the aim of your cast, so you may find yourself having to do it multiple times. This is because the shark will not take the bait unless it is right in front of it. Once the shark bites, press “A” to reel it in.

Check the store’s stock every day.,
Try on the clothes.,
Buy the shirt if you like it.,
Repeat trying on shirts and buying those you like until you have 5 shirts.",How to Get 5 Shirts from Sable in Animal Crossing: a New Leaf," The Able Sisters will offer different items every day. If you check on Monday and there’s nothing to your liking, then just come back on Tuesday. It’s no good to buy shirts that you don’t like.


To check the stock, simply walk into the store. All clothes will be displayed on mannequins.;
, If you’re not sure about a piece of clothing, walk up to it and press “A.” This will initiate a dialogue with Mable; choose the option that says you’d like to try it on.


Trying on clothes can sometimes give you a better idea of what the item really looks like.

, The real way to get 5 shirts is simply to buy 5 shirts that you like. Sable does not ever gift shirts to you in the course of Animal Crossing: A New Leaf.


Once you’ve found a shirt that you like, stand next to it and press “A,” initiating a dialogue with Mable. This time, choose the option that says you’d like to buy it. Provided that you have enough bells, you will hand a pouch of bells over to Mable, and the shirt will appear in your inventory (or if you tried the shirt on first, you have the option to wear it).
The cost of the shirt varies; most are 200 bells up each, so make sure you have enough money.

, It’s as easy as find and buy! Keep collecting different clothing items to keep your wardrobe varied and weather-appropriate.

Go to Nookington’s.,
Look for the separate room on the first floor of Nookington’s.,
Purchase a hairstyle package.",How to Find the Hair Salon in Animal Crossing1," Shampoodle first appeared in Animal Crossing: Wild World and has since appeared in all subsequent titles (as of a New Leaf). Shampoodle is located inside Tom Nook’s shop in Animal Crossing: Wild World, but Nook’s shop must have been upgraded to Nookington’s in order for Shampoodle to open.;
, Shampoodle is located in that room. There is a barber’s pole just outside the room that will let you know you’re in the right place.

, Harriet offers a hairstyle package for 3,000 bells with which you will get a new hairstyle and hair color.

"
"
Go to the city by bus.,
Purchase a hairstyle package.,
Get a makeover.",How to Find the Hair Salon in Animal Crossing2," Shampoodle returns in Animal Crossing: City Folk, but this time Harriet has her own building, as opposed to being attached to other structures as in a New Leaf and Wild World. Shampoodle is located in the city, and to reach the city you must take a bus.


To board the bus, simply run to center point of the north end of town. The bus will then drop you off in the city, where many shops are located.

, Harriet offers the same hair package as in the other titles for the same price of 3,000 bells.

, City Folk is the first time that Harriet offers the makeover, in which she makes you a Mii Mask based on any Miis created on your Wii.

"
"
Go to Main Street.,
Turn down the right street.,
Purchase a beauty-enhancing package.",How to Find the Hair Salon in Animal Crossing3," Shampoodle is located off Main Street in Animal Crossing: A New Leaf. As Main Street is just past the train tracks, just run north through the crossing and you will be on Main Street.

, Shampoodle is on the second floor, just above the Able Sisters shop.

, Harriet runs Shampoodle, and in a New Leaf she offers hairstyle changes, hair color changes, eye color changes, and makeup. However, you can only purchase one package per day.


The hairstyle package costs 3,000 bells and includes a style change and color change.
You can change your eye color; however, it must be 14 days since Shampoodle first opened. It then costs 3,000 bells, and changes your eye color. Your eye shape will remain the same though.
To get makeup, you need to have a Mii created on your DS. Harriet will then create a mask for your Animal Crossing character so that her face will look like your Mii’s face. You can choose between all of the Mii’s you have created. Makeup also costs 3,000 bells.

Donate to the Museum.,
Begin fundraising for the Museum Shop.,
Unlock the shop and buy it.",How to Find Silver and Gold Tools in Animal Crossing: New Leaf1," First things first, you need to donate to the Museum. To unlock the option to build the Museum Shop, you have to donate at least 20 things to the Museum, with at least one item from each of the four categories (art, fossils, fish, bugs.) Fossils can be dug up with a Shovel, fish can be caught with a fishing rod or by diving in the Island, and bugs can be caught all over town with a net. However, Art has to be bought from Crazy Redd.

One day a week in your town, Crazy Redd’s tent will appear in the town square, near your town tree. When you enter the tent, you’ll see that he has 4 paintings or sculptures on display, and he’ll inform you that your character can only buy one artwork for that day. Now examine what you wish to buy using A, and when you buy an item, you receive the artwork the following day. Choose carefully, though! Redd is known to forge artworks, and once you buy, you can't change your mind and switch to a different item. There are many guides on the Internet that tell you how to spot a fake from an original, so don’t be afraid to look it up.;
, After you donate those 20 things, go to the Town Hall, sit in your mayor's seat, and start a new building project. The Museum Shop will be in the list, which is what we want. You’ll then start a fundraiser in town, in which you can also donate some Bells to ensure that you get it built faster.

To help raise funds to build the Museum Shop, go into your train station and give money to Lloid (the gyroid). Then you can choose how much you want to give.

, Once you raise enough funds, the Museum Shop will open in the next morning! It sells random items a day, but it’s the only place to buy your Silver Shovel, Net, and Fishing Rod for 500 Bells each. You also need to unlock them through donating a certain amount of corresponding items, but the items you donated to unlock the Museum Shop counts as well.

For the Silver Net, you need to donate about 30 bugs. For the Silver Fishing Rod, you need to donate 30 fish. For the Silver Shovel, you need to donate 15 fossils.
The Silver Nets and Fishing Rods have a wider radius for catching bugs and fish, while Silver Shovels have a chance of spawning Gems instead of Bells from a Money Rock.

Buy the Silver Axe from the Island Shop.,
Unlock the Gardening Store for the Gold Axe and Silver Watering Can.,
Get the Gold Axe by buying Saplings.,
Get the Silver Watering Can by buying seeds.,
Get the Gold Watering Can by attaining the “Perfect Town” status.",How to Find Silver and Gold Tools in Animal Crossing: New Leaf2," The Silver Axe is only available in the Island Shop, but rarely appears in their displays. It costs about 8-9 Medals, but it lasts a lot longer than a regular Axe (136 uses for the Silver Axe compared to the 32 uses of the Axe), plus the trees you cut down with it has a chance to spawn a rare tree stump design, which is when the tree rings from cutting down a stump has a cute design instead, like a leaf, or the Triforce symbol.

You can get medals from completing the minigames in the Island.

, For the Gold Axe and Silver Watering Can, you’ll need the Gardening Store. The store opens five days after the player has created their town, and you need to have pulled weeds or planted flowers a combined total of 30 times.

The store can be found between the Nookling store in Main Street and the Able Sisters’ Store, and it takes at least 1-5 days for the store to be built.

, To get the Gold Axe, you’ll need to buy a total of 50 Saplings from the store. Leif, the sloth shop owner, will then give you the Gold Axe upon purchasing the 50th sapling. The Gold Axe spawns less stump patterns that the Silver Axe, but never breaks., Much like the Gold Axe, you need to buy 50 Seed Packets of Flowers from Leif, and he’ll hand you the Silver Watering Can when you get the 50th. It waters a wider radius than the Watering Can., Here’s the tricky bit: you need to get the town to “Perfect” status and retain it for 15 days. To do so, you need to make enough “good” Public Works Projects, plant enough Trees and Flowers without crowding the town, make sure to keep items scattered on the ground (excluding seashells, buried gyroids and fossils, mushrooms, and flowers) to a minimum, and pull weeds every single day. And you need to maintain this for 15 days. When you do this, talk to Isabelle in the Town Hall and she’ll hand you the Gold Watering Can. The Gold Watering Can has an even wider radius than the Silver one, and can turn wilted Black Roses into Gold Roses when you water it.

Proclaiming a Beautiful Town Ordinance as Mayor will keep the flowers from wilting and spawn less weeds, but costs 20000 Bells to enact, and only 1 Ordinance can be enacted at a time.
Public Works Projects, like adding benches and fountains and streetlights, can increase the town rating, but “ugly” projects—like big screens, flashing lights, the drilling rig, and especially the garbage—can will decrease it.
While you only need to plant a certain amount of trees (somewhere between 100-200 trees in total), you can have as many flowers as you want, as long as it’s more than 50.

Complete your Picture Book.,
Wait for a competition.,
Speak to who’s in charge.",How to Find Silver and Gold Tools in Animal Crossing: New Leaf3," This will take you a really long time, but basically you need to catch every single bug type and all the river and ocean fish (but not the ones you get from deep-sea diving on the Island). You can find out if you’ve completed your Picture Book by tapping the book icon on the touchscreen of your 3DS., The Fishing Tourney in New Leaf happens on Saturdays, specifically on the third Saturdays of January, March, May, and November, and on the second Saturdays of February, April, October and December. The Bug-Off (bug-catching tournament) is available in the third Saturdays of the month from June to September., When one of these tournaments roll by, speak to the person manning the tent in the Event Plaza by the Town Tree. For the Fishing Tourney, you need to speak to Chip, who is a beaver. For the Bug Off, you need to speak to Nat, who is a lizard. Chip will hand you the Gold Fishing Rod, and Nat will give you a Gold Net in return for your hard work.

These tools have a better response time and a wider radius than their Silver counterparts.

Upgrade your store to T.I.Y.,
Spend and wait.,
Pass 4 fashion checks.,
Buy 50 Fertilizer.",How to Find Silver and Gold Tools in Animal Crossing: New Leaf4," To get the Gold Shovel, you’ll need to unlock the Department Store. It’s the last tier of the shop upgrades and can be a bit tricky to do. You’ll need to have unlocked at least the T.I.Y. Home Center to do so. You can do this by spending about 50,000 Bells in the Supermarket, and it must be at least 21 days after building the Supermarket.

To unlock the Supermarket, the Convenience Store and the Gardening Store must be open for 10 days prior, and you need to have spent 25,000 Bells in the Convenience Store.
To unlock the Convenience Store, you must have bought a house, the town must be 10 days old at least, and you must buy 15 items in total or spend 12,000 Bells in the store.
All player data in the game card can contribute to the upgrade requirements.

, When you have the Home Center, you need to spend a total of 100,000 Bells in the store, and the Home Center must be open for 30 days in total before you can upgrade. You can use all your player saves to do this quicker too., Here is the trickier requirement. Once a week, on random weekdays, Gracie, the fashionista giraffe, will visit your town plaza and judge your fashion sense.You need to pass her judgement 4 times to fulfill the last requirement to unlock the Department Store upgrade. You can do this by wearing a complete set of clothes, or clothes from the same type and theme to pass her judgement. There are guides in the Internet that list all the clothes and outline which articles of clothing you can combine together to pass her judgement, so if you’re unsure of what clothes you can wear to get a pass, you can look it up. Afterwards, the Department Store will unlock after you fulfill the requirements.

Note that socks count as an article of clothing, so even if you’re wearing shoes or pants that conceal your socks, they still count during judgement.

, When you have the Department Store, you need to buy 50 Fertilizer from Leif, and when you buy the 50th, he hands you the Golden Shovel in return. While it does not yield you gems from Money Rocks, when you bury some Bells on the ground with a Gold Shovel, a Money Tree will grow from it, and you can literally harvest money from it!"
"
Get a Slingshot.,
Shoot down at least 14 Balloons.,
Shoot down toolboxes!",How to Find Silver and Gold Tools in Animal Crossing: New Leaf5," A Slingshot can be bought from the store for 500 Bells. Much like your other base tools, two of them are available for purchase every day at a random order., When the clock has a time ending in 4 (4:44, 11:14, 8: 04, etc.), a Balloon carrying a present will drift from the edges of town. You can shoot it down with your slingshot, though you may have to chase it a bit. You’ll have to pop at least 14 of these, so better get used to chasing.

If you chase it into the top of the town cliffs by the beach, you can pop them with any tool on hand, since they drift very closely to your character.
If you pop the balloon over water or flowers, the present is destroyed and you get nothing. This is because there isn’t any space for the present to land in. The present may also be destroyed when the balloon is popped over a 3x3 pattern.

, After you pop your 14th Balloon, sometimes a toolbox will be tied to a Balloon instead of a present. If you shoot the toolbox down, you have a chance of getting either a Silver Slingshot or a Gold Slingshot. The Silver one shoots 2 rocks at once, while the Gold shoots 3."

This means you’ll see things like Vincent Van Gogh’s Sunflowers painting. Thus, if you’re familiar with some pieces of art, you’ll be able to tell which pieces are fake.

For example, a fake Venus de Milo has hair that goes down to her shoulders as opposed to the genuine hair cropped just above her ears.;
, Redd displays his art in the four different corners of his tent. This means, at first glance, it can be very difficult to scrutinize the paintings and statues. Keep in mind, though, that you can change the camera’s angle inside the tent by pressing the directional buttons on the D-pad.

For example, pressing the right directional button will cause the camera to move to the left, enabling you to better see the painting in the upper-right corner of the tent.
Considering that seeing the piece of art is crucial to determining whether or not it’s a fake, you should do your best to use the directional buttons on the D-pad to get a good view.

, Do be aware that Redd does not refer to any of his art pieces by their actual names. Instead, they will have names like “Perfect painting.”, This painting by Peter Bruegel depicts a number of hunters who have reached a snowy village., This painting by Paul Cézanne depicts a bunch of apples and oranges on top of pedestals and white tablecloth with a purple background., This painting by Eugène Delacroix depicts a war victory with someone standing in the middle with the French flag., This painting by Paul Gaugin depicts a number of dark-colored women with a dog in the front., This painting by Vincent Van Gogh depicts a vase filled with sunflowers., This painting by Francisco Goya depicts a woman lying in repose with black hair and yellow sleeves., This painting by Édouard Manet depicts a woman in the center at a bar with a party going on in the background., This painting by Édouard Manet depicts a young boy standing and playing the flute., This painting by Jean-Francois Millet depicts three people working on a farm., This painting by Jean-Francois Millet depicts one man sowing seeds on a farm., This painting by Georges-Pierre Seurat depicts a number of people out enjoying an afternoon in the park., This painting by Giuseppe Arcimboldo depicts a person with a face made out of produce.

Talk to Isabelle.,
Select an ordinance to enact.,
Pay for the ordinance.",How to Change Shop Hours in Animal Crossing New Leaf," Being able to alter store hours requires that you make an ordinance, but in order to make an ordinance, your approval rating must be 100%. To know what approval rating you currently have, journey to the Town Hall (the purple marker on the map at the bottom screen).


Enter the Town Hall and sit in the mayor’s chair located behind Isabelle’s desk. Isabelle will approach you once you sit down, and speak to you, giving you a variety of dialogue options.
Select “Check approval rating” to see how the villagers view you. If it is not yet 100%, there are several things you can do to quickly reach the perfect goal. If it has, proceed to Part 2.;
, There are several actions that can raise your approval rating by 3; however, you will only receive points the first time you do each action:


Changing the town music—Speak to Isabelle in the Town Hall. She will give you the option to change the town music, but only if your town is two in-game days old or more.
Changing the town flag—Speak to Isabelle in the Town Hall.
Putting something up for sale at Re-tail—Visiting Re-tail (the pink arrow icon on the map at the bottom of the screen), and talk to Reese, the pink alpaca.
Posting something on the bulletin board—Go to the bulletin board next to the train station (northernmost part of town) and hit “A” on your console, and then enter your message.
Donating a fish, bug, or fossil to the museum—This can be done after capturing a fish with the fishing rod, catching a bug with the net, or digging up a fossil with the shovel. Enter the museum, which is on the far left side of Main Street, and talk to Blathers.

, These actions can be repeated:


Removing trash from the water by fishing—At times when you fish, rather than pulling up an animal, you will come up with a piece of junk, which can later be disposed of. Note that this is a random occurrence.
Introducing yourself to villagers—This can be done by approaching villagers and hitting the “A” button to converse with them.
Sending letters—Buy letter paper at the Nookling Junction. Open it in your inventory, enter a message, and send it by giving it to the duck working at the Post Office (found on the left hand side of Main Street).
Pulling weeds—This can be done by standing over weeds, which appear as brownish green sprouts of grass, and hitting the “Y” button.
Watering flowers—This can only be done if you own a watering can, which can be purchased at the Nookling Junction. With the watering can equipped, stand in front of the flowers and hit the “A” button to water them.

, You will earn 3 extra points per day simply by playing., Once your approval rating has peaked, you will be able to enact four different ordinances, two of which alter the opening and closing times of shops, so go to the Town Hall and sit in the mayor’s seat.

, Once you sit in the chair, Isabelle will approach and and ask you you if you want to enact an ordinance. Tell her yes.

, You can choose either the “Early Bird Town” or “Nightlife Town” ordinance.


The Early Bird Town ordinance will cause shops to open and close 3 hours earlier, and villagers to wake up and go to bed 3 hours earlier.
The Nightlife Town ordinance will cause shops to open and close 3 hours later, and villagers to wake up and go to bed 3 hours later.

, After selecting your preferred ordinance, Isabelle will ask you to pay 20,000 bells; pay for it, and the new ordinance will go into effect the following day.

Talk to the villagers.,
Check back on villagers frequently.,
Do the favor.,
Complete a fishing favor.,
Catch bugs as a favor.,
Visit the neighbor’s house as a favor.,
Have the villager visit your house.,
Get your neighbor new furniture as a favor.,
Do time capsule favors.,
Visit other towns as a favor.,
Do deliveries as a favor.,
Find the villager whom you owe the favor.,
Talk to the villager.",How to Do Favors in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," The first order of business is to actually have your villagers ask you for a favor, and they can’t ask you if you don’t talk to them. So run around your town, and every time you see a villager stop and talk to them by pressing A.


When talking to the villagers, make sure you don’t pick the bottom option, which is always some version of “Nevermind.” Choosing this option will end the conversation. Instead, pick the options that are long the lines of “How are you?” and “I’m bored” and “What’s going on?” Those options will prompt the villagers to ask you for a favor if they currently have one.
Villagers will not ask for favors if they are inside shops. They need to be inside their own houses or wandering around outside.;
, Sometimes, a villager won’t have a favor to ask you when you first talk to them, but they might a few minutes later. If you really want to get a large number of favors to complete, you need to talk to villagers often.

, Villagers can ask for a wide range of favors. They are always clear, however, in what it is they want. Once you have a favor to do, do it on the same day that they are accepted.


If one of your villagers asks you to catch him a shark, for example, but you can’t catch a shark until the next day, then there is no point in accepting the request.
For a better idea of what favors you will be asked to do, see Part 2.

, Many villagers will request that you catch them a specific kind of fish. Sometimes, this will be broad and they want just an ocean fish or river fish. In that case, any fish caught in the right area will do. Other times, they want a specific kind of fish, like a Hammerhead Shark, and then you have to have that exact item to complete successfully.


Fish vary based on the season and time of day. Sometimes, your villagers will request fish that you simply can’t get. There’s nothing you can do about that.

, Villagers will often request that you catch them a certain kind of bug. Go out and use your Net to catch the bug they want.

, Some villagers will invite you to come over to their house. When this happens, they often state that they are free after a certain time and then it is up to you to choose when you want to drop by.


In order to complete these requests successfully, you need to remember to show up to that villager’s house at the specified time then stay in the house for at least a few minutes and talk to the villager inside their house a couple of times. Afterwards, you can successfully leave and they will say it was nice to have you over.
If you leave their house without staying long or saying anything, they’ll wonder why you bothered coming over at all.

, Some villagers will request to see your house. This works similarly to the above requests, in that you will be able to choose a time. Sometimes, they ask to do this immediately, and if you accept, you need to walk over to your house right away.


Again, this involves showing up at your house at the specified time and then talking to the villager a couple of times while he or she is in your house. If you leave your house, the villager will leave also, so again, spend at least a few minutes before heading out.

, Some villagers will express discontent with their house’s current decorations. There are a couple of different variations on this request:


They simply want a new piece of furniture to spruce up the room. This one is the broadest and easiest to complete. You just need to buy any piece of furniture and give it to the villager. You may, however, want to look in their house first and try to buy them something that will go well with their current décor.
Replacing a piece of furniture. Other times, the villagers will mention one piece of furniture and say that they want it replaced. As an example, a villager might say they want something to replace their twin-sized bed. This doesn’t mean that you have to get them a bed to replace it, but it does mean that you need to get them something of the same size and type. You couldn’t give them something that goes on the wall or is half the size. In these instances, they want something that fills up the space in the exact same way.

, In order to receive time capsule requests, you must have at least one spot open in your letters. For these requests, villagers will hand you their time capsule (which will show up in your letters area) and ask you to bury it for them. Make sure you do not accidentally open the time capsule because that will fail the request and cause the villager to be upset with you.


Choose a spot that you like and bury the capsule by first digging a hole with your shovel. To dig a hole with your shovel, equip it and press A. Then open up your letters, tap on the time capsule, and choose “Bury.” A little star will show up on the ground to indicate that you buried the capsule. This completes this portion of the favor.
At a later date, the villager will request that you dig up the capsule and return it to them. Do so, and make sure you don’t accidentally open it.

, If, and only if, you have visited a friend’s town before in Animal Crossing, your villagers will sometimes request that you travel to another town to collect signatures. This requires that you use the train station, visit another town, and then talk to the villagers there.

, Deliveries are a fairly common, and very easy to complete, favor. In these, villagers will ask you to take something to another villager. All you need to do is not open the package, find the other villager, and hand the package over to them.


The villager that you give the package to will be the one to reward you, not the one who initially requested the favor.

, Make sure that they are not in their shops before you talk to them.

, Complete the favor by talking to the villager again. If you have to give them something to complete the favor, this is where you’ll do so.

Spend 8,000 bells at the Able Sisters’ Shop.,

Spend 10,000 bells at either Kicks or Able Sisters.,
Wait for another 10 days.,
Visit Shampoodle.,
Get a haircut.,
Wait 14 days.,
Make sure you have not asked Harriet to make your character over.,
Talk to Harriet.,
Change your eye color.",How to Change Eye Color in Animal Crossing," The Able Sisters Shop can be found in the shopping district; simply head north, past the train station, and follow the cobblestones under the arch. Their store should be on the left side of the district.;
, After 10 days, the shoe store, Kicks, will be built and opened next to the Able Sisters Shop. If you have already spent 8,000 bells at the Able Sisters Shop before ten days have passed in the game, you can expedite the process by time traveling on the game’s calendar:


At the opening screen of the game, tell Isabelle that there’s something you need to change before playing, and select the “Change the date” option.
Adjust the calendar so that the proper amount of days have passed since your town’s creation.

, This 10,000 bells can be a purchase total at either store, for example, spending 4,000 at Kicks and 6,000 at Able Sisters.

, After 10 days, Shampoodle will be constructed on the second floor of Able Sisters.


If you’re in a hurry, time travel forward using the method stated in Step 2.

, Although you have now unlocked Shampoodle, you are not immediately given the option to change your eye color. The hairstylist, Harriet, will only give you the choice to change hairstyle or makeup when the salon is first built.


To get started on unlocking the Eye Color Change feature, visit Shampoodle during its operating hours, which are from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

, Take a seat in the red chair on the left side of the room, and Harriet will approach you and ask what you want to get done today. Select the haircut option, and answer her questions to determine which style you will get.


It costs about 3,000 bells to get a haircut.

, On the 15th day, the Eye Color Change feature will be available to you.


Again, if you’re in a hurry, just time travel 14 days forward.

, This is because Harriet can only do one thing for a player a day, so she cannot do a haircut, makeup and change the eye color on the same day.

, Visit Shampoodle during their operating hours and sit in the chair. Harriet will approach and ask what it is you want to make over.

, Tell Harriet that you want to change your eye color. Harriet will then ask you some questions. Your answers will determine the color your eyes will change to:


To get black eyes, answer either “The vast sky” or “The large trees” to her first question, and “Pitch black” or “Their endless shade” to her second question.
To get blue eyes answer either “The vast sky” or “The endless ocean” to her first question, and “A clear, blue sky” or “A tropical blue ocean” to her second question.
To get grey eyes, answer either “The vast sky” or “The endless ocean” to her first question, and then “Like rain coming” or “A cold, wintry ocean” to her second question.
To get green eyes, answer either “The large trees” or “The endless ocean” to her first question, and “Their abundant leaves” or “An ocean of coral” to her second question.
To get brown eyes, answer “The large trees” to Harriet’s first question, and “Their sturdy trunks” to her second question.

If you see something in one of your ponds on Animal Crossing: New Leaf and it is not a fish, it is a diving beetle.,
Notice its actions.,
It does not get scared when you run past it quickly or when you put a fishing rod in the water and take it out.

",How to Catch a Diving Beetle on Animal Crossing: New Leaf1,";
, It should dive down occasionally. It will look like a little blue coin when it dives down.

,"
"
Get out your net from your pockets.

,
When the diving beetle dives down and turns into a little blue coin, press A to swing your net down on it.

,
Hopefully you should catch it.

,
The diving beetle does not get scared so if you fail, you can just wait until it dives down and try again!

Wait for the right time.,
Go to the right place.,
Look for the huge shadow.,
Catch the Stringfish.,
Enjoy your Stringfish.",How to Catch a Stringfish in Animal Crossing," The Stringfish only appears in winter, from December to February, and only between 4PM and 9AM. Make sure you’ve got the right date and time; otherwise, you have zero chance whatsoever at catching a Stringfish.


If you really want a Stringfish, and it’s not the right time in the real world, you could always do Time Travel (i.e., manually change the date of your Animal Crossing town) in order to make it the right time.;
, Some fish are caught only in the ocean while others are caught only in the river. The Stringfish is a fish that is caught in the river, so make sure you’re looking for it there.

, The shadow that the Stringfish makes in the water is bigger than the shadow that other fish make. If you want to save yourself the time of simply catching every fish in the river, just look for the big shadow. Once you see it, only then should you use the fishing rod.


To help you save time, run along the side of the river if you only see small shadows. Running will scare away the small fish, and waiting a short bit of time will result in new, different fish populating the river. Rinse and repeat until you see that large shadow that you’re looking for.

, Once you’ve got your mark, equip your fishing rod, and press “Y” in order to use it and thus cast your rod into the river. Then, listen and watch closely for the moment that the fish “bites.” Once the fish bites, press “A” to reel it in.


Most of the time, the rod will bob a few times first before you’ve fully hooked the fish. Pressing “A” too early will just result in the fish getting away.
The bite can also be determined by the plunking sound it makes, so turning your volume all the way up is advised.

, You’ve just gotten one step closer to catching every fish in Animal Crossing!

Wait for Sunday.,
Find the turnip vendor.,
Talk to Joan.,
Buy turnips.",How to Buy Turnips in Animal Crossing New Leaf," Unlike the stores in the shopping plaza, the turnip vendor is not open on a daily basis. She will only appear in the player’s town on Sunday, from 6 .a.m. until noon.


If you do not want to wait until Sunday, simply change the date in game. You can do this at the initial screen, when Isabelle is starting the game for you. Before choosing to start your game file, select the option to change something.
Isabelle will ask what you want to fix. Select the change time and date option, and set the clock to a time on Sunday between 6 a.m. and noon.;
, A boar named Joan is the go-to source for turnips. During 6 a.m. to noon on Sundays, she can be found wandering around the town. Simply walk around a bit to find her.

, Approach Joan, and hit the “A” button to interact with her.

, When you talk with her, select the option to buy turnips. Joan sells batches of ten turnips, with the price ranging between 90–110 bells. This price will not change during the day; however, it will change by week.


Turnips can be held in your inventory or stored in drawers within your home.

Get a bug net.,
Find regular trees.,
Shake the regular tree.,
Capture bees.",How to Catch a Bee in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," Before you can begin your bee-hunting adventure, you’ll need the proper tool to catch them with. Like all insects, they must be caught with the bug net.


If you don’t already have a bug net, you can buy one for 500 bells at the Nookling Store run by Timmy and Tommy. This store can be found in the shopping plaza—simply head north, past the train station, and up the cobblestone to reach the plaza.
Make sure the net is in your inventory when you begin searching for bees.;
, That is, not fruit trees. This is because beehives will not fall from fruit trees.


Beehives can be found during any time of day, during any season, however only about 3–4 will appear each day. Bees can only be found by shaking trees; a hive will fall out after a tree has been shaken.

, To shake a tree, approach it without anything equipped, and hit “A.”


Always stand to the north of the tree, and make sure there is plenty of room to run upwards. Do not shake trees south of rivers and buildings.

, If a beehive falls out, the player will pause for a quick shock reaction, before being chased by the insects. As soon as you can move, run north. Do this by pressing the analog stick upwards while holding down the “B” button.


Once you’ve run far enough so that the bees are no longer visible on screen, hit the “X” button to open your inventory. Equip the bug net—doing so should automatically make your character face south, so you will be ready to catch the bees once they catch up.
When you’re ready, hit the “X” button once more to close the inventory. Keep an eye out for the bees; once you see the swarm at the bottom of the screen, hit “A” to capture them.

Select “Check approval rating” to see how the villagers view you. If it is not yet 100%, there are several things you can do to quickly reach the perfect goal. If it is perfect, proceed to Part 2.;
, There are several actions that can raise your approval rating by 3; however, you will only receive points the first time you complete each option.


Changing the town music—Speak to Isabelle in the Town Hall. She will give you the option to change the town music, but only if your town is two in-game days old or more.
Changing the town flag—Speak to Isabelle in the Town Hall.
Putting something up for sale at Re-tail—Visiting Re-tail (the pink arrow icon on the map at the bottom of the screen), and talk to Reese, the pink alpaca.
Posting something on the bulletin board—Go to the bulletin board next to the train station (northernmost part of town) and hit “A” on your console, and then enter your message.
Donating a fish, bug, or fossil to the museum—This can be done after capturing a fish with the fishing rod, catching a bug with the net, or digging up a fossil with the shovel. Enter the museum, which is on the far left side of Main Street, and talk to Blathers.

, These actions can be repeated:


Removing trash from the water by fishing—At times when you fish, rather than pulling up an animal, you will come up with a piece of junk, which can later be disposed of. Note that this is a random occurrence.

Watering flowers—This can only be done if you own a watering can, which can be purchased at the Nookling Junction. With the watering can equipped, stand in front of the flowers and hit the “A” button to water them.

, You will earn 3 extra points per day simply by playing.

, After you have gained the authority to begin projects, take a look at what your options are. Enter Town Hall, which can be found by locating the purple icon on the map at the bottom of the screen.

, Go past the counter, and sit in the same mayoral chair you use to check your approval rating.

, When Isabelle asks what you would like to do, select the “Public Work Projects” option. Depending on what your villagers want, there will be a variety of different options, with up to 13 available at a time:


Permanent Buildings—These are independent businesses, and offer a variety of services to the player, ranging from dance clubs to a police station. Each one has very different extra features that can enhance the game. These are the café, campsite, Club LOL, Dream Suite, Fortune Teller Shop, Museum Renovation, police station, and Reset Surveillance Center.
Remodeling Projects—Remodeling projects do not serve a utilitarian function; they are merely a way to change your town’s aesthetics. If you want to impress visitors to your town, or want a change of scenery, Remodeling Projects are a good investment. These are the Zen Town Hall, Fairy-Tale Town Hall, Modern Town Hall, Fairy-Tale Train Station, Zen Train Station, and Modern Train Station.
Utility Structures—Utility Structures are interactive objects placed throughout towns. Players and villagers can sit on the furniture, or ring the bells. These can make your town like a large playground. Utility Structures are Camping Cot, Outdoor Chair, Hammock, Bell, Zen Bell, Benches, Picnic Blanket, Tire Toy, Pile of Pipes, Chair Sculpture, Bridges (only 3 bridges can be constructed in one town), Bus Stop, Clocks, Drinking Fountain, Fence, Fire Hydrant, Fountain, Garbage Can, Instrument Shelter, Signs, Street Lamps, Traffic Signal, and Water Well.
Public Art—Public Art is not interactive; its function is to make your town more beautiful. Like the remodeling projects, they make your town more visually impressive and provide a nice change in atmosphere. You can select among 3 different types of arches, Archway Sculpture, Cube Sculpture, Custom Design-Sign, Face Cut-Out Standee, Fire Pit, Flower Bed, Hot Spring, Illuminated Heart, Illuminated Tree, Jungle Gym, Rack of Rice, Sandbox, Scarecrow, Stadium Light, Statue Fountain, three different kinds of Topiaries, Torch, Video Screen, Water Pump, Wisteria Trellis, and Zen Garden.
Landmarks—Landmarks are like Public Art, but a bit pricier to fund. They often are small scale models of famous landmarks, giving your town an extravagant feel. These include Drilling Rig, Geyser, Lighthouse, Moai Statue, Parabolic Antenna, Pyramid, Solar Panels, Sphinx, Stone Tablet, Stonehenge, Totem Pole, Tower, Windmill, and Wind Turbine.

, Depending on your playing style, any of these projects could appeal to you. If you want a very interactive town, you’ll want a lot of utility structures. However, if you desire a gorgeous town, Public Art is probably the best choice.


In particular, bridges are very useful because they make your town easier to navigate. A trash can is also useful for throwing away rotten food, rather than paying for Reese to dispose of it.
All the permanent buildings offer their own unique experience, so their construction highly depends on what sorts of activities you’d like to have around town.
After looking through the options Isabelle offers, hit the “A” button to select your desired project (note only one project can be in construction at a time).

, If it is not a permanent building or remodeling project (these take places in pre-determined zones that the player cannot control), Isabelle will ask you where you want to place the project. She will follow you as you run around town, and depending on the size of the project, you will need to find a plot of land relatively free of trees and houses.


If there are too many trees in an area you’d like to build in, you can remove the trees using an axe and shovel. Swing at the trees with the axe equipped, then remove their stumps with the shovel. Both the axe and shovel can be purchased at the Nookling Junction.

, When you have decided on a project’s location, face Isabelle and hit the “A” button to talk to her. Tell her that this is where you wish to begin the new project.


If the area is too small, Isabelle will suggest you find somewhere else

, After agreeing on a spot with Isabelle, a fence and gyroid will be placed in the future location of the project. The gyroid will accept monetary donations that are put towards the project. Once it reaches the desired amount, the project’s construction will be completed.

Unfortunately, your villagers won’t do much in terms of contributing to your project, so you will have to donate most of the bells yourself. Simply face the gyroid, hit the “A” button, then select the “Donate” option.
Each project’s price varies widely, from 10,000 bells to nearly half a million bells.

, You might create new bonds with the shop owners, which is important because if you not only visit the shops, but sell or buy things there, you may get other special buildings, or the shop may upgrade.

, This will make your town bloom in harmony; it really helps if you want to show off your town to any of your friends that may visit your town through WiFi.

, Make your house look the way you want to, by adding new items inside and decorating it the way you would like it to be! It doesn't even have to be perfect, just start working on your house! Check T&T Emporium for new items everyday.

, Try to donate fossils, fish, bugs, and paintings to Blathers, who is the owner of the museum, and he will gladly take these off your hands! Plus, it'll help make your museum grow! This is helpful, so donate as much as possible to it. You may even gain respect from your friends, and more villagers will visit the museum.

, This will help you get many bells, which you can spend on clothing, furniture, and many other items.

Go to the train station.,
Have your best friend close so you can visit their nearby town.,
Or choose a faraway town with an established friend who isn't nearby.,
Add them as your friend by tapping their name on the town list.,
Go from friends to best friends by tapping the heart by their name.",How to Add a Best Friend in Animal Crossing: A New Leaf," Regardless of what town map you have, the train station is located near the top of the map, just left of the exit that takes you to Main Street.


Once you’re inside the train station, speak with the monkey (use “a” to initiate dialogue with characters). You’ll see that you have two options: either to visit a nearby town or a faraway town.;
, If you and your friend are close to each other, have one of you go to visit the other's town – it doesn't matter who. Just make sure your gate is open so they can come in!


If you choose to visit a nearby town, Porter (the monkey) will simply look for nearby random players who have their gates open to other nearby players. This option works even if you haven’t previously exchanged friend codes with that player. This can work if you’re sitting next to your desired best friend and he or she opens up his gate for you.

However, do be aware that if you or your friend opens your town gates to nearby players, that you might end up with other unintended visitors.



, If your best friend isn't nearby and you choose to visit a faraway town, your 3DS will connect through the Internet to towns with people whom you’ve already exchanged friend codes with and who have their gates open to far away players.


Remember, this option only works if you've already exchanged friend codes. Otherwise, their faraway town won't show up.

, Once you’re in your desired best friend’s town, simply look for the green button that has icons of people on it on the bottom left of the touch screen. Tapping that button will result in list of every person in the current town. Most likely, it will only comprise of your desired best friend, but if others are wandering around, they’ll show up, too.


From there, tap the name of the person you desire to be best friends with and he or she will be added to your Animal Crossing friend list.

, Any person must appear on your friend’s list before you can initiate best friend status, thus why the previous steps are necessary. In order to become best friends, you just have to have this person add you back by tapping the heart next to your name.


If you have your friend visit your town, have them add you to their list. Then you can look at your list and make them your best friend by tapping the heart next to his or her name.

Run!,
Run in circles.,
Seek the nearest shelter.",How to Avoid Beehives in Animal Crossing1," When faced against the wrath of a hundred annoyed bees, your best bet is to run. While you can’t run very far or fast enough to completely avoid them, this will save you a few seconds before complete and utter agony.


To run, press the B button while moving with your D-pad in all games, save for City Folk. In City Folk, press A and B at the same time so the character runs towards the cursor.;
, Bees don’t take sharp turns very well, and enough sharp turns will buy you time, so move in another direction abruptly while running.


Running in wide circles or changing directions are the best way to escape bees, as long as you don’t accidentally turn towards the bees.

, When you can, duck into the nearest indoor sanctuary. It could be your house or the town store—any building or structure that leads indoors would suffice. You can immediately exit it after ducking inside, because either way, the bees would disperse, leaving you safe from the dreaded hoard.

, Once you see the beehive drop, access your inventory as quickly as possible ( - on City Folk, X in New Leaf, and Y in both the original and Wild World). Drag your Net towards you character icon by pressing A and selecting “Grab, then maneuver to the icon and press A again to equip it.


On New Leaf and Wild World, you can simply tap and drag the Net to your character icon.
You can cycle your tools in City Folk and New leaf by pressing the left and right buttons on the D-pad, which makes things even easier for you.

, Once you equip your tool and exit the inventory, keep pressing A while facing the swarm. Once you catch one, rejoice in your sweet, sweet victory against the dreaded bees!

Go over to Main Street.,
Talk to Digby.,
Choose to view the Showcase.,
Enjoy the Showcase.",How to Access the Happy Home Showcase in Animal Crossing: New Leaf," The entrance to the Happy Home Showcase is located on here, so go to Main Street by running to the north edge of your village and crossing the train tracks there.;
, Digby is a dog that is found just north of where you enter Main Street. Talk to him by facing him and pressing A.

, In the conversation with Digby, he will ask if you want to view the HH Showcase. Choose the answer “Yup!” in order to proceed into the Showcase.

, The HH Showcase is an entirely different zone in the map, so speak to Digby when you are ready to return to your town.


You will see the player characters of anybody that your 3DS has successfully made a StreetPass with in the area when you first enter. If you have StreetPassed with a player multiple times, you may speak with their character to get a special item from them. These items include balloons, pinwheels, and bubble wands, and will be visible in the character's hand if they are obtainable.
There are other areas to the west, north, and east that hold the houses of the players you have StreetPassed. There are sixteen spaces for houses in each area, making a total of 48.
Take a look inside the houses. You can order up to a total of five pieces of furniture per day from any of the houses. Special furniture, event furniture, or furniture that has been customized by Cyrus may not be ordered, however. Also be aware that the item will cost more than if you obtained it from the Nooklings' store.
If there isn't much to enjoy in your HH Showcase, carry your 3DS around with you to gain more StreetPasses. Putting your system into sleep mode will aid the process. Ensure that you have StreetPass enabled for Animal Crossing: New Leaf.

If the code is meant for a specific game, you'll likely get a message telling you so. However, you could also just get an error message."
"
Know which codes are for specific games.,
Start up your game like normal.,
Find the in-game QR scanner.,
Flatten the QR code and make sure it is well-lit.",How to Scan QR Codes on a 3DS2," Generally a QR code will have a small image in the middle of it designating it for a game. If there is a logo around the code, or the code is otherwise labeled as ""for _______ only,"" this means you must have the appropriate game on to view the code. Any Mii game, for example, has a little ""mii"" in the center of the QR code's typical checkerboard pattern., Skip the main menu and go straight to the game to input the code. All games have different ways to input QR codes, but they will all happen in the game, not in the main 3DS menu.

, This is usually in the main menu or the settings page. However, some games hide these scanner to make the items you scan more valuable. Animal Crossing, for example, makes you talk to Sable once a day for 10 straight days to unlock the QR scanner.If you cannot find the QR code reader, look online or in the game's instruction manual.

, QR codes can be a bit finicky, but you can ensure they work with a little patience. Make sure the code is well lit and the camera is six to ten inches away. Smooth out any wrinkles and hold the camera steady, moving it in slightly if it still isn't reading immediately.

First things first.,
Once you've received your R4i Gold card, and have your micro sd card in hand, head over to the official website for the r4i gold.,
Download the firmware to your PC, and make sure to note where you have saved the file.,
Download a free / shareware version of a compression software.,
Double click on the firmware .rar file and it will open for you're in the compression software.,
The NES emulator for the Nintendo 3DS is called NesDS.,
Once you have both your firmware downloaded, as well as the NesDS emulator, it's time to put it all on your micro sd card.,
Now it's time to put the firmware on to the micro sd card.,
Your next step is to do the same with NesDS.,
Once your firmware, NesDS and your games are on the micro SD card, it's time to take the micro SD card out of the USB Reader and plug it into your R4i Gold card.,
Plug the R4i Gold into your Nintendo 3DS just as you would any regular 3DS game card.,
This is your final step before you're playing your favorite NES games on your Nintendo 3DS.",How to Play NES Games on Your Nintendo 3DS1,"  You'll need to get your hands on an R4i Gold card for the Nintendo 3DS.  There are several cards out there that claim to work on the new Nintendo 3DS system, but only a couple actually do work.  You'll want to make sure you are getting an original R4i Gold, and not a clone card with a sticker that claims it's an R4i Gold card.;
,  In their downloads section you'll see a list of all of the different versions of the firmware.  Download the newest or latest version.  They are listed from newest to oldest, therefore, the first link in the downloads section will be the newest version of the firmware.

,  If you're using Firefox, your firmware file would be saved in your downloads folder by default - unless you have it set to allow you select your download location.  In any event, make sure you jot down where the file is, you'll see why in the following steps.

,  Once you have it downloaded, install it on your PC.  The compression software will be associated with all .zip and .rar files after the installation is complete.  You won't have to reboot your PC after the installation, so you can immediately go right to the folder where you saved your downloaded firmware file.

,  You want to select the extract option to extract the contents of the archive to your PC.  The compression software should, by default, extract the files into a folder that is named exactly the same as the archive you're extracting it from.  The firmware is important because without it, your R4i Gold card won't be recognized when you power up your Nintendo 3DS.  The firmware is what tells the Nintendo 3DS that you have a card inserted, and it also runs the menu system or file manager for the r4i card itself.  Think of it like the OS for a cell phone.  Without the OS on the phone, the phone itself won't power up, will not have any menus or any applications.  The firmware does the same thing on your R4i.

,  It's a freeware / homebrew program that works much like emulators on the PC work.  You can find it by doing a google search for ""download NesDS"".  There are numerous web sites from which you can download it. Pick any of the sites in the results.  There's no risk of any virus or malware infecting your Nintendo 3DS or your PC.

,  In order to do so, you'll need to use the micro SD card reader / writer that came with your R4i card.  Plug the micro SD card into the USB dongle, and use any free USB port on your computer.  The micro sd card will show up as a removable disk drive.

,  The firmware is your menu system, and this is what you'll need in order for your R4i Gold so that it can be recognized by your Nintendo 3DS in order to load your NES emulator and games.  Go to the folder that was created when you extracted the files.  You'll have to copy these files to the micro SD card.  It is however very important that you do not copy over the folder that contains all of the firmware files.  You'll want to double click the firmware folder, and inside you will see several folder and files.  This is what you want to copy.  Select all of the folders and files and copy them over to the root of your micro SD card.  The root of the micro SD card is what you see when you double click on the drive letter that was assigned to your micro SD when you plugged it into your PC.  There should be no folders at all.

,  Simply copy the nesds.nds file from your downloads directory to the root of the micro SD card.  Both the firmware files and the emulator itself have to be located in the root of your micro sd.  If you put NesDS into a folder, you will not be able to load it.  If you have the NES games you want on your Nintendo 3DS ready, you can copy them over to the micro SD card as well.  While you don't have to, it is recommended that you create a folder on your micro sd card called NES or games and copy your NES games into that specific folder.  It will help you keep your NES games organized.

,  It's impossible to put it in the wrong way, the micro SD can only be inserted properly into the r4i.

If it fails, there is a chance they'll try again. They will buy a gift for them. If this fails, they will see they're not to be and their depression goes down.
If it succeeds, the Miis are now together, and the upper section above ""Best Friend"" Will Show them as their ""Sweet Heart"" or ""Special Someone"". The text matters on what version you are using of the game.

, You can win any one-player game on normal to get Ness. It doesn't matter what character you choose. However, you must only use three lives, and you cannot lose all three of them.


Though any character will work, quick and powerful characters like Pikachu, Kirby, and Fox are often the best against Ness. You will have to defeat Ness before he is unlocked., Continues are when you run out of lives and start a stage over again with three lives. You must beat the game with only your three original lives.


This includes beating Master Hand, the games last boss.
Playing defensively is often your best bet, especially on team levels (giant DK, Mario Bros, etc.). Use projectiles often so conserve life and do damage., Once you've beaten Master Hand, Ness will challenge you to a battle on Dream Land. Defeat Ness to unlock him.


Ness is small, with a very good grab and throw. However, he is slow on the ground and much better at fighting in the air. Stay low and use lots of A attacks to win quickly. Note that he can absorb ranged attacks (like Samus's cannon), so use them with caution.

Once you've reflected 10, across any mode, you'll get the chance to fight Ness., If you lose, you can simply play another round of Brawl to get another chance. Ness is small, with a dangerous grab, but he has low range on almost all of his attacks that makes him easy to beat. Use your speed and A attacks to weaken him for an easy kill., This single-player mode is a great way to unlock characters quickly. You won't even have to fight against Ness to get him! To get Ness, you must get to and beat the level ""Subspace.""

Use Falcon Punch.,
Try Up B.,
Use the Falcon Kick when you are on a flat surface and your opponent is near you.,
If your opponent uses their shield, grab them and throw them.,
Work on your A moves.,
Work on you B moves.,
Use your speed.,
Take advantage of items.,
Meteor Smash your foes.",How to Play As Captain Falcon in Super Smash Bros.," Whether your opponent has high damage or not, it will always inflict lots of damage and KO them a lot of the time. Jumping toward your opponent, pressing B, then unleashing it on them is a great way to do it. NOTE!!! Falcon Punch is a very slow attack and if your opponent sees it coming can easily dodge it, or counter by hitting you. It is best used when your opponent is holding a box, or when they come drifting back after being knocked off the platform. Anther use of Falcon Punch can help save yourself while falling. When hit off the edge AND way up in the air, it can be advantageous to ""punch"" your way over instead of using valuable jumps. Its tricky, because the punches are slow, but if used right can be the difference in being KO'd or saving yourself.;
, This move is called the Falcon Dive. Use it mostly when your opponent is falling, or is right above you. It will send them flying similar distances caused by a falcon punch. Be careful though, as they might counter it with a down kick. After you complete a Falcon Dive, it allows you to use the move once more. It's a jump reward for landing the move. It can also be more fun if you insert a comment such as, ""Come a little bit closer!"" when the move is completed. If they are human, this might demoralize your foe. However, we do not endorse any type of bullying. Remember to have constructive fun while playing.

, If there is an obstacle in your way, jump, and then use it. Follow it up with another attack once they get up. The only word of warning is to be careful when near the edge of a level. It goes a prescribed distance no matter if you go off the edge or not. Avoid Self Destructing by Falcon Kicking toward the interior of a level and staying away from the edges.

, If they have enough damage, they will be KO'd. However, a word of warning. Throws are a useful tool to changing the tempo of a fight, but they are not main attacks. Using throws as your main offense is a true sign of a beginner. As you gain experience you will see that combos and ""Hard A"" attacks are more efficient.

, They can be very helpful when your opponent has low damage. There are two types of ""A"" moves: Hard and Soft. Soft A moves do not cause as much damage nor do they hit your opponent as far as Hard A's, but they are quicker. Hard A's are generally your Kill Shots. They produce high damage and strong hits which send your opponent flying. to execute a Soft A point the analog stick in the direction you want to attack and then follow up with pressing A. For example, you can point the analog stick Up in a way that makes you not jump and repeatedly press A to do multiple Soft hits to rack up damage. Once your opponent is approaching 100% damage, execute a Hard A by directing the analog stick in the direction you wanna strike while pressing A at the same time. It takes timing and a more forceful analog movement, but if the direction and A are pressed at the same time, it should yield a Hard A attack.

, B moves are characterized as Special Moves. Unlike A Moves, B Moves only have 3 variations: Up+B, Down+B, and Neutral B. Note that there is no Horizontal B. Neutral B executes the attack in the direction you are facing. Usually Neutral B attacks are weaker yet faster attacks, but Captain Falcon, DK, and Samus have powerful Neutral B's which either charge or take time to develop.

, Constantly move around and make it hard for opponents to inflict damage on you. And, when you strike, just dive in and attack. It can be highly effective if you Dodge. Do this by pressing Z and then pointing the joy-stick to the right or left, depending on the direction that best suits the situation.

, Poke balls, hammers, beam swords, etc. can give you the upper edge, no matter what character you are. Once you get more advanced, Items become trivial and some might even call them ""cheap."" Use with discretion, and judge your competition beforehand. Set the rules to the match before you play and enjoy. The hammer is generally considered the ""cheapest"" way to kill. Never rely on items as your means of victory, because you will gain few friends and little respect. Item Hogs, as they are affectionately known, are people who spam Items. Spamming Items is a sign of a beginner player.

, When one of your enemies has been thrown or knocked off of the edge, it is the perfect time to Smash them to their doom. Once they have expended all of their jumps, position yourself above them in the air by jumping. Time your Down A right and you will Smash then to their DOOM. The timing is tricky and you do not want to use more than one jump to position yourself. If you miss, saving yourself can be an issue. With timing and practice the risk will be worth the reward, and your foes will be demoralized for sure.

Use them to your advantage.;
, Play through it and follow all the directions. Remember to practice all the moves. You can also practice CUS shots if you want (more on that later).

, Pay attention to the screen at all times. If you need a break, pause. Listen to what your teammates have to say. Sometimes they provide useful tips or alert you to danger.


Sometimes, your teammates might not tell you right away if he is being attacked, so be sure to pay close attention to everyone. Then again, stuff your teammates kill won't add to your score. This makes it a good idea to kill enemies and bosses before they do. As you gain experience, your teammates will really only grow to be necessary for medals.







, It is obvious that you won't be able to beat the game the first round because there is no save feature (due to the reason that the game would be extremely easy to complete if there was one). So, learn the courses! Learn where enemies pop up, where you can game shots, and where items appear.

, Loop when enemies are behind you and barrel roll when lasers become a serious threat. Brake and boost as needed (sometimes braking helps to game shots). Use where needed, but don't overuse.

, Learn where items like laser upgrades, rings and bombs spawn. Except on the Zoness boss, you shouldn't use bombs on bosses. Rather, use them on large enemy groups within the main level for extra points.

, ""Cus"" is short for ""charge unlocked shot"". It turns out that whenever an object that can be shot down (be it enemy ships, rocks or even your allies) gets hit with the splash of a charge shot, you get a point, no matter if it is destroyed. Same goes for Blue marine torpedoes. So, use them wherever possible and regular charge shots where it is not.

, There are two ""high score"" routes that go like this:


Corneria, Meteo, Katina, Sector X, Macbeth, Area 6, Venom
Corneria, Sector Y, Aquas, Zoness, Macbeth, Area 6, Venom
On these routes it is very easy to get upwards of 2000 points with practice. You can also try for high scores on individual levels if you like.

, This is important: without the proper conditions you cannot travel to some levels. Fortunately, all you need to know is here:


To get to Sector Y, you must first kill the 3 enemies tailing Falco halfway through the level. After that, you have to fly under all the rock arches on the lake. When you do this, Falco will be impressed with your flying and show you a route to a different boss. Defeat him and move on.
Katina from Meteo: this isn't on the map. When you get to an asteroid field late in the level, there will be some rings that look very much like checkpoints. Pass through all 7 (difficult! It will take some practice) and enter the resulting warp. No boss, just make it to the end.
Solar from Fortuna: Shoot down Star Wolf before the bomb goes off.
Macbeth from Sector X: Defeat Spyborg before Slippy tries to play hero. A good rule of thumb is to shoot it down before Falco finishes his quote. Remember: the weak spot is the head.
Sector Z from Sector X: again, this isn't on the map. When you have to go left or right, go left. Shoot 4 warp gates that appear when notified and pass through them. Then survive the warp. Be careful: it is easy to die here. This is a good route to take if you need the Sector Z medal as Katt won't steal kills from you.
Solar from Katina: Shoot the mother-ship core before 1 minute is up.
Aquas from Sector Y: Kill 100+ enemies.
Sector Z from Zoness: Shoot all the searchlights.
Area 6 from:
-Macbeth: Shoot the 8 switches and then the main switcher. If you came from Zoness Katt will will get 2 and 5 for you. Falco will shoot the last one if he's with you. You also have to have Peppy alive to make it through the main switch and blow up the train.
-Sector Z: destroy all 6 missiles.

,, Avoid aiming for the very top, and instead aim at the little flat bit at the sides of the huge spire at the top of castle. Remember, Mario is a fast faller, so be sure that you aim high, as if he slides or falls off of the castle, he will either lose a lot of health or die.

Good luck!",How to Effectively Play As Kirby in Super Smash Bros. N64," Kirby is a perfect example of versatility in regards to movement. Kirby has decent speed on the ground coupled with multiple jumps through the air. To jump with Kirby, direct the analog stick UP and puff your way to where you need to go. Jumping can also be achieved by pressing the ""C"" buttons. Each press executes one jump. After the analog or ""C"" button jumps are depleted, Kirby has an UP+B that is his recovery move. Be careful not to rush into a UP+B because once it is activated you will be put into a state called freefall, where you can't move or attack. Once you touch the ground or reach a platform you exit the freefall state, so no worries. Kirby's jump is an incredible asset. Having multiple, puff-like jumps allows you to move great distance, although at a cost to movement speed in the air His air movements are much slower than the dual jump technique of the like of Mario or Captain Falcon. Walking and Running are achieved by directing the analog stick in the direction you need to move. The intensity of the analog motion determines whether Kirby runs or walks.;
, Once movement has been mastered you are ready to explore Kirby's arsenal of ground attacks. There are two main groups of Ground Attacks:

, There are 2 types of ""Attack"" moves: Tilts, and smashes. Tilts do not cause as much damage nor do they hit your opponent as far as Smash attacks, but they are quicker. Smash attacks are generally your KO moves. They produce high damage and knockback. To execute a tilt point the analog stick in the direction you want to attack lightly and then follow up with pressing ""A"". For example, you can point the analog stick Up in a way that makes you not jump and repeatedly press ""A"" to do multiple tilts to rack up damage. Once your opponent is approaching 100% damage, execute a smash attack by directing the analog stick in the direction you wanna strike while pressing ""A"" at the same time. It takes timing and a more forceful analog movement, but if the direction and ""A"" are pressed at the same time, it should yield a Smash attack.

, Unlike Attacks, Special moves only have 3 variations: Up Special, Down Special, and Neutral Special. Note that there is no Side Special., this executes the attack in the direction you are facing. Usually Neutral B attacks are weaker yet faster attacks, but Captain Falcon, DK, and Samus have powerful Neutral Specials which either charge or take time to develop. Kirby's Up Special is called the Final Cutter. The Final Cutter is a 3 part attack: an upward sword thrust, a downward sword swing, and a horizontal energy blast upon contact with the ground. Kirby's Down Special is a famous technique known as the Da Brick or Da Rock. Kirby turns into a block of dense material and plummets downward with destructive force. To bail out of the move, simply press ""B"" and Kirby will re-materialize. Otherwise after a few seconds he will pop out himself.


NOTE: Kirby is the only exception to the Neutral Special formula. Kirby's Neutral Special is an intake of air which engulfs your opponent. Once engulfed there are two courses of action: Press ""B"" and take their Neutral Special for you own OR Press ""A"" and shoot them from your mouth in what looks like a star. Both actions have their advantages. Taking their powers allows Kirby to become unpredictable, more powerful, or more durable. For example, If Kirby engulfs Fox and presses ""B"" then Kirby will release Fox and morph into a Fox-Kirby hybrid which enables Kirby to now use Fox's Blaster as his new Neutral Special. If Kirby engulfs DK, Samus, or Captain Falcon then the new hybrid Kirby will gain either the DK Punch or Samus' Energy Blast or Falcon Punch, respectively. Finally, if Kirby manages to engulf Jigglypuff and press ""B"" then Kirby will gain the Pound technique, which when done in succession with Kirby's jumps, lengthens Kirby's Recovery distance considerably.

, While Kirby has above par ground attacks, Kirby's arsenal of air maneuvers is what truly makes Kirby especially lethal. There are 5 different air attacks using the ""A"" button: Up, Down, Forward, Back, and Neutral. These can only be used while suspended in air after a jump or while falling:

, This attack sends Kirby into a spin in which his arms and feet inflict minor damage. Cause around 8-10% damage.

, This attack is a Drill Kick which inflicts some serious damage and knocks the opponent downward. This attack will be revisited later: 15-20% damage.

, This attack does a horizontal Drill Kick motion in the direction Kirby is facing. Useful for entrapping your opponent in a succession of kicks dealing upwards of 10-15% damage.

, This attack is a Back Kick which attack away from Kirby's face. Does around 16% damage but more importantly strongly knocks your opponent toward the side of the screen.

, Neutral Air attacks use no direction and are executed by pressing only the ""A"" button. Kirby's Neutral Air is a Drift Kick which has an Area of Effect on all sides of Kirby. Another powerful move similar to Kirby's Back Air. Causes around 15% damage.


NOTE: ""B"" Air Attacks are the same or similar in function as ""B"" Ground attacks.

, Just like every other player in the game, Kirby has a defensive skill set which involves a shield to block attacks and a roll to make attacks miss or not get a full connection. Shielding and Rolling are both executed by holding the ""R/Z"" buttons. To shield simply hold ""R/Z"". Shielding does not protect against grabs. Also shields deteriorate over time and grow smaller. Shields also grow smaller as they are subjected to forces and attacks. If your shield breaks you become unconscious. NOTE: Kirby has one advantage in defense that no one else can match. Kirby's Down B has Super Armor, meaning you won't receive knockback, although you'll still take damage., So Kirby will still pop out soon enough. But to Roll it takes ""R/Z""+Analog horizontal motion. To Roll left flick the analog to the left while holding ""R/Z""; and to roll right flick the analog to the right while holding ""R/Z"".

, Throwing can be used as a defensive as well as an offensive maneuver depending on your motives. The action of throwing simply requires pressing the ""R"" or ""Z+A"" buttons while in close proximity to an opponent. Throwing can definitely be useful but unfortunately Kirby's weakest attribute is definitely his ineffective throwing techniques. His Forward Throw, done by grabbing with ""R"" then pointing the analog stick the direction Kirby is facing, is the Pile Driver. He picks up the opponent, flashes upward off the screen, and then slams the opponent explosively on the ground. This move looks flashy but only has one one practical use. On maps like Hyrule or Planet Zebes, Kirby can start throwing on the bottom level but explode them on the top most level which can be somewhat effective if your opponent has sufficient damage. However Kirby's Back Throw, done by grabbing and pointing the analog stick in the opposite direction you're facing, is pretty useless. It throws your opponent at an upward-outward-diagonal direction. It rarely produces a KO, and throws them too high to reach consistently. As a defensive device, throwing can get your opponent away from you which could allow you to retreat from the edge and find more suitable fighting ground. Throws are useful tools to change the tempo of a fight, but they are not main attacks. Using throws as your main offense is a true sign of a beginner. As you gain experience you will see that combos and Smash attacks are more efficient at KO'ing your opponent.

, Once you have mastered Kirby's jump and are comfortable with his Air Attacks, Meteor Smashing is the final step at maximizing Kirby's lethal potential. Several characters in the game have Meteor Smash capabilities: Kirby, DK, Yoshi, Mario, Samus, Captain Falcon, Ness. However, Kirby and DK are the only special ones that have TWO techniques which apply downward force sufficient enough to send an airborne opponent to Super Smash Heaven. Kirby's Down Air Attack, the Drill Kick, is one. And the other is Kirby's Up Special also known as the Final Cutter. Here is the proper technique:

, When an opponent is making a desperate attempt to safely get back to the stage, demoralize them by hovering over them in such a manner as to be directly on top of them in the air. This is especially crucial when smashing the likes of Link and DK because their up Specials are also horizontal attacks. Therefore in order to flawlessly KO them you have to be directly above their head. Once in position, Drill Kick them. Warning: That is the basic technique, but there are consequences of the Meteor action. If you Down Air too violently you can actually self destruct yourself because you will be exerting too much downward force. Luckily Kirby has the best jumps in the game, especially when merged with Jigglypuff powers, and can recover easily. The better way to Drill Kick them downward is to do the Down Air command while Kirby's momentum is still in the upward direction. This causes Kirby to do a hover-like motion in place while Drill Kicking. It provides the same lethal downward force without plummeting you to your death as well. This is the safest and most efficient way to Meteor your opponent. It is also useful in edge guarding. If you do the Hover Drill Kick while above the edge of the stage, then you make it so they cannot grab the ledge and have to go over you or through you.

, This technique is lethal, flashy, demoralizing and risky. When Kirby's blade in the Up Special attack is on its downward motion it provides the sufficient downward force to Meteor your opponent off the stage. Just like the ""Hover"" Drill Kick technique, this attack is designed to jump and execute a downward strike while covering the ledge's access point. If the blades bottom edge catch them they are doomed. But if the point of the sword hits them they only experience the horizontal energy blast, not the downward force. The risky part is that the Final Cutter can sometimes have a horizontal motion as well as vertical. If you are covering the edge and execute the Final Cutter but move off the edge, it will KO you super quick. It's an advanced move, but WICKED if executed.

, Have fun exploring Kirby's skill set and go dominate your friends!

Combating in General.,
Know Your Opponent.,
Combating Heavy Characters.,
Combating Light Characters.What they lack in power, they make up for in speed.,
Combating Swift Characters.",How to Play As Lucario in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U/3ds," It is important to know about Lucario's inherent traits and flaws before playing as him. While individual strategies may change over time, only an update will change these qualities.


Combos aren't his specialty, but they're still possible.
Forward-special becomes a projectile as he takes more damage.
His weight causes him to fall more slowly, thus leaving him vulnerable in air.
His up-special has more end lag than other moves. To avoid being an easy target, aim for the ledge instead of the platform.
His aura-based attacks get stronger as he takes more damage.
His power increases as his stocks decrease.;
, Lucario's tilts compliment his speed well. They are fast enough to ensure a hit, and they provide decent knock-back at higher percents.



Forward Tilt: A quick, 2-hit attack. At low percents, it's good for following up with a grab, dash attack, or smash. It can become a kill move when both Lucario and the opponent are around 150%, but not likely in competitive play thanks to directional influence. However, you can prevent their re-entry with neutral special.

Up-tilt: A circling kick. Its speed and minimal end lag means it can be safely used after shielding. You can also chain a few of them together; heavier characters are most susceptible to it. However, the knock-back is too strong at higher percents for setting up combos.

Down-tilt: A quick, downward kick that, ironically, sends opponents into the air. Like forward-tilt, it combos well into grab and dash attack. However, the hit box is small and the knock-back will be too great at higher percents.

, All of his specials get stronger as he takes damage. As such, he will rely heavily on them.



Neutral-special (aura sphere): A ball of aura that progressively becomes a kill move. By far his most useful move. Side-step dodge out of a charged one, back-throw, and release the full-powered attack. Expect your opponent to shield more in anticipation after you're done charging. Use that time to grab. The only downside is that faster characters can take advantage of the charge time.

Side-special (force palm): This is mainly used when Lucario reaches 50% and up due to its poor hit box and damage beforehand. If close enough, it becomes a grab that can kill at around 90%. Knock-back is determined by your opponent's damage rather than your own.

Up-special (extreme speed): One of the best recoveries in the game, while also being the most dangerous. It has more end lag than any of his other moves, thus making him vulnerable after use. Also, it deals damage, but only for a brief period before it ends. Lastly, its speed and power increase as your damage increases. This makes it even more dangerous because you have to manually guide it and it can easily jet over the entire stage.

Down-special (double team): By far the worst counter in the game. The animation provides enough time for opponents to block. It's also too slow to effectively use in the air. Despite all of that, it can still hit opponents who are off-guard. Its success depends on a smart prediction.

, Despite Lucario's floatiness, he can do damaging aerial combos. While not all of these are the most ideal for an aerial combatant, they're still serviceable.



Neutral-aerial: An aura-based attack whose hit box covers his whole body. Because of its end lag, it's best used as a short-hop set up that requires good timing.

Forward-aerial: The only aerial that combos into itself. You can use it after just about any throw. Though, the opponent's damage will dictate the knock-back, of course. Once that happens, use it to edge guard.

Up-aerial: A reliable follow-up to an up-throw. It can even kill if both you and your opponent are at high percents. Its poor hit box is balanced by its speed.

Back-aerial: Like other back-aerials, it can provide quick kills, more so for Lucario thanks to his aura gimmick. It can't combo into anything, thus making it a great closer to an aerial combo.

Down-aerial: Two quick kicks that do little damage. It's near impossible to integrate into a combo. With practice, however, you can use it as a mix up since it changes your opponent's direction and can be followed up by a grab. Just keep in mind that that's easier said than done.

, Not much to say here. Like most throws, they're good combo-starters. Though, they are better when your opponent is healthy. Also, none of them can kill on their own.



Up-throw: Aside from it being his strongest throw, it send the opponent up far, but not too far, thus making it good for setting up aerial combos.

Down-throw: It sends opponents further up than up-throw, thus making it less reliable. Other than that, it functions pretty much the same way as up-throw.

Back-throw: It slams opponents into the ground behind you. They land close enough for you to do it again, but a dash attack would be better. Though, a fully charged aura sphere best compliments it.

Forward-throw: It has the same perks and the same drawbacks as up-throw and back-throw. To some it's slightly worse, while to others it's just as good. It all comes down to individual playstyle and preference.

, Smash attacks are what Lucario excels at. When Lucario is at 70% and up, charging becomes more of an option. Also, each smash attack has different uses.



Forward-smash: While it does okay damage at low percents, it's a bit too slow to be used whenever. The aura gimmick does nothing to the speed, but it does increase both damage and knock-back. Sneak it in after shield or when your opponent is rushing you.

Down-smash: It's slow, but it hits both directions. If timed right, it can hit opponents just coming out of a side-step dodge. Unlike side-smash, it is usable at both low and high percents.

Up-smash: While not completely terrible, it's the least reliable. If you're at 60% or higher, it can cancel out down tilts, but even at higher percents it won't kill as fast. In addition to that, it's the hardest to hit.

, Contrary to popular belief, it's not wise to wait until your damage is high to take the offensive. As mentioned above, he is a lighter-weighted character so he is more susceptible to knock-back. It is much wiser to take the offensive as early as possible. Also, no combo is set in stone since they are highly situational. Nevertheless, seeing a rough example may help.Just keep in mind that it'll become less usable as either Lucario or your opponent's damage increases.


1) Grab.
2) Rapidly press A to rack up damage.
3) Up-throw.
4) Use forward-aerial attacks in succession.
5) Get close
6) Charge neutral special on them.
7) Grab again.
8) Back-throw.
9) Neutral special.

, Every character has their own unique play style and every experienced player has their own unique habits. Picking up on these requires actual experience. However, know that every character falls victim to the conditions of their weight class. Because of this, general tips will be more useful than suggested combos. Just remember that most are variations on the one in Step 2.


Heavy characters are powerful, bulky, and slow to both move and attack. They also have more landing lag.
Light characters are weaker, the least defensive, and quick to both move and attack. Their stats makes them reliant on combos more than other weight classes.
Swift characters are light characters that they are a stronger, a bit more defensive, and just a tad slower.

, They are the ideal opponents since they hit the hardest. You can play offensively and get significantly stronger from damage in no time. Even so, you do not want to get too hurt. The key to surviving comes down to these tips:


Their landing lag gives you time to set up a combo with a dash attack.
An alternative/follow-up to the dash attack is a down-throw into up-air.
Your smash attacks KO at 60%.
They dish out the greatest knock-back, so floaty characters like Lucario are more vulnerable.
Well-timed spot-dodges will protect against deadly tilts and smashes.
Use down-special just before their smash attack. Their poor speed makes them less likely to block.
Use forward-air more often than back-air.
When landing, use down-air to stop up-tilts/smashes.
Use forward specials at 40% to keep them away.

, They can easily outpace Lucario. This enables them to exploit Lucario's less-than-stellar combo capabilities. The best way to beat them is to exploit their poor defense, keep them at a distance, and disrupt their combos.


Fire a decently charged neutral special that will miss by a small margin. Just as the characters move quickly, so does the opponent's mind; use fear to break their focus.
Use partially charged neutral-specials to keep them away until you're at 60%.
Lucario can use their fast falls to set up combos.
At 60%, forward-special becomes a projectile. Use it to keep them away.
Out-predict them and use down-special. Its slow speed won't matter because they'll be locked into a pre-determined combo.
Their speed allows them to escape Lucario's combos easier.
Above all, play defensively.

, Swift characters can be seen as an unofficial subdivision of light characters. The only reason they are being differentiated is because they are Lucario's biggest threats. Much of the same advice for light characters applies here. However, these are Lucario's biggest threats (specifically Sheik and Zero Suit Samus).


Projectiles aren't as necessary.
They take the greatest advantage of Lucario's slow attacks with their speed and, sometimes, power.
Forward-air is your best bet when they try to get up close.
Before blocking/spot-dodging, determine whether the attack has one or multiple hits. If only one, then prepare for follow-up attacks.
It's very difficult to escape a combo once caught.

Practice.",How to Play As Mega Man in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS," The basic moves are as follows:


Neutral A: Releases three shots from Mega Man's busters. Be careful, because this attack has a limited range.
Forward A: Same as neutral A, only you move while firing.
Up A: A jumping uppercut attack.
Down A: A sliding kick attack that moves you forward a bit.
Dash attack: Mega Man spins forward while doing damage to any opponent he hits.
Neutral aerial: Same as neutral A, where shots are fired while you're falling.
Forward aerial: A slash from a flaming sword.
Back aerial: Mega Man slashes the air behind him.
Up aerial: Produces tornadoes that fly into the air. The tornadoes pull in anyone they touch and pulls them into the air.
Down aerial: Mega Man launches his fist downwards. You can use this move as a meteor smash.;
, The smash attacks are as follows:


Forward smash: A projectile that goes forward; the speed and size of which depends on how long you charge it.
Up smash: A ball of electricity that hits opponents multiple times.
Down smash: Two pillars of fire that throw an opponent upwards.

, The specials are as follows:


Neutral B: A metal blade that you can fire in eight different directions. It hits an opponent twice. Beware, other opponents can grab the blades and use them against you.
Forward B: An explosive that latches onto anything that it touches. This can be transferred to other opponents, including yourself.
Up B: Mega Man uses his robotic dog, Rush, to jump into the air. Other opponents can use Rush to jump into the air as well. If you bounce on Rush twice, the second jump will be higher than the first jump.
Down B: Produces a wall of leaves around you that blocks projectiles. You can launch it by pressing A or B.

, You can use a throw by hitting the L button when close to an opponent, and tilting the control stick in the direction of the throw you want to use.

, You can shield by pressing R. While it's important to be on the offensive, sometimes, you have to be defensive as well. You can tilt the control stick while shielding to roll, and you can press R while in the air to do an air dodge.

, Combos allow you to rack up damage and prevent the opponent from attacking. Use a combination of different attacks to avoid being too predictable.

, When a Smash Ball appears, break it by using attacks against it, and use your Final Smash by pressing B. Mega Man's Final Smash involves him firing a black hole that moves forward, and anyone that gets caught in it is attacked by a massive beam attack from the different forms of Mega Man. The direction the black hole moves depends on the direction you're facing when you unleash your Final Smash.

, For example, you can move the control stick up lightly to do a short hop.

, The most important thing to do if you're looking to get better with Mega Man is to practice. Practice playing in 4-player battles and in 1 vs. 1 matches, both with items on and items off. Each stage has two different forms, its normal form and its Final Destination form. In the Final Destination form, the stage is simply a flat stage with no platforms or obstacles. You can play a stage's Final Destination form by pressing X on the stage selection screen.

Patching


Most Slot 1 carts require that you download and install a proprietary firmware package.,
Running your Homebrew


You should have a grasp of what your solution is capable of if you follow the included instructions or from the manufacturer's homepage.",How to Run Homebrew Games on a Nintendo DS,"


A ""Slot 1"" cartridge, sometimes still referred to as No Pass, may work in many different ways. Original Slot 1 carts extend beyond the casing. However, more current cards now look very similar to official DS cartridges and have a small usb port, a microsd tf card slot, or both. Most Slot 1 carts now support SDHC microsd tf cards, which increase read/write speeds up to 10mbps and increase capacities up to 16gb.
A ""Slot 2"" cart can look like a variant of a Game Boy Advance cartridge (sometimes called ""fat"") or most recently resemble the dust cover cart included with DS Lites. These typically use embedded memory for expanding RAM, storing data, or adding rumble features. However, some still can be found that you can add additional media on your own, such as microsd cards. Be careful not to get the second ""flat"" type of card if you have an original DS!
You typically need additional media, usually microsd tf cards, to attach to your Slot 1 carts. Some Slot 2 carts still have microsd support, but most or all produced now do not. Nintendo appears to be phasing out Slot 2 with the DSi.
Slot 1 and Slot 2 carts are generally only available online, from specialty retailers.
Usually, getting a Slot 1 solution by itself and using a spare microsd card is the cheapest and simplest way to archive your games, or to run homebrew on.
Most Slot 2 carts also require an additional battery to function properly, which not only increases cart costs, but increase overall maintenance of your potential solution. However, some applications cannot run without a Slot 2 cart.;
, Due to limitations, note taking or even browsing the internet may not be an optimal solution.
For additional ideas, you may want to search online for homebrew software.

,
All Slot 2 carts function best if you have some type of configuration utility or DLDI patcher. This is very important because Slot 2 has been utilized in several ways (rumble pack, extended ram, or as a GBA). There is no known auto configuration utility. However, you may want to research in depth your final choices. For instance, if you use a backup of your NDS Browser Cart, it may be difficult to get it to run in combination with the latest EZFlash Slot 2 version.
If you have to patch your ROM files individually, it is recommended that you back up each file before patching.

, If not, please discuss your issues on your solution manufacturers' forums, or in the discussion tab here.
Any specific application can be considered as NDS files or GBA files, as far as your DS is concerned. However, there are applications of homebrew that allow you to do more with several other file types. This means that your DS can use your media while running a nds rom file, so not only does this let you have the opportunity to unlimit your save file bottlenecks but it also lets you use your DS almost like a small pc.

Know that if you order this product by mail, it is likely that you did not receive an installation CD, which is very useful.,
Gather all of the components.,
Notice the menu that appears.,
Discover that there is something called an e:// drive that is not normally there.,
Search Google for ""M3 real system files"", and find a website that gives system files 3.0 or above.,
Download the system files and save them to the M3 Real card, but be sure not to save them in the NDS folder.,
Notice that the box it says ""Built in PDA"", but you will find it is not.,
Return to the NDS folder and create sub-folders (such as MUSIC, PICTURES, etc.).,
Go back and try again if it didn't work.

",How to Use an M3 Real for Nintendo DS," This guide is mainly for those who do not have this CD.;
, There should be a card reader with a USB key on the end. Put the Micro SD card in the reader. Be careful not to break it! Turn on your computer, then stick the card reader containing the card into the USB port.

, Scroll down to find the button that reads ""Open to View Files."" The details of the Micro SD card will be displayed. Use the ""Up One Level"" button in the window. This should take you to ""My Computer.""

, Rename this ""M3 REAL"" and go back into it. Create a folder called NDS (save this for later).

, (Note: On the actual M3 website the system files are wrong!)

, Then, use an extraction program to unzip the files.


If you can't do that, don't worry! Go into the zipped folder and copy all of the files and folders. Create a standard folder called ""system2"" and put them in there. Then, go back, delete the zipped folder, and rename the folder from ""system2"" to ""System"". Be sure to get this right, or it will not work!

, Go back to the web and find M3 Real PDA files and save them to the M3 Real card. Then unzip or copy and paste the files into a standard folder. The M3 Real cannot read zipped folders.

, Place your files (e.g., MP3s) into the corresponding folder.

Go through the tutorial.,



 

Learn the concept of how to complete a puzzle.,





Use ""X"" marks.,





Complete the larger numbers first.,





Fill lower numbers.,





Complete the puzzle using the finished columns and rows.,
Play different levels of the game.",How to Play Picross DS," The tutorial will guide you through how to start a puzzle, explain how the icons and hints work, and allow you to complete the practice puzzle.
, Using a 5 x 5 board as an example, look at the numbers on the top and side. These numbers represent how many squares need to be filled in.

Single numbers represent how many consecutive blocks need to be filled in. The easiest columns and rows to finish are the ones with zeros and the amount of columns/rows there are. Zeros define as there are no blocks to fill in. If you are on a 5x5 board, it's safe to fill in all 5 squares in the corresponding direction.
Double numbers represents how many blocks are filled in, according to the first number, at least one space blank, then fill in consecutive squares according to the second number amount. On a 7x7 board, it's possible to have 3 and 1; 3 consecutive squares filled in, at least one space blank, and 1 square filled.

, Like in Minesweeper, additional ""marks"" assist in knowing where you can and can not accomplish a spot on the board. Tap on the ""X"" icon and place a X in a box where it can't be filled in. This is very useful when zeros are in play; as they can eliminate squares easily. Be sure to tap on the ""Pen"" icon after you have placed any ""X""s on the board., Look to see if there's any high single number columns or rows., Using the image given, all of the ""3"" rows are filled in, in a row appropriately., Using the image on the right, because there needs to be 4 consecutive squares filled in, it's appropriate to fill in the 3rd box down to complete the column. The 3rd column requires 1 square to be filled in, at least 1 space blank, and 2 consecutive squares filled in. You'll see that this has been already accomplished when the ""3"" rows were filled in., Each level or mode challenges a person with certain time limits and time records.

Easy Mode: A total of 15 puzzles, 5 with a 5x5 board and 10 with a 10x10 board. These puzzles create a special picture when completed.
Normal Mode: There's a time limit of 60 minutes (1 hour). If a person exceeds the time limit, they won't receive a special picture at the end and get a ""Time Over"" notice on the screen. Every mistake that you make results in 5 additional seconds on the clock.
Free Mode: Similar to the Normal Mode, but no reminders if mistakes are made.

, This is essential- a screen that is not steady translates to erratic movements and can be fatal.

, Whatever you may think or insist, your finger will not work in a tough fight-- it will hurt you more than help you (it will likely obscure half of the screen).

, The twin lasers have a higher rate of fire and move more rapidly, but plasma shots are more powerful, if slightly slower. The cloak will mask your movements and in a multi-player battle will offer you a relief when your shields are nearing collapse.

, Do not allow anyone to circle in behind you.

, Do not rapidly tap the controls-- holding down a button for a short period of time will fire three bursts very quickly. Do not attempt to shoot down an opponent with a locked shot.

, At the time of this writing, the latest version is 1.18 which was last updated in 2008. There is a third party R4 DS firmware available called WoodR4, which offers better features and greater compatibility with all homebrew games, apps, and emulators. The R4 may not ship with the latest firmware. See below for the proper link.

, The R4 comes with a microSD to USB adapter which is very nice. If you have a memory card reader, use the SD adapter that comes with most microSD cards. In a pinch, put the memory card in a compatible phone and connect the phone to the computer.

, Unpack the contents of this archive to the root directory of your microSD card.

, That should be all it takes. Remove whatever game may be in your DS' Slot-1, insert the R4, and insert the microSD card into the R4. There is only one way it can go, and it will most likely be the way you don't expect. It does not matter in what order you do this - you could also put the microSD card into the R4 and then put the R4 in the DS. (A clever individual can remove the microSD card from the R4 while the R4 is in the DS, but it's a tight area.)

, You should get the safety warning, but before you get a chance to touch the screen to confirm, the R4 should take over. The default DS menu, if it was enabled (it is by default), will be bypassed, and the R4 menu will load. You will get three choices. The first one, Game, will allow you to load a .NDS file (a DS ROM, or a homebrew application - .NDS is to your DS what .EXE is to your Windows computer). The second one, Media, will allow you to play multimedia - music, video, text - using the Moonshell OS. The third one, Slot-2, will allow you to boot a Slot-2 (Game Boy Advance) game.

, See the list linked under references for the compatibility guide - anything with a green square behind R4 is a go!

, The lime green DS that you could get in a package with Personal Trainer: Cooking works, especially against people who are new to the DS world.

Jump on the Koopa.,
Keep jumping on the Koopa.",How to Get More 1ups in Super Mario Bros2," Koopa Troopas are the green or red turtles. As you progress through the game, you’ll often encounter them. If you jump on a Koopa, you’ll only make them hide in their shell. They’ll eventually emerge if you leave them alone. You can only kill Koopas by having them shell-dash off a cliff (or if they walk off a cliff on their own) or by throwing fireballs at them.

, Once you find a Koopa on a flight of stairs, jump (A, 2) on it once to have it hide in its shell. Make sure that it stays on one of the steps on the stairs.

, Once it’s hidden, continue jumping on the Koopa. It’ll stay on the step as it won’t be able to move around, not with the next step going up hindering its movement to the right and Mario jumping on it from the left.


You’ll first earn points as you jump on the Koopa, but if you continue jumping on it, it’ll eventually give you 1ups. Keep doing this for all Koopas you find on stairs to get unlimited 1ups.

, Play the level as you would—get coins, power-ups (if any). It would be best to avoid the enemies though rather than kill each one. Do this until you get to the goal stairs.

, At the top of the stairs, don’t jump just yet. Back up a little until you’re at the left edge of the very last step at the top so you’ll get a good start for your jump towards the goal pole.

, This is your goal, the highest point of the pole. If you jump at the very top of the pole and slide down, you’ll earn 1up for your efforts.


If you found going through the level is easy for you, repeat it. If not, find another level that’s easier for you to finish and reach the goal.

Laminate it!,
Enjoy!",How to Decorate the Cover of Your Nintendo DS," This way, you can change it up if you don't like the way it looks. Use graph paper, if you want to make your design look exact. Be sure to color your design in, too. But at the same time, make sure your design won't be overly crowded. This is important for two reasons. One, the DS has a relatively small screen space, so you won't be able to fit a whole bunch of things on, and two, simpler designs usually look better than complicated ones.;
, Now that you've planned out your design, and you are content with the way things look, gather your supplies. Remember, there is no wrong way to decorate your DS. You can use stickers, rhinestones, photos, paint, markers, drawings, or whatever your imagination comes up with to decorate your DS. Remember, it's your personal design!

, If you are planning to paint or use markers on your DS, make sure it does not damage the software inside of it. For example, cover any open holes in the system (such as the games slot or headphone plug) with tape. Once you finish using the markers or paint, make sure it dries thoroughly before you peel the tap away. Otherwise, this will damage your system!

, Now that you're all prepared, you can apply your design. Arrange the decorations in a way that looks attractive, and looks unique. If you are using a wet substance (such as paint), apply one coat, then wait for it to dry. If it looks like it needs another coat of paint, then you can add one on. Once you've applied your design, wait for it to settle/dry.

, This step is optional, but if you want your picture (photo, drawing, etc.) to look nicer or last longer, use Scotch, or clear packing tape, and apply it over the image. If it has air bubbles, push them out using a sturdy piece of cardboard or an old credit card. You could also use Mod Podge instead of tape if you are laminating an image that you painted onto your DS. Go back to step three if you are using Mod Podge to laminate your design instead of tape. This step will ensure that your picture will not fall off, and will last a lot longer.

, Once your design is finished, enjoy it! Send pictures of it to your friends and admire it. After all, your design is unique because you made it! Have fun with your new, personalized DS!

The box: this is the very first indication of a not-so-authentic DS game.,
The inside of the box: First things first, is there a game booklet?,
If there is no booklet, what else can we look at?,
Time to look at the cartridge itself!,
Alright now we've seen the front, let's turn it over and have a good look at the back.,
So if you've performed all of the above steps and found nothing suspicious, that is a pretty good indication that you've picked up a legitimate Nintendo product.,
Give yourself a pat on the back for selecting a good eBay seller and not falling into the trap of buying a fake Nintendo DS game.

",How to Determine if Your DS Game Is Fake," First off look at the text and the pictures on the front- are they poor quality or pixelated? If yes this suggests that it's not a real copy. Second off, take out the paper cover - it's usually always high quality glossed paper and some parts of it may be shiny. If it's just regular printing paper then it's not real. Next look at the back, there should be a seal verifying the game's authenticity (see picture), the image on the right shows what the European Nintendo seal should look like (note that the image on the left is the official seal for North American Nintendo releases - so if it looks like this it may be a North American copy of the game);
, If there is, it should be staple-bound and be in full colour. Once again, pixelated text or images suggest it's been made by someone other than Nintendo. In the image, (14) shows the serial number in the top right corner of the booklet and that the first 8 characters correspond exactly to those on the game cartridge - if there is no number it may indicate (though not always) that the booklet is fake. Often in pirate games there are no booklets due to the effort expended creating a fake one, but similarly if you're buying the game pre-owned the previous owner may have misplaced it so legitimate games may also be without one.

, Well it isn't too hard to pick up empty cases for DS games, but there are a few differences between those which contain authentic Nintendo products and those which do not. (7) in the image shows that the fake game has two separate nodes to hold in booklets; real Nintendo game boxes only have one. More subtly, (8), which is not visible in the picture, shows that the small protruding nodes on the spine of the game do not have a ring around them in authentic boxes, but they do in the fake boxes. This may seem like petty detail, but the pirates who take your money for fake games don't expect you to be so vigilant when identifying these kinds of errors. One more thing that is easy to check from the box is that in real games, the box has the 'Nintendo DS' logo embossed directly onto the plastic of the box. If there is no logo, the game is a fake for sure. However sometimes in fake games the logo is there but it is stuck on with adhesive to the inside of the box, rather than printed onto the box directly. If you look at the image (13), you can see a very faint line around the logo- this is definitely a sticker job and an indicator of a very sneaky pirate! If there is no line or evidence of the logo being stuck on, then your product is quite probably legitimate.

, Take the game out of the holding clip, and take a look at the front. There are a few things we want to look at. First off look at the sticker- it should be glossy and have rounded corners with the bottom left corner having a chip out of it. The text should be legible and not pixelated, and it should be in full colour. The image shows three examples of legitimate DS games; (9) shows that on each cartridge there is a small 'instep' where the plastic is marginally lower in order to accommodate the sticker, this is big indicator of an authentic game so if there isn't this ridge, it's almost certain your game is a fake. (10) shows that on every game there should be an identical official seal, usually in the bottom left corner somewhere. If there isn't one, the game is likely to be fake. (11) all DS games have this CE symbol on them and it is always in the bottom right corner, no symbol = fake game. (12) shows the Nintendo DS logo, most games fake or not have this symbol BUT often fake games miss off the 'TM' at the end of the logo, this is a sure fire indication that your game is fake.

, The indicators on the back are more subtle, but more likely to indicate a game's questionable authenticity. In the image, (1) shows the join at the back of the cartridge, if it's neat and barely visible, the game is all good, however if it's shabby and obvious, it suggests a fake. (2) shows the Nintendo logo, which always has a 'TM' after it in legit games, but not necessarily in fake ones. (3) is difficult to make out from the image, but the words are much bolder in a fake game, this works best if you have a game you are sure is real to compare it against. (4) shows the serial number of the game, now this is difficult to check but often DS games will have a serial number that starts with A or B, and which corresponds to the middle four letters on the sticker on the front of the cart. This is difficult to check for certain though. (5) shows the chipboard visible through the slats of the casing - there should be numbers and letters visible on the green board, however you may have a fake copy which says 'Nintendo' there instead- that is a certain indicator of a copy. (6) There is a slight difference in the colour of the metal strip visible between the plastic slats, which indicates the use of non-Nintendo hardware- not good.

, It's time to put it in your console and see what happens, since everything appears to be safe. When the start-up screen appears, take a look at the entry for the DS game- if the text description matches the game and the image is both present and believable then you have yourself a proper copy of the game.

Watch the final cutscene.",How to Beat Wizpig in Diddy Kong Racing DS," The location of this race is in the main hub world, inside a Wizpig head poking out of the side of a mountain. This head will appear brown when the game first starts, but once you've collected all of the pieces of the Wizpig Amulet by beating the first four bosses, the head will be lighter in color and its mouth will be open for you to enter.
, You will be racing in a car, and Wizpig will be running. Wizpig is also very fast. Because of those things, it is best for you to choose a character with well balanced stats, such as Diddy Kong or Timber the tiger., This can be done by using your stylus on the touch screen and spinning the wheel at least up to the red zone. This should give you at least somewhat of a boost right off the bat., If you don't, then you will likely wind up falling into water and having to restart the race. Let go of the A button right before you hit each zipper for a speed boost, which will help you stay ahead of Wizpig., If he steps on you, then you will be squished, and you will lose any ground you had on catching him, or you will lose the lead that you had, and you'll likely have to start over., It'll show all of the characters having a party on the island because you beat Wizpig for good. However, Wizpig will show up and crash the party. You will then know that you still have one more world left to do, and one last battle with Wizpig left., This race is located in Future Fun Land, which is the last world in the game. To get there, first make sure that you've beaten all of the trophy races. Then, go over to the signpost located near Sherbet Island. Run into it with any vehicle, and a cutscene should start up. The lighthouse will then turn into a rocket, and you will be transported to Future Fun Land., For this race, you'll be in a plane, so keep that in mind. However, safe bets are usually once again characters with evenly balanced stats, such as Diddy Kong or Timber the Tiger., In order to do this race, you must have beaten all the tracks in Future Fun Land, thus having every ballon in the game. You also must have all of the T.T Amulet pieces, which can be obtained by beating T.T in each of the four Wish Races in the first four worlds. Once you know you've met all the requirements, enter the giant T.T door in Future Fun Land, followed by the giant Wizpig Door., Although you may want to get one because you'll get a head start against Wizpig, you'll wind up crashing into his rocket, which will set you back significantly, and you'll likely need to restart the race altogether., In this race, although there aren't really any zippers that you need to hit, balloons will be your friend. Use at least the second level of missiles when trying to shoot down Wizpig, as they will likely slow him down enough for you to gain some ground. Also, use at least second level blue balloons, as they will help you either keep enough of a lead on him, or catch up to him quickly., It'll show Wizpig crash landing onto a distant planet, and it'll then be followed by a party in the main hub world with all of the inhabitants of Timbers' Island. Next to one of the groups, there'll be a sign that says ""The End"". This will mean that you have officially beaten all of Diddy Kong Racing DS!"

Think about which Nintendo DS model you would like to get.,
Save your money.,
Choose the location that you want to get your new DS from.",How to Buy a Nintendo DS," Nintendo has a chart comparing each Nintendo DS.


The DS Lite is the cheapest model, but you can only play Nintendo DS games and chat with your friends. If you plan on using an emulator (ex. R4), this may be the perfect choice for you, since you can't update the DS. You can also play your old Game Boy games too.
The DSi has a moderate cost, but you get a built in camera. You also have the ability to download games that costs $2-10 dollars. However, the camera isn't good and the Color Change lens don't work properly.
If you like playing games on big screens, the DSi XL is perfect for you. The graphics quality is lower than the DS, DSi and the 3DS, but you get 2 free games pre-installed.
Another model is the Nintendo 3DS. Just like the DSi, there is a camera and the ability to download games. 2 games are pre-installed (Face Raiders and AR games). You can also make a Mii just like on the Wii. Keep in mind that you can get dizzy if you play on 3D mode (the higher the depth, the shorter time it takes to make you dizzy).
A bigger version of the previous model is the Nintendo 3DS XL. It has the same features as the Nintendo 3DS except it is larger, and costs more money. It is ideal for people with larger hands, or for people who want a better ""3D"" experience.
There is also a cheap 3DS known as the 2DS, it is very cheap and it does the same as a 3DS, just without the 3D. it might be outdated soon though.
The latest model of the DS is the new 3DS. It does the same a a regular 3DS but it is faster and the 3D way better. It tracks your head to deliver the 3D to it. This one costs a bit more than a 3ds, but if you want to get a 3DS, you should spend a bit more money on this one, as the other model will be out of date soon.
There is also the New 3DS XL. It is the same as the new 3DS but it is better for people with large hands or just want a bigger screen, just like the 3DS XL.;
, You can do some odd jobs for your neighbors or if you're talented, preform on the street for money. Stash your money somewhere safe, or deposit it into your bank account.

,


You can buy it from a retail store, but most of the prices are the same. If your parents have some loyalty card (ex. Best Buy Reward Zone), you can bring them to the store and buy your DS there, for a win-win solution. You get the DSi, and your parents get some points so they can redeem something!
If you can't afford retail, you can buy a pre-owned DS on eBay. There may be missing parts and a few scratches to compensate for the cheapness.
If you live in New York City, you can go to the Nintendo World Store to buy your DS. You can ask the Ambassadors there for assistance on setting up your DS, and you can get some other Nintendo-themed items for yourself.

Find out which type of touch screen your device uses.,
Test your screen if you're not sure.",How to Make a Stylus1," There are several different types of touch screens and your homemade stylus may not work with all of them.


iPhones, iPads, Androids, Kindles, and many other smart phones and tablets have a capacitive touch screen, which needs an electrical conductor (like the human body) to register where contact is made.
Nintendo DS, The 3Ds, the Nook, and some other phones and e-readers use resistive or infrared touch screens, which only require pressure to register contact. You can use just about anything as a makeshift stylus--just be careful not to scratch the screen.;
, Touch the screen with the tip of a pen cap. If the device responds, it is has a resistive or infrared touch screen. If nothing happens, the screen is inactive.








"
"
Gather your materials.,
Cut off a piece of the sponge about the width of the pen.,
If the sponge has an abrasive side for scouring (like a Scotch-Brite sponge), cut or tear it off.,
Wash and dry the sponge.,
Remove the plastic tip and the interior of the pen--the ballpoint tip, the ink reservoir, and spring if it is a click pen.,
Insert the sponge into the pen.,
Leave about 1/4-1/8 of an inch of the sponge sticking out of the pen.,
Hold your stylus near the tip for it to work.Your fingers need to be touching the base of the pen that is in contact with the sponge.",How to Make a Stylus2," Find a clean dish sponge (not a scour pad) and a ballpoint pen with a removable tip.A cheap, plastic pen works best, as long as you can easily pull off the plastic tip and remove the ink.
A slightly see-through pen can make it easier for you to see what you are doing.

, You can approximate this measurement by holding the pen against the sponge and marking the measurement with a marker, or you can just eyeball it.







, Anything abrasive can scratch and damage your screen. You only want the actual sponge part.







, Some sponges come with soap already added, so to be safe rinse the sponge in warm water. Squeeze out all of the water and let the sponge dry.








, You should be left with the empty base of the pen.








You should be able to pull the tip off with just your hand. If you have difficulty, try using a pair of needle-nose pliers.

, Pinch the sponge to make it smaller and push it into the base of the








, Use your finger to feather and break up the fibers of the sponge., If you hold the hollow part of the pen, the electromagnetic current won't pass through the sponge and the touch screen won't register the touch of the stylus.








"
"
Gather your materials.,
Use a sharp knife to whittle tip of the pencil to a slight, flat angle.You are not sharpening the pencil tip as though you are going to write with it.,
Wrap the entire pencil with at least two layers of aluminum foil.,
Smooth the aluminum foil over the angled tip of your pencil.,
Wrap a piece of tape around the center of the pencil.,
Wrap the tip of the stylus with scotch tape.,
Try your stylus to see if it works.",How to Make a Stylus3," You'll need about a foot of aluminum foil, tape of any kind, and an unsharpened pencil. You may also need a sharp knife to whittle your pencil.If you don't have a pencil, you can substitute a pen, a chopstick, a dowel--anything pen-shaped. Pencils or other wooden objects work best, however, as you may want to cut your stylus to have an angled tip.

, The angled tip should still have a surface area of at least four millimeters, about the size of a pencil eraser or the very tip of your finger. Many capacitive touch screens will not register the touch of anything smaller.The stylus will work without this step, but you will have to hold it straight up and down. This will make it more comfortable to hold.
Always be careful when handling a knife--remember to cut away from your body. Never pull the knife toward yourself.

, Fold the aluminum foil neatly over the tips.









If you are using a pen, keep the cap on the pen when you wrap it., It should be smooth and flat on the tip. You don't want any crinkles or bumps.








If your tip is not flat, your stylus may not work.

, This will keep the foil in place.







, This will protect you screen from getting scratched by the aluminum foil.







, If it isn't working, try to flatten your tip even more. Remember that you want the tip to be at least the size of an eraser or else it may not be acknowledged by your touch screen.







"
"
Gather your materials.,
Sharpen the tip (the narrow tip that touches the food) of the chopstick with the pencil sharpener.,
Smooth the tip using the sandpaper.,
Decorate your stylus with Washi tape or paint.",How to Make a Stylus4," You'll need a single chopstick, sandpaper, and something to sharpen the wood. A hand-operated pencil sharpener is the easiest way, but you could also whittle the tip with a sharp knife if you don't have a pencil sharpener.


Try not to use an electric pencil sharpener--it may break.

, Sharpen it less than you would a pencil--you want it to look more like a blunt pencil tip.








, A sharp tip may damage your touch screen (or you). Rub the tip with the sandpaper until it is blunt. It should not be painful if you press it into your skin.


Sand any rough edges of the chopstick as well so you don't get splinters.

, A few layers of tape wrapped around the stylus may make it more comfortable to hold.









Remember: this stylus will not work on an iPhone, Android, Kindle Fire, or other device with a capacitive screen.

Download and Install the Linux version of Steam, if you have not done so already.,
Find out what the 'launch command' for your non-Steam game is.,
Add it to Steam.,
Modify the shortcut.,
Change the icon being used, if desired.,
Launch the game/program of your choice directly from the Linux Steam client.",How to Launch Non‐Steam Games from Steam (Linux)," You can download the .deb file here or the .rpm/unpackaged file here.;
, For example, for the non-Steam version of Oil Rush, this would be (directories can change depending on your game's install location) ./home/user/Programs/OilRush/launcher_x86.sh


If the launch script for the program is in /usr/bin, take note of the name of the script used (for example, to launch Google Chrome, the launch path is simply: chrome)
If you are adding a WINE/PlayOnLinux program (a Windows-only game you play on Linux) you will need to find the location of the WINEPREFIX for said game. Then find the full directory path to the game. For default WINE the directory is commonly /home/user/.wine/drive_c/Program Files   or Program Files (x86) if you are using 64bit wine.   Refer to playOnLinux to find the location it stores your WINEPREFIXes at, as it can be different for some systems.
For an example we will be using my EvE-Online directory:/home/user/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/CCP/EVE/
The command used for WINE games should be as follows: WINEDEBUG=-all wine ""/home/user/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/CCP/EVE/eve.exe""

, After you have determined the path and launch commands for your program (super simple stuff, right?), open and log in to the Steam client.


Under the ""Library"" section in Steam, on the bottom left click ""Add a Game...""
Click ""Add a Non-Steam game..""
Here's the creative part. You will want to select any random program on the list. Fore example, you might use VLC Media Player.

, You will notice now that VLC Media Player (or whatever you selected) will appear in the clients ""SteamOS+Linux"" Library list. Right-click on the name and select ""Properties"".


First you will change the name of the Shortcut. For example, you might name it ""Eve - Online""
Next you go to the second box down which is ""Target:"". You will change this to your games launch command.

For the Linux game this was: ""/home/user/Programs/OilRush/launcher_x86.sh""
For the WINE game this was: WINEDEBUG=-all wine ""/home/user/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/CCP/EVE/eve.exe""
If the launch script is already in the /usr/bin folder, simply enter what the name of the script is here, with no quotes.
Note: Any /path/to/files should be in "" "" (quotes) to avoid weird things from happening. Seriously, aliens might invade. Use quotes and stay safe.


If you are launching a non-steam Linux game, change the ""Start In:"" to the folder the launch script is located, for WINE/PoL games, or if the launch script is in /usr/bin, leave this as the default.

For Oil Rush ""Start In:"" should be: ""/home/user/Programs/OilRush""
For Eve - Online it should be: ""/usr/bin""
For Chrome it would be: ""/usr/bin""



, To do this, either find a suitable icon with google search and download it, or find where your program stores it's icon at and use that. This varies a lot between programs; common places are in its launcher directory, in /usr/opt, in /home/user/Pictures/Icons, the list goes on.


For WINE/PoL games, if the icon is not easily located within the programs directory, it's likely saved inside the .exe itself, and you have two options..

Search for the icon online. This is simpler, and recommended.
Download a program that strips icon images from .exe files.



, You will have full access to all Steam client features, including in-game overlay complete with music player, web browser, IMs, friends list, the works. You will also get the steam FPS overlay in-game should you enable it in the Steam settings.


Also, you get the added advantage of people on your friends list seeing what game you're playing, even if it's not a Steam game, provided you named the shortcut in Steam properly. Enjoy!

Consider the PlayStation 4's drawbacks.,
Take one last objective look at both consoles before buying one.",How to Decide Between PS4 and Xbox One," Both the PS4 and the Xbox One hover between the $250 and $300 marks; however, there are a few additional costs to factor in:Storage updates. This console generation's disks contain anywhere from 15 to 80 gigabytes of information; coupled with a mandatory installation process, your 500 gigabyte hard drive is going to look pretty small after a few installs. Upgrading to the one terabyte hard drive is nearly essential, and your bill will go up quite a bit when you do so.

External storage. Considering the above, you might just elect for an external drive instead. These tend to run on the expensive side, so budget for another $100 or so on top of your initial price.

Movement recognition. The Xbox One's Kinect is much more expensive than the PlayStation 4's camera that serves the same purpose, and both are considered generally superfluous anyways. If you don't care about motion tracking, this is a non-issue, but it's something to consider otherwise.

Promotional deals. Both consoles occasionally have discounts for a console and game bundle, and your local stores may slash console prices depending on how well they're selling. You can also expect a drop in console prices when the new editions of the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 come out.;
, Do you have a PS3 or an Xbox 360? If so, you might want to stay in your console's lane; otherwise, you'll need to adapt to an entirely new operating system, flagship game franchise lineup, and email account creation.

, Both the PS4 and the Xbox One have multiple flagship franchises carried over from previous generations (for example, the PlayStation has Killzone and Uncharted, while the Xbox has Halo and Gears of War). These games remain as console-specific exclusives; therefore, if you're a die-hard Halo fan, you'll probably want to stick to the Xbox One (and vice versa).

, The Xbox One's ethos is more geared towards multiplayer titles than the PlayStation 4, boasting AAA exclusive titles such as Halo and Titanfall; however, the PlayStation 4 has a wide variety of rich singleplayer experiences that the Xbox One can't quite match. Your preferred style of game may dictate which console you purchase.

, This is one area in which a console's titles are less important than situational context: for example, if you enjoy playing multiplayer games and all of your friends play online using PlayStation 4s, you'll probably want to disregard the Xbox One's slight multiplayer edge.

, Some notable pros include the following:


Extremely responsive to first-person shooter titles (e.g., Halo, Call of Duty, and Titanfall).
Syncs with Windows 10, thereby turning your Xbox One into an entertainment system and extension of your PC.
External hard drive hookup allows you to play games right off of an external hard drive.
Supports backwards compatibility for select Xbox 360 games.

, The Xbox One falls short of the PS4 in a few places:


While processing speed is more powerful than the PS4, the Xbox One's graphical processing is weaker.
You can upgrade internal storage.
Overall unit is larger and more bulky than the PS4.
Exclusives aren't all necessarily multiplayer based, there is a distinct lack of exclusive single player titles in the Xbox market.

, Since most AAA games are now releasing on both platforms, you can focus on the following:Better graphical processing.
Launch titles and flagship games have more emotional depth and an emphasis on storytelling.
Upgradeable internal storage (up to two terabytes).
Generally better indie game support than the Xbox One.
Virtual Reality support.

, Some notable ones are as follows:


No backwards compatibility.
No way to play games off of an external drive (though you can back up your games to an external drive).
The PS4 controller is still considered less ergonomic than the Xbox One's.

, Despite the perks and drawbacks of both, you'll see most of the same titles on both platforms, and the graphics, performance, and overall quality of those titles will be close enough that--if you don't have a technical preference by now--one console's heightened performance in one area is unlikely to change your mind.

Connect your router.",How to Connect Your Xbox to the Internet3," The Xbox 360 can easily access the Internet wirelessly in an instant! It has a built in Wi-Fi adapter that allows it to connect to your router automatically.

, The first time you turn on your console, it will not yet automatically connect to the Internet, since it hasn’t memorized your router’s access information yet.

, In the Network menu, Xbox 360 will display all the Wi-Fi hotspots within its signal’s reach. Once the Xbox 360 detects your router in the Network, select it and you will be able to access the Internet. You may have to enter your router’s password first, depending on your router’s security settings. Xbox 360 will now remember this wireless setup and use it automatically on your following sessions.


If you have an Ethernet cable connected to your console, it will automatically go into “wired” Internet connection mode. If you want to stay connected wirelessly just disconnect the Ethernet cable from your unit.
You may need to adjust your console’s wireless configuration setting if your console fails to connect to the Internet. When in doubt, set everything to automatic or simply reset to default.

Mix a solution of even parts isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol and water.,
Hold the disc by the hole in the middle and the outer edges.,
Dip a microfiber cloth into the mixture.,
Wipe the disc from the center straight out to the edge.,
Place the disc bottom-up for a few moments to dry.",How to Clean an Xbox Game Disc1," Isopropyl alcohol is a powerful cleaning agent, and you can get it for cheap from most grocery stores.


If you don't have isopropyl alcohol, window cleaner will work as well.;
, Avoid touching any of the disc surface.

, Microfiber is very tightly-woven, and is soft to the touch. It will pick up dirt and dust without scratching the disc's surface.Don't use tissue, paper, towels, or cotton to wipe the disc. These materials all pose a scratching risk.

, Rotate the disc and wipe again from the center to the edge. Keep rotating until the entire disc has been wiped.


Wipe straight from the center instead of in circles. Wiping in circles around the disc can increase the risk of scratching., Allow the disc to air dry, but don't place it in direct sunlight. Isopropyl alcohol should only take a few seconds to dry; window cleaner may take a little longer.


Avoid drying with a dry cloth, as this can promote scratching.

"
"
Get a non-bleaching toothpaste.,
Put a small drop of toothpaste on the disc surface.,
Add a small amount of water.,
Use your finger or a microfiber cloth to buff out scratches.,
Rinse the disc with warm water when you're finished.,
Consider professional resurfacing.",How to Clean an Xbox Game Disc2," Since toothpaste is slightly abrasive, you can use it to polish off light scratches on the surface of your disc. Make sure that it is not a whitening or bleaching toothpaste, as these contain chemicals that can damage the disc.Baking soda toothpaste will give the best results. Avoid gel-based toothpastes.

, You don't need much, a little smaller than a pea should be sufficient.

, Just a drop or two should be enough, you want to be able to make a paste with the toothpaste, but not turn it too runny.

, If you're using your finger, make sure that you've cleaned it first to remove excess oils. Apply gentle pressure and rub back and forth over the scratch to polish it out.


Rub from the center towards the edge, not in a circular motion.

, Make sure that all of the excess toothpaste has been removed from the disc surface. Allow the disc to air dry after rinsing it off.

, If the scratches are too much for toothpaste to handle, your only other option may be professional resurfacing. This is usually a pretty expensive process, and if the game is older it may be cheaper to just buy a new copy.


Check your local used video game, music, or movie stores to see if they offer disc resurfacing services.

Begin Level 32 of the single player campaign, by entering the campaign menu and selecting Level 32.,
Read the opening blurb and view the map to gain your bearings.,
Move your first worm right under the first ledge and backflip up onto the area just below the first mine.,
Get your second worm to place a horizontal girder in the area between the second tower and the third tower, the area with only one mine underfoot.,
Move your first worm to the area just above the gap between the first and second towers.,
Use your second worm to place a girder as cover over wherever your first worm is, as the enemy worm will begin using his air strikes in the next turn.,
Fire punch the enemy worm into the ocean with your first worm, thus winning the level.",How to Complete Level 32 in Single Player Campaign on Worms 2: Armageddon," You MUST have already purchased this campaign level from the Worms marketplace for 100 gold or the option to play it will not be available.;
, You must get across the map in under 5 minutes and kill the enemy worm before he kills you with his air strikes. You only have a fire punch and five girders in your arsenal and the terrain is filled with mines, so you will have to use your wits. You have 4 turns to complete your task.

, You will then need to quickly backflip right up next to the first mine, setting of its' self-destruct timer, and move past it to the roof just below the second mine. Although it may be tempting to then try to backflip over the next mine, you will not be able to, so the best method is to backflip at the exact moment the first mine explodes - this will hopefully throw your worm above the second mine and onto the top of the first spire. Your first turn will end and the enemy worm will skip his turn.

, This second worm will not be able to move any further on the map and its' only use will be to place girders for the first worm. Your second turn will end and the enemy worm will once again skip his turn.

, There will be two mines there; you need to jump across to the second mine, backflip onto the ledge above it, and quickly get out of the blast radius by moving onto the girder the second worm placed for you. Before the turn is done, you will need to get onto the other side of the third tower, or you probably will get stuck when the enemy worm fires off his air strikes. If possible, get right next to the enemy worm if you can. Your third turn will end and the enemy worm will skip his turn.

, If the first worm is next to the enemy, then the cover is not needed, but it's always good to be sure. Of course, this will mean the second worm will receive the brunt of the air strikes. Your fourth turn will end and the enemy worm should fire an air strike into the second worm, or into the cover provided for the first.

, Congratulations!

, Use the hose with an attachment to suck the dust out of the holes in the front of the system. Do not push or rub over these holes, because you could push dirt and dust deeper into your system., Turn the faceplate over and go over it with a damp rag. Once you're done removing the dirt and dust that's built up, make sure to let it dry completely. Do not reattach it to your system while wet.

Reattach the lid to the console.",How to Clean an Xbox3," Before you clean your Xbox, you'll want to make sure that there's no electricity running through it. Unplug the console and make sure that there are no frayed wires or broken ports. Work on a flat, static-free surface, like a kitchen table, when cleaning your console.

, Flip the console over and pick out the rubber feet on the corners of the console with your fingers. You can also use a flathead screwdriver to get the feet up if you are having issues.Note that using this cleaning method will void the warranty on your Xbox.

, Once you get the feet off, you'll see four screws under each of them. These screws require a torque 20 screwdriver that you can pick up at a hardware store, or buy online. Unscrew all four screws that are under the rubber feet, then find the two screws in the center of the console. These will be located under the stickers.To find the last two screws, feel the surface of each of the stickers on the bottom of your console until you feel the rounded head of a screw.

, To discharge static electricity, ground yourself by touching a metal object or by wearing an anti-static wristband. This will prevent shorting out the internal components of the Xbox., Once you remove all six screws on the bottom of the console, you should be able to lift the lid of the console off of the base of the system. Be careful when doing this, as it will expose the inner parts of your system.

, Once you remove the exterior lid of the console, you can wipe it down with a damp rag and a drop of dish soap without affecting the electronic parts inside of the console. Take the lid and wipe over the surface of the console with a damp rag and dish soap.Do this far away from the electronic components of the Xbox.
You can wipe down the console with a dry cloth to maintain it over time.

, Compressed or canned air will disrupt the dust particles trapped in the console. Use the attachment to get into especially dusty areas and try to discharge the dust from the inside of the system.

, Once the exterior of the console has fully dried, you can reattach it to the other part of your Xbox by placing it over the Xbox and then screwing the screws on the bottom of the Xbox back in. Do not use cleaners on the Xbox when the protective casing is screwed into it.

Don't impersonate or defame anyone else.",How to Choose a Good Xbox Gamertag," Having trouble thinking of a good Gamertag? Your actual name is a great place to start. Try making a play on your first or last name. If you have a nickname, you can use it as well. Another idea is to make a pun or a reference to a character with a similar name from fiction.



Examples: Someone named John Smith might try XxSmithxX, JSmith95, JohnnyBoy1234, or AgentSmith4589.

Don't include your full, real name in your Gamertag. Keep in mind that anyone you play on Xbox Live will be able to see your name. For security reasons, it's a wise idea to keep your real-world identity to yourself.;
, If there's a specific game you love, consider referring to it in your name. It doesn't matter whether you play this game any more than the others. You might try naming yourself after a character from this game. You can also try something less on-the-nose like a place, weapon, or event.



Examples: If you love the Halo series, you might try MasterChief3000, MrNeedler, CortanaLover99, CovenenantSquad01, or EliteHammer.

, Video games aren't the only things in the world that interest you, so they don't have to be the only things in your name. Draw on your wide range of skills, hobbies, and interests to think of an idea. You might reference an animal you like, a band you're a fan of, your dream car, or something else entirely. It's all up to you!



Examples: If you're a musician, you might try names with music terminology like TrebleKill333, BassicInstinct, Bad2theTrombone, BFlattened, and so on.

, Intent on completely wrecking your competition online? Let other players know that you mean business with a name that calls attention to your lethal skill with a controller. Go for a name that sounds scary, deadly, or diabolical. Keep in mind, though, that hate speech and offensive content are banned under the XBox Live terms of service.Examples: 7Obliter8r9, MsJennyDeath, Noobs Beware, KillerJoe, etc.

, Another way to give your competition the jitters is not to outright say that you plan to destroy them. Instead, suggest it. Names that imply some sort of mysterious or suspicious quality are quite popular as Gamertags. Sometimes, it's all about what you don't tell your enemy.



Examples: OnlyInTheShadows, Ninjitsu765, UnseenDoom, BehindYou!

, Your Gamertag doesn't have to be grim or serious. In fact, having a more light-hearted one can make you seem more approachable to other players. This can be good when you're working with teammates toward a shared objective. Names that make someone laugh at first sight are always a good bet. Since you're working with a limited number of characters, quick puns are often easiest.



Examples: ChrisPBacon, CubaBaddingJR, TheOtherGuy, HeyYou (so that when people talk to you in-game, it's confusing.)
You may want to try using an online tool like the Pun Generator (available here) if you're having trouble thinking of ideas., All you need is a few words of a non-English language to give yourself a Gamertag that's unique in English-language games. You have a few options here. One is to translate a cool-sounding name that's already taken into another language. You can also try using the language's equivalent of your real name. You can even just find a word that you like the look of — it's up to you!



Examples: If you're a fan of bears, you might try Urso734 (""Urso"" is ""bear"" in Portuguese) or 123Ayi (""Ayi"" is ""bear"" in Turkish)
Online translators like Google Translate and Freetranslation.com can help with these sorts of names., There's no rule that your name has to make sense. In fact, the more random your name, the less likely that it's already taken. Try combining two words that have no connection or using a random adjective to describe a word you happen to like. The more creative, the better!



Examples: GrandioseFox, OceanPillar1524, PantHill93, Seven8Six, etc.
You can even use a nonsense word or phrase — something that means nothing at all.

, Before you go to the trouble of logging in and making a Gamertag for yourself, save yourself time by checking to see whether it's already taken. There are a few sites that allow you to do this online. A basic search engine query should reveal several.


For example, this site works well., Is a gamertag that you really want taken? Don't worry! You can probably get a very similar name just by adding or changing a few letters. One common way is to put a string of numbers at the beginning or end of the name. You can also try spelling the name differently, adding extra letters, changing the spacing, and so on.


For example, if you want the name ""MrJim"" but it's already taken, you might try ""MrJim127482,"" ""123Mr Jim456,"" or something similar.

, Another common way that gamers get the name they want is by making designs on either side of their name. This is done with whatever letters and numbers are available. This can give the visual impression that your name is jeweled or decorated. There's no ""right"" way to do this, but arrangements of symmetrical letters like Xs, Os, Is, and Ys are common.


For example, if you want the name ""SallyRide"" but it's already taken, you might try ""xXSallyRideXx"", ""OoOoSallyRideoOoO"", or something similar.

, In online games, clans are essentially ""clubs"" that avid gamers can join to play with people they know. Often, players advertise their clan membership by putting the name of their clan at the beginning of their username. This can also help you get a name that's already taken — odds are, the version with the clan name at the front is free.


For example, if you're in the ""Fyre"" clan and you want the name ""Lazr33"", you might advertise your membership like this: ""xFyrexLazr33""
Clans will often have instructions on exactly how to format your Gamertag to advertise your membership. Be sure to follow the directions!

, There are very few rules dictating what you can and can't put in your Gamertag. There rules that do exist are covered in the XBox Live Code of Conduct. All players agree to follow this code when they sign up for Live. Perhaps the biggest rule about Gamertags is that absolutely no offensive language is allowed. Accounts that break this rule may be suspended or banned. The Code's definition of ""offensive language"" includes:Curse words
Hate speech (e.g., racist/sexist slurs)
Illegal drug references
Controversial religious topics
Controversial historical figures or events

, The other major rule about Gamertags is that very few sexual terms are allowed in users' names. As a general rule, anything that could be considered remotely ""dirty"" is off-limits. However, a few ""clean"" terms are allowed in Gamertags. These terms are:""Gay,"" ""Bi,"" and ""Lesbian""
""Transgender""
""Straight""

, Even if your Gamertag isn't technically offensive, your account may still be probated or banned if your Gamertag tries to get around the rules with words that imply offensive concepts. It's usually obvious when a user is trying to ""cheat"" the Code of Conduct, so these sorts of names are almost always a waste of time.For instance, the name ""Adolph Hitler"" would definitely be prohibited under the rule against controversial historical figures. However, a name like ""A. Dolph Hit L.R."" would also be prohibited, since it's clearly referencing the same person.

, No matter what Gamertag you use, make sure it's your own. The buying and selling of Gamertags is against the XBox Live Code of Conduct. In these cases, both the seller and the buyer may be subject to penalties or bans.


If someone already has a name you want, use the tricks in the section above to find a name that's close to it. Don't try to buy or steal the name.

, Picking a name that's intended to cheapen another person's name, whether that's through imitation or personal attacks, is off limits. This extends to other players, moderators, game developers, and Microsoft staffers. Make sure your name is all about you — not someone else.


Imitating authority figures like moderators and staff members is a tactic that is commonly used for scams. If you do this, even if you have nothing but the best intentions in mind, it can still earn you a ban or probation.

, The only one screw is circled in red. Be careful not to touch the plastic bumpers circled in blue. In the event that you do, consult the ""Tips"" section of this article.

, Practically every gear in this area moves every other gear, but the white one seems the easiest to twist. Keep twisting until the two catches circled in green are completely lowered.

, These catches keep you from inserting a second disc. You should not have to twist the white gear fully counterclockwise and it is a good idea not to. Make sure the left black platform is not tight against anything - especially the stuff towards the bottom edge.

,


When this is done, your rollers should be slightly loose. Work with the rollers and the white gear until they are just tight enough to loosely hold a CD as though the drive were reading it.

, Pay attention to how the junk CD locks into place as though you still cared about it.

,


You can shake it lightly, but if it doesn't come together smoothly, something might be misaligned. Go back and tweak until it comes together with relative ease. Don't forget the white magnet.

, It should come out smoothly and be re-accepted smoothly.

Inspect the scratches.,
Dampen a soft, lint-free cloth.,

Apply a small amount of toothpaste to the polishing cloth.,
Gently rub the toothpaste over the disk.,
Wash the disc off with cold water.,
Dry the disk.,
Test the game.",How to Fix a Scratched Video Game Disk with White Toothpaste," Toothpaste works best for shallow scratches and scuffs on the reflective side.It will probably not work on a deep scratch. Scratches on the non-reflective label side should never be rubbed, and may have caused irreparable damage.


If you have deep scratches, consider sending the disk to a disk repair service. You could also try more abrasive treatments, such as a non-petroleum-based metal polish.;
, Lightly dampen a cotton or microfiber cloth. You'll use this to clean grime off the disk. If you skip this section, the toothpaste could rub dirt particles into the CD, making the scratch worse.









Avoid any rough or dusty materials.
If the disk is visibly greasy or dirty, wipe it under running water.

, Gently brush the wet cloth against the disk. Wipe each stroke outwards from the center, like a spoke on a bicycle wheel. Rubbing in circles increases the risk of damage.








Hold the disk by the rim to avoid adding additional dirt and oil from your fingers.

, A dry cloth is more likely to damage the disk. One of these methods of drying are recommended instead:









Place face down on a couple layers of paper towel and wait until dry.
Loosely wad a paper towel and brush from the center outward. Do not push onto the disk; the only pressure should come from the bending of the paper towel.Let air dry.

, You must use actual paste, not a gel toothpaste. The paste contains abrasive material that scrapes plaque off your teeth. This will sand down the scratched surface as well, hiding the scratch causing the laser to misread.Baking soda toothpaste works well due to the extra grit.
If you're lucky, your toothpaste will list an abrasion rating, called RDA.No one's tested how RDA affects disk cleaning, but a higher rating (120+) should work better.

, A small dab should be enough. As before, use a clean, lint-free cloth such as cotton or microfiber.

, Always move radially, from the center of the disk straight out to the rim. Do not rub in circular motions. Continue rubbing gently until the scratch is gone or nearly gone. This can take a few minutes.










Do not polish harder in an attempt to speed up the process. This can cause further damage to the disk.

, Ensure that you remove all of the toothpaste. You may need to use a clean polishing cloth to remove residue, using the same wiping pattern.








, You may wipe it with a dry cloth, but blotting with a paper towel is safer. You should notice that scratches are fainter or even completely gone. You may have made some additional tiny scratches, but provided that you did not press hard, these shouldn’t interfere with the disk.







, Place the disk into the appropriate drive and see if it works. If so, then you are done. If not, repeat the toothpaste treatment for a second round.









If there is no noticeable improvement at all, try again with a grittier toothpaste, or with petroleum-free metal polish.
If two rounds of polishing do not work, try sending it to a disk repair service. These can buff out the scratches with a special machine.

Get your Xbox professionally repaired.",How to Fix a Broken Xbox," Before trying to do any repairs on your Xbox, check to see if you are still covered by a warranty. If you open your Xbox, you will lose your warranty


Xbox 360 consoles have a standard 1-year warranty.
Original Xbox 360 consoles have a 3-year warranty if they experience three flashing red lights or Error E74. This does not apply to the E or S models.;
, There are several common problems that affect various Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles. Identifying the problem will help you determine what you need to do in order to fix it.


Red Ring of Death - This is the most common problem to plague Xbox 360s, especially older ones. You'll know you have it if the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Player lights are flashing red around the Power button.
Disc-read error - If your discs are not working, you may need to replace the disc drive in the Xbox or Xbox 360.
E74 Error - If you see this displayed on your screen, your board has warped and some of the chips have potentially come loose.

, In order to repair any of these problems, you will need to open your console. This is typically a fairly involved process, especially for the Xbox 360. Opening your console may require special tools such as a Torx screwdriver and an opening tool.



See this guide for opening an Xbox 360.
See this guide for opening an original Xbox

, Fixing this problem usually involves replacing the thermal paste and pads for the cooling apparatus. You will need to purchase a fix-it kit that comes with replacement pads and thermal paste. Some come with replacement braces as well, which put less strain on the equipment.



See this guide for step-by-step instructions on fixing a Red Ring of Death or E74 Error.
There is no guarantee that any fix will get your console working again, or that it will work for long after being fixed.

, If the Xbox says it can't read your disc, look to see if it has any scratches or fingerprints on it. If it does, it's not a problem with the XBox. If the disk looks fine, it's a hardware problem. See this guide for detailed instructions for fixing a variety of disc-based errors, or read on to learn how to clean the laser.


Open up your XBox and remove the disk drive. See the guides in Step 3 to find detailed instructions for your particular Xbox console. Make note of where the cables were connected.
Take a cotton swap, dip the tip in rubbing alcohol, and clean the laser head. Allow it to dry for 15 minutes.
Reinsert the drive into your Xbox, close it up, and see if it reads the disc.
If it still doesn't work, you may need to replace the drive. Open your Xbox again, and make a note of the brand and model number. Purchase a new drive, identical to the old one. Make sure to change the face and swap the boards.

, Even if your Xbox is out of warranty, there are many local repair shops that will attempt to repair your console for you. Find a trusted shop and get a quote on what repairs might cost. Weigh this cost against the cost of simply purchasing a new console.

, At the other end of that side, you will see five more of these tabs. Pop them one at a time, keeping constant pressure as you open the shell, or use the case tool to open them all at once.

, Flip the 360 around to look at the front end, find the clip at the end near the DVD drive. This can be easily opened with your fingernail or a flathead screwdriver and a good deal of prying. There should be four tabs on this side, which you can take one at a time.

, With the shell removed, you should be able to see the inner casing now. Open this by unscrewing the cover panel. Flip the Xbox onto the opposite side and pull off the remaining shell to reveal the inner components.

Mod the hard disk drive.",How to Disassemble an Xbox3," The cables which are attached to the DVD drive are very delicate so carefully remove this component first. Lift it up just enough to get to the cables and then gently pull out both of them.


The DVD drive can be flashed, through a complex modding process, if certain malfunctions occur or firm or software modding is desired. However, if Microsoft discovers this type of modding, it will earn you a lifetime ban from Xbox Live.

, First, lift the white section of plastic. The fan below can be popped out, but there are also cables attached, so carefully remove those before pulling the fan out all of the way.

, The ring controls are easily accessed for modding or repair once the case is open like this.

, The motherboard will also now be easily visible and accessible. You can carefully pull it up by the silver box at the center or fix it in place.


Access to the motherboard can allow you to fix the heatsink (the usual cause of the Red Ring Of Death) by re-soldering or installing new screws. It will also allow you access for software or firmware mods, like reset glitch hacks. Just remember that these are very complex processes, even for those who are very skilled, and can get you banned by Microsoft.

, Though it is not located in the main case, you can also open the hard disk drive in order to install a drive with more storage space. This is done by unscrewing all of the pieces, unplugging the HDD and sliding it out of the bay. At this point it is easily replaced with another hard drive, as the cables used are standard."

",How to Fix a Scratched Video Game1," A video game cd with major scratched will probably have to be professionally resurfaced, meaning it most likely cannot be fixed at home.;

Inspect for scratches.",How to Fix a Scratched Video Game3,"


Make sure to choose a toothpaste that's actually an abrasive, one that feels gritty between your fingers or when it's in your mouth. A natural, chunkier toothpaste will work best.

, Don't rub the toothpaste in circles; it will only create more scratches that are harder for the console to read.

,, If the scratch looks entirely polished away, try putting it into your console and playing it. If it still looks scratched, you may need to gently polish it several more times until the scratches are completely gone.


Over repeated polishing, the scratch will start to look like more of a shadow. When you're got it to this state, you're good.

The Boneyard is one of the smaller maps available.,
There is a staircase leading up to a platform at each team's base.,
Snipers really have no place in this level.,
There are many airplanes hulls laying around that you can climb inside.,
If you're on the team that spawns near Zone D, there is a great place to spawn camp.,
Desert Gulch is another smallish level that works well for Sharpshooter and Last Man Standing matches.,
There are paths that lead along the edges from one base to the other, which make great trails for making flag runs in CTF games.,
Quick reflexes are necessary in this level.,
If you're playing a Last Man Standing match, there are several places where you can hide out.,
Dry Dock is the darkest multiplayer map, making it difficult to see enemy movement.,
There are plenty of walkways that go up above the floor on this level, though you shouldn't use them to quickly move to enemy territory.,
In the center of the map is a choke point.,
The key to victory on this stage is to know the terrain and quickly be able to pick out what movement indicates enemy motion and which is simply rain making splashes.,
The fishing village is another giant map that won't work well unless you have a large game going on.,
Because this takes place in a jungle, there is plenty of opportunity for long range combat.,
Nowhere is a large map that puts one team up on top of a hill while the other team is separated from them by a large rocky outcropping.,
This map is a camper's delight.,
Rocky Cove is a symmetrical map that is based around one platform in the middle of the two spawn points.,
The key to domination on this map is to control the central outcropping.,
Nowhere is one of the more popular maps and so you should practice mostly on that one.

,
Remember to lie in a prone position for maximum accuracy.",How to Be Great at Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter (Graw)," This means that it's great for games with only 4-8 people in it, but is still hectic and fun for larger games. The map is a set in a junkyard with bits of old airplanes strewn about throughout the field, making for lots of trails and shooting opportunities through the filth. This is a dark map, so if you're having trouble seeing you might be tempted to turn on your night vision. We found it is a better move to just turn the brightness up on your television. Since this is a compact map, the game modes we like to play on this map are CTF, Zones, and Elimination.;
, When playing any sort of objective based game, make sure you place one team member up there in the prone position on the side opposite where you spawned. This will allow you to pick off any enemies dumb enough to try to make a straight run at your base after spawning.

, There isn't enough room to need the extra sighting that one can get over an MR-C, so just stick with that if you're going to camp. If not, Auto Rifleman and Grenadiers have a nice role on this map. With such small confines and a lot of turns, being able to unload your fire quickly and powerfully is important.

, Don't bother doing this unless you're playing a game with 16 players or a no respawn rule set. The action on this map is hectic enough that waiting around for someone to wander by will cause you to fall way behind.

, If you go to the north of where the opposite team is spawning, you'll find a small staircase that leads to nothing. If you sit back in that cubby, you can get a clear view of the other team as they appear. Just remember not to fire and give away your position until they are no longer invulnerable.

, It takes place in a scene straight out of Road Runner cartoons with plenty of raised plateaus blocking your field of view and creating an interesting maze. Due to its winding paths and limited open space, the Marksman class is not as useful here as he is in other stages. The Rifleman and Auto Rifleman will find the greatest success here due to their fast shooting and ability to shoot while moving.

, The rock outcroppings provide plenty of cover and you can quickly duck off into a side road if you find someone tailing you too closely. Similar to these trails are three fairly straight paths that run north-south. A good shot can camp out at one end of these and gun down anybody that hangs around in these shooting alleys.

, Don't lay prone because everyone else is going to be moving so much that you'll quickly find yourself ambushed. Instead, run around in the crouched position and always be ready to pull the Left Trigger to aim and fire off a few shots when you see enemy movement.

, One of the best is on the far eastern side. There is a lake there that you can cross to the other side and hide out on the shore. It gives you a full view of anybody creeping in your area and will allow for some great sniping moments.

, It is a fairly small stage, allowing for intense battles even with 4-8 players. The map takes place on a stormy night in a symmetrical dock region and is great for Elimination and Territory matches.

, The added height they give you will make you an easy target for everyone playing and you'll quickly be picked off. It is a better idea to stick to the low ground and travel under the large pipes rather than sticking your head up.

, There are a series of walkways in the middle that are the only way to get across, but doing so will require you to move out of cover. If you're making a run across this area, stay crouched and move quickly. Your team is going to want to make sure that enemies don't have an easy time moving through this area, especially in a Territory match. To do so, look for the raised platforms on the north and south ends of the map. Situate one team member with an MR-C laying prone on the platform and you'll be able to camp for a few kills before anybody realizes what you're doing.

, Night vision works fairly well for finding enemies, but don't run around with it on since you lose some range of sight. We find it better to just turn the brightness up on your screen rather than deal it.

, It consists of a village on the north end where one team's base is. There is a smaller series of huts on the south end where the opposing team will start. Although the village at the north end can give some great urban combat situations, the majority of fighting will take place in the jungle between the two bases.

, Auto Rifleman will find themselves being picked off without knowing who hit them as they try to quickly move into enemy territory. Stick with Rifleman and Marksman and make your moves carefully. Stick behind rocks and don't travel along the dirt paths -- these paths are perfect sniping alleys and you can be sure someone is going to be camped at one end of them waiting for a sucker to try running along them. The platform at Zone A is a particularly great place to park and camp.

, There are three major lanes for travel on this map. You can move through the rocks, down the middle which will require you to move through the junkyard and past some buildings so that you don't overexpose yourself, or you can move through the trench that runs around the far outside portion of the map.

, There are a ton of places to sit down and snipe your enemies, especially if you start at the bottom of the hill. The far west side of the map has a little area that is recessed and behind some fences and houses. You can lay down there and have a full view of the long road leading up to the other spawn point, allowing you to take down your enemies as they appear. If you find this happening to you, spawn in the second point that is inside the buildings and then run around through the trench to smoke the camper out. Campers can also set up shop at the bottom or top of the rocky outcropping. This means that you'll want to move through these paths slowly and deliberately so that you don't run into a trap.

, Like other maps, there are several set routes for moving across the stage. You can work your way through the rocks on the north end. This will protect you from any sniper fire, but you'll have to be ready for anything around each bend. You can move across the south side underneath the two little pools. This makes you vulnerable to some long range fire, but there are plenty of rocks to seek cover behind. Since this is a more open area, we don't suggest running through here with a weapon that doesn't have at least some sort of scope. Finally, you can simply run across the beach. Unless your team has decisive control over the central portion of the map, this is not recommended because you'll be vulnerable to fire from all sides.

, This is easier said than done because as soon as you get on top of it, you'll become a target from nearly every point on the map. To stay alive you have to stay low. Lay prone next to a rock and target any enemies running across the beach towards you. Hopefully, your teammates will be able to protect you from anybody running through the maze of rocks on the north side. If you can do this, you'll be set to win any type of game mode that you're playing.

, Always use a smooth-textured, lint-free material, such as cotton or microfiber cloth. Avoid rough materials such as facial tissues or paper towels.

, Use regular tap water to wet a small area of the cloth, then squeeze it out to remove excess water.


Never use household cleaning products, which can ruin the disc.
Disc repair products may be sold as ""scratch repair"" or ""CD/DVD repair"" products.

, Do not place your fingers on the surface of the disc. Turn the game disc so the non-labeled, reflective side faces you.


If the labeled side is clearly dirty, you can use this same method — but be extremely careful, as wiping the labeled side too vigorously can destroy the data on some game discs., Gently wipe the disc with the wet cloth, starting from the center hole and moving in a straight, short line to the rim. Repeat until the entire disc has been wiped.


Never move the cloth in circles around the disc, as this can damage it.

, Wipe the same side of the disc a second time. This time, use the dry portion of the cloth to remove moisture. Take care to use the same straight strokes, from the center of the disc outward. Dry wiping is more likely to scratch the disc than wet, so be extra gentle during this step., Put the disc down with the reflective side face-up. Wait at least two minutes to allow the remaining moisture to evaporate. Once the disc is completely dry, put the disc into the disc drive of your game console or computer and check whether the problem is fixed.


If there are still problems, try the other methods below. If your other games also won't run, clean your disc drive.

Understand the risk.,
Mail your disc to a repair service.,
Remove fingerprints and grease with rubbing alcohol.,
Purchase a disc cleaner spray.,
Use a non-whitening, non-tartar-control toothpaste.,
Select a safe polish.,
Use a clear wax.",How to Clean a Game Disc2," Most game disc manufacturers do not recommend using anything but water, but that's not always going to get the job done. These alternatives below are listed with the safest methods at the top, increasing in risk as you move down the list. Always use gently motions when cleaning to reduce the chance of scratches.

, If you aren't prepared to risk damage, search online for a mail-in disc repair service in your country. These services may have buffing machines or cleaning products that are not commercially available.

, This method will not repair scratches, but should remove grease stains. Apply a dab of isopropyl alcohol to a clean cloth, and rub the disc from the center to the rim. Carefully wipe off moisture with a dry cloth with the same motions, then let sit for two minutes so it is completely dry.


Since dry cloths can cause scratches, some disc owners prefer to let the disc air-dry for half an hour or more instead.

, If the game still won't boot up, purchase a ""disc repair"" product in spray bottle form and follow the instructions on the packaging to clean the disc. This may be sold as a ""CD/DVD repair"" or ""scratch repair"" product.


Using a disc repair buffing wheel or other machine that comes with the disc repair product is highly discouraged, as these can cause damage.Always check the warnings to make sure the product is safe for your type of disc.

, Toothpaste is slightly abrasive, and can polish off scratches with low risk of causing more damage.For maximum safety, avoid whitening and tartar control toothpastes, which tend to be more abrasive.Apply the toothpaste as you would water or rubbing alcohol, as described above.


The toothpaste must be in paste form. Don't use a gel, liquid or powder.

, If toothpaste doesn't work, you can move on to plastic polish, furniture polish, or metal polish. These are also slightly abrasive, but because they are not intended for game discs, there is a higher risk of damage. Always check the ingredients list for ""solvents,"" ""petroleum,"" or petroleum based products before using, as these can dissolve through the CD and destroy it. If it smells like kerosene or gasoline, don't use it.Some people report that Brasso metal polish is effective, but this does contain a mild solvent. Use at your own risk.

, Deep scratches can be filled in by gently applying a clear wax, then buffing it in with a clean, dry cloth moving in straight lines from the center outward. 100% carnauba wax or another non-petroleum-based, clear product is recommended."

Blow out dust.,
Purchase a laser lens cleaner.,
Clean the lens.",How to Clean a Game Disc3," Use a handheld air bulb to gently blow out dust from the drive. A can of compressed air will also work, but could cause damage to delicate drives.Always hold the can upright during use, or the propellant material may leak out.

, If your game console or computer won't play a brand new, scratch-free disc, you may need to clean or repair its disc drive. A laser lens cleaner will only remove dust, not grease or caked-on dirt, but it's easy to use and worth a try. Typically, this comes in two parts: a disc to be inserted into the drive, and a bottle of liquid to drip onto the disc beforehand.Make sure the cleaner is designed for your type of player, such as a DVD drive or PS3. Even using a CD drive cleaner on a DVD drive could damage it.

, If the steps above don't work, and you don't want to take the drive to a professional repair shop, you'll need to disassemble the drive and clean the lens. If your device is still under warranty, be aware that this will likely void any chance of getting a replacement or free repair from the manufacture. If you're prepared to take the risk, follow these steps:


Shut off the device and unplug it.
Disassemble the drive using a screwdriver. Some game console faceplates can be removed using pressure from your fingers, but do not apply force unless a guide to your specific model recommends this.Continue disassembly until the entire, round drive and surrounding areas are visible.
Look at the lens. This is a small, glass object. Minor scratches shouldn't cause problems, but deep scratches could require professional treatment.More commonly, dust or grime is causing issues, in which case you can clean it:
Dampen a cotton or foam swab in 91%+ isopropyl alcohol. Gently wipe the lens. Allow to air dry before reassembling the drive.

Look after the data.,
Load the cartridges correctly.,
Store the cartridges in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.

,
Clean a cartridge if it gets dirty.,
Protect your cartridge.",How to Care for Game Cartridges," Remember not to think of a cartridge's extra mass compared to discs as armor. They are still sensitive to heat and battering, and the bottom is always opened up, exposing the chip.;
, Make sure to never turn off the console while you are saving. You could lose data. To prevent burning out or shorting the cartridge's internal chip make sure the console is off before removing the cartridge.

, Load the cartridges directly into the system so the chip goes in place. If a cartridge resists insertion, do not force it. Make sure it is around the right way, and if the problem is somewhere persists the cartridge or the console may have been damaged.

,, Use Windex or other similar off brand cleaner on a Q-Tip to clean the connector. Do not spray liquid directly on contacts, and avoid excessive liquid. Simply blowing into the cartridge opening can remove most dust, but be careful not to spit, as this can cause extra damage.

, Many third-party companies sell cartridge cases. These offer and extra level of protection from dust, heat and general damage. You can still purchase cartridges for many consoles, such as the N64 and the Game Boy Advance.

Research choral groups in your community.,
Contact the leader or appointed press member of the group about joining.,
Prepare for your audition, if necessary.,
Complete your audition or voice placement.",How to Use Your Singing Talent1," Doing a quick online search or browsing your local newspaper should give you enough information about whether such groups exist. You can look for the following:


Middle and/or high school choirs
Collegiate choirs
Church choirs
A Capella groups
Barbershop quartets
Community choirs
Service-based choirs;
, If you want to join the group, you will need to find out what you will need to do so. You will likely have to audition, and you might have to pay membership fees or meet certain eligibility requirements.


For example, for middle school, high school, and collegiate choirs, the participants in those need to be students at those schools. Another example would be that in order to join a church choir, you have to be a member of that church's congregation.

, Some choirs only ask candidates to do a voice placement in order to join so that the teacher or conductor knows in which voice part you belong. Others will have you do an audition, for which you will need to prepare.


You may be asked to prepare your own song, in which you should practice a song you like or come up with your own original song. Or, you might be provided with the song, and you will then have to learn it for your voice part.
Voice parts include, generally speaking, soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, and bass. Women usually sing soprano, mezzo-soprano, and alto, while men usually sing tenor, baritone, and bass. However, there is flexibility if a singer has a large range.

, Arrive to your audition early, and make sure you are prepared.


Be sure to warm up beforehand so that your vocal chords are ready.

Understand what busking is.,
Find somewhere that you can legally busk.,
Choose an appropriate time of day to busk.,
Gather what you need for your street performance.,
Set up for your busk.,
Perform your busk.",How to Use Your Singing Talent3," Busking is the act of performing on the street or in a public place, usually by singing, dancing, or reciting something., Be sure to research your city's laws on busking. Generally, busking should be permitted in any public place where other forms of free of speech are permitted, but your city might require special permits or permissions.Obtain any necessary permits with enough time in advance so that you do not run into legal trouble on the day you choose to busk.
Also look into Performing Rights, which might be required in some countries.Performing Rights indicate that you have permission to perform music publicly.
It is also considered appropriate etiquette to choose a location away from other buskers., Typically, busking is not recommended in the morning, as people are less willing to notice or donate money, if that is something you are seeking. However, you can do well later in the day, especially if you choose evening commute times or choose somewhere highly populated.


Daytime, or at least during daylight hours, is most recommended for safety reasons., If you play an instrument and sing, then make sure you have everything you need for your instrument to work and be heard.


For example, you will likely need to bring an amplifier for an electric instrument, which means you will also need to find a location to busk that has access to power outlets.
Other supplies might include a microphone, a bucket for gathering donations, extra clothes for weather precautions, and any permits that you need to show to law enforcement proving you have permission to busk.
Be sure that you allowed to use amplification in your chosen location., Once you have reached your location, set yourself up. You may not have much to set up, but be sure to keep your possessions near you.


If you are collecting donations, be sure to periodically collect money from your collection bin and hide it somewhere safe., Once you are all set up in your chosen spot, there is nothing left to do but to start performing. Here are a few last tips for successful busking:Thank every donor, if you are collecting money.
Be considerate with the volume, if you are using amplification.
Have an adult with you, if you are a minor.

Area schools often have talent shows, if you are a student. Talent shows are also sometimes held as part of community events, such as fairs.
You can also look for televised talent shows, such as American Idol, America's Got Talent, X-Factor, The Voice, and Britain's Got Talent, to name a few. Oftentimes, these televised talent shows hold auditions in a variety of cities in the country in which they are filmed.

, You may be asked to submit an application, audition your talent, and/or meet certain requirements in order to enter. Be sure you know what you have to do to enter.Mark any dates for auditions on your calendar so that you do not miss them.

, Be sure to take time to choose the song you want to perform, learn the appropriate voice part for it, and practice it daily.


If you will need accompaniment for your audition and/or your performance at the competition, then be sure to regularly practice with that accompaniment, whether it be piano, guitar, or another instrument.
For televised talent shows, it is recommended to audition with a cover song, rather than an original song., Once you audition, and assuming that you are accepted, take time daily to practice. You may be performing the same song for the competition, or you may be selecting a different one. Either way, you need to practice.


Again, be sure to practice with accompaniment if you are using it.

, When the time comes, perform your song with confidence for your audience. Give it your best!

Understand behavioral differences.,
Recognize intensity.,
Understand sensitivity.,
Note curiosity.,
Identify the problematic nature of gifted children in the classroom.,
Note high test scores in one or more school subject.",How to Tell if a Child Is Gifted1," To personally identify if your child is gifted, you may want to begin by observing your child’s behavior. Experts believe that gifted children have certain exaggerated behaviors that may indicate heightened intelligence or talent.For example, a common exaggerated behavior is a gifted child being terrified of germs and visualizing them on his/her body.Another example of behavioral differences in a gifted child is if s/he prefers to spend more time talking to adults than to peers.;
, The most obvious sign of intensity of a gifted child manifests through her emotions. This is generally the first thing parents notice in their gifted child. This intensity can be observed in a number of situations including:Intensity in emotion -- Child may exhibit both positive or negative emotions. This may be showing extreme emotion or moving from one feeling to another in a short time span.
Intensity in the body -- Extreme expression of emotion in the body or showing symptoms such as tense stomach, sinking heart, blushing, headache, nausea, or shyness.
Intensity in memory -- Intense children can remember feelings associated to an incident. They will often re-live or re-feel them when remembering the event. For example, your child might appear to feel pain when recalling a past injury.
Intensity in self-evaluation and self-judgement. She might self-evaluate her early art as bad or not good enough.

, Gifted children often show sensitivity to situations. Some examples from Dabrowski’s 1979 and 1994 studies show that gifted children often exhibit:


Open honesty and concern for others. Children will exhibit these traits even though they know they will be reprimanded.
Sensitive to the feelings of others. Gifted children may befriend outcasts and not tolerate cruelty to other children.
Easily upset with criticism. Children may get upset when people ignore their suggestions. They may also show compassion and awareness of other’s needs.
Awareness and consciousness with well developed sense of morals.
A strong sense of right and wrong.

, A gifted child will show curiosity sooner than other children. She will readily ask questions and explore her surroundings. She notably enjoys learning, is keenly observant, and is highly self-critical.This curiosity is often paired with intensity. A gifted child, when showing interest, will pursue it with intense passion.
For example, a gifted child might be curious about the world around her by asking ""why"" questions frequently or physically exploring the world around her, even if it may appear to be dangerous for her., It might be difficult to diagnose a gifted child in the classroom because at least one-fourth to one-half of their regular classroom time is wasted waiting for other children to catch up.In these situations, boredom becomes rampant and may create difficult relationships between peers. Therefore, a gifted child may present possible problems in the classroom including:


Impatient with slowness and others.
Dislike of routine and drill.
Strong-willed.
Difficulty accepting the illogical.
Difficulty in being practical.
May use words to escape or avoid situations.
Overly intense focus.

, A common sign of a gifted child is excelling in a particular subject (math, science, art, etc) or more than one topic. If your child is receiving notably high grades, especially with seemingly little effort, your child might be gifted.


You may want to talk to your child's teacher to see if he/she notices any signs of your child being gifted.

, Look around for a calendar of events and ask a librarian if you're not sure. Start young! Some libraries have programs even for babies and toddlers., Bedtime is good, but any regular time will work. Even if they're not reading yet, get them used to the idea that books have stories in them and that story times are times to sit quietly. For older kids who are reading, start reading chapter books and other materials that are a bit beyond their current reading level. For chapter books, you can read one chapter at a time., Never allow books to be left on the floor or tossed around. Impress upon children that books are to be treated in special ways and have a special storage space just for them. A bookshelf is best, but books can also spend time on a nightstand or table if it seems more natural, especially while they are being read., In most cases, you will still be responsible for the care and return of the materials, but having their own cards makes it much more personal than if you check things out for them.

When they are old enough, encourage them to keep track of their own books and due dates, but supervise and remind them, especially at first.

, Many libraries have story times, performances, and other activities for kids. They're a great opportunity to help your kids associate the library with having fun, and many are designed to encourage reading., If the kids have their own cards, let them check books out themselves.

Check out at least a week's worth of books at a time. Remember that a week's worth of books for young children may be quite a few.

, Check out and read books for yourself when you take them., As your children get older, bedtime story time can transition into independent reading., For younger kids, help them find the right section but let them choose what interests them. As they get older, let them choose their own titles and let them judge what is interesting and appropriate., It's a great way to keep children engaged and reading over the summer, meaning that their education can advance during the summer rather than backslide. Reading is also a great antidote to summer boredom and excess television watching, even if your kids choose to read manga or adventure stories."

Seek professional guidance.,
Know how your child will be evaluated.,
Work with teachers or counselors.",How to Tell if a Child Is Gifted2," Organizations seeking to support emotional health in gifted children have developed evaluation guides that parents can use to determine if their child is gifted.You can often find these guides on the organizations' websites. You can do an internet search for “Gifted children evaluation guide.”
This is merely a guide; always seek professional experience and guidance to make a successful diagnosis.

, If you notice your child exhibiting signs of being gifted, talk to her pediatrician or school counselor.It is always best to consult a professional.


Often, public schools have professional counselors who can assess whether or not your child is gifted.
Almost all gifted children are diagnosed at the state and local level. Therefore, your school district will have unique assessments to identify if your child is gifted.
Unfortunately, these tests, as well as accommodations, vary widely due to budget allocations.If your child is gifted in a particular subject, talk to your child's teacher. S/he may resources to help your child or know who to contact for further assistance.

, As each state varies on how they identify a gifted student, there is no standard test or evaluation. Each state should list its evaluation criteria on the Department of Education website.


For example, Ohio has a “Student Growth Measures FAQs” which discusses its implementation of gifted program assessments.Another example is Florida’s Department of Education website which includes definitions of gifted students, contacts, state regulations, and laws.Check with your state’s Department of Education to find regulations and state standards.

, Your school district may take a number of paths to help your gifted child. They might:


Provide a unique curriculum more appropriate for your child’s level.
Consider grade advancement (for example, skipping from 5th grade to 7th grade).
Pair your student with a tutor or teacher for additional learning
Give you the resources to supplement your gifted child’s education outside the classroom.
Provide accommodations in a regular classroom."

When determining the level of giftedness of your child, consider whether you are looking for giftedness or talent. This may be an important distinction if your educational district uses Gagne’s theories for placement or assessment.


Additionally, Gagnè’s theory has five domains: intellectual, creative, socioaffective, sensorimotor, and ‘others’ (for example, extrasensory perception). If following this theory, your child may be gifted in one or more of these domains.
If your school district uses Gagnè’s theory to diagnose your child as gifted, they might look beyond your child's ability to perform well on tests. Instead, they will be more interested in assessing your child's natural abilities. This might mean observing how your child interacts with the world around her before diagnosing as ""talented"" or ""gifted."", Renzulli’s (1978) theory on gifted behavior is more specific than Gagne’s. This theory states that there is a clear gifted interaction between three clusters of human traits: “above average general and/or specific abilities, high levels of task commitment (motivation), and high levels of creativity.” Not only must children show aptitude in these areas, but they also must be able to apply them in appropriate situations. These behaviors are contextually dependent and may not manifest continually.


Renzulli's theories are more applicable in curriculum development for gifted children; it often opposes high-stakes testing in favor for more individualized approaches in teaching and learning., While Gagnè’s and Renzulli’s theories are certainly very popular when considering the nature of giftedness in children, there are other theories to consider as well. The 19th and 20th century heralded a number of theories in childhood assessments. While these theories may be archaic, they are essential in developing modern day theories and practices. As a parent of a gifted child, it is beneficial to know where such theories originated. Other popular theories and events include:


William Torres Harris’ (1868) early systematic approach to incorporated gifted learning in education.
Galton’s (1869) work, Hereditary Genius, which indicates intelligence is passed on from parent to child.
Binet’s and Simon’s (1905) early assessments, which revolutionize assessments in schools.
Stedman’s (1918) work on gifted opportunities.
Terman’s (1922) longitudinal study on gifted students in New York City.
The National Institute of Gifted Children is founded in 1954.
US Education Department established the Office of Gifted and Talented in 1974.
Dabrowski, a Polish psychologist, discussed emotional development and sensitivity in children in his theory of emotional development (1964, 1967, 1972).
The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented is established at University of Connecticut in 1990.
National Association of Gifted Children published national education standards in 2006, which is then revised in 2013., If your child has been labeled or diagnosed as ""gifted,"" ask your school system what theories they use to develop a curriculum. This will help determine future expectations.


For example, if a school district relies on Ranzulli's theory, you can probably assume that your child will receive individualized attention and perhaps a unique curriculum to fit her level.

, While there are many theories and approaches to assessing gifted children, each state in the US has its unique definition and educational approach. When enrolling or diagnosing your child, consider how your location will affect this definition.


Luckily, the National Association of Gifted Children has a state-by-state breakdown of regulations and terms for easy reference.You want to make sure your child is getting all the help they need. It is important that your child gets properly diagnosed per your state laws so you and your family may take advantage of programs and resources.

, Because these terms and ideas are constantly being challenged and changing, it is important to stay current on research, regulations, and laws.


There are a number of academic publications that frequently provide evolving news and research, including the journal Gifted Child Quarterly.Staying abreast on current information will help you better help your gifted child. A gifted child's needs are different than a normal child, so you may need to supplement his/her education on your own.

Give chores to every family member.,
Start early.,
Choose age-appropriate chores.,
Provide specific instructions.,
Track chores with visual aids.,
Make children accountable for their chores.,
Work with your kids.",How to Teach Your Kids to Have a Work Ethic1," Assigning chores is one of the best ways to teach work ethic and responsible behavior. Chores should be age-appropriate and based on their interests and talents. If your child likes being outdoors, assign them to work in the garden or rake leaves. If your child is interested in cooking, let them help you prepare dinner and wash the dishes.;
, The earlier you start the better. It will be more difficult to get children on board if they are older. Most children can begin having chores around the age of two or three. Young children respond best to positive encouragement and are focused on doing the task well. Older children are able to grasp the concept of working hard and the satisfaction that comes from hard work., Age-appropriate chores will keep your children engaged and keep them from getting frustrated by tasks that are too challenging. Chores for children ages two to three include putting toys away, putting their clothes in a hamper, and wiping up spills. Children ages four to five can make their bed, empty small trashcans, bring in the mail, and help clear the table. Children ages six to seven can sort laundry, sweep floors, and help make their own lunch. Children eight to nine can load the dishwasher, put away groceries, help make dinner, vacuum, and make their own snacks.Children ten and up can load and unload the dishwasher, wash the car, change their bed sheets, fold laundry, and cook with your supervision.
Teenagers can have a summer job to contribute to their personal expenses.

, Your expectations should be clear so your child knows exactly what to do. Instead of telling your child to ""clean their room,"" let them know all of the tasks that are involved. Should they make their bed? Put away their toys? Hang their clothes in the closet?Your instructions should also include expected deadlines as well. Should the bed be made before school? What days of the week are they expected to wash dishes?

, Time management is another aspect of having good work ethic. Your child likely has homework, extracurricular activities, and leisure time. They must learn how to balance all of their priorities. Sit with them and create a calendar and/or daily schedule to keep them on track. If your child needs to make their bed every morning before school, teach them to set aside five or ten minutes every morning to complete the task.Use a large calendar, chore wheels, dry-erase board, or magnets to keep track of to-do lists and schedules.
Make the creation of the visual aid a family activity.
Have your kids mark off chores as they complete them. Younger children might enjoy putting stickers next to a chore once it has been completed.

, Your children should feel accomplished when they complete their chores and face consequences for not completing their chores. The consequences of not completing the chores should be specific to that chore.If your child repeatedly forgets to take the trash out on Thursday nights, wake your child up extra early one Friday morning to take the trash out before school. This consequence is better choice than taking away TV time for not taking the trash out.

, This is especially helpful if your kids are younger and can't do chores on their own yet. Working alongside your children teaches them the value of hard work and prepares them to work independently.For example, when laundry need to be done, sort the clothes with your children, then together fill the washing machine, together put them in the dryer. Then when its time to fold, fold the clothes side by side showing how to fold and doing it together.

Use school as a training ground.,
Let children see your work ethic.,
Teach positive affirmations.,
Provide an allowance.,
Praise children for effort.,
Encourage improvement.,
Share stories about how hard work and persistence pays off.,
Teach children to solve problems themselves by teaching them trouble-shooting techniques, and encouraging them to take the lead.,
Teach kids to complete a project.,
Help your child start a business.",How to Teach Your Kids to Have a Work Ethic2," Teach your child that there are consequences for completing or not completing their homework and putting forth effort. If your child does not put in adequate effort, let them suffer the consequences. For example, if your child turns in their homework late and gets a bad grade, have your child ask their teacher about completing extra credit to bring their grade up.If your child does poorly on a test because he or she did not study well enough, talk to your child about studying more. Help your child problem solve ways to do better. Should they spend extra time on that subject? Do they need to go to tutoring after school?

, Your children may not hear everything you tell them, but they are always watching you. If you have the opportunity, take your child to work with you. Show your child the work you do around the house such as folding laundry, washing the dishes, or paying the bills.Explain to them what you do at work and why you do chores.


Display a positive attitude about the work that you do. If you complain about your boss or having to wake to go to work, your child may mirror your bad attitude.

, Your child should learn to work through difficult challenges. Teach your child to engage in positive self-talk. Phrases such as ""I can do it,"" ""I won't quit,"" and ""I'll try again,"" can be used as encouragement when things get rough. Have your child say one of these each day., An allowance can be used as a reward for chores or to teach financial responsibility. You can give your children money and/or privileges for completing their chores. Privileges such having friends over or choosing a movie to watch can also be rewards.Explain the connection between completing chores and not having money to spend. If your child does not complete their chores, they will not have money to buy something candy from the store.
If you want your child to see chores as their contribution to the family, an allowance may not be a good option.
Providing an allowance is a personal choice. It is not necessary to teach your children work ethic.

, Place more importance on effort than on intelligence.Your child will not be successful at everything they try, but they can put forth effort every single time. For example, if your child brings home an ""A"" on her report card, tell her ""I'm so proud of how much you studied"", or ""I'm pleased you put so much effort into that class"".

, Constantly challenging your child will result in growth. especially in areas where your child is skilled. For example, if your child excels in reading, say ""You're doing such a great job on your reading, so I think you're up to an even better challenge"", and present harder tasks. If your child has mastered a chore such as making the bed, allow your child to change the sheets on the bed as well.

, These can be fictional stories, stories from your life, or accounts of famous people.Identify your child's interests (e.g. music, art, sports, etc.) and then find examples of people who worked hard to achieve their goals. Find books or movies that detail the work that these people put into their craft so your child understands that success does not happen overnight.

, For example, if your child is dealing with a mean classmate, ask questions to prompt your child to think out an appropriate response. Praise your child for coming up with good solutions, and for handling problems independently.

, Staying organized and on task can help your kids get their work done more efficiently. Each task should be divided into three steps: getting organized, staying focused, and getting it done. Before your child begins a task, go through each of these steps with them. Continue to do this each time until your child is able to do this independently.If the task is completing a homework assignment, getting organized would include getting pens, paper, handouts, and any textbooks that are necessary to complete the work.
Staying focused can be difficult. If your child wants to go watch TV or play outside before homework is done, tell your child to ask ""Is that what I should be doing right now?"" If your child becomes restless, let them know that it is OK to stand up or stretch and then get back to the task.
Getting it done includes any final touches that are needed to make sure homework is complete. Final touches include proofreading by your kid and/or you, writing the name and date on the homework, putting the homework in a folder and in his or her backpack.

, Your kid may want to start a business. Babysitting, volunteering, mowing lawns, baking, dog walking, and running a lemonade stand are all reasonable businesses for children to run. If your child is interested in doing something like this, help them make a business plan, get supplies and equipment, and market the business. Have a planning meeting where you will discuss responsibilities and what is needed to make the business a reality.Let your child know that he or she is responsible for the business and how much time you will commit to helping them.
You should not do all of the work for your child. For example, if your child is scheduled to babysit the same night of a friend's birthday party, let your child know that their business comes first. Do not offer to babysit so your child can go to the party.
The summertime is an ideal time to try out a business idea. Your child will be out of school and have more free time to devote to their business.

Do not compare children.,
Do not be overly critical.,
Explain the reasons for doing chores.",How to Teach Your Kids to Have a Work Ethic3," Never fell a child that he or she does not work as hard as another child. This can cause problems between siblings. This can also be discouraging to the child who was criticized. Focus on each child individually and look for improvements in his or her effort., It will take time for your child to get the hang of doing chores the right way and on time. If you see that your child is trying their best, encourage them to get better instead of punishing them. For example, if your child leaves food on some of the dishes they washed, tell them that you appreciate their effort and show them how to wash dishes again. Being overly critical can cause your child to resent chores and have a bad attitude towards them.Kids learn at their own rate and it will take time for them to master new chores.

, Your child may not be able to make the connection between work ethic and their chores on their own. Once you assign a chore, explain the reason why the chore needs to be done and how that chore contributes to the family.For example, if your child is responsible for taking the trash out, explain that the trash goes out to keep the home clean and to keep the house from smelling bad.


Also explain the consequences of not doing assigned chores.

Teach your child to wait their turn to speak and not to interrupt when you are speaking.,
Set the table for a family dinner, using good dishes and silverware.,
Tell them the most important table manners a lot of times: Napkin on the lap (under 10 they should tuck it in, under 14 they MAY tuck it in), elbows off the table, don`t eat with your mouth opened,...

,
Teach a child to say thank you by having them hear you say it.,
Always say please each time you ask your child to do something.,
Teach them not to touch things that are on tables, either in your home or when visiting.,
Teach your child to take compliments courteously by saying thank you at appropriate times.,
Teach a little older child to hold a door open for others, especially when entering a store.,
Make Sunday a family day special by wearing special clothes.,
Teach your child to be polite and that it is not proper to point or to stare at others who might be of a different religion or color.,
Stay calm.,
Be aware.,
Show love.",How to Teach Your Child Good Manners," Make sure that when you are done, that you give the child your full attention. Children learn by seeing so show them to respect others by respecting them.;
, Place the forks on one side of the plate, and the spoons and knives on the other. Add a napkin and a glass, and place them in their proper position. Use the proper utensils as needed, as well as the napkin. They will follow your lead and will make you proud when you take them out to eat at a fancy restaurant.

,, No matter how young they are, never forget to say thank you to them each time they hand you something, even if it is their bottle.

, Children learn by what they see and hear by their parents. A hug and kiss by you, will make sure that they always remember to say that word. .

, Explain that they can look, but not touch!

, Children copy what they see and hear so make it a point to always use those words often.

, Show by how you hold the door open for others, allowing them to walk in first-instead of having the door slam in someone's face- and they will learn to do the same.

, Boys should wear a tucked shirt, maybe a tie and a blazer, dress pants and leather shoes. If you go to Church together, then make sure you say good morning to each person you see, and watch and notice your children do the same. If an older person is standing, while you are sitting, stand up and offer them a seat. Your children will notice, and learn, and follow your example.

, Point out how it can be interesting to see how different families do different things such as rituals or traditions.

, Each time you start yelling or losing your temper, you may lose a little of your child's respect.

, There is a great difference between childish provocation and childish behavior such as forgetting to feed the dog and so forth. Some errors are child appropriate and come with the perils of growing up, while others are simply a test of what the parent may or may not allow.

, Explain why the behavior is punishable and how the child may avoid this in the future. Hug and comfort them after the incident has passed as this will foster love and trust.

Teach at your child’s pace.,
Take it one color at a time.,
Use identical things to make color comparisons.,
Make your lessons interactive.,
Avoid using color names before nouns.",How to Teach Your Child Colors1," You can start introducing lessons about color when your children are around 18 months, but most toddlers won’t start fully grasping the concept of colors until they’re around three years or older. It’s fine and even encouraged to start teaching them about colors before then, but be sure to take it slowly and don’t despair if they aren’t getting it.One of the reasons that colors are so difficult to understand is because they exist all around us all the time and in such great variety. It’s much easier for children to distinguish between two distinct shapes than it is for them to compare two different colors.The more examples your child has, the more likely they are to understand a color. So, even if they don’t get specific colors early in their development, repeated exposure to a color like red through verbal identification and active lessons (like sock matching and finger painting) will help them refine the concept as they grow.;
, While you may want your child to master the whole rainbow all at once, they’ll be much more likely to retain lessons about colors if you introduce them one at a time. Give your child a chance to really master blue before you move on to red.All children learn differently, but it’s generally a good idea to introduce no more than one new color per week. You can have fun with this by assigning colors for each week--Blue Week, Red Week, Yellow Week, and so on. Gear your activities towards the week’s color. Serve blue foods; have them wear blue clothing; give them blue paint to play with, etc.
Even if you’re focusing on one color, it’s helpful to start by having another color for comparison. Your child will be more likely to understand what “green” is if they have an example of what green is not. You might, for instance, present them with two balls and say, “This one is green; that one is not green.”

, The focus of lessons should be the colors themselves, which means that you want to minimize any other differences between the objects that you are asking your child to compare.For instance, you should use a green block and yellow block of the same size to help your child distinguish between the two colors. Don’t use a green block and a yellow ball because the child might get distracted or confused by the difference in shapes.

, The more of your child’s senses that you can activate in the learning process, the better. Pick activities that allow toddlers to touch, feel, smell, and hear things in addition to just seeing the colors.For instance, if you use orange and red fruit snacks for a lesson, your child can interact with the objects on many different sensory levels. Being able to touch, smell, and taste the learning tools will make their learning more active, which helps the lessons sink in.
If you’re trying to get your child to remember the names of various colors, try introducing a video that teaches them a song. That way, their verbal memory will be activated by exciting sounds and visuals. If you want to combine dancing with catchy rhyming lyrics, try The Teaching Station’s “Color Song.”If you want to go color by color, try The Busy Beaver’s popular collection of “Color Songs” that run from red to “grandma’s purple car.”, Studies show that how you verbally introduce colors to children makes a difference. To avoid confusing your child, you want to isolate the color as one property of a thing (“this ball is red”), without making it seem like it’s part of the name of thing (“this is a red ball”). Placing “red” at the end of the sentence also helps focus their attention on the color, not the thing.


For instance, your youngster is more likely to understand blue as blue if you say, “This block is blue,” than if you say, “This is a blue block.” Keep this mind while you give any lessons about color, and your kids will retain what they’ve learned much better."
"
Make your child’s bath a different color every week.,
Serve them brightly colored food.,
Color their food.,
Let them match their own socks.,
Play dress up.,
Play “I spy.” Help your child locate colors in the world around them.",How to Teach Your Child Colors2," Try adding a few drops of food coloring or colored bath salts to your toddler’s nightly bath. Talk to them about each color, and name other items that are the same color. Alternate every week, or every few days, to give them time to really learn the colors.


You can even introduce bath toys to match the weekly bath color. Let them play with a rubber ducky during Yellow Week or a blue boat during Blue Week.

, Tell your child the color of each food item as you serve it to them. Help them associate the color with a particular dish by reinforcing the connection with each bite. Say, “Now we’re going to have a bite of corn that is yellow...Here’s broccoli, which is green.”If you’re focusing on a particular color, serve them food of that color. If it’s red week, give them strawberries and beets. If it’s blue week, have blueberries for dessert.
For more advanced learners, you can use a cereal like Fruit Loops to your advantage by having your child name the colors. Pick out a single loop in their spoon, and ask your toddler: “Can you tell me what color this is?”

, It's also fun to add food coloring to their hard-boiled eggs and other food you make for them, so you can say, “this egg is red.” This is especially helpful when there are few foods that are naturally the color that you’re focusing on (like blue).

, This helps your child learn about colors going together in a tactile way.Remember to start easy, with socks that are solid colors. You want the learning to be challenging but not frustrating for your toddler.
For another version of this lesson, try making the family’s socks into a game. You can put out two baskets, one with a pair of white socks and one with a pair of colored socks. As you roll each new pair, have your youngster toss it into the basket where they think it belongs.

, Lay out a variety of clothes and accessories. Ask your child to pick out and put on specific colored items.For instance, you can tell them, “Put on a green shirt,” “Put on a red skirt,” or “Put on a yellow necklace.”
If you’re focusing on a particular color, ask your child to dress themselves in that particular hue. A simple morning lesson could be: “It’s Blue Week; Ashley, can you pick out some pants that are blue?” Be sure to help them with each selection until they’re confident enough to do it themselves.

, If you’re in your back yard, go around and see what red things you can see-- “I spy a red wagon; I spy a red flower; I spy a red bucket.”"
"
Play with colored blocks or shapes.,
Color with crayons.,
Finger paint.,
Sculpt with playdough.,
Use an app.",How to Teach Your Child Colors3," This is the simplest way for your child to make clear comparisons between colors. Because blocks are identical in shape, it allows your toddler to focus primarily on the differences in their colors.


You can start simply, by only using two blocks. “This block is red. This block is not red. Which one is red?” Once your child is able to consistently identify the red block, ask them to pick out the other red blocks from among the set.

, Get a simple box of crayons and a coloring book. Focus on coloring with one color at a time, repeating its name as your child uses the crayon to build up their association between the color and its name.


You can ask them, “which color do you want?” When they select one, be sure to say which they picked if they don’t already know: “That’s red. What would you like to make red? The dog? Now that dog is red.”

, Have your toddler make their own hands-on masterpieces with nontoxic paints. Give them a few colors to work with so that they can begin to intuit the differences between colors by mixing and matching them on paper. When they choose to work with various colors, they’re subconsciously noticing that there’s a difference between them.


Be sure to limit the mess by using large sheets of paper and putting newspaper or butcher paper underneath.
You can brew up your own kid-safe paint at home by boiling a half a cup of cornstarch in two cups water. When it reaches the desired consistency, divide it into dishes and add food coloring to make it the color(s) you’d like., This is another hands-on way to get your youngster interacting with colors. If you’re focusing on them learning a specific color, have them play with that color of playdough. When they’re ready for more challenging lessons, you can give them a few different colors and ask them to make specific things: “Can you make me a pancake that is blue?” or “Can you make a ball that is red with a bat that is blue?”

, Educational apps can be a wonderful, interactive way to teach your child lessons about colors. Simply download them to a tablet, teach your child the rules, and enjoy playing the games together.Try iPad’s Speak Colors app to help children learn how to say color names aloud and use them in full sentences.
Color Me Pete for the iPad is an excellent tool for helping kids visually recognize colors in their immediate environment. It uses the tablet’s camera by challenging children to locate a particular color in the space around them. When your child thinks they’ve found a match, they can snap a pic, and the app with tell them if they’ve correctly identified the color or not.

Do your homework.,
Introduce technology as an interactive experience.,
Seek out products, apps, and games that promote active learning.,

Utilize technology in combination with hands-on learning.,
Promote child-to-child interaction while using technology.,
Consider options for learners with special circumstances.,
Don’t overdo it.,
Set a good example.,
Use technology as one tool of many.",How to Use Technology to Help Preschoolers Learn," Yes, it is entirely possible that your preschooler will figure out the basics of a new tablet faster than you — swiping a touchscreen seems to be a natural, intuitive process for children unhampered by years of experience with ever-changing forms of technology.That, however, does not excuse you from doing your due diligence to research and understand a product, game, or app before placing it in a preschooler’s hands.


Research and examine devices to ensure that they are appropriate and easy-to-use for young children. Work through apps and games to consider their educational content — just because they claim to be educational doesn’t mean they aren’t just essentially covert advertising, for instance. Consider whether they provide an interactive experience and how they provide feedback to the learner.;
, Every parent of small children knows it — tablets, TVs, smartphones, and other tech can make appealing “babysitters” when you need to get something done (or just need a little break). To draw out the educational benefits of technology, however, it is best to create an interactive experience that involves you, the child, and the tech.Examine the new device, game, etc. with the child. Collaborate to figure out how it works, asking questions and giving advice. After the brief introduction, let the child be the main “explorer,” but remain engaged and interested in the tech and what the child has learned about or from it.
Remember, technology can be a tool of isolation, or something that brings people together. Learning is more likely to occur in the second scenario.

, Years of cognitive research have demonstrated that learning occurs most effectively in an active setting. This exists when you have: active engagement; group participation; frequent interaction and feedback; and connections to real world contexts. Even an individually-based product, game, or app can fulfill many of the requirements for active learning.


Some educational programs are little more than glorified repositories of quizzes, Q & A, or other more passive forms of instruction. Seek out options that will engage a child on a personal level, stimulate critical thinking skills (not just rote learning), and foster creativity (and thus a sense of ownership of the learning experience). Try things out for yourself. Think about the types of challenges, options, and feedback that are provided.Some 60%-80% of children are primarily visual learners, so finding games or apps that encourage problem-solving skills can be a particularly valuable resource for them., Whether you are working with one or two small children at home or a dozen in a preschool class, it pays to think ahead regarding what types of technology (and how much of it) will best mesh with your overall goals and program. Thankfully, several resources exist from organizations focused on improving the use of technology in early childhood education.


To name one well-known example, the Fred Rogers Center focuses a good portion of its energy (and online resources) on “digital media and learning.” For instance, it has collaborated on a twelve-point checklist for educators and others to use when evaluating, selecting, and using technology for younger kids (http://fredrogers143.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Checklist-for-Identifying-Exemplary-Uses.pdf)., Much of preschool learning boils down to introducing concepts, objects, and phenomena (e.g., sharing, scissors, and springtime). Most young children respond well to a visual and tactile learning experience, which makes active tech resources a good complement to a range of other hands-on introductory learning activities.For instance, if your preschool class is learning about sunflowers, the wealth of information and images (and drawing apps) available on a tablet shared among several students can work alongside traditional cut-outs, coloring pages, preserved flower petals, seed counting, etc., Despite fears stretching back to the early days of desktop computers that technology decreases child socialization, studies have long indicated that technology is at least as capable of increasing personal interaction. Students of any age, including preschoolers, can and will interact by asking for help, giving instructions, confirming choices, or even disagreeing about strategies or selections.Introduce a new tablet or computer game to the whole class at “circle time,” for instance, and let the students collectively examine and ask about it. Create opportunities for scheduled use, sharing, or collective projects utilizing tech resources so that kids find interacting both with the technology and each other to be natural. Seek out learning platforms that support multiple players/learners or collaborative efforts. Monitor usage to ensure that all students get adequate opportunities to use the technology., Preschoolers with physical disabilities, challenges with communication or personal interaction, or a host of other unique needs or circumstances may derive particular benefit from the use of learning technology. Look into apps, games, and devices specially suited to the strengths and needs of your individual preschooler(s).A child with a limited physical ability to play with blocks or finger paint may be able to practice similar creative skills on a tablet, for instance.
Tablets can also be helpful with dual-language learners, by utilizing pictorial representations and translation apps designed for small children.

, Technology can definitely be a good thing when it comes to preschool education; it can also be a case of too much of a good thing. Ideally, screen-based technology in particular should be but one of several methods of instruction for small children, with active interpersonal engagement and (physical) hands-on learning retaining the primary position.No demonstrated benefit has been shown for exposing children under age two to screen-based technology, and the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) still recommends zero daily “screen time” for kids in this earliest age group.
For kids age 2-4, two 30-minute sessions of “screen time” per day, and perhaps up to two hours per day for slightly older children, is likely more than adequate., As with so many other things, children learn how to use (and not use) technology based in large part upon your example. If you are glued to your smartphone all day, including during meals, trips to the playground, etc., this is the behavior model your kids will want to emulate. Technology should be a broadly useful tool, not a crutch or even an addiction for you or your preschooler.Take time to “unplug” yourself and interact with your child. No technology can match the value of this type of learning (for either of you).

, Every child learns differently, and finding the right “mix” for each kid can take time and trial-and-error. Offering the widest array of learning methods and experiences possible is the best way to determine what works best for an individual child, as well as to ensure a well-rounded learning process.In the final analysis, you shouldn’t fear or avoid technology as a learning tool for preschoolers; you also shouldn’t see it as the single learning solution. Use technology with care, creativity, and supervision, and it can be one powerful means among many for helping young children learn.

, It is important that you have at least one other person to help out - even though parents are in - especially before things kick off nicely. They should be able to deputize in your absence.

, Include the first few meeting times and places, along with your contact name, phone number and email address. Have rip-tabs with information placed at the bottom of the flyer for parents to take with them.

, Keep it simple, as parents won't want to share too much information until they know you more personally. Create a list of ""Dos and Do Nots"", along with consequences. These might include hitting and biting, snack and allergy guidelines, pet policies, and so forth.

, Distribute your flyers to local pediatrician offices, grocery stores, dentists, and more. Most small businesses that are child-related will be willing to have your flyer up. Answer any inquiries promptly. This lets the parents know that you are sincere and keeps their interest level up.

, Create an online group (via Google groups, Yahoo groups, or bigtent.com) to help communicate play date locations/time/assignments. Or take advantage of online group sites that allow playgroups to coordinate the activities and events and sends out automatic reminders.

Teach your kids about the tools needed to do everyday tasks.,
Show your kids that you are ""into"" their games.",How to Spend Free Quality Time With Your Kids," Seems simple, but, do you really know how to do it? Get down on the floor and play trucks, build forts, make cardboard buildings for cars. Go through the clothes in the house and make a dress up box; include old jewelry, hats, purses, and shoes. Plan a tea party, and follow it wherever it goes.;
, Start a small chapter book and read one chapter a day. Make reading time special with snacks.

, Simple paper plates make great masks to wear, then you can play using your masks.

, Every kid loves to help in the kitchen. Make or buy their own cookbook and apron, then let them pick a recipe and help them make it, and do this as a weekly thing. You will be surprised how much you learn from your child while spending the time together.

, Get a big box, cut it open, lay it flat and hand them the supplies to go crazy -- let them paint, draw, cut, and then join in.

, All kids love picnics, the key is making them spontaneous. Pick them up from school, take a snack and head to the park, have a picnic inside, use a theme like all red food, or let them pick all the foods. It doesn't matter if you eat Twinkies and cereal for one meal. It won't kill them or you.

, When's the last time you indulged in something a little wild, like hide and seek in the house?

, Kids don't need extravagant play houses -- a sheet over the clothes line or some chairs will do just fine. Play in there with them.

, Get out the cookie cutters and anything else that you normally don't let them use for playdough...use plastic utensils for cutting.

, The kids will have a great time laughing when their Mum/Dad isn't able to find that thing that is obviously in front of them (""No I can't see it anywhere.""). Another great example is getting your foot stuck to the floor after gluing something. When the kids try to help, their hand also gets stuck to the parents hand.

, Imagine you are a family of penguins or dolphins or something. Assume roles. Assume a challenge & play out the roles.

, Invite friends of your kids at home. Its easier to manage multiple kids, if you know the trick. Build a story collaboratively. A child starts the story. Next one continues it by adding another line. Then the next one takes it further & so on..

, Instead of saying ""not right now"", stop and go play for an hour. Is that bill really going to be any different if you leave it on the table and come back an hour later? Probably not, but, your child may look back and remember the day you stopped what you were doing and played for an hour.

, Some parents call these walks pajama walks. But the thing that separates these walks from other walks, is that there is no talking going on while walking as well as no other activities besides the walking. Make sure they are dressed in their night and footwear and take them walking.

,, The kids can help hold the tools while you explain to them what you're about to fix with that tool coming up. Later, the reverse can be said as the two of you bond and the child does the work(when the kid turns into their later teen years).

, Whether it's video games, computer games, board games, show them that you can ""walk the walk"" and even ""talk the talk"" and see if you can surprise them. They'll enjoy it that you've taken the ability to learn something that they didn't feel you should have learned in the first place.

Reward your child.",How to Teach Toddlers Their Colors," Children learn best when they are engaged and enjoying themselves.Using different games and fun activities can spark your child’s interest in colors and help him or her retain the information more effectively. A good way to think of this is “busy hands, busy brains.”


Try different types of games with your child and see which one he or she likes best. For example, you could ask you child to select a crayon, marker, or piece of construction that he or she likes. Then take your toddler out for a walk and say, “let’s spot colors that are the same as your paper. I bet you can beat me!”Tie a different colored ribbon to the tops of three long-handled spoons. Put them in a small pail and tell your child to dash to a specific colored spoon. Make sure to offer positive reinforcement such as, “great job, Sara, you found the pink ribbon!”;
, Toddlers often love to pick out their own clothing and will put together all sorts of fun combinations. Use getting dressed as another opportunity to teach your little one different colors.Allow your toddler to pick out an item of clothing and say, “that’s very nice, what color is it?” If your child knows the color, then ask him or her to get another piece of clothing in the same color. Remember to keep your color descriptions as simple as possible—no mint and green, just green.
Let your toddler pick out all of the articles of clothing he or she wants to wear that day. As the child puts on each piece, ask him or her what color it is. If the child isn’t sure, say, “this is orange, Callie, just like your favorite shirt and the oranges you love to eat.”

, Nutrition is key to helping your child grow. Because healthy foods are often bright and beautiful colors, you can use meals as a way to teach your toddler his or her colors.Ask your child what color a food is as you pass it to him or her. For example, say, “what color is the piece of broccoli?” If your child says, “green,” give him or her a bit of positive reinforcement with a, “great job, Luca!” You can extend the lesson by asking, “what other foods are green, Luca?”
Let your toddler pick out his or her own foods from healthy pre-selected choices. Tell your child to let you know what color each food is as he or she picks it. Make sure to reinforce the lesson as much as possible with statements like, “that’s right, Emma, strawberries are red.”

, Songs about colors set to the tune of popular children’s music can also help your toddler learn his or her colors. Teaching these songs to your child and singing them in places such as the car or the bathtub can distract your child while helping him or her to learn his colors.


Try using “I Love Red” by Jean Warren. Sing the following to the tune of “Three Blind Mice”: I love red, I love red.That’s what I said, that’s what I said. Firetrucks, wagons and strawberries piled high. Stop signs, hearts and pizza pies. Roses, tomatoes and apples, oh my. I love red. That’s what I said., Set aside some time every day or every couple of days to make pictures with your toddler. Most small children are thrilled to have a crayon or some finger paint with which to “draw” on a piece of paper. As you paint, ask your toddler what colors he or she is choosing and why. Then ask your toddler if he or she can tell you what colors you are using.Think of was to make painting or coloring a game. For example, ask your toddler, “What colors should I use today?” and let him or her run and pick out your colors for the day.

, Introducing variables is another good way to teach your toddler colors, as well as the differences between them. Have your child compare identical objects, such as balls, of different colors. Seeing the distinction between colors can help your child more clearly identify them and their names.Use items you have around your house to highlight the differences. You can use things like balls, shoes, or even fish. Remember to keep the number of choices relatively low until your toddler has a good grasp on multiple colors.

, Toddlers and their brains are still growing. Presenting a two or three year old child an entire box of crayons and expecting him or her to learn all of the color would overwhelm the child. Instead, have the child pick out one or two of his or her favorite colors and reinforce your lessons of those during the week. Move to a new color or two the next week and repeat this pattern until your toddler knows a wide array of colors.Consider starting your child with the basic colors of the rainbow. These are the ones he or she will need to know for school. Keep in mind it may also be difficult for a toddler to differentiate between similar shades of one color. It’s easier for a toddler to know “red” instead of “carnelian” or “vermillion.”

, It may be more difficult for children to learn colors in English because the name is often used before a noun—for example, “the blue whale.” But by saying, “The whale is blue” instead, you can help your child successfully narrow his or her focus to the object before telling the color. In turn, this can help your toddler more quickly learn his or her colors., Repetition is important for the development of a child’s brain. Stick with games and lessons your child enjoys to help him or her learn the colors more effectively and even quickly. Build on these lessons as you introduce new colors to their palette knowledge.Let your child use the same digital media to learn the colors. For example, make it a ritual to watch a show at the same time every day or week. Ask the same questions every week: “hey Max, you love Daniel Tiger! Can you tell me again what color he is?”

, Take any opportunity you can to help your child learn his or her colors. Playing games in the car or on walks like “I Spy” can reinforce your lessons and minimize boredom.Use car trips to your advantage and help your child avoid the dreaded “are we there yet?” question. As you approach traffic lights, ask your child what color is showing. You can also ask your toddler if he or she sees a certain color car.
Have your child search for different colored foods in the grocery store., If you’re with family or friends at gathering, give your child the chance to show off his or her new knowledge. Having the praise from others can help your toddler retain the information and motivate him or her to continuing learning the colors.Ask your toddler in front of others, “what color is Mrs. Neumaier’s dog, Charlotte? Isn’t she pretty?” Then let everyone fawn all over your toddler and how smart he or she is.
Make sure to let your significant other know when your toddler learns his or her colors. Say to your child, “Caroline, let your mom know what color you’re wearing today.”

, As your child begins retaining more colors or even showing off his or her knowledge, make sure to reward him or her occasionally. It doesn’t need to be anything big, even a small box of crayons and coloring book or a toy will work. Tell your child, “Owen, you’ve been so awesome at learning your colors. Why don’t you pick out a toy train that you like. What color train do you want.”

Play dominoes as a learning game.

,
Half things all of the time.,
Flip 1 coin and talk about ""heads and tails"" and ""probability"" is 1/2, or 1 out of 2.",How to Teach a Young Child Beginning Math Skills," By being surrounded by this information all the time, they will gradually begin to remember this information subconsciously, meaning that the facts will be second hand. This will make learning even more new information much easier., There are plastic ones available that will float in the bathtub, allowing that fun sense of learning to go beyond the class room and encourage them to think for themselves - encourage them to play with those.

, Remember, the concept of counting is more important than learning to identify shapes of numeric figures - that will be something that comes after counting has become normal in every day life. The recognition of numeric figures should come in natural, gradual way, through activities. Do not force the information too much, especially if the child is struggling with the information or finding it overwhelming. Allow them time to think and explain things in a clear, concise manner which is simple but not immensely detailed. Mastering the basics is your chief aim here before moving on to further elements.

, This should hopefully provide initiative for the child to demonstrate their counting skills whilst playing and without you necessarily needing to ask them.

, Oh, Hey! Another one; and guess what, that's a total of two!""

This will subtly remind them of what they have been learning, again encouraging them to think about it beyond the class room to incorporate it into every day life.
, That will soon clear up as their vocabulary and mathematical skills develop with age and time.

, 1 can of food and 1 more can equals two cans of food. Right?

, ""Can I get a Yeah!""

Support them in all they do, to define a clear sense of right and wrong.

Use technical words like ""equals, sum, total, solution, objects,"" etc. They will get the hang of it when you keep using them from day to day. Tell them abstract concept of measurement, like taller than, shorter than, lower than, higher than, smaller than, larger than through these activities. If you feel they are beginning to become used to or accustomed to a word, begin to throw in new words to their vocabulary to make things more interesting and challenging.

, ""Let's 'subtract.' What is 3 bottles of milk 'minus' 1 bottle?"" (That equals two bottles) ""Right!""

, Explain that when they spend their money then that is ""subtracting"" from what they handed to the cashier, and the answer or ""solution"" is what they get back as change...

, That would be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Doing that motivates a new idea and leads to learning to multiply.


Repeatedly adding 2 is what multiplying by two is based upon. It's a short cut for repeated addition of the same number:

2, 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 2 = 6, 6 + 2 = 8, 8 + 2 = 10, two is in 10 5 times. So then say, ""2 multiplied by 5 is equal to 10,"" then also say ""5 times 2 equals 10""...


Repeatedly subtracting 2 is what dividing by two is based upon.

10 - 2 = 8, 8 - 2 = 6, 6 - 2 = 4, 4 - 2 = 2, 2-2 = 0, two is in 10 5 times. So then 10 divided by 2 is 5. Use multiplying to check division.
10 divided by 5 = 2

""Check"": 2 times 5 is 10.





, at a glance over time.;
,, Talk about 1/2 of a candy, half of a drink, etc.


Ask, ""Is this half?"" Explain that it's only half if it is split into 2 equal parts, numbers or amounts.
Ask, ""Can I have the big half?""; then ask ""Why that is a silly question?""

Explain that ""half"" really means splitting something into parts that are ""exactly the same"" and so either half should be equal: the same...



, So explain that 1 out of 2 possible or 2 out of 4 of the same kind of things is another way to say ""one half"", so 2 is half of 4 (of of the 4 items or half of the 4 minutes of ""time"").


Avoid gambling when flipping coins or playing dominoes: you don't want to promote bad habits or addiction. They learn about that soon enough.

Balance your child’s academic life and kid-life.",How to Raise an Intelligent Child," Reading helps develop important communication skills, vocabulary, and grammar. In addition, reading helps children learn a lot more about the world. It expands their horizons and can bring them into contact with people and information that they might never experience otherwise. As a result, reading is one of the most important ways to raise and nurture an intelligent child.


Try reading with your child every day at least once. It's best to start doing this when your child is a baby.
Make reading fun for your child; use different voices and sounds to keep his or her attention.
Encourage your child to read on his or her own.
Encourage your child to discuss what he or she has read with you.
Schedule time for regular trips to the library.;
, While television is not necessarily a bad thing for children to spend time watching, it presents several problems for parents who want to take a proactive stance raising their children. Perhaps most importantly, television occupies time that could be used on more stimulating activities. In addition, some studies have indicated that watching television can stunt the intellect or limit a child’s intellectual growth.


The US Department of Health recommends that children under the age of two do not watch TV or spend time in front of other screens, such as computers or tablets. Children between the ages of two and five should not have more than one hour of screen time each day and kids between the ages of five and 18 should have no more than two hours of screen time each day.Make sure that your child watches shows appropriate for him or her.
Have your child watch shows that stimulate his or her brain, such as “Discovery Kids.”
Treat television as a treat, not a right.
Make your child's television experience more active rather than passive; have your child sing along with the characters or talk to your child about what he or she sees or hears., As educators and developmental theorist have known for a long time, toys are an important part of a child’s intellectual growth and development. As a result, you should put thought into the toys you purchase for your child and make sure that your child’s toys are developmentally advantageous. Of course all children are different, and different children use toys differently, so use your best judgement.


Toys and games that promote problem solving (like puzzles) are a good choice.
Toys and games that allow your child to express creativity (like Legos or Lincoln logs) are beneficial.
Toys that allow your child to physically move and touch things are often better choices than video games.
Video game time should be limited, and you should vet every video game to make sure it has educational and intellectual value before allowing your child to play.

, An important element of raising an intelligent child is nurturing your child’s interests. Different children will demonstrate different proclivities and different interests. You should nurture this and promote uniqueness. You can do this by:


Positively reinforcing your child’s interest. If your child demonstrates an interest in history, take them to a historic site. If your child demonstrates an interest in science, take them to a science museum.
Buy them books that he or she is interested in.
Enroll them in programs that cater to their interests. If your child loves environmental science, find a summer environmental program for kids at a local university to enroll them in.

, If you only cater to your child's interests, he or she might miss out on things they have not been exposed to. In order to prevent this, you should go out of your way to introduce your child to different ideas, cultures, and ways of life. Consider:


Introduce girls to traditionally masculine subjects like science, technology, engineering and math. Let your daughter know that she can choose these subjects as career paths, hobbies, and interests.
Introduce boys to traditionally feminine subjects spheres like cooking, childcare, and nurturing. Let your son know that he can choose to be a cook or a caregiver.
Introduce your child to different ways of viewing the world in terms of gender relations, culture, and intellectualism. Your child does not have to fit into any sort of traditional mold and can adopt different ideas in order to fashion their own unique identity., Interact with your child as he or she plays. You can choose to sit down and play with him or her, or you can talk to your child as he or she plays. This way, you’ll learn more about your child and about his or her specific type of intelligence. You might also be able to steer them toward playing styles and activities that are more enriching. But remember:


Always let your child express his or her own creativity. Do not inhibit your child's creativity.
Don’t take over their play time.
There is no right way to “play.”, Talk to your child regularly about his or her interests. This way, you’ll learn about your child and you’ll be able to determine how your child is progressing intellectually over time. You can choose to talk about anything with your child, but it’s better to let your child choose the conversation.


When your child asks you something, turn it into a conversation rather than just quickly answering him or her.
Ask your child questions, and see how he or she responds. Remember, though, there is no right answer. Your goal should be just to engage your child.
One of the most important parts of talking is listening. Make sure you listen carefully to what your child is saying, rather than lecturing to him or her., Use every opportunity to explain how things work to your child. This is a critical part of how children learn to understand the world. Use their development over time as a way to introduce them to the world.


When your child is young, between the ages of 2-4, explain basic and simple things.
Gradually introduce more complex topics as your child gets older.
Save topics like sex, budgeting, and the complexities of law for children near or over the age of 10., Having your child attend the best school possible is key in nurturing your child’s intelligence. This is important because you want your child to be around peers and educators who are as committed to nurturing excellence as you and your child. In addition, you want your child to attend a school that has the resources to fund programs that will help your child stimulate his or her thirst for knowledge. Consider:


Charter or magnet schools.
Private schools.
Schools with high ratings.
Schools with special programs that will benefit your child, like those with well-developed STEM or art programs., While an intelligent child might succeed and prosper in any classroom, you should try to sign your child up for specific classes that will further challenge your child and help him or her expand his or her horizons. Specific classes that might nurture your child’s success include:


Non-conventional pre-kindergarten programs that promote creative growth.
Gifted programs in elementary school or middle school.
Honors classes in middle school and high school.
Advanced Placement classes in high school.
International Baccalaureate classes in high school., Communicating with your child’s teachers and administrators will help ensure that your child is getting the attention he or she needs and is being challenged to a level that will nurture their intelligence.


Keep an open dialogue with your child’s teachers and always be courteous and respectful.
Talk to your child’s teachers about higher level work that your child might be able to do in place of other work.
Talk to your child’s teachers about readings and activities your child can do outside of school., Outside of academics, extracurricular activities are a great way to expand your child’s horizons at school. Extracurricular activities will help your child develop into a better-rounded person with a richer base of experiences to draw on. There are a number of activities you can consider:


Athletics.
Debate club, school newspaper, Model United Nations, and similar clubs.
Chorus or band., An important part of nurturing your child’s intelligence is to help create a balanced life for your child. This is because down-time and play-time are important for all children and for creativity. Consider the following:


A child who is overcommitted might be overstressed and develop anxiety.
A child who is overcommitted might not be able to realize their potential in any one thing.
A child who is overcommitted might lose interest and harbor resentment against overbearing parents.
Overcommitting your child might create undue stress on yourself and on your partner."
"
Take a risk.,
Learn to control feelings of embarrassment.,
Stop relying on others to confirm your worth.,
Believe in yourself.,
Be tenacious and caring.,
Persist in the face of personal mental ambiguity.,
Be determined.,
Ignore the people who oppose your dream.,
Pay attention to the signs, symbols and omens facing you.",How to Release Latent Talent," Often people who haven't realized their talent potential are relying on fear of the unknown to hold them back. The door marked,""Enter at thy own risk"" stands before you. Turn the knob and enter.;
, Embarrassment bars the creative ability you must walk through. Find out ways to build up your confidence and to let go of perfectionism so that you stop feeling embarrassed and start feeling emancipated.

, Validation and support will not come from those you love and admire. This comes from within you, and is the one anchor that will hold you fast when others disapprove or disbelieve in your direction, a direction that you know is right for you.

, This requires you to make unpopular decisions sometimes. Learn to live with that reality.

, The days of indifference must be exchanged for earnest resilience. There isn't an easy out from life; you must embrace it fully, warts and all, to come out the other side feeling fulfilled.

, It can be all too easy to slip into a fugue and pretend that the practical matters of the world don't involve you. They do and they are precisely what will ensure you succeed if you attend to them.

, People will misunderstand your intent, actions and desire when you change suddenly from someone who just ambles along into someone driven. You'll need to learn to start saying no to people, something that may come as a shock to the system at first but... it works. Redefine who you are so that your latent talent can shine forth.

, Just keep marching on to the beat of your own drum.

, Your gut instincts are telling you something important, so listen to them as much as you listen to the voice of reason dulled by years of not taking risks. Let your talents rise!

Interact with your child.,
Talk to your child.,
Expose your child to things that develop both sides of their brain - the left side functions for reasoning, logic, and language while the right side features creativity and the arts.

,
Let your child play – When your child plays, they are creating the foundation for their intellectual, social, physical and emotional skills.,
Encourage your child to exercise - Physical exercise does not only make your child strong, but it also makes your child smart!,
Make music a part of your child’s life – Studies have shown that listening to music can boost memory, attention, motivation, and learning.,
Let your child witness you doing smart things - Children learn by modeling adult’s behavior.,
Let your child play smart computer games - The best computer games teach your child about letters, math, music, phonics and many others.,
Feed your child properly - Giving the right food is important to Raise a Child A protein-rich diet (egg, fish, meat, beans, peanuts, etc.),
Take them on outings.,
Show your child that they can improve with practice and hard work.",How to Raise Smart Children," Scientists have observed that babies who were not cuddled, played with and loved have stunted brain growth. They also observed that babies who were not held and did not receive attention failed to grow, became depressed, and eventually died. On the other hand, many studies have shown that hugging, interacting and playing with your child has a strong effect on developing his intelligence. The loving connection formed between you and your child and your one-on-one interaction with him provide the foundation for his higher thinking skills.;
, Also, listen to when your child is speaking. This reinforces their effort to communicate and for language. You may also read books to your child. Start reading to even if your child does not understand the words. This gives them a head start in developing language skills. Children who are read to when young are more likely to develop a lifelong interest in reading, do well in school, and succeed in adult life. Reading books is one of the most important activities that make children smart.

,, When your child plays with other children, they learn to combine ideas, impressions and feelings with others.

, Exercise increases the flow of blood to the brain and builds new brain cells. Exercise is good for adults' mental sharpness, but it has a more long-lasting effect on your child's developing brain.

, It can also lower stress that is destructive to your child's brain. Learning to play a musical instrument has an effect on the brain’s proportional thinking and spatial-temporal reasoning that lay the foundation for abstract math. If possible, start with the piano. After learning to read music and play up to 10 notes at a time, it will be much easier for them to learn any of the other instruments. But starting them with music young--no matter what the instrument--is the important thing.

, If they see you engaged in reading books, writing, making music, or doing creative things, they will imitate you, and in the process get smarter.

, It also develops their hand-eye coordination and prepares them for tomorrow’s technology. More importantly, the child learns these while they play. Learning and having fun at the same time is the best way for your child to learn.

, improves their attention, alertness, and thinking. Carbohydrates give his brain the fuel that is used in thinking. The best ones are those that come from whole grain and fruits. Processed carbohydrates and sugar have bad effects on attention span, focusing ability, and activity level. Vitamins and minerals are also important.

, Some good options are the museum and tourist attractions. Once they are old enough take them on educational yet very thrilling/exciting places such as The London Dungeons. Taking them on affordable trips abroad is a good option too.

, In a study, researchers showed that teaching 7th graders that intelligence is not fixed but malleable (and that it can be improved through hard work) resulted in an upward trajectory of math grades in junior high school ."

Get a dance bag.,
Feed your child a snack about a half an hour before you leave for class.,
Take your child to the bathroom about twenty minutes before you leave for class.,
Put her hair into a bun about ten minutes before you leave for class, if it's long.,
Get to class fifteen, to twenty minutes before, so that you aren't ""that mom/dad"" that always gets there late, and makes everyone else relearn every step that they just went over.,
When buying ballet slippers, try to avoid buying ones with elastic strings.,
Don't stress too much.",How to Ready a Young Child for Ballet Class," In most dance studios, they sell merchandise such as leotards, tights, shoes, and duffel bags. They come in all sizes, patterns, and prints so get one that is right for your child. If they are only in ballet, get a small bag that will hold their leotard, tights, ballet slippers, hair items, and spare shoes. If your child is in more than one dance genre (jazz, acro, musical theater, hip-hop, lyrical, tap, etc.), then get a bag that will hold all of their stuff (shoes, sweats, leotard, tights, hair items, etc.). Since this is all for fun, get a dance bag that they like, and that is a good size for all the items.


Since your child is young, they will probably want to take toys to dance, so make sure a toy will be able to fit in one of the pockets.;
, Give them something healthy, so that they're energized, and is ready to have fun. The best options for a snack are fruit, yogurt, or a granola bar. Give them something small, so that they aren't completely full and tired during dance. If your child is loaded up with sugar or too full, they may end up crashing, getting tired, slowing down, and throwing a tantrum. However, if they're hungry during class, they will also be tired, and will get distracted from hunger, and not pay attention in class. So, remember to give them a little something before dance class.

, Even if your child says they doesn't have to go, make them try so that they doesn't miss anything in class. When they're done, change them into their leotard, tights, and ballet shoes. Most ballet dress codes consist of black leotard (no sparkles, tutus, or fringe), plain white or pink tights, and pink, black, or white ballet slippers.

, You may need to freshen it up right before class, though, if it gets ruined while she's in the car or playing before class.


The best method for a bun is to put your daughter's hair in a ponytail (preferably a high ponytail), and twist it tightly. This might pull her hair a bit, but it will be fine.
Next, twist the twist, so that it forms a bun. Put a hair band on it to secure it, and bobby pin the hair that sticks out.
Add a cute bow, so that your daughter looks cute in class.

, It is also very important to get there on time, because if you don't it hurts your child when dancing, everyone gets annoyed with you, your child will be unhappy, and it makes you look unreliable. If you can't make it on time, have a friend or family member take them. Tell them about the uniform, snack, bathroom, hair, and what time to be there.

, It's a hassle to tie them, tuck them in, and have them trip your child we dancing. If you can't find any slippers without elastic strips, then cut them a bit shorter, to the point where they won't drag, if they are untied accidentally.

, You aren't going to be able to be on time every week. You may forget to tie their shoes, or take them to the restroom. Just remember, this is for fun! As long as your child is happy, that's all that matters. Most children don't care if they show up to class in a sundress, and cowboy boots! You are their parent, and if your child is happy, then you are perfect!

Understand the risks of being overweight.,
Consult with your child’s doctor about healthy weight ranges.,
Calculate your child’s BMI.,
Set realistic weight-loss goals.,
Talk with your child about your concerns.",How to Push Your Overweight Child to Lose Weight1," Baby fat can be cute, but when it lingers for years or increases significantly, major health problems can arise.


Overweight children are more likely to become overweight adults.Iron and vitamin D deficiencies are common among overweight children, as are joint problems and bowed legs. Breathing problems, such as asthma, early puberty, and sleep apnea are also issues that plague overweight or obese children.;
, If you are concerned that your child may be overweight, schedule an appointment with their pediatrician.


Ask questions such as, “Is my daughter’s weight within a healthy range for her age?” or “He seems to have put on a few extra pounds over the summer, is this normal for children his age?”
Your medical provider can assess your child’s overall health and test for possible metabolic or hormonal conditions that may be contributing to weight gain., Body mass index (BMI) is a formula that measures body mass relative to height. Use your child's BMI as a screening tool to see whether they are actually in the unhealthy range.


The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created growth charts that are used to calculate age- and sex-specific BMIs for children (BMI-for-age charts). The CDC Web site has an interactive tool you can use to calculate your child’s BMI. Access the site here: https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/calculator.aspx.
Children with a BMI in the 85th through 95th percentile are considered overweight, while those above the 95th percentile are considered to be obese. , Research has proven time and again that crash diets and those that are too restrictive do not work for long-term weight management.


Those who are most successful at keeping weight off lose it gradually and steadily. Some younger children may merely need to keep their weight steady, as they are still growing. For older children and teenagers, they may be able to safely lose ½ pound to 2 pounds per week., Your son or daughter may not be surprised that you bring up their weight, but do it in a positive, non-confrontational way.


Primarily focus on them being healthy, rather than hitting a particular target weight. Say, “I’d like you to be as healthy and active as possible, let’s think of some ways to do that.”
Be sure not to compare them to other children or otherwise hurt their self-esteem.
Tell them you can work together as a family to achieve health goals. You could say, “I was thinking we could try as a family to eat healthier and get more exercise.”
By involving the whole family, your child will be less likely to feel bad about their excess weight.

"
"
Educate your child about their dietary needs.,
Encourage your child to eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Pay attention to portion sizes.,
Ask your child to help with meal preparation.,
Reduce the amount of junk food in your house.",How to Push Your Overweight Child to Lose Weight2," It may seem second nature to you, but children need to be taught about the fuel their body needs to stay strong and healthy.


With your child, visit http://www.choosemyplate.gov/MyPlate-Daily-Checklist. This interactive Web site hosted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides daily nutritional checklists based on your child’s age and calorie range.
The federal recommendations for all Americans, including children, stress a diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat protein and dairy choices.
Work with your child to make a list of healthy foods they already enjoy. You can try to incorporate them into your meals more often.

, Whole fruits and a variety of vegetables should fill half of your child’s plate at each meal. These high-fiber, low-calorie foods can fill them up and prevent them from eating less healthy choices. Try to “eat the rainbow” each day. Make a game out of trying to eat a fruit or vegetable representing each color of the rainbow every day. See which family member reaches this goal first each day. This will encourage your child to eat a variety of fresh produce in a fun way. Go to a local farmer’s market or farm stand. These venues provide a fun opportunity to try new foods and may encourage your child to seek out other healthy choices.

, Even healthy foods can cause weight gain if you eat too much of them.


A serving size of fruit or vegetables is about the size of your fist.
For snacks like pretzels or crackers, a serving size is roughly a handful of the item.

, Many kids love to be around you when you’re in the kitchen, so why not put them to work? Your child may be more inclined to try new, healthier foods if they have a hand in preparing them.


They can help measure ingredients, like rice or pasta, or rinse produce.
If your child is a little older, they can help chop vegetables (while supervised) or shred cheese.
They can also help you look through cookbooks and select healthy meal options.

, If sodas and cookies are not within easy reach, your child will be less likely to eat these high-calorie options.


Be sure not to completely forbid sugar and other low-nutrient (or ""junk"") food, because that will only make them more tempting. Allow kids a reasonable amount of junk food each day. This will keep them from feeling deprived and also from fixating on a ""banned"" food.Try to limit servings of desserts or junk food to around 150 calories.If they say they're still hungry after their 150-calorie portion of cookies, tell them, ""I know you enjoyed your snack, now here are some apple slices to help fill you up.""

"
"
Make exercise a family activity.,
Ask your child about trying new activities.,
Model good behavior.,
Limit screen time.",How to Push Your Overweight Child to Lose Weight3," Everyone in your house, not just your overweight child, will benefit from increased physical activity.


Try to go for walks after dinner or on weekend afternoons.
Look up local hiking trails or bike paths and plan a family outing to them.
Sign up the family for a charity fun run.

, They will be more inclined to be physically active if it is an activity they enjoy.


Some activities to try include dance classes, gymnastics, or yoga
Swimming, diving, and martial arts may be other activities your child has not previously considered.
Many gyms let you sign up for a free class before making a commitment for a whole session.
Encourage them to ask a friend to join them. Odds are, they’ll stick with a class or activity if a friend is there to support them.

, The best way to reinforce an active lifestyle is to live one yourself. Your children look up to you, and if you happily exercise regularly, they will be inclined to do so as well.Think of ways to incorporate more activity into your own life, such as taking the stairs or parking further back in parking lots.
Try a new exercise class. If your child sees you enjoying being active, they will be more likely to see exercise as fun, rather than a chore or punishment.
Eat healthy foods yourself to model good eating habits for your child.

, Kids should only have one or two hours of screen time each day, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.Some devices, such as Kindle Fire and iPads have options that allow you to set a limit, so the device will automatically shut off when your child reaches their screen time limit for the day.


Screen time includes watching TV, playing video games, or surfing on a tablet.
When screen time decreases, active time naturally increases.

"
"
Stress being healthy rather than solely focusing on your child’s weight.,
Focus on other things the child does well.,
Talk about other things rather than her weight all of the time.",How to Push Your Overweight Child to Lose Weight4," It can be difficult to talk with your child about a weight problem, but focusing on health rather than weight can really help make the conversation easier.


Avoid judgmental statements about their weight. Don’t focus on your child’s appearance. Rather, say something like, “I want you to have strong muscles,” or “Wouldn’t it be good to be able to run faster at the playground?” That way, they’re focusing on what their body can do, rather than how it looks.

, Remember, there is more to your child than their weight problem. Be sure to stay positive about their other noteworthy traits, like being good at school or being a good friend.


Say something like, ""I loved the way you included the new boy in your game at the park today.""
Or, you could note how your child is always responsible: ""I really appreciate all of your help cleaning the house this weekend.""

, Your child’s weight problem is certainly a serious concern, but it is only one aspect of their life.


During the weight-loss process, be sure to still spend quality time with your child and enjoy those things you’ve always done together.
Once your child has successfully worked on being healthier for a while, plan a special trip or outing to celebrate.

Be patient, and show real and instant, child-appropriate excitement ""Wow!,
Practice a ""quiet game"" sometimes.,
Decide which activities are appropriate for the age of your young child -- according to your goals for your child.",How to Play Simple Learning Activities with Your Child at Home1,""", have lots of common fun and be sure to give mild praise (clap, and say ""Yes!"") about learning. Don't go gaga (crazy) whether s/he does (or does not) catch on to an idea this time or immediately; so that it's not embarrassing/crushing such as when you or a teacher does not go silly with admiration and joy (keep praise short and mild).


Don't be surprised whether you might see no/or little (or big) signs of comprehension at times.
Never shame or make a big deal; or else, the young child won't be happy. Never make the child's learning disappointing. Lead in simple learning, for commonly learning all the time.

, Activities do not have to be fun or funny -- if they are interesting and appropriate to the child. Realize that children are naturally curious and are always learning ""math"" as well as other languages whether you guide them or not, but don't expect much obvious results at first.

, Some activities are mostly for the younger, less taught and the less-skilled child from infancy to preschool age or even kindergarten.


Choose activities that are easy, safe enough and while using age-appropriate child discipline. Avoid and discard any activity that is disagreeable to you and/or the child -- causes anxiety, frustration, that the child does not wish to accept, etc.

NOTE: The age groupings below are approximate. Some children will learn earlier or later than others. Don't get too excited if your child is ahead of or behind on any of these groupings. The information here is NOT a psychological IQ test! It's just fun things you can do with your child to help them assimilate concepts and information.

Make appropriate sound effects (with alert infants who sit up and pay attention) to go cleverly with whatever you are showing, teaching younger children such as pictures of farm animals, pets, people.,
Play simple sorting games and have the child manipulating objects for various physical characteristics.,
Imply numeration up to the number three with a small child by leading all kinds of games like saying or singing:



""Meow"" --
""Meow, meow"" --

""Meow, meow, meow"" .

,
Learn to count by naming number values: Point to, and always count things, like toys aloud.",How to Play Simple Learning Activities with Your Child at Home2,"
Sound effects may, also, be appropriate between about 11 to 18 months of age... the attention span may be low, so you will need to turn the page and make new sounds for the animal, car, truck or whatever and point at the picture.;
, Show them how to do these games and always say the color (and later emphasize the shape that the child has in each hand). Say obvious colors often, such as when the toddler puts a hand(s) on a painted wall or bangs a solid color toy on your chair arm, or table (""orange, orange, orange,..."" with each hit). Or, with one color in each of his/her hands, you say ""red, red, blue, red, blue, blue, red,..."" on each strike of the surface with the toy -- using soft, (perhaps chew-able) and unbreakable objects. Always do and say lots of examples for them, such as:


""Sorting"" by each solid color and ""naming/describing"", size or by shape, at different times (11 to 18 months of age, may also play sorting and arranging with all kinds of single colors of soft shapes, 'floaties and teething toys),
""Arranging blocks in lines"", or to form a shape, square or circle later,
""Nesting"" (plastic bowls, boxes one inside another, for a size concept for example),
""Grouping"" (grouping can imply numeracy, always count one, two, three),
""Classifying"" for instance by examples say:


Size: ""small, bigger, really big"", or ""short, tall, the tallest one""

Kinds: ""sweet, sour, so bitter!"", or ""cold, warm, too hot!"" -- (not dangerously hot),

Uses: for very young say: ""Toy, play,"" or ""Not a toy, No play,"" or ""Do not bang it""; ""Don't hit or drop it"", etc.

, Vary the manner of the game.

, Then you name (or let them name them if they should know) the geometric shapes as they show them to you (squares, triangles, circles, cubes, stars, etc.) and repeat this occasionally/several times.


Let the child say the shapes/colors and use fun and teasing reminders if necessary. The child will consider it a fun ""game"" and not realize they are learning.

, It's simple addition and subtraction... but your child will be having too much fun playing with mom or dad to notice that they are ""learning"". Ask questions like: Which ""family"" of animals has more babies now? What will happen if the dog family sends puppy to visit grandma? How many dogs will be left at home then?

, Set out clear plastic cups in an area where spills can be cleaned up easily and put varying amounts of liquid (juice? Water?) into each. Let them experiment by pouring liquid from glass to glass. Ask them if the amount in each glass got bigger or smaller and is it more or is it less? If you want to take it a step further, use measuring cups for this activity with older kids (age 4-6) and talk about how four of the quarter cup measurements will fill the one cup measurer.

,
Count how many plates as you put them on the table. Count eggs to be cooked.

, Talk about 1/2 of a candy, half of a drink, etc. Ask, ""Is this half?"" ""Are both the same? They should both be exactly the same amount.""

,, Say and show, ""Two fourths make one half.""

Fold paper 1/4 in half again and talk about ""1/2 of 1/4 is 1/8"" -- as the words, not as the numerals; just say: ""one half of one fourth is one eighth"". Say and show how, ""Two eighths make one fourth.""


""Pizza Math:"" Slice pizza or cake, etc. in half and then ask:

Talk about ""1/2 of 1/2 is ____?"" . Explain that ""each of the 4 pieces is one fourth"".

Have them prove it... by slicing ""half of the two halves"" and then talk about two 1/4's makes ____? . Let them count all the 4 pieces created; say, ""Each of the 4 pieces is one fourth of the whole pizza"", and then talk about two 1/4's makes ____? Talk about ""1/2 of one fourth"" is ____? Have them prove this, too... by slicing each fourth into halves of the four fourths. Let them count all the 8 pieces created; say, ""Each of the 8 pieces is one eighth of the whole pizza"", and then talk about two 1/8's makes ____? .





, But, ""No!"" it is one fourth. The ""th"" which makes a soft ""thuh"" sound may sound silly or like you are not speaking clearly.
Explain the sound of a ""four"" compared to a ""fourth"" as simply as possible (not even mentioning the spelling for a young child).
Don't try to make them say ""thuh"" -- if it may be too hard to make that sound, just explain lightly and quickly! Move on to more simple, fun activities, of course...


Say ""'One out of four' or 'one of the four' equal parts of pizza"" (for example) to be clear in grouping parts as fractions of a larger thing which is very different in meaning from ""one group of four things"" which are not in that case being interpreted to represent fractions. This should be explained and understood clearly after the child is getting the idea.See fractions as pieces of the ""same size of circle"":

, Make them carefully.


Draw dividing lines for equal fractions across from side to side, exactly through the center to make fractions of the circular pizzas.
Out of one pizza circle, draw and cut 2 equal parts and say that each is called one half (not one, two). Later they can learn to write 1/2, but now it is probably oral, by word of mouth.

Use the second pizza shape to draw and cut 4 equal parts so that each is called one fourth (not one, four) and written as 1/4.
Use the last circular pizza shape to draw and cut 8 equal parts called one eighth (not one, eight"") and written as 1/8.



Allow (coach) the child to place 2 of ""1/8"" size on top of 1 of the ""1/4"" size to see that those quantities are equivalent. So 2/8 = 1/4 and also 1/4 = 2/8.


, Use pieces to lay on top of an equivalent larger piece as explained above. Or, lay the 1/4 on top of the 2/8 (made of 2 of 1/8 pieces). Celebrate a little for a getting and demonstrating the right answer...

, . 2 pieces of the 8? 2/8 = ??? , 3 pieces out of 8 equal pieces is called ??? and 4 pieces makes 4/8 = four eighths = regroups to make what? Have him or her prove it with equivalent pieces. Smile and laugh and do a dance when it is done.

, Have him or her prove it with the pieces. Smile and laugh and do high fives. as a reward.

, Say, ""Prove it!"" Smile, laugh -- and shout, ""Hey! Right!"" or something to celebrate.See fractions as pieces of the ""same size of shape"":

, Now redo all of the pizza math from above... Squares have all four sides equal and all corners are 90 degrees, called right angles.


Why are they called right angles? Well, if the angle of a building's walls compared to its ""level"" floor is not 90 degrees, then that would not be right! It would not stand ""upright"".

If a building has ""plumbed"" walls (perfectly vertical) and level floors and ceilings (perfectly horizontal) then that is usually what is wanted: so that is ""Right!"", ie: not wrong... That's where the word comes from.



, Be careful to divide it into equal rectangles. Rectangular shapes have different length compared to the width.

, Divide the candy bar in equal pieces as before.

Focus your statements on the child's actions and efforts rather than characteristics.,

Try to engage in discussion rather than use evaluative praise.,

Praise good behavior.,

Praise small improvements.",How to Praise a Child," It's better to say something like, ""I can tell you worked really hard on that,"" instead of, ""You're so smart."" Studies have shown that when children are praised for their efforts and later encountered difficult problems where they faced the possibility of failure they tended to work harder and kept trying. The same studies showed that when children were told something like how smart they were but later encountered a difficult problem with the possibility of failure they gave up. The children who were praised for being smart quit working because they didn't want to risk losing approval for not being able to complete a task.
, A good example is children's art work. Rather than just say a picture is pretty, ask the child to tell you about it. This does a couple of things. Rather than having a brief interaction, you're now spending some quality time with your child. You may gain some insight into things that are important to your child by listening to things they are describing. You're also fostering important brain development by having your child describe things to you. Whether the child is 3 or 13, this type of interaction is meaningful. You're building your child's self esteem when you show them they're important enough to listen to., When a child does something you like, acknowledge it. ""I really appreciate how you made your bed today."", Everyone learns by trial and error. Sometimes you may be working on improving a behavior. Praising steps in the right direction gives encouragement to keep trying."

Monitor schoolwork.,
Volunteer your time.,
Communicate with the teacher.,
Visit the classroom.,
Talk to other parents.",How to Play an Active Role in Your Child's Education1," Taking an active role in your child's education can be very beneficial in helping her succeed. One of the most important things you can do is to pay attention to what she is learning in school. Keep track of what subjects she is studying and monitor the assignments she is working on.Younger children tend to bring home projects, worksheets, and information from the teacher. If your child is in elementary school, ask her to go through her backpack with you each afternoon or evening.
Take time to ask what she is working on. Ask her to explain each of the items she brings home, and show a genuine interest.
If your child is older, ask about individual classes. Instead of saying, ""How was school?"", try saying, ""What experiments did you work on in Chemistry today?"";
, There are many ways to become more actively involved in your child's education. One of the most effective is to actually spend time at the school. Ask your child's teacher or principal for a list of volunteer opportunities available for parents.


In many elementary schools, parents are regularly utilized as classroom volunteers. Sign up to spend a morning helping with an art project.
If your child is in middle school or high school, volunteer to chaperone a field trip. Serving as an additional supervisor on a visit to the state capital is a great way to interact with your child, her classmates, and teachers.
You can also volunteer in other ways. Think about your own talents. For example, if you are a skilled seamstress, offer to help make costumes for the school play.
Consider volunteering to be the parent adviser for an after school club. Maybe your child is interested in playing chess, and wants to recruit other kids to join in. Talk to the school about organizing a new club.
Offer to give a presentation to your child's class. Many schools have a career day, which would be a great opportunity for you to teach your child and her classmates about your job.

, Your child's teacher obviously plays an important role in your child's education. At the beginning of each school year, contact the teacher and establish an open line of communication. Let her know you are interested in any feedback or comments she has to offer.


You can stop by the classroom before or after school to introduce yourself. Just say, ""Hi, I'm Angie's mom, and I wanted to introduce myself. Please feel free to contact me if you feel there is anything about Angie that I should know.""
You can also send an introductory note or e-mail at the beginning of the year. You should also contact the teacher throughout the year if you have any specific concerns.
Make parent-teacher conferences a priority. Most schools have regularly scheduled meetings between parents and teachers. Put these occasions on your calendar well in advance so that you have time to attend.
Try to respect boundaries. Schedule an appointment with your child's teacher during regular business hours instead of phoning her at home late at night.

, Sitting in on a lesson or two is a great way to get a clear idea of what your child is learning. Ask the school if they allow parent visitors during classes. Contact the principal's office to learn the specific guidelines.Make sure that the teacher is aware that you will be visiting. Send an e-mail or note ahead of your visit, stating that you are looking forward to watching your child learn.
Follow-up with your child after the visit. Over dinner, ask specific questions, such as, ""How long have you been reading that book? Who is your favorite character?""

, If you get to know the other parents at school, you will likely feel more motivated to get involved in the culture. A great way to meet other parents is to join the Parent Teacher Organization or Association. Attend meetings regularly to get to know other parents and learn about issues affecting your child's education.Talk to other parents about what your kids are learning. If you have concerns about anything that is happening at the school, it will be useful to have another viewpoint.
The Parent Teacher Organization will usually sponsor many events and projects throughout the year. For example, they might raise funds for a new computer lab. Joining this organization is a great way to work with others to improve the school.

Help her succeed by fostering a good learning environment at home. This includes giving her a comfortable area in which to work.Designate an area of your home for school work. It can be the kitchen table, a desk in your child's room, or a corner in your home office.
Help her to concentrate by limiting distractions in the school work area. For example, avoid letting her do homework in a room with the tv on.
Establish a routine. Find a time that works for your child to her her homework and help her stick to that schedule.
Maybe your child works best before dinner. Schedule your meal time a little later to allow her ample time to get her work done.

, You can make learning fun and exciting by planning activities around what your child is learning at school. For example, if your child is studying the Civil War, there are lots of things you can do to make that come alive for her. Try taking a trip to a local history museum to see what exhibits they have on display.You can also do fun activities such as cooking new foods. If your child is taking Spanish at school, try cooking some homemade enchiladas together.
If your child is really interested in her biology class, try to find some nature-based documentaries to watch with her. Or look for some cool books on the subject. Your local library is a great resource.
Get the whole family involved. Family field trips are a great way to encourage learning. Take a weekend trip to a new city and explore some local history.
For example, if your child is studying science, try going to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. You can also look for alternatives closer to home.

, If your child is having trouble with a particular subject or class, you can provide extra learning opportunities outside of school. First, assess her needs. Is she simply bored by the topic? Or does she seem to struggle with some of the necessary basic skills?For example, maybe your child just doesn't seem interested in her history lessons. Try to make the subject more interesting for her by talking to her about some interesting individuals in your family. Hearing stories about relatives can make history seem more relevant and exciting.
If your child is struggling with certain skills, there are some steps you can take. For instance, if your child is having trouble retaining information, try making flashcards.
Ask the teacher for a copy of the curriculum, so that you have all of the necessary information. Then, design some flashcards that you can use to help your child study in a fun and creative way.

, Not only will your child need solid reading skills in school, but helping your child to become a reader will promote lifelong learning. One of the most effective ways to help your child become a better learner is to promote reading outside of school. You can do this by finding ways to make reading enjoyable for your child.If your child is young, you can read books together. Devote some time each evening to taking turns reading from a popular series such as the Harry Potter books.
Set a good example by reading your own books. If your child sees you choosing to relax with a book in the evening instead of the television, she will be more likely to adopt the same habits.
Don't be afraid to offer incentives. Have your child set a goal of reading a certain amount of books in a month. If she meets the goal, offer a reward such as a family outing for ice cream.

, Your child spends more hours away from school than in it. That is why it is important to help her continue learning when she is away from a traditional learning environment. Work to turn everyday events into moments where your child can learn something.For example, cooking is a great way to teach your child math skills and organization. Ask her to help you read a recipe and measure out the ingredients you will need for dinner.
If your child asks a question, take time to engage and give a thoughtful answer. If your teenager asks a question about the election process, take some time to ask her what her views about the candidates are.
Demonstrate that learning is something that happens throughout life. If you are using the internet to find tips to house train your new puppy, use that as an opportunity to talk to your child about all of the different ways you can find information.

, Reading and doing homework are considered types of quiet learning. While these are important, your child also needs to engage in active learning in order to have a more well-rounded education. Active learning means that your child is actively participating in an activity.Encourage your child to join a sports team or an after school club. Playing a sport like soccer teaches teamwork and the importance of following the rules.
Social interactions will also help your child gain confidence. This will help her to succeed in the classroom and out.
Take your child on educational outings. For example, ask her to accompany you to the local art museum. Ask her opinions about the different exhibits.
Lead by example. Show your child that it is important to live a well-rounded life. Join a book club with other parents in your neighborhood to demonstrate that learning can be fun., The mind-body connection is very important for a child's development. In order to succeed at school, your child needs to be physically healthy. Take an active role in her education by making sure that she is properly nourished and well-rested.Make sure that you provide healthy snacks and meals. While your child is growing, it is important that she receive the right nutrients. Provide healthy snacks such as fresh fruit or veggies and hummus.
Children need about 8-11 hours of sleep each night, depending on their age. Make sure that your child has a structured routine that includes a reasonable bed time."
"
Ask questions.,
Listen carefully.,
Make time for your child.,
Offer encouragement.",How to Play an Active Role in Your Child's Education3," You can more actively be involved with your child's education by making sure that you communicate with her. One of the best ways to do this is by asking questions. This shows that you care and are interested in her school life and what she is learning.Ask open-ended questions. Try to avoid questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no.
Instead of saying, ""Did you have a good day?"", try ""What was the best part of your day?"". This will give you a better opportunity to develop the conversation.

, Kids want to feel like you respect and value their feelings and opinions. When you ask a question, make sure that you actively listen to the answer. There are many ways to demonstrate that you are listening.Ask follow-up questions. If your child says, ""Gym class was cool today,"" ask a question like, ""What made it great? What did you do?""
Use positive body language. Maintaining eye contact and nodding your head are excellent ways to show that you are paying attention.

, Set aside time each day to spend with your child. This will allow you to get a more accurate sense of what is going on in her life, including school activities. If possible, try to eat dinner together each night. Meals are a great time to talk about the day.Schedule time to attend your child's activities. If she sings in a choir, make sure to attend concerts. It will show her that you are interested in her life.
Offer to help with homework. Set aside time each evening to help your child with any problems that are giving her trouble.

, Providing supportive words is one of the best ways to help your child succeed. Be an active participant in her education by cheering her on when she succeeds and offering support when she struggles. Your feedback is important to helping your child learn more and grow as a student.Offer positive reinforcement. If your child gets an ""A"" on a spelling test, that is cause for celebration.
If your child struggles on an assignment, try to figure out what went wrong. Ask her if she needs more time at home to work on projects, for instance.

Give the child agency.,
Give them control to change direction.,
Encourage their passions.,
Let them know you care.,
Encourage enthusiasm with your words.",How to Motivate Gifted Children1," Gifted children are often passionate about certain subjects, and they'll throw themselves into something they're interested in with abandon. However, that passion can be staunched if their interest isn't respected. That is, if the adults in their life expect them to learn a certain way or a certain amount, it can limit rather than motivate gifted kids.In other words, gifted kids need to have a say in what they're learning. Of course, they can't completely direct their learning. However, with a bit of encouragement, they're likely to learn far more if you act as a guide, rather than someone who's there simply to instruct their learning.
For example, if you're working on fractions with a kid and they master it quickly enough to start figuring out decimals, don't hold them back. Encourage their interest by showing them how decimals are related to fractions.
Another option is to ask your child to teach you. Let your child learn about the subject that interests them and then ask them to teach you about it. This will appeal to their creative side and reaffirm their understanding of the material.;
, A gifted student will stay unmotivated if they're in a situation where they aren't learning anything. Boredom will take over, and they will find anything to keep themselves entertained. However, if you give them room to grow, if they have the capacity to move to something else once they've conquered the basics, they're more likely to stay engaged.For example, say a student is reading at an advanced level. If you try to keep them on a lower level of books, they'll get bored. Give them the opportunity to try out higher level books to keep them more engaged. If the rest of the class is still stuck on picture books but the child is reading at a higher level, consider starting them on chapter books.
Do not take it personally if the child becomes bored and react with annoyance. Focus instead on ways to redirect and challenge them.

, If a gifted child shows an interest in something, try to find a way to help encourage that interest. For instance, put them in touch with local experts in your community. You could also point them to resources in the library. Once you realize a child's passions, you can use that passion to help inspire them to learn in other areas.For example, a child who isn't much interested in math may be inspired to learn it if they have a passion for cooking. They'll learn about fractions and measurements without even realizing it. At home, you can work with a child to go through a recipe. Try doubling a recipe to make it more challenging. As you go along, make sure to talk through the math out loud with the child.
Once you learn what a kid is passionate about, you can use that in the classroom or at home. A more advanced child can be challenged by helping other students or even by helping the teacher. For instance, if the child has mastered the current math unit, encourage them to help other students. Alternatively, if an older child is interested in computers, have the kid help you load software onto the computers or help you with a new program.
Remember to show an interest in their passions yourself. Your interest in the child and whatever they are doing can be a powerful motivator.

, For a gifted student, an uninterested, unmotivated teacher or parent is just going to keep them unmotivated. However, if you show that you care about what they're learning, they're more likely to stay engaged. Someone else cares enough to inspire them, and they're motivated in turn.Try listening to what inspires your children or students. Having someone available to listen, who champions what they care about, can make all the difference.
For example, you could say, ""So what has caught your attention this week? What are you excited about learning?"" Listening to the answers will give you insight into the child and let them know that you do care.

, If you describe a topic as ""difficult"" or ""challenging,"" that can lead some gifted students to feel like it will be boring or too hard to do. However, saying words like ""interesting"" and ""intriguing"" can convey your enthusiasm to the students and pique their interest, too.For example, you could say, ""We're starting a new unit in math today. I hope you are excited as I am. I think fractions are so interesting, don't you?""

Have your baby listen to your voice (mother and father would be better) as well as classical music.,
When the baby pops some parts of his or her body, touch your womb or gently push it so the baby reacts.,
Continue to have the baby listen to classical music after it is born, but never at a loud volume.,
When your kid can talk, encourage him or her to ask questions about his or her surrounding world.,
Teach your child how to color, write his or her name, recognize letters, numbers, family members on pictures, etc.,
Let your child know that learning is fun.,
Ask your child why he or she doesn't like a certain subject.,
Teach your child how to be responsible.,
Remember that your child needs to rest.,
Never force your child to study a certain career because you like it.",How to Make Your Kids Successful Students," According to many experts, this routine makes your child´s brain open connections between your child´s brain cells. Record material that you consider to be interesting to reason about and then make your baby listen to it.;
, Remember that nerves are connected to the brain and this procedure might open new brain paths on the unborn baby´s brain. Furthermore, it becomes a funny game.

, As the baby is growing, have him or her explore with your participation. Don´t let the child just do it by herself all the time. Think of some new ways of exploration. Remember child safety rules; everything has to be done according to his or her age. If you have questions ask a specialist or another kind of person like those people.

, Always show her you enjoy her questioning (the simple expression ""wow"" makes her know that you enjoy her questioning). If your child wants to give an explanation, always listen to him or her. If your child is wrong, appreciate her curiosity and then explain her the right answer in a manner according to her age.

, Never get frustrated or force the little child. Always make the child think you are playing and everything is part of a funny game.

, Remember your child is looking at you, so facial, tone of voice and body expressions are crucial. Whenever your child brings a different thing from school, show him or her how interesting it is.

, Your answer should have a message, no matter if hidden but clear. ""You don´t like it honey because you didn't consider this or that..."" Use your own words, but make him or her understand that every subject is very interesting and enjoyable. Show love to your child and he or she will listen.

, Never let your kids play or watch TV first and then study. Tell them that they sure can play or do whatever they like after they have studied.

, It is a good idea to take a nap when they come from school before starting studying.

, Let her recognize by herself her own career and be there to help and honestly answer her questions. If you don´t know what to answer, investigate from reliable sources and ask your kids to investigate by themselves as well.

Go faster.,
Move to harder material.,
Present them with tangential material.,
Make it about more than just school.,
Try compacting.",How to Motivate Gifted Children2," Often, gifted kids are unmotivated because they're bored. They've mastered the content already, so they feel like they don't have to try. To help alleviate the problem, try challenging these kids. One way to do that is to go faster if you have a group of these students. You don't want to leave them in the dust, but you do want to move fast enough that you're engaging their brains.Keep checking in with the children. If they have the content, move on. If they don't, try covering it again, but in a slightly different way.
One way to check if the kids have the material is to ask relevant questions or to do in-class homework. Either way, you can assess where they are individually or as a whole.
Look for warning signs of boredom, such as restless behavior, increased chatting, etc.

, One technique that can work in a large class of mixed students is to give the gifted kids more advanced material. Once they've mastered the basics, offering more advanced material on the same subject can give them motivation to keep working.Of course, this approach is more difficult in a large, varied class. However, you can give a group of students a topic to discuss while you help the rest of the class catches up, or you can ask the more advanced students to help the other kids catch up. Both offer challenges to the advanced kids, while keeping the other kids in mind.
For instance, in history, maybe some of the kids have the ideas of the Civil Rights Movement down, while the rest of the class needs a bit more help. You could have the more advance group spend time discussing what made ""I Have a Dream"" such a great speech, while the rest of the class does more reading. At the end of class, the more advance group could present their findings to the rest of the class.

, If a kid finds a topic interesting enough to master it quickly, try finding tangential or related material to interest them. If you can find related topics, the gifted kid will likely dive in and do more than you expect. Alternatively, try taking what they're already learning deeper.For example, if a kid is interested in the U.S. suffragist movement, you might point them in the direction of the British suffragist movement.

, Make sure you have conversations with your child that go beyond academia or what they're currently studying. For instance, watch the news together and ask them their opinion on current events. This reminds them that there's life outside of school, which can help keep them from feeling smothered or overwhelmed. Asking for their input shows you value what they have to say, and can also challenge them to apply their gifts toward real-world problems., One technique to help gifted students involves pre- and post-assessments. As you start a new unit, give the students a pre-assessment. The students who have already mastered certain areas can sit out those lessons, working on other material.When compacting, it's important to have alternative assignments and activities for students, though they can be self-directed if the student has a particular interest.

Help kids set goals.,
Teach gifted kids why something is useful.,
Provide a practical application.,
Help them to realize how now affects the future.",How to Motivate Gifted Children3," Goals should relate to the child's passions and desires in some way for them to be meaningful. They should also be short and measurable, so that kids can feel like they achieve them. Work with gifted students to set their own goals, so that they can have the motivation to achieve.For instance, say a kid wants to win a reading award at the library because they want to be part of the pizza party. While that's an extrinsic goal, it can work to motivate the child. The key is to break it into smaller goals. If the child needs to read 40 books over the course of a year, set the goal at one book a week, with a chart set up to see how they are working towards their long-term goal as well.

, Many gifted kids need to understand why something is useful before they want to put drive into learning it. Maybe it's useful on a social-cultural level, but it will likely connect better with students if it has a more utilitarian purpose.For example, a child may not be able to see how math is useful to their everyday life or their long-term goals. However, say the child wants to be a vet. Explain that vets need math to help their furry patients, as vets need to do things like calculate medication dosages. In other words, connect what their learning to what they want in life.
In the short term, help kids see how math is used in everyday life. For example, math is useful in things like cooking, figuring out a tip, calculating how much something costs (adding on tax), and playing physical games (geometry).

, Sometimes, the best way to show a kid why something is useful is to let them learn through that practical application. This approach is often used in science class, where kids learn a concept, then apply it through an experiment. However, in other subjects, kids may not be getting the same sort of motivation. Try to attach what kids are learning to practical applications to help motivate them.


For example, if you're teaching kids about persuasive letters, consider having them write to a local politician about something they care about. It will help connect the activity to something in real life.
If you are a parent, discuss your daily responsibilities with your child and how learning provided you with the tools to take care of these responsibilities.

, Even young kids have dreams of what they want to be, and they can be motivated by those dreams. What they are learning and achieving now affects what classes they can be in later. In turn, that affects what colleges they can get into. Helping kids to see how their achievement level now affects their future can provide motivation.Arrange for the gifted child to talk with an older child, college student, or new graduate. This will get them excited about their future and also underscore the importance of learning for the future.

Be a role model.,
Nurture unstructured playtime.Allow your child to have unstructured playtime where you do not interrupt, direct the play, or make suggestions.,
Provide resources.,
Generate ideas.,
Encourage mistakes and failure.Kids that are afraid to fail or make a mistake may create obstacles for themselves in the creative process.Kids may also be afraid to judge their own work or have their work judged.,
Ask open-ended questions.,
Limit screen time.,
Focus on the process instead of the end result.",How to Inspire Creativity in Your Kids1," Be open-minded in your thinking and find lots of solutions to many problems. Show your kids that you are flexible and willing to try new things.When faced with difficulty, show your kids that you can approach the problem in different ways and still be okay.


If your kids ask you a question, be creative in how you answer it. You can brainstorm different solutions with your child before answering the question. For instance, your child may ask, “Where does rain come from?” You can start to wonder together, “Well… it comes from the sky… what else comes from the sky? Could it come from that?”
If your kid asks you how to draw a heart, show lots of different ways to draw a heart (like using straight lines, using dots, or drawing flowers in the shape of a heart), even including the anatomical way, then ask your child to think of some.;
, Choose toys for your children that don’t have one specific purpose but let your child find many uses.


Encourage activities like painting, drawing, and building.
Avoid or have very few cause-and-effect toys, such as a jack-in-the-box or other pop-up toy.
Don’t correct your child’s play unless their is obvious conflict.
If your child says, “I’m bored”, set out some toys, and start a story line and have your child complete it. For instance, you can set up some dolls and say that they are traveling all over the world. Their first stop in in Prague, where do they go next? What places do they want to see? How long do they travel for, and how many countries do they visit?

, Have specific spaces for activities, especially messy activities. Create an art space for your children where they can paint and make a mess without it affecting the whole house, or a dress up area where all clothes go. When it comes time for Christmas or birthday gifts, request art supplies, musical instruments, building materials, and costumes.Repurpose things you have around the house: paper towel and toilet paper rods can become a sword or a sailboat.
Challenge your children to make something using common household items like paper, wrappers, and wrapping paper tubes.

, Set aside time to brainstorm ideas of how to solve problems, create new activities, or make new things. Don’t judge, evaluate or talk about what may be plausible, but encourage the flood of ideas. Don’t choose the “best” idea. Focus on the process of idea generating, not the outcomes or evaluations.Whenever something's lacking (i.e. you need to reach something but you don't have a ladder) have your kids think about ways they could solve the problem.
Read a short story until the climax then stop. Now ask your kids what they think happens next and how they would solve the problem.

, Share your own failures with your child, and stress that it was okay and that it taught you something.


Practice coloring outside the lines with your child, coloring skin blue or purple, or other silly things to show that doing things differently is okay.
If your child is upset about making a mistake, find creative alternatives to making it okay. If your child rips a page in a coloring book, repair the rip with stickers, or draw around the rip to make it fit in with the picture.

, Some parents find themselves caught in the closed question loop, such as, “That’s a nice flower, isn’t it?” or “That’ll be fun, won’t it?” Instead of asking questions that are closed, ask open ended questions that allow for creativity.Allow your child to answer creatively, as well.


You can say, “Which is your favorite flower and why?” or “What do you think will be fun?”

, Allow your children to watch a minimum of tv or interact sparsely with screens like phones, computers, or tablets, as too much screen time can lead to obesity, attention problems, emotional disturbances, and difficulties sleeping.Instead, encourage activities such as reading, listening to music, practicing drawing or rehearsing a play.Set a timer for your children when watching tv or use a tablet or phone, so they know that once the timer goes off, screen time is up.

, Incentives or too much force can interfere with creativity, and make the child try to guess what you want instead of exploring on their own.Instead of giving verbal praise such as “great job!” or “what a great painting!” praise the effort. Say, “I can tell you worked really hard on that.” or “Wow, you used many colors in your picture. How vibrant!”

Don't forget the classical music among other babies' songs.

,
Play and talk to your baby often.,
Respond to every cry as quickly as you can and you will see that his/her cries will slowly disappear.

,
Be consistent and patient and especially don't overstimulate your baby--he/she will tell you when to stop.,
Work with your baby a little bit each day.",How to Increase Your Baby's Chances of Being Smart from Womb to Birth," This will help you to communicate with your beloved baby.;
, As your pregnancy progresses, your fetus will acquire more skills. He/she will be able to kick, move, see, hear, suck his/her thumb, have some taste selections for music and even food.

, At around the fifth month of pregnancy, your baby will be able to recognize your voice among other voices, so begin to talk to him/her as often as you can. Repeat his/her name several times, say to him/her that you love him/her and that you are waiting for him/her. You can even cuddle your tummy. You can say, for example: (Edwin, Edwin, I am your mum. I love you so much and I am waiting impatiently to see you.)

, It is proven that classical music helps in brain development.

, For the father, get your voice on a tape and let your baby hear your voice through putting ear phones on his/her mummy's tummy. This will help him/her feel secure, loved and waited for.

, You can even sing for him/her, tell him/her stories, etc...

, Do not use large pieces of loose clothing that could cause suffocation. A piece of his/her mummy's clothes (a scarf, for example) so the baby can get soothed when smelling his/her mother's scent.

,, Perhaps we all know about these things, but did you know that every single cuddle and/or each smile we give play a part in the brain stimulation? But how exactly do we actively stimulate our little ones in a more effective way?

, First, your baby will tell you when he/she will be ready to receive the stimulation. Choose a time when your baby has eaten, has been changed, and is calm.

, He/She will then be searching your eyes (especially the iris); he/she will keep that gaze for some seconds. As he/she grows, the gaze will be more intense and will also last longer.

, Put those toys and pictures in his/her crib and in the diaper changing area. This will help him/her focus more and strengthen his/her brain development.

,, Do a 'skin-to-skin' contact with him/her because this will give him/her a sense of warmth and confidence.

,, A little hint: If you see that your baby has loosened his/her gaze, has became irritated and is crying, stop the stimulation. You will have other opportunities throughout the day.

, 15 minutes a day can give you not only a smarter baby, but an astonishing grown up later on."

Solve problems in different ways.,
Allow children to explore their interests.,
Enroll your child in creative activities.,
Connect your child creatively with peers.,
Encourage multisensory learning.,
Make sure not to falsify your kids' theories unless it's absolutely necessary.,
Encourage all ideas and keep all comments positive.",How to Inspire Creativity in Your Kids2," Give your child a problem, and ask how to solve it. Then, ask your child to solve it in a different way. Emphasize the process and not the final product. Encourage many solutions to a problem and many routes to a solution.Ask your children to create a house, but be vague and say they can create anything they want. If they get stuck, say they can draw a house, build one out of popsicle sticks or cardboard. Encourage them to make a house in many ways, down to making a dog house or a doll house or a house for a friendly monster.

, You may really want your child to learn piano or be a ballerina, but let your child choose what activities interest him or her.The more freedom a child experiences in activities, the more flexibility in the child’s thinking.


Your child will naturally gravitate toward activities that he or she enjoys. Encourage the exploration of those activities.
Activities that can help inspire creativity include music, dance, drawing, sculpting, and painting.

, Have your child take classes such as painting, dancing, sculpting, or pottery. Art is especially helpful for children as it helps create and express the emerging personality.Choose activities that allow the child to learn basic skills, but also fill in the blanks with his or her own creativity.


Find classes at your local community center, park district, or private studio.
Allow your child to be creative on his or her own, and also in collaboration with other children.

, Learning with other children can be exciting and educational.Check out children’s clubs or after-school activities that allow the children to collaborate and create something together. Working together and allowing the creativity to flow with other children can result in lots of fun ideas and lots of learning.


Kids can create a dance, a song, a science project or a functional item like a boat.

, Get as many senses involved as possible in activities.Use movement, sound, texture, taste, and visual information. You can also play music in the background. One way to do multisensory learning is through learning a song with motions or a dance, or making up your own motions.


Play with clay. You can choose different colored clay with different textures. Practice saying the sounds that the clay makes when it is squished, and notice how it smells.
If you have an activity with only a few senses, imagine the others. You can ask questions about the senses, like “what sound do you think this could make?”

, If your kids tell you that the wind is made by the trees, tell them that it could be true, and ask what makes them think that. By allowing them to develop their own theories they can explore their own creativity! However, be careful not to make them think that their outlandish (and incorrect) theory is veritable fact; just point out that it’s a possibility.

, Stay positive in your feedback and most of all, encourage your child to be creative. If you find yourself thinking, “That could never happen” or “that idea will never work”, keep it to yourself and praise your child for thinking out of the box.


If your child wants to build a spaceship to travel to the moon, encourage the venture without saying “That’s impossible.” Help collect building materials and encourage your child to think of different ways to get to the moon.
If you have a hard time not putting down your child’s ideas, say, “That’s an interesting approach” or “I’ve never thought about that before.”

Provide good options for your kids.,
Coach your children through difficult decisions.,
Use hypothetical examples.,
Allow your child to learn from poor decisions.",How to Inspire Creativity in Your Kids3," Good decision-making skills can also help to inspire creativity in your kids. When your child has a decision in front of him or her, try presenting a few good options and asking your child to weight the benefits and downsides of each one.For example, if your child wants to get a treat in the grocery store, you might encourage him or her to choose between three healthy options, such as a granola bar, a bag of dried fruit, and a container of yogurt covered nuts.
Having good choices to choose from will ensure that your child makes a good choice while also allowing your child to imagine the benefits and downsides of each option. This process may help your child to develop his or her creativity.

, Encouraging your child to look at a problem from many angles can also encourage creativity. If your child has a tough decision to make, try sitting down with him or her and talk about the decision. Encourage your child to look at every option and to look at the pros and cons of these options.Don’t make the decision for your child, just help him or her to select the best choice by discussing options together and asking questions to encourage your child to think critically. For example, you might ask, ""What do you think that outcome of that decision would be?"" And, ""What benefits does this option have over the other options?""
You may also want to sit down with your child again after the decision has been made and talk about how it turned out and whether or not your child still thinks it was the best option. For example, you can ask something like, ""Knowing what you know now, would you still make the same decision? Why or why not?""

, Presenting your child with hypothetical moral dilemmas can also be a good way to help your child to build his or her decision making skills and nurture creativity at the same time. You can encourage your child to examine multiple possible decisions, consider the potential outcomes, and decide which one he or she would choose.For example, you might ask your child to imagine what he or she would do if a friend cheated on a test. Should your child tell on the friend? Confront the friend about cheating on the test? Or say nothing?
Encourage your child to look at the pros and cons of each hypothetical option. For example, what might be the positives of telling on a friend? What might be the negatives?

, It may be tempting to step in every time your child makes or is about to make a mistake, but your child will not learn anything if you do this. Instead, try to step back now and then and let your child make his or her own mistakes.What your child learns from these experiences will offer valuable lessons about decision-making and it may help to inspire your child’s creativity as well.


For example, if your child decides to use his or her free time after school playing video games instead of tackling a difficult homework assignment, then don’t interfere. Allow your child to deal with the consequences of that decision on his or her own.

Teach your child about the pros and cons of social media.,
Teach your child how to use privacy settings.,
Have them add your profile to their friends list.,
Keep computers in public areas.,
Designate times for technology-free activities.",How to Stop Social Media from Hurting Your Parenting1," Tell them that you understand why social media is appealing. Explain that it’s great for keeping up with friends and family and makes it easy to share positive information. Remind them that, despite these pros, social media poses risks, like oversharing, overusing, and cyberbullying.Say things like, “It’s great to feel connected to other people through social media, but talking to people face-to-face builds a stronger bond than texting or chatting online.”
Tell them, “Sharing too much information or posting too many photos, especially intimate photos, is dangerous. Never talk to strangers, share your location, or show people pictures of your body.”;
, Familiarize yourself with the privacy settings of whichever social media platforms your child uses. Go over the settings with them to show them how to ensure their privacy online.Make sure their profile picture, basic information, and “likes” are only visible to people they’ve added as friends. Instruct them only to add people that they already know.
Show them how to create privacy lists organized by categories like close friends and family, acquaintances, and teachers.

, Tell them that they have to add you in order to use social media. While it’s preferable to let them keep their password secret to encourage their sense of privacy, make sure you’re not blocked from seeing any content.Have them show you their privacy lists to ensure you’re not on a restricted list.

, Do your best from discouraging them from using laptops and phones in their bedrooms. Make it a rule that they can’t use technology behind closed doors.In addition to exposing your child to content that’s too mature for them, letting them use social media in their bedroom can interfere with their sleep. Consider having them turn their phone off at least an hour before bed. Either keep it in your possession or have them keep it in a common room of the house.

, Establish rules like “Everyone must turn their phones off during dinner,” or “No screen time within an hour of going to bed.” Set aside time during weeknights or weekends for technology-free family activities.Try having a weekly family game night in which no television and no phones are allowed. Consider making Saturdays or Sundays family days in which you do outdoor activities together, like bike riding around the neighborhood, hiking, or playing a sport together.

Limit your own screen time.,
Avoid posting too much about your child.,
Ask for your child's permission before posting.,
Don't let other parents' posts hurt your self esteem.,
Model real-world social behavior.,
Have regular conversations to build trust.",How to Stop Social Media from Hurting Your Parenting2," Maintaining a social media presence can help you monitor your child’s activities and help you stay connected with your own family and friends. However, you should model proper use of social media for your child.Try not to let your child see you with your eyes glued to your phone. When you’re having a conversation with them or anyone else, avoid pulling out your phone to check for texts, emails, or notifications.

, We all want to brag about our children, whether we post a picture of them after a sports victory or science fair win. However, sharing too much information about the ups and downs of parenting can interfere with your child’s sense of independence.Avoid posting about disagreements or difficulties you’re having with your child. Try not to post things like, “They are so stubborn about cleaning their room! They took such a tantrum when I asked them to pick up their things!”
If you do feel the need to ask for advice on social media, limit the post's privacy settings and leave out your child's name.

, When you do post information about or pictures of your child, ask them if it's okay to share. Most kids, especially teen, have strong feelings about controlling and curating their online identities. Try to limit posts to positive content that make both you and your child proud.Ask them, ""I really want to brag to my friends about you winning the spelling bee. Can I please post the picture of you with your trophy?"" It's natural to want to brag about your child, but do your best to limit how much you post.

, Try not to feel jealous or less capable when you see other parents' pictures of meals they've prepared or outfits their kids wear. Almost everyone carefully selects what they post on social media. Remember that you don't get a behind the scenes view of that seemingly perfect life.Your friend might post a couple pictures per week of elegant, healthy meals she prepared. However, she wouldn't post pictures of the fast food she buys or other not so photogenic realities. Try to stay positive and find inspiration in the images you see instead of letting seemingly perfect pictures hurt your self esteem.

, Kids have a more difficult time learning how to socialize and form emotional bonds when parents overuse social media.Show your child how to confidently interact with others in the real world. Try role playing with them to develop and maintain social skills.Teach them how to introduce themselves to others. Explain to them how to have conversations with people by asking questions, like “What are your favorite things to do?” or “What games do you like to play?”
Show them how to politely assert themselves by saying things like, “Hey this game looks fun! Can I play?” or “I don’t like being called that. You should call me by my name.”  

, Show your child firsthand how to bond with others through meaningful, face-to-face conversations. Regularly ask your child about their life, friends, school, and other relevant topics. Convey that you care about their interests, and that they can come to you for advice, for help with school, to vent, or just to chat.Turn your phones off or agree not to check them when you have a conversation.
If they give you one word answers, try to phrase questions specifically and in ways that encourage deeper responses. Try asking things like, “What was something new you learned in school today,” or “What did you do at practice today? Anything you want to work on more at home?”

Encourage your child to steer clear of popularity contests.,
Help your child overcome social media bullying.,
Deal with your child’s cyberbullying.,
Take their phone away only to punish phone-related misbehavior.",How to Stop Social Media from Hurting Your Parenting3," Counting likes, comments, and tags on social media is tempting for kids and adults alike. However, these popularity contests can lower self esteem.Tell your child, “Don’t keep score by counting your likes or comments. They don’t really mean anything or say anything about who you are.”

, Never hesitate to intervene if your child is the victim of cyberbullying. Tell them to avoid interacting with the bully, to block them, and that bullies just want to look cool in front of others. If you feel the situation might be harmful, talk to your child’s teacher, principal, or other authority figure.Tell them that there’s an issue with cyberbullying between your child and their peer. Show them screen shots or other forms of documentation. Ask them about disciplinary action or to keep an eye on the children at school.
If you feel the need to restrict their social media use or take away their phone, explain to them that it’s not a punishment. Say, “You’re not being punished, and you didn’t do anything wrong. But please trust that I have your best interests in mind and know that his is for your own good.”

, If your child has bullied others via social media, avoid responding by yelling at them or punishing them without explanation. Instead, teach them that bullying online is just as bad as bullying someone face-to-face.Try to understand why they feel the need to bully. Ask them, “Why did you feel the need to be mean? What if someone had said that to or about you?”
While you want to try to understand their point of view, you should be assertive about stopping the behavior. Calmly and firmly say, “Bullying in any form is unacceptable and it must stop.”

, At some point, you might consider taking your child’s phone away or otherwise restricting their social media use. You should restrict phone or social media privileges in response to related misbehavior, like accessing or posting inappropriate content, cyberbullying, or chatting on social media during a designated technology-free time.In general, punishments work best when they’re directly related to the behavior you’re trying to correct.
Avoid restricting phone or social media privileges away for something unrelated, like breaking curfew. If you do take their phone away, make sure to talk to them about the reason why to reinforce the lesson you want them to learn.

Set rules.,
Set your computer up somewhere where you can monitor use.,
Be logical.",How to Police Your Kids on the Internet1," Ensure that your children can't install anything on your home computer without parental permission; children may download harmful programs onto your computer because cybercriminals have disguised them as ""games"" or fun ""software"". Remind your children to never send personal information, such as phone numbers or addresses, to strangers. Make sure that your children are aware of which sites they are and aren't allowed to visit. Set a time limit for certain sites, and make sure that your children stick to that time limit.;
, Rather than allowing you children to have computers in their rooms, consider keeping computers in a communal place. This will allow you to cook dinner or read in the living room while keeping an eye on the sites they visit.

, While you want to protect your kids, you don't want to be overzealous. Keep a reasonable balance between protection and freedom, especially with older children and teenagers who might be more mature and cautious. The internet can be a wonderful place with many things to learn. For example, Myspace is a good way to keep in touch with old friends that had moved away and keep up with your schoolmates when you live far away from town. Your kid might have an opportunity to become ""known"" because of Myspace and it is good for home businesses. However, you must be a certain age to have an account on Facebook, Myspace, and any other social network that contains adult content and dialogue.

Revoke admin privileges from your children's accounts.,
Block all content that you deem inappropriate.,
Set time limits.,
Keep passwords a secret.",How to Police Your Kids on the Internet2," Only you and/or your spouse should have admin privileges on your children's computers; your children should be using standard user accounts. This reduces your children's ability to install potentially harmful programs, and makes it harder for them to circumvent your parental control measures., This can be done by investing in programs such as Net Nanny or using DNS servers that allow website blocking, but it is not necessary to spend money to do so.


If you'd like to block websites on your Mac, see How to Block a Website on a Mac

If you'd like to block websites on your Windows computer, see How to Block a Website in Windows


, For distracting but not necessarily inappropriate sites, set a time limit allowed per day. Using Firewall software, you enforce the rules you set by only allowing access to certain websites at certain time.

, Do not tell your kids the password get in to the computer. This will force them to have to ask you to log them in each time they wish to use it, meaning that you have a little more control over whether or not they do.

Decide which sites they can join.,
Create an email account for your child.,
Set up an account together.,
Turn on privacy settings.,
Look for inappropriate activity.,
Ask for their social media account passwords.,
Friend or follow your child.,
Communicate your expectations clearly.,
Set specific rules.,
Have the computer in an open place.,
Put passwords on devices.,
Refrain from checking their history.,
Use teachable moments.,
Gently address inappropriate content.,
Give them space.",How to Monitor Your Child's Social Media Use," Monitoring may start before your child even has a social media account. Figure out how to use the sites and become familiar with them. Decide whether your child is mature enough to use them responsibly. Some social media sites are geared toward adults, not children. Content may pop up that is not appropriate for your child, so make sure you give them a safe platform to use.For example, Yoursphere (a kids social network) is designed specifically for children’s safety and privacy.
Most social media websites have age restrictions upon sign-up. For Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat, and Pinterest, an individual must be 13 to get an account. YouTube has a minimum age requirement of 18, but someone 13 or older can sign up with permission from a parent. Vine and Tinder require a person to be 17 to hold an account.
You may want to set up your own account a few months in advance of letting your child set their account up. This will give you a chance to get a feel for the site and its daily happenings.;
, Many large providers for email allow children to have email addresses. You can help your young child create their own email address and adjust the settings to have all emails forwarded to you. This can help you monitor their communications and contacts through email.Children must be 13 or older in order to have a Google or Yahoo account.
Keep in mind that most communications between teens will happen through direct private messages on their social media account.

, Once your child is 13 or older and you’ve decided they are mature enough to have their social media account of choice, set it up together. Go through the site’s privacy settings and talk about why some things are okay to have and some are not. Monitoring what is originally put onto the page or website is an important part of keeping your child safe from the onset.Setting up an account together means that you know all the content that is going on your child’s page, what the web address is, and how to access it.
Make sure your child knows not to change their content or privacy settings without your consent and make the consequences for doing so clear if they do.

, While you’re sitting down and talking about the settings, toggle some off. Turn off features like “geotagging” on photos or posts, which shows your child’s location. Adjust the setting so that all posts are private (shared with friends or connections only) and not public.For example, it’s not appropriate to include the child’s phone number, email address, or address.
As you adjust these settings, make sure your child understands why it’s important to keep some things private.

, Keep your eyes out for inappropriate photos, disrespectful language, bullying, or words or images meant to hurt or offend others. Make sure no pictures or text endorse illegal activity such as drinking, smoking, or doing drugs. Also make sure that your child knows that sending nude photos can be considered as distributing child pornography, and they may be prosecuted for it. You may want to check your child’s friends or connections to make sure they are not being preyed on or speaking with someone who might hurt them.Depending on how much content you are monitoring, check their messages to make sure they are not sharing private information (like their phone number or address) with strangers. Notice who their friends are and where they know them from.

, With a younger child, you may wish to have their passwords and check on their activity. This can help keep them accountable for engaging in sexually inappropriate behavior, sharing inappropriate photos or personal information, or perpetuating cyberbullying. As your child develops and matures, you may back off more and give them more independence and trust.Be sure to let them know what they have done to earn your trust and why they are being rewarded with more privacy. Let them know what consequences they can expect if they violate you trust as well.


There’s no hard and fast rule for when it’s appropriate to have your child’s passwords and when it is not. Use your discretion to assess your child’s risk.

, One way to monitor your child’s activity in a less invasive way than having their passwords is to friend or follow them. Just like you monitor your child’s television, this is one way to monitor their activity on social media. Tell children that what they post now might seem harmless, but it could have a negative impact on their future.Be aware of your child’s activity. For example, some children use a different account so that parents cannot see their posts. Set up a Google alert with your child’s name to see any new activity through your Google account.

, It’s ultimately up to you what sites you let them join, how much information they can share, and how much time they spend on social media. Be firm in what expectations you have and what consequences exist if they break a rule or do something behind your back. If your child has a smartphone, set clear boundaries for its use.Let them know how you will keep them accountable; don’t sneak around and check on them.
Consider writing a behavior contract that clearly states what is and is not allowed regarding social media, especially on your child’s cellphone.

, Clearly define what your child can and cannot do on social media, and post them somewhere that your child will see them often. It’s best to do this before they set up an account. However, you can do it after if your child already has a profile. For example, tell them that they cannot “friend” anyone they do not know and that it is never okay to share their password with anyone.Talk about potential dangers of social media. You may want to share scary stories with your children. While this may be uncomfortable, it’s beneficial for them to know that dangers are ever-present and that it’s important for them to be safe., Consider not allowing computer or cellphone usage in your child’s bedroom. Only allow your child to interact with social media in an open and more public location in your home. Putting the family computer somewhere public like the living room or kitchen will help you casually keep tabs on your child’s activity without being entirely invasive.For example, allow your children to use the computer when another person is present in the room.
If you allow your child their own laptop or tablet, set certain parameters for use and remind them that using it is a privilege, not a right.

, Whether it’s a computer, laptop, tablet, or cellphone, have a password for each device in your home. This way, your kids have to come to you if they want to use it. This is especially helpful for younger children. If your children must come to you for permission, you can know each time they use the device and for how long they use it.Children will undoubtedly try to guess your passwords, so make sure it’s something you can remember yet your children will not guess correctly.

, While it’s important to set up social media boundaries for your child, be cautious and less hands-on with older children. They may interpret heavy monitoring as an invasion of their privacy and begin to resent you. Older children want to be trusted and have some privacy from their parents.However, it is also important to show an interest in them, show them respect, and be approachable to discuss tough topics. Nurture your relationship with them outside of social media. Be sure to give them some space when it comes to monitoring their social media usage as well. Communicate your trust in their good judgment. Remember, your child’s desire for privacy does not necessarily mean that they are hiding something.Don’t listen in to phone conversations or access their accounts in a sneaky way. If you’re worried about your child’s activity, ask them about it first.
If you feel strongly about monitoring usage, have routine phone checks to assess usage. Don’t spring a check on your older child.

, No amount of monitoring can keep all children safe at all times. If your child does experience cyberbullying or received sexual messages, use the experience to teach them about internet safety. Remind them to protect their identity with strangers and maintain their reputation both online and offline.For example, if your child is being bullied online, show empathy and give them support. Then, give them tools to deal with the bullying, such as blocking the person, calling another child’s parents, or reporting the content. Reiterate the importance of respect when online.

, If you notice an inappropriate photo, bring it up to your child. Tell them why it’s inappropriate and request them to delete it off of their social media account. For example, let your child know that sexually suggestive photos are not appropriate for a teenager and may actually be dangerous in the wrong hands.Say, “I noticed a picture that’s not appropriate on your social media account. I don’t think you meant anything bad with it, but it makes me nervous for other people to see that photo of you. Please remove it.”
If your child has distributed child pornography, take this seriously. Even if they meant no harm, it’s important to handle the situation in the appropriate way by alerting authorities and not spreading the images any further.

, It’s easy for parents to be curious or worried about their child and sneak onto their account to check on them. However, recognize when you need to back up or give your child more privacy. You want to protect them from harm, yet don’t encroach on their right to privacy. This can damage your relationship and push them away.Ask your teen what freedoms they would like and find a compromise that you can live with. If your child is upset by your restrictions, communicate why you create restrictions and what you hope they will do to keep your child safe.
If you’re giving your child more space, have some trial periods where they can prove that they can be trusted and not break rules.
If you are unsure about how to strike a good balance, then you may want to speak with a mental health professional for some guidance.

Know what to look for.,
Explore your main options:


The inbuilt parental controls in Windows or Apple Mac.,
Install parental controls as soon as your kids begin to use a PC, and every time you buy a new PC or smartphone – it's your commitment to them!,
Make sure they can't interfere with the software!!,
Discuss and be honest.,
Be conservative at first.,
Remember the age of your kids matters - but not in the obvious way!",How to Pick the Best Parental Controls," Your ideal parental control software should allow you to the following:


Block websites on a set of criteria you choose, for example, sex, violence, or drugs;
Whitelist useful sites such as WikiHow or Wikipedia
Provide you with a monitoring function;
Be extremely hard to circumvent for even the most technical of teens;
Allow you to manage access across different devices, including PCs and Smartphones
Allow you block internet access at set times, for example after bedtime
Work across social media, for example by not permitting chats with people that you don't know and
Have good technical support.;
, These are free products and implemented within the computer. However, they're not as flexible as standalone products and obviously work only on Windows or Mac - not on other devices. Rapid bug fixing may not be a priority for companies which may have bigger fish to fry
Parental control addons within web browsers such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. These are free, but they give you no real advantage over other solutions, They are also much easier to circumvent
Standalone software options. This is probably your best choice. Unfortunately, they're usually not free - there will be an annual fee to pay. On the plus side, they're more customisable than free products (you get what you pay for after all). For example, some allow you to block on over a dozen criteria, including sex, pornography, adult, drugs, guns, suicide, abortion etc. They are also less tied into the Windows or Mac system. Products which charge often offer trial versions so you can experiment and compare on your own PC before making your decision.Norton Family, however, does have a free edition.Qustodio has a free edition for Android smartphones

, Be aware that teenagers often hate this sort of software even though it's for their own protection, and so you don't want to have to argue about installing it when they have always been used to unlimited access.

, The internet is full of pages on how to do this, but properly installed software is almost impossible to remove;


Always give kids and teens a separate account on the house PC, and on their own laptop when they have one too. You then install parental controls for their account. You then have a separate administrator account with full access. As your teenagers then have a standard Windows user account and not an administrator one, it is much harder for them to interfere with the parental control software as access to key settings requires your password.
Lock down your computer's BIOS so that it cannot boot from USB or CD, and password protect the BIOS. This blocks attempts from very techy teens to boot from another operating system
These steps also provide extra protection against downloading viruses or malware.

, Make sure they understand why they have this – that it's for their protection and does not mean that you do not trust them. Promise that you will be content with blocking, and that you will not use the monitoring capability to spy on them – and be sure to keep that promise.


This is why you should avoid so-called stealthware programs such as eBlaster which operates silently in the background. With no blocking you are forced to spy on your teenagers' online behaviour – which explodes the trust relationship between you. Parental controls should be open visible and honest.

, Many parental control companies provide sample age-related profiles and it makes sense to try the one just below your kids/teens age group. But regularly review how things are going. Even the best software may inadvertently block useful sites and so you need to be able to whitelist them on request. Listen to well-founded complaints about it being too restrictive and consider what to do. Be prepared to make it less restrictive – but do not negotiate on the principle that the software is necessary for their own good.


Do not begrudge the time you spend doing this – discussing online usage and pitfalls is part of their education, and if you keep administrative control of their PC then you will need to add software for them anyway when required.

, When you are configuring restrictions, remember that the group most at risk of online abuse are teenage girls, because they spend more time on line, and want to experiment – and are the natural target of unpleasant people. It follows that they need parental control software most of all, even though they may not think so.

, If the computer your child is using has a camera or webcam, a computer Trojan can sometimes turn the camera on without you knowing, allowing the person at the other end to watch everything.

, Keeping in mind that most child-oriented website chatrooms are the equivalent of fun penpal style exchanges, you can take a few moments to check out the chatroom to see if it's suitable or not. Steer children to sites or chat areas that are safer for children, including those with regular adult staff monitoring of children's chatter and strict rules and enforcement on giving out private information.


Help your kids to find suitable chat forums online. The aim is to find ones monitored regularly by adults, rather than a mere program picking up offensive words.

, Contact your internet service provider and let them know of your concerns, along with any facts to back up what you're saying. If you're very concerned, you might also consider contacting the police.

Make sure to have a discussion about the dangers of cyber predators and why she should never meet strangers she meets online.;
, Talk to your child about what rules you have concerning social media. These rules can include anything you are concerned about.Examples include:


Not allowing your child to post about where they are.
Not allowing your child to post any personal details.
Limiting the amount or kinds of photos your child posts.
Setting an amount of time your child can spend on social media.
Restricting which social media sites your child can become a member of.

, You don’t just need to worry about predators finding your child. You need to discuss with your child how to keep herself safe from herself. Posting embarrassing, questionable, or inappropriate pictures can cause potential colleges and employers to reject her. Posting status updates that are rude, offensive, or questionable can also come back to haunt her later.Make sure to discuss with your child that once she puts something on social media, it is out in the world and difficult to remove or take back.

Friend or follow your child.,
Allow your child the right amount of privacy.,
Have a shared computer.,
Make sure global location settings are off.,
Learn text language.",How to Protect Your Kids on Social Media2," All social media sites have minimum age requirements to be able to sign up for an account. These ages are put into place to protect the privacy of children and young people. Make sure not to allow your child to have a social media account when she is younger than the required age. When she reaches the minimum age, decide if you feel she is old enough.For Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat, and Pinterest, a person must be 13 to get an account. Although YouTube requires a person to be 18, someone who is 13 can sign up with parental permission.
Vine and Tinder require a person to be 17 to hold an account.

, When your child has a social media account, friend or follow that account. Talk to her about which sites she is using, and if you don’t understand how the site works, have your child explain it to you. This can help you monitor what your child is doing online and who she is talking to.Your child might have social media sites you don’t know about. Browse through downloaded apps on her phone or watch which apps she’s using to see what social media sites she is a member of.
Be aware some social media sites have options that allow members to choose who sees the posts. You child might be following or friended with you, but they could filter the post so you can’t see it.
You also might be able to see what her interests are or if something is wrong with you child by reading her posts.

, As your child grows up, you want to give her privacy and trust her. This means not going behind her and checking on everything she does. However, you should keep an eye on what your child does online.When younger teens get social media sites, make sure to get passwords for the sites. This can help you watch over their online activities. For older teens, you may allow them more privacy by letting them have their own private passwords.
Check internet history. This will show you what sites your teen has been visiting. You can also check your child’s phone. However, this may cause a problem with your child if she believes you are invading her privacy and not trusting her. Use your judgment for how often and when you check these things. You may hold checking internet and phone histories for when your child gives you a reason to not trust her or believe her privacy is at risk.
You can also install apps such as Net Nanny or WebWatcher. Your child will never know these apps are on the computer, and they will alert you to things that may jeopardize the safety of your child., Another way to keep your child safe on social media is to have a shared computer. This means the child doesn’t have her own laptop in her room where she can hide what she does from you. Instead, she uses the computer in a central location in the house where you can monitor what she does., To protect your child, turn off the location settings. Location settings allow social media sites to add the location of the person when she posts a photo or an update. By turning this off, it helps people from not knowing exactly where you child is or places she frequents often.Location settings may post the city that the person is in, the name of restaurant or store, or even the address.

, Social media, text, and sexting have their own language. Knowing some of the language, or know where to look up acronyms, may help you really know what your child is talking about. Sexting particularly has its own language, and parents should be aware of this so they can address the situation if it arises."

Use privacy settings.,
Avoid using GPS tagging.,
Refrain from friending strangers.,
Take caution with the information you share.,
Post smaller pictures.,
Refrain from posting pictures of other children.",How to Protect Your Kids on Social Media3," If you have a social media account, you probably want to share photos of your children. You do this because you love them and are proud of them. But sharing photos of your children might be putting them at risk. When you share photos of your kids, use the privacy settings for the photos so you can control who sees your photos.Use settings to allow only the people you follow to see your photos. You can also set custom privacy settings, where you choose who you want to see the photos.
You may also consider making your entire social media account private so you will know who sees your information.

, Your child is not the only one who needs to turn off location settings. You should also turn off location settings when you post pictures of your child. By keeping the location of your child off of social media, you protect her from potential predators., Social media is used to meet new friends, and some people even use it to play games with strangers. If you post pictures of your child or talk about her, refrain from friending people you don’t know. Don’t accept friend requests from people you don’t know. You never know if someone is a predator or not.Talk to your child about accepting friend requests from strangers. Encourage her to never friend strangers.

, People often overshare on social media. This includes details about their children. You should never give away personal details, such as your child’s full name, the school she attends, her birthday, or other details. These things may seem benign, but put your child at risk., If you want to post pictures, make sure to post pictures at a lower resolution. This can help reduce the risk of someone printing it out or enlarging it.If you are really concerned about people stealing photos of your child, place a watermark on your photos.

, When your child has a party or a sleepover, make sure to never post pictures of other people’s children. Only post photos of your own child. If you want to post photos from a party with someone’s child in it, make sure to discuss that with that parent first."

Use your judgment.,
Set rules now.,
Talk about inappropriate content.,
Toggle parental controls.,
Be upfront.",How to Monitor Your Child's Smartphone Use1," There’s no ‘one size fits all’ approach to monitoring your child. What may work for one child may not work for another. For this reason, think about what may become a danger for your teen. If you’re worried they may sneak off, you might want to track their location. If you’re concerned about the people they are talking to online, you might want to track their emails or texts. If you’re concerned about them taking inappropriate photos and sharing them, monitor their photos and camera use.You may monitor different things with two teenage children.;
, It’s difficult to backtrack on rules you set up for your teen. Do some research and think about what rules you want to put in place before buying the phone. That way, both you and your teen will be in agreement before it is purchased. If they do not agree to the rules, then they do not get a phone.You may want to put rules into writing so that they can be easily referenced. Alternatively, consider making the rules with your children so that you can more readily make rules they're more likely to follow.
Even if your child buys a phone with their own money, explain that you are still responsible for them and their activity. For this reason, rules must be in place.

, Before your child starts playing with their phone, have a serious discussion about posting, sharing, commenting or endorsing inappropriate content. This might include inappropriate photos, rude, racist, or homophobic comments, or participating or endorsing illegal activity such as drinking, doing drugs, or smoking. Let your child know that even joking about these things in a comment or thread can lead to serious consequences.Make sure you child knows there are potential long-term consequences for actions they take on their phone. For example, police may get involved if there is an inappropriate photo shared or comment made that is illegal, and this can affect their future work or college experience.
You may also want to remind them that nothing online is truly private. What they put online can stay there forever for others to see, so teach them to always exercise caution and respect when online.

, Many smartphones have restrictions or parental controls in the settings. Before handing a smartphone to your child, get familiar with the parental controls and decide which ones are appropriate. Parental controls can restrict certain applications such as the camera and web browser. You can make changes to the privacy settings, including location and social media, installing or deleting applications, and even limiting the volume control. These settings can restrict your child from making purchases or downloading certain content.Most parental controls are only accessed through a password. Make sure your child cannot easily guess the password-- they will surely try!

, If you choose to monitor your teen’s activity, don’t do so privately. Let them know that you are monitoring them. You may want to tell them exactly what features you are monitoring and why you are doing it. If you monitor their smartphone without them knowing, they may feel betrayed once they find out, and they will likely find out one way or another.


Before giving them the phone tell them that you will be monitoring it so that they will stay safe.

Choose what applications they can use.,
Buy a monitoring program.,
Toggle location settings.,
Deal with their social media accounts.,
Look for inappropriate activity.",How to Monitor Your Child's Smartphone Use2," It’s important to do a little research before you allow your child to download applications and use them. For one, know what the age limits are for certain apps or social media sites. If you know an application may be risky or dangerous, do not allow your child to download it. If they do want to download an application, have them state their reasons why they’d like to use it and any potential dangers it may have.


Most social media websites restrict young children from registering. A child must be 13 or older to use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat, and Pinterest. YouTube’s age requirement is 18, but if a child is 13 or older they can sign up with parental permission.
Yoursphere (a kids social network) is designed specifically for children’s safety and privacy.

, You can purchase tools to monitor your child’s phone activity from your own phone or computer. These programs tend to be extensive in the information you can see, so adjust what content on your child’s cell phone you want to monitor. If you have multiple children with a cell phone, many programs allow customization for up to five cell phones.Some programs let you log on to check activity, while others also allow you to set up alerts to your child’s activity.

, Some parents may want all location services turned off to protect their child’s privacy. This can keep applications from sharing their location or disallowing “checking in”. Others parents, however, may want to use software to track where their child is at a given time. If you’re concerned your child says they’re going one place yet are suspicious you are going somewhere else, this application can be helpful for confirmation.Do some research for providers that offer location tracking. You can find a web-based program or look into applications on your own phone that can track another phone.

, Decide how you will handle their social media accounts. You may choose to not let them install social media applications on their phone and only let them use social media on the family computer. Decide what accounts they are allowed to have and as always, toggle the security settings to protect their privacy.


For a younger child or for a child who may be at a higher risk, have their social media passwords so that you can monitor their activity. As they get older or more mature, you may wish to relax your rules.Friend or follow your child on their social media accounts. This is a step down from having their passwords, yet still allows you to see what they’re doing and posting. However, beware if your child sets up a different or secret account that you do not follow., If you’re monitoring your child’s phone, look out for any inappropriate content. This can occur over social media or messaging applications. Inappropriate content can occur in comments, posts, emails, texts, or photos. It can also be an image your child shares. If your child posts something inappropriate, have them remove it right away. If necessary, have them apologize to anyone who may have been hurt.If your child posts something illegal (such as a nude photo), do not share it or spread it in any way. Contact the police right away.

Specify their use.,
Establish time limits.,
Decide whether devices are allowed in their bedrooms.,
Create “technology free” zones.,
Adjust the rules when necessary.",How to Monitor Your Child's Smartphone Use3," Especially for young children, decide when they are allowed to use a smartphone. Are they forbidden from using it until their homework is done? Can they bring it to school? Do they need to hand the phone off to you when it’s time for bed? Create parameters around when it is okay for them to use a smartphone and when it is not.For example, set a rule for no texting or entertainment until homework is completed.

, If you fear your child may become absorbed in their phone, set time limits for their cellphone use. Don’t buy an unlimited plan and instead, opt for limited texts, calls, and data. That way, they will know when they’ve used up their plan and will use it more sparingly.Under parental controls, turn certain applications on or off depending on how long your child is allowed to use them. For example, turn games on only after your child is home from school and has completed their homework and chores.

, If you’re trying to keep an eye on their activity, it’s hard to do if they’re in their room, especially past their bedtime. Some children engage in inappropriate activity and often do so when they are alone in their bedrooms. Safeguard your child from potential predators or unsafe situations by not allowing a cell phone in their bedroom.Knowing that your eye is on them can help kids stay away from unsafe sites or people.
Try creating areas where they need to leave their phones at certain times, such as before going to bed. You may ask them to leave their phones to charge in the kitchen at night, for example.

, Have certain rooms where cell phones or tablets are not allowed. For example, don’t allow any family members to bring technology to the dinner table. Have one room where your family spends time together and specify that cell phones are not allowed in that room.When your family does activities together, request that children either do not bring cell phones or limit their use.

, What worked for your then-9-year-old may not work for your now-15-year-old. Be flexible and willing to adjust the rules as your teen becomes more mature and/or wants more freedom. Start with strict rules for young children then loosen them up over time. Reward their good behavior or show them your trust with more freedom.This is especially useful for older teens who will attend college or get a full-time job soon and need to learn personal responsibility.

Be careful not to pick a trendy name, if it is too trendy, it may become overused , out of style and no longer preppy.;
, A true prep attends prep school. End of story. Make sure you look into several schools, and take your child's opinion into account, too. You may want to consider sending them to boarding school for high school, or even junior high. In some states, such as Minnesota, you can consider sending your child into college early with the Post Secondary Enrollment Option, which gives them a head start for more advanced college at a younger age or you may consider taking college classes in high school. It's a wonderful experience, and will prepare them for college nicely. Outside of school, teach them useful languages such as French, Latin, and Spanish from an early age(about seven years old, the younger the better). Always make sure they do their homework, but don't hover over them. It will be a catalyst for a child and his or her rebellion.

, Understated clothing make the biggest mark. Polo shirts, oxfords, khaki anything, and lots of grosgrain ribbons. Don't lay out their outfits for them past age, but suggest these things, and take them shopping in stores such as Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Tommy Hilfiger, Brooks Brothers, Vera Bradley, J.Crew, Martha LeWren, etc.

, If your child wants to develop his or her own style, allow them to pick a few items from the store of their choice., Teach them to wash their faces and brush their teeth at least twice a day, shower every morning, and keep their hair nice. It really is important, and developing these skills early on will save both you and your children a lot of trouble later on. Do not make fun of brand names lesser than the items you purchase usually, you want to be an example for your child.

, Make sure they are always polite, always say 'please' and 'thank you', always have good table manners, etc. In addition to the proper manners... Teach your children how to be friendly, outgoing, and bubbly. Make sure they socialize with other children, and make lots of friends. However, even if someone is not in their inner circle, teach them to respect them anyway.

, Choose places such as Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod,The Hamptons, and Sun Valley. Take lots of pictures, and try out lots of activities while you are there. Preppy childhood memories are essential.

, Try to sign your children up for at least one of the following sports per season; Field Hockey, Lacrosse, Golf, Tennis, Soccer, Swim, Crew, etc. The Ivy Leagues love well-rounders, and they need to stay healthy and fit.

, In addition to sports, sign your children up for some other extra curricular activity, anything they are interested in. Instruments , Debate Teams, Recycling clubs, The Arts , anything that will make them a well rounded child in the future. Let your child develop skills on their own time, leave a piano or a violin in the house with music notes, have art supplies stacked into the house but do not push them toward it. Your child will more than likely gravitate to this pieces from curiosity. The more well-rounded, the better, and they can make lots of friends by doing things after school.

, Having preppy children, does not mean having spoiled children who depend on their parents for everything , money , clothing etc. Have your child get a job to enforce the meaning of responsibility and good work aesthetics. Clothing stores , cafes , tutoring for both males and females are great places for a teenager to get a job.

Allow Free Play.,
Let them go out and play.,
Invite friends.",How to Keep Kids Busy with No TV," There have been hundreds of studies on the link between exposure to violence (on TV or within a game) and violent behavior. Most of the studies answered: yes, the link is there. According to the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics): ‘Extensive research evidence indicates that media violence can contribute to aggressive behavior, desensitization to violence, nightmares, and fear of being harmed.’ An average American child will see 200,000 violent acts and 16,000 murders on TV by age 18... None of us wants to see our children or our loved ones depressed, obese, in front of computers or TV screens at all times, having behavioral problems, being sick, or experiencing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the rhythm of our lives and our day-to-day habits that allow the TV to rule might damage our mental health.;
, If you are spending the time with people you really care about, you might want to re-consider the habit of having your TV on, and reaching for your mobile phone at all times. Learn to actively listen to your loved ones, it is a beautiful skill.

, This is your 'family' time. Make sure that you eat and/or prepare at least one meal per day together as a family. Time together is full of wonders. You could spend time cooking, playing, talking, walking together. You could sing, dance, do art together, or explore learning a new language. There is plenty of time and mental space that you will gain with no TV time.

, There should be a balance between time spent alone and time spent with friends. Time spend alone is an important time where a child learns to entertain itself through writing, reading, beading, singing, dancing. learning a new skill, this is a time for music, time for silence, art time. These are all structured activities, done at home.

, There should exist a balance around time spent in a structured activity and time spent in a free play. Allow your children an opportunity of free play. Let them experiment, challenge the existent, and stay curious exploring new games. Do not invent new toys and new games for them at all times. Let their imagination become the driving force. The child with the room full of toys is no longer able to focus, because of visual and mental clutter. Whatever is in his or her hands will not be enough, because the other toy is also reachable. The toys are today made to be perfect, so they do not allow for the expansion of imagination. Different alternative schools such as Montessori and Waldorf suggest that early toys should be hand-made and without specific features, ie. a doll without a face, a ball made of cloth, etc, so that children’s imagination can work its wonder. Perfect toys do the job instead of children, stopping them from the exploration game.

, There should be a subtle balance between time spent indoors and time spent outdoors. Children get fascinated with gardens and ‘green’ grounds. Outdoors create a golden opportunity to run, to breath, and to learn outside of the ‘box’. Children who learn to enjoy the outdoors will become adults who enjoy hiking, gardening, jogging, bicycling, adults that take care for animals and plants and protect the environment. Using 'outdoors' we help children fulfill some basic childhood needs: racing, yelling, hiding, experimenting, a need for freedom and adventure and an opportunity to explore the unknown.

, Children need lots of opportunities with friends to develop their basic social skills and the whole range of social competencies. Children learn both cognitively and intuitively, observing the subtle inner relationships within nature and between people. Playing with friends, kicking the ball, playing hide-and-seek, or run aimlessly, are all keys to growing creative and inspired children.

Wait until your child is at least 13.,
Determine if your child will be honest about online interactions.,
Check that they follow your other established rules.",How to Know if Your Child Is Ready for Social Media1," According to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, it is illegal for social media websites to collect data from anyone under 13. Many children can easily bypass these parental consent hurdles by using a fake birthdate or email address.Bypassing these rules may indicate to your child that lying is acceptable. This could send a negative message to your child.

Children between ages 7 and 11 are still learning how to think of hypothetical situations. This may make it difficult for them to accurately describe what they would do if someone left a mean or inappropriate comment on an Instagram photo.Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Snapchat, and Pinterest require that a person be at least 13 to sign up.
You must be 18 to sign up for YouTube, but a child who is 13 or older can sign up with parental permission.Dating websites like Tinder and OkCupid require a person to be 18 or older to hold an account.;
, Each child matures at a different rate, which makes it difficult to pinpoint the proper age to open a social media account. However, if you are able to have honest conversations with your child, that may indicate that they are ready to use social media. A child that is mature enough to come to you with a problem will most likely feel comfortable asking you for help if they have a negative experience online.Does your child come to you if they are having trouble in school? Are they honest about their test scores? Do they talk to you about problems they’re having with a friend? If yes, you and your child most likely have a comfortable, healthy line of communication.

, An emotionally mature child will be respectful of other rules in the house, like completing their chores or doing their homework. If they are able to follow these rules and others regarding the use of the family computer, video games, and other electronic devices, that may indicate that they are mature enough to have a social media account."

, It's your job to monitor the amount of time your children are on the Internet, or to purchase a program that can log out after set times.

, If the home page or even the address makes you uncomfortable, it is probably not appropriate. Check it out yourself, review it and rate it according to your beliefs about what your kids should or should not interact with. Block it if needed.

, They will usually summarize a lot of the features of the site. This can help you to understand the purpose of the site and its suitability for your kids.

, Chat rooms and blogs are usually very risky even if they are designated for kids. Predatory persons can target unwary and gullible children who take them at face value. It can be easier to simply ban it. Moreover, chatting can become a very bad addiction that is hard to control in tweens and early teens, especially when they become rebellious towards you.

, Keep the computer in an open area where everyone can monitor its use. Check the history of what has been viewed and review anything suspicious.

, Incentives can include full pocket money, a visit somewhere, a new pair of jeans, etc. for sticking with the rules. For breaking or side-stepping the rules, reduce the pocket money, cancel the outings, and ban them from using the Internet for periods of time.

, Don't accuse your kids gung-ho. Sites get visited easily enough by accident through the mere click of a URL link. If they say they just clicked on it once, take this at face value but monitor future visits; if it happens again, then you'll see a pattern develop and can block the visiting or talk to them about it further.

Even if your child is ready to use social media, it is beneficial to remind them that their actions online have real-world consequences.If they are upset about a test score or something that happened at school, remind them that social media is not the place to share that information.

, Let your child know that they are only permitted to use social media and other devices, like their cell phone, for a set amount of time and in certain situations.

Reading aloud is also a nurturing activity that creates a bond between you and your child.
If your child develops a love of reading when young, they are more likely to enjoy reading as they get older., As you read, describe the pictures. Ask your child what they see and what does it mean. At the end of the story, ask your child what the story meant and what they liked about the story.Allow your child to turn the pages of the book.
Try to connect parts of the story to your child. For example, if the character in the book has a bicycle, you may say, “you like to ride your bike just like ___.”
You can also provide explanations that are not in the book. If one of the characters laughs, you may say, “She was laughing because she was very happy.”

, Read books that would be difficult for your child to read independently. Discuss words that are new and interesting. Try to relate those words to your child’s life and give examples.If your child is old enough, ask them to come up with a way to use the word.
Try to use the word in your daily life or challenge your child to use the word as many times as possible during the day., If your child can read on their own, encourage them to read. Children who read have larger vocabularies than children who do not.Reading does not have to be exclusive to books. Magazines, newspapers, and any other items your child is interested in should be read as well.


Encourage your child to keep a dictionary nearby and look up words that are unfamiliar.

Place computers with Internet access in a central location in the home.,
Get rid of the webcam.,
Decide what online activities are age appropriate.,
Discuss online behavior rules with your child.,
Invest in monitoring and filtering software.,
Keep a close eye on behavior.,
Be aware of the warning signs that something is wrong.,
Talk to your child.,
Remember that your job is to keep your kids safe, not to be their best friend.",How to Keep Your Children and Teens Safe Online," When computers are in a central location, they can be easily monitored, but if placed in private places such as bedrooms, children can quickly close inappropriate websites when they hear their parents coming.

, Webcams can be a great way to communicate with your friends and family, but leaving a teen unsupervised with a webcam can lead to your child’s strip show debut.

, Chat rooms, instant messaging, and websites such as YouTube, Myspace, and even Yahoo can be particularly dangerous for anybody under the age of 16. Any place where your child can be contacted privately by strangers is a potential lurking ground for predators. However, instant messaging and Myspace has become a popular form of communication. A reasonable compromise may be to allow your child to instant message/Myspace only people that they know in real life, and not new internet friends.

, Write them down clearly and post them near the computer as a reminder. Instead of threatening your child that breaking the rules will mean that they must go to time-out, tell your child that breaking the rules will mean they lose internet privileges. Be clear about what your child can and cannot do online and be sure to emphasize the importance of keeping personal information private. Children should never tell anyone online their address, phone number, full name, school name or show anyone pictures of themselves.

, There are programs that can help you monitor your child’s activities and block inappropriate websites. However, be aware that these programs do not replace a watchful parent and can easily be disabled by computer savvy teens.

, Check your browser history frequently. Finding that the browser history has been cleared may be a sign that your child has been up to something they shouldn’t. Check your child’s favorites. Visit the websites they visit and see what it’s like for yourself.

, If your child quickly closes programs whenever you walk into the room or becomes very secretive about what they do online they are sending up a huge red flag that they are doing something they shouldn’t. Be especially wary if your child begins receiving phone calls that they are secretive about or starts receiving gifts in the mail from people you don’t know.

, This is probably the most important step. Talk to your child about internet safety and what can happen when people are not careful online. If your child goes online this is just as important as talking about smoking and drug use. Keep talking about it even if you think your child is being safe. Ask them about what they do online, who they talk to, what they saw. Show interest in what they do.

, They might be angry at you for restricting their actions online, but it’s worth it.

Be prepared.,
Review problem-solving skills.,
Work through examples.,
Make it engaging.,
Take a break.,
Be patient.",How to Improve Your Child's Poor Homework Performance1," It will be easier for you to provide help with your child’s homework if you know what they are working on.This way you can review any concepts you aren’t familiar with beforehand. You can also gather any supplies and materials that will be needed to complete their homework.


If possible, review their assignments or agenda so that you’ll know what they are learning in each class.
Complete sample problems and skim over text to get comfortable with the materials. For instance, do the first problem on their math work to make sure you get it.
Look through their notes and textbooks, or Google anything you aren’t familiar with. For example, if they’re studying mitosis, do a quick search to get an overview of it.;
, Instead of offering answers when you help with homework, encourage your child to show you how they would solve the problem.This will improve their homework performance by giving your child the opportunity to review material and practice problem-solving skills.


For example, if your child is stumped on a geography question, ask ""Where could you find the answer? Do you think a map will help? What about your textbook?""
Tell your child to show you how to work through what they can of the problem. Sometimes kids know more than they realize and can finish all or most of a problem.
For example, “This one is challenging. Show me how you would start. What would you do next?”
It’s also teaching your child to problem solve if you say, “I don’t know how to do this one either. Why don’t we look it up? Where do you think we should start?”

, Instead of doing the work for your child, you can help them with their homework if you create and walk through some examples.Doing similar work helps your child understand how to do the assignment. The extra examples also give your child extra practice which can help improve their homework performance.


For math work, recreate a problem from the homework assignment by changing one or two of the numbers.
For instance, if the problem says (8b+5)(4b -2), you could change it to (9b+5)(6b-2). The steps for solving the problem are the same, only the numbers change.
Show them how you would skim a text by using a magazine article or book you are reading.

, Sometimes all it takes to improve a child’s poor homework performance is a little fun.Adding a hands-on element can help your child understand difficult concepts or solve challenging problems.


Draw pictures, graphs, or charts to help explain events, story plots, or word problems. For example, you could draw a diagram of the water cycle to review it.
If it’s math homework, use candy, beans, or other objects for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems.
Allowing younger students to use things they don’t normally get to use like highlighters, paper clips, and sticky notes can engage them in homework.
For example, highlighting the main idea of the paragraph is fun for your child, but also reinforces their understanding of what they read.

, Working for hours non-stop on homework and studying can be frustrating and overwhelming for young and older children. Encouraging your child to take a break can help give them a chance to de-stress and re-energize.Take a 10-15 minute break after every hour of homework. Adjust the time of the break as needed to suit your specific child.
Stand up and stretch or take a quick walk. Physical activity can help your child be more focused and creative when they return to their work.
Allow your child to do something creative like color or draw a picture.

, It can be frustrating for you and your child when you are trying to provide homework help, but they still don’t seem to get it. It can also be upsetting if you are rushing your child to finish. Instead of giving up or rushing them to finish, be patient and give them time to work through the assignment.


Give your child enough time to think about a question before answering it.
Remember that some things that are second nature to you (like multiplication) may take them more time to do or may even need reviewing.
Take a break for yourself if you find yourself losing patience. It’s better to walk away than lose your temper over homework.

Play word games.,
Talk through your daily activities.,
Take your child to different places.",How to Increase Your Child's Vocabulary2," Games such as Scrabble, Scrabble Jr., Upwords, Boggle, Boggle Jr., and Banana-grams focus on words and help build vocabulary. Games are a fun activity that makes learning fun. Your child may not even realize that they are learning.


Crossword puzzles are also good for linking words and their meanings.
You can purchase these games from a store, online, or check them out from your local library.

, As you go through your daily routine, talk about what you are doing. If your child is old enough, ask them about their day and encourage them to ask you about your day. Talking through activities helps your child connect words to actions.If you are washing dishes, you may say, “I am washing the dishes in soapy, warm water.”
It does not matter how small or insignificant the task seems. Provide some narration.

, Every time you go places, talk about what you see and experience. Discussing your new surroundings will introduce new words that may not come up at home or school. Walking around your neighborhood, riding in the car, visiting the zoo or a museum, or even a trip to the grocery store present an opportunity to learn new words.Ask your child questions about what they see or bring certain objects to their attention to stimulate conversation.
If you are at the grocery store, you may point out different fruits and vegetables with unique names. You may discuss different food groups.

"
"
Use adult words with your child.,
Relate new words to known words.,
Use the words in conversation.,
Teach words based on your child’s learning style.",How to Increase Your Child's Vocabulary3," When you speak to your child, talk to them as if you are speaking with another adult. There is no need to “dumb down” your speech so your child understands. Encourage your child to ask a question if they do not understand something that was said.Children who engage in or listen to higher level conversations have better vocabularies and better reading skills later in life.
Use a more advanced word when possible. For example, instead of “happy,” you may use “jovial” or “ecstatic.”

, It is easier to learn a new word if it is related to a word your child already knows. For example, if your child already knows the word “vegetable” and “carrot,” it can help them learn the word “broccoli.” If your child knows the word “mad,” it will help them learn the word “upset.”You can also teach words that are related to a similar concept. If you are discussing farms, you may talk about all the different things that relate to farms. This way your child will understand that association between these words and will be more likely to remember them.

, Repetition is important when learning new words. Use the word on multiple occasions and in different scenarios. It is better to focus on a few words instead of trying to introduce a bunch of new words.Your child will understand a word before they are able to actually use them.

, Your child will learn best if you cater to their learning style. Your child may learn best by listening, doing, or seeing. Try different methods to see what works best.If your child learns by listening, introduce new words through conversations. Talk about what words mean. You may even use rhymes or riddles to learn.
If tour child learns best by doing, have them act out words using facial expressions and gestures.
If your child learns best by seeing, use objects and drawings to learn words and their meaning.

Create a study space for your child.,
Create a study routine with your child.Having a regular routine for homework can improve your child’s performance


Take into account that some kids may work better in the afternoon, while others do better working a little later in the evening.,
Teach your child organizational skills.,
Encourage your child.,
Reward improvement.",How to Improve Your Child's Poor Homework Performance2," This space should be comfortable and quiet, with adequate light, readily available school supplies, and minimal distractions.Having a specific place to work and study will help your child be more organized, focus better and quicker, and improve their homework performance.


Try to find a space without a TV, games, or other distractions. Or at least make sure electronic devices are off and there is nothing around to distract your child.
If a computer is needed, have your child use it somewhere you can make sure they aren’t getting off track by chatting, playing games, or surfing the net.
Make sure there are pencils, pens, paper, dictionary, and other materials on hand for your child.

,
For example, when your son gets home from school, he might have a snack, then work on homework for a set period.
Remember to include breaks from studying in the routine. For instance, your daughter might work on her Spanish homework and then take a five minute break before starting on History.

, One big challenge to good school performance is not being organized.Having the materials they need when they need them, knowing which assignments are due and when they are due, and using good time management skills can help your child improve their poor homework performance.


Buy your child a calendar or agenda. Show them how to enter important dates or assignments. Remind them to use it for the first week or so.
Help your child develop a schedule for the day and week. Include time in the schedule for homework, studying, sports, and fun.
Use organizational supplies like pencil holders or desktop organizers to help keep materials organized.

, Remember that your child probably has some negative feelings about their homework. They may feel anxious, depressed, or ashamed. Encouraging them can help erase these feelings and help them try harder to improve their homework performance.


You might say, “I really like the effort you are putting into this assignment. Good job!”
Or you could say something like, “You’re a hard worker and a smart kid. I know that you can do this.”
You might also try, “I know this is a hard assignment, but I like that you are sticking with it.”

, When your child does an assignment well, or completes an assignment, rewarding them can help them improve their homework performance.In the beginning you may to have provide material rewards, but over time, you should be able to just provide encouragement and praise.


With younger children, giving them 5 minutes extra play time, a special snack, or even a sticker can encourage them.
For larger projects or long-term improvement in homework, consider giving your child a reward like extra computer time on the weekends or permission to go to a social event.
Emphasize that your child should be proud of themselves. This helps make their reward the sense of accomplishment they have.
You might say, “You should feel proud of how you completed your work. It took a lot of effort and you stuck with it.”

Communicate with your child's teacher.,
Make use of technology.,
Get your child a tutor.,
Consider learning disabilities.",How to Improve Your Child's Poor Homework Performance3," One of the best resources for improving your child’s homework performance is their teacher.They may have some additional advice or insights on how to help your child do better. It also shows that you are aware of the problem and are trying to addressing the issue.


Have regular contact with your child’s teacher so that you can be aware of your child’s progress, challenges, and successes.
Let the teacher know that you are concerned about your child’s performance and would like to work as a team to make it better.
For example, you might send an email saying, “I’ve noticed she is having trouble completing the homework. I’d like to work together to improve her performance.”
You might ask, “What suggestions do you have for how I can support her with her homework? What are some things my daughter can do to improve herself?”

, One way to improve your child’s poor homework performance is by using apps, software, programs, and devices to assist with homework. The resources can help your child learn new concepts, review material, practice skills, and more.Many schools and teachers have webpages that contain valuable information about school events, deadlines, guidelines and more.
Online calculators, sample problem generators, video examples, and more can be used to support children with homework performance.
Visit Common Sense Media to find reviews of apps, games, and websites for children and adolescents.

, Sometimes it takes outside help to support your child in improving their homework performance.Resources like tutors and learning centers can work with your child on specific assignments, as well as overall challenges with studying or learning.


Some schools offer free or low-cost before and/or after-school tutoring programs for students. Check with your child’s teacher to see if this is an option.
Consider allowing a peer or sibling to help. Monitor the session to make sure that it is actually tutoring and not playing or otherwise.
Ask your child’s school for the names of some tutors or learning centers that they recommend.
Consider using a site like SylvanLearning.com or TutorZ.com to locate a tutor, learning center, or online resources.

, If your child continues to have problems with homework performance or also has problems with school in general, you may want to have them evaluated for a learning disability.


Talk to their teacher about having an evaluation completed through the school.
Identifying a learning disability can help explain some of the problems your child is having with homework.
It can also help you get additional resources, like individualized instruction, to help your child be successful in school.

Oftentimes, you may notice memory in unexpected, somewhat subtle ways. Keep an eye out for signs of a superior memory.Children may remember facts better than others. Gifted children often memorize facts very young, often for their own fulfillment. Your child may memorize a poem they like, or portions of a certain book. Your child may also memorize things like state capitals and state birds.
Watch for signs your child has a superior memory throughout the day. You may notice your child easily recalls information from books or TV shows. They may also remember events in excessive detail. For example, you may find, after a family dinner, your daughter remembers everyone's name, including people she had only heard spoken about, and can easily remember physical characteristics of individual family members, such as hair color, eye color, and clothing.;
, Early reading is often a sign of a gifted child, especially if a child teaches themselves to read and write. If your child was reading before they entered school, this is a sign your child may be gifted. You may also notice your child reads at an advanced level. They may score high on standardized test for reading and comprehension, and teachers may notice your child reading frequently during school. Your child may actually prefer reading to physical activities.Keep in mind, however, reading is only one of many signs of a child being gifted. Some gifted children may struggle with reading early on, as gifted children often work at their own pace. It's commonly known, for example, that Albert Einstein did not read until he was seven. If your child is not an advanced reader, but shows other signs of being gifted, they may still be gifted.

, Gifted children often tend to have an advanced level of skill in certain areas. Many gifted children are highly skilled in mathematics. As with reading, watch for high test scores and high academic achievement in mathematics. At home, children may enjoy doing puzzles and playing logic games in their spare time.Keep in mind that, like reading, not all gifted children will be math prodigies. Gifted children have different areas of interest and skill. While math is certainly a common area of interest for gifted children, a child who struggles with math may still be gifted., Gifted children tend to reach developmental milestones earlier than their peers. Your child may have been talking in full sentences earlier than their peers. They may also have had a high vocabulary very young, and was able to engage in conversation and ask questions earlier than other children. If your child seemed to develop faster than peers, they may be gifted., Gifted children are marked by a genuine interest in learning about the world. A gifted child may know a lot about politics and world events. He or she may also ask a lot of questions. Your child may ask you about historical events, family history, culture, and so on. Gifted children are often very inquisitive and take joy in learning new things. A gifted child may have a larger than average sense of the world., As gifted children have higher than average memories, a strong vocabulary is a sign your child is gifted. At a young age, as early as 3 or 4, your child may use words like ""understandably"" and ""actually"" in every day speech.A gifted child may also be able to learn new words quickly. He or she may learn a new word for a test in school, and quickly begin using it appropriately in conversation., Many children ask questions, but a gifted child's line of questioning will stand out. Gifted children ask questions to better understand the world and the people around them, as they have a genuine desire to learn.Gifted children will constantly ask questions about their environment. They ask about what they hear, see, touch, smell, and taste. You may be driving in a car, and a song will come on the radio. A gifted child may ask a lot about the song, about what it means, who sang it, when it came out, and so on.
Gifted children also ask questions to gain insight and understanding. A gifted child may ask about other people's emotions, questioning why someone is sad, angry, or happy.

, Gifted children are marked by an early ability to converse. While many children tend to go on about themselves when talking to adults, a gifted child will participate in the conversation. They will ask questions, discuss the topic at hand, and easily pick up on nuances and double-meanings.Gifted children will also switch tone between conversations. You may notice your child uses a slightly different vocabulary and speaking style when talking to someone their own age than when talking to an adult.

, Gifted children do have a tendency to speak quickly. They tend to talk about subjects of interest at a faster pace, and may suddenly switch topics. This is often seen an inattentiveness. However, it's actually a sign your child has many different interests and curiosities., At an early age, a gifted child will be able to follow multi-step directions without trouble. They may not have to ask for a reminder or for clarification. For example, a gifted child might easily be able to follow a direction like, ""Go to the living room, get the red-haired doll from the table, and put it in your toy chest upstairs. While you're up there, bring down your dirty clothes so I can wash them."", Gifted children are known to have passionate interests at an early age and are able to concentrate intensely on a single subject. While all children have unique interests, gifted children will be particularly knowledgeable about certain subjects.Gifted children may want to read informative books about a certain subject. If your child is interested in dolphins, for example, they may frequently check out nonfiction books from the school library about the subject. You may notice your child has a deep knowledge of different types of dolphins, the lifespan of dolphins, their behavior, and other facts about the animal.
Your child will genuinely enjoy learning about the subject. While many children develop an interest in, say, a certain animal, a gifted child may get giddy over watching nature documentaries and studying about that animal for a school project.

, Gifted children will have a unique ability to problem solve. They tend to be fluent thinkers are able to look for alternative solutions and ideas. A gifted child may figure out a loophole in the rules of a board game, for example, or add new steps and rules to a common playground game to make it more interesting. A gifted child will also look to the hypothetical and the abstract. You may hear a gifted child posing ""what if"" questions when trying to figure out a solution to a problem.Due to the fluid nature of a gifted child's thinking, they may struggle in the classroom. Test questions with only one possible answer may frustrate a gifted child. Gifted children tend to see multiple solutions or answers. If a child is gifted, they may do better at essay tests than tests made up of fill in the blank, multiple choice, or true or false questions., Gifted children are imaginative by nature. Your child may love to play pretend, and to fantasize. They may have unique fantasy worlds. A gifted child may be highly adept at daydreaming, and their daydreams may be uniquely detailed., Many gifted children have a unique capacity for the arts. Gifted children may easily express themselves through art forms like painting and music, and also may have a higher than average appreciation for art.Gifted children may draw or write as a hobby. They may also imitate others, often for humor, or sing songs they've heard elsewhere.
Gifted children may tell vivid stories, whether fact or fiction. They may enjoy extracurricular activities like drama, music, and art, as they have a natural need to express themselves artistically.

, You can gauge whether a child is gifted based on social interactions. Gifted children have a unique ability to understand others, and genuinely try to empathize.A gifted child may be sensitive to other people's emotions. If your child is gifted, they may be able to easily tell if someone is sad or angry, and may want to understand the reason behind an emotion. A gifted child will rarely feel indifferent in a situation, and will almost always be concerned for the wellbeing of those around them.
Gifted children will be able to interact with people of all ages. Due to their advanced knowledge, they can talk to adults, teens, and older children with as much ease as they can communicate with those their own age.
However, some gifted children have social difficulties. Their intense interests may make it difficult to interact with others, and gifted children are sometimes misdiagnosed as autistic. While positive social interactions are one sign your child is gifted, it is not the only sign. If your child has difficulty socializing, this does not necessarily mean they are not gifted, and some gifted children are also autistic.

, Gifted children tend to be natural leaders. They have a great capacity for motivating and encouraging others, and seem to naturally fall into leadership positions. You may notice your child is generally the leader in a group of friends, for example, or that your child is able to quickly rise to a leadership position in extracurricular activities., Emotionally, gifted children need alone time. Gifted children will enjoy spending time with others, but will not become bored or agitated if they spend time alone. They may pursue solitary activities, like reading or writing, and may sometimes prefer to be by themselves rather than hanging out in a group. A gifted child will rarely complain of boredom when not being entertained, as they have a great deal of intellectual curiosity that keeps them mentally stimulated.When bored, a gifted child may only need a little ""push"" to start a new activity (e.g. handing them a butterfly net).

, Gifted children have a high capacity for aesthetic appreciation. A gifted child may frequently point out beautiful trees, clouds, bodies of water, and other attractive natural phenomenons. Gifted children are also drawn to art. A gifted child may enjoy looking at paintings or photography, and may also be heavily influenced by music.Gifted children may frequently point out things they notice, such as the moon in the sky or a painting on a wall.

, Conditions like autism and ADHD may have symptoms that overlap with traits of gifted children. You should be aware of the symptoms of these disorders that do not necessarily overlap with giftedness. If you believe your child may have autism or ADHD, you should seek medical evaluation. Be aware that developmental disabilities and giftedness are not mutually exclusive; your child can have both.


Children with ADHD may, like gifted children, struggle in school. However, children with ADHD are not as detail-oriented. They may struggle to follow basic directions. While children with ADHD may talk fast, like gifted children, they will display other signs of hyperactivity like fidgeting and constant movement.Like gifted children, autistic children may have passionate interests and enjoy alone time. However, autistic children will also display other symptoms. An autistic child may not respond to their name, struggle to understand others' emotional states, misuse pronouns, provide unrelated answers to questions, and over- or under-respond to sensory input (loud noises, hugs, etc.)."

Take your child's age into consideration.,
Evaluate your child's body type.,
Choose an instrument that works for a child with braces.,
Be practical about whether or not your child can practice regularly.,
Consider how well coordinated your child is.",How to Help Your Child Choose a Musical Instrument to Study1," For children older than six, you can pick from a wide variety of musical instruments. Younger children, however, are limited in what kinds of instruments they can physically handle. If you are picking an instrument for a child younger than six, a violin or a piano makes the most sense. Young children can more easily handle such instruments.The piano can be a great choice for a young child because it provides foundational skills. A child can better understand music by playing the piano, as there is a visual representation of music that can help foster an understanding of musical theory.
Violins are good options as well, especially because they can be made in small sizes for very young children. A violin also helps a young child learn how to tune an instrument, which is important for developing musical skill.;
, Some children have body types that make them more prone to certain instruments. Keep body type in mind when selecting an instrument for your child.Height is a big factor when it comes to choosing instruments. A child that is of a smaller size will not take as well to a very large instrument, like a bassoon.
If you're choosing an instrument a child plays with their mouth, think about lip size. Smaller lips do better with instruments like the French horn or the trumpet, while a child with larger lips would struggle with these instruments.
Also, think about your child's fingers. Long and slender fingers will do better with a piano than short, stubby fingers.

, If your child has braces, or will get them soon, this can have a big impact on which instruments they can and cannot play.Braces will not inhibit your child's ability to play clarinets and saxophones that much. A flute will have an initial adjustment period for braces, but can be successfully played if your child has braces. Bassoons and oboes can also be played with braces.Braces are not as compatible with instruments like the trumpet, french horn, and baritone instruments like the tuba.

, A child should be practicing their instrument for 20 to 30 minutes a day in order to improve.Therefore, you need to pick an instrument your child is able to practice in your home or at school regularly.Large instruments, like a piano or drums, may not fit into your home if you don't have a lot of space. You should also keep in mind sound. If you live in a quiet neighborhood, people may complain about your child playing drums.
You do not have to rule out a large or noisy instrument simply because it does not fit into your home. See if your child's school has a place where your child can go and practice outside of the home, especially if your child has their heart set on a particular type of instrument.

, Some instruments work better if a child who is highly coordinated. Woodward and percussion instruments would work best with a well coordinated child. If your child is not as well coordinated, stay away from these instruments unless your child expresses a very strong interest in learning them. If a child truly wants to, say, play the drums, they may be able to develop the necessary coordination with time."

Sixth graders learn a variety of math skills. Your sixth grader will learn how to:Multiply and divide fractions.
Understand ratios and rates, and solve word problems relating to ratios and rates.
Understand the ordering and absolute value of positive and negative numbers, as well as understand that positive and negative numbers are used to describe quantities having opposite directions and values.
Solve simple equations with variables.
Write equations to solve word problems, as well as to describe relationships between quantities.
Reason about relationships between shapes to determine surface area, area, and volume.;
, Build a relationship with your child’s teacher by talking to their teacher regularly about your child’s performance. Try to keep the conversation focused by asking about the most important topics. For example, ask about how they are doing with analyzing and solving problems with ratios and rates, solving expressions with variables, and solving word problems with equations.You can also ask to see examples of their work. Ask the teacher, “Is this piece of work satisfactory?” or “How could it be better?”
You can also ask questions like, “How can I help my child to excel in this area?” “Is my child on track?” or “What resources are available to help my child succeed?”

, By reviewing your child’s homework, you will be able to identify the area’s your child is having difficulty with. When you identify trouble areas, address them with your child. Remember to be supportive instead of critical.For example, once your child is finished with their homework, take a few minutes to review it. When you have identified trouble areas you can say, “I noticed you missed a couple questions in this area, do you understand how to do these problems? Or, “You missed a few questions here, what is causing you to become confused? I can help you.”

, Your sixth grader will need a quite place to study and work on their math homework. Designate a time and place to work on math homework and study for tests.Have your child study or review their math homework 20 minutes each day. For example, the dining room table could be a great place since it is often in another room and away from distractions like the TV and siblings.


You could also create a space in their room by setting up a desk with a chair in one of the corners.

, Teach your child to take notes by telling them to write down important information. Important information can be explanations used by the teacher to explain a difficult problem, as well as strategies, shortcuts, and individual steps to complete math problems.


Teach your child the T-chart method of taking notes. Tell them to draw the letter T. Next, have them write the title of the day’s lesson at the top of the T. Then, show them that general information goes in the left hand column, while more specific information, like detailed explanations, goes in the right hand column., If your child is having difficulty with math, don’t make excuses by saying, “I was never good at math, either.” This gives your sixth grader an excuse to give up on math, or to be unfocused in class. Instead, encourage your child to succeed in math.For example, you can tell them, “Even some of the greatest mathematicians had trouble with math. If you make an effort, you will be able to succeed.”

, Remind your sixth grader that they can succeed in math as long as they stay positive and put in the necessary effort. If your child does poorly on a test, use this time to let your child know that challenges are their best chances to grow and learn. You can recount a time when you were struggling to do something, and how you overcame the challenge.You can say, ""When I tried out for the basketball team the first time, I did not make the team. But the following year I practiced really hard and attended as many games as possible. Then, when I tried out the next year, I made the team. I was so happy because I knew my hard work paid off.""
When your child does well on a test, do not forget to praise them for their effort.You can say for example, ""You earned that A+. You worked hard and did not give up.""

, If understanding math is an extra difficult task for your child, or if you do not have time to sit down with your child to review their homework and teach them math problems, then hire a tutor. Also, if studying together causes a fight and is extra hard on you and your child, hire a tutor.Hire a tutor that can help your child, but also one that encourages independent effort.
Ask your child’s teacher or school if they can provide a valid reference for a math tutor.

, By making math a game, you can help your sixth grader become interested in math, and thus, succeed in math. For example, at the supermarket, find an item you regularly purchase, like bread. Ask your child to calculate the cost of each piece of bread by knowing the cost of the loaf and how many pieces of bread are in a loaf.You can also play a game while standing in the checkout line. Before the cashier rings up the groceries, have your sixth grader guess how much they think everything will cost. Once you know the final price, ask your sixth grader how they came up with their number. Then, compare their estimates to the actual prices on the receipt.

, If your sixth grader likes to play video games, have them calculate the average time it takes them to complete a level in a game. For example, record the time it takes to complete the same level three different times. Then, have your child average the times together to get a final average. Encourage them to challenge their friends to see how long it takes them to complete the level on average.

, Cooking and baking are great ways to help your child understand ratios and proportions. The next time you cook dinner, have your child determine the amount of ingredients needed when cooking.


For example, if a recipe calls for six cups of rice to serve three people, how many cups of rice do you need to serve eight people? How about 4 people?"

Think about whether your child is outgoing.,
Talk to your child's music teacher.,
Consider how your child thinks.",How to Help Your Child Choose a Musical Instrument to Study2," Children that love to be the center of attention are drawn to instruments that steal the show. If you have an outgoing child, choose an instrument to match that personality.Flutes work great for outgoing children, as flutists are generally near the front of the band.
Louder instruments, like the saxophone and trumpet, also work well for outgoing children.

, If your child takes music lessons at school, talk to your child's music instructor. A child may have a slightly different personality playing an instrument than they do at home, and your music instructor will have a good sense of what instrument is right for your child.Make an appointment with your child's music teacher. Tell them you're trying to pick an instrument for your child and you want to know what kind of instruments your child enjoys in band.

, Analytical thinkers may take better to certain instruments. The oboe and the piano are often a good choice for a highly analytical child, for instance. These instruments require a bit more analytical thinking and inquisitiveness. For children who are less analytical and more socially oriented, go for instruments like the saxophone, trombone, and the flute."
"
Pay attention to which parts of a song a child gravitates towards.,
Have your child test out an instrument, if possible.,
Assist your child in exploring music.",How to Help Your Child Choose a Musical Instrument to Study3," Allow your child to listen to music with you. This can help you figure out what kind of instrument a child may enjoy playing. Listen to what sounds resonate with your child, and consider the instruments producing those sounds.Listen to a variety of music, from solo music to ensemble pieces. Ask your child which sounds they enjoy, and talk to them about the instruments involved in producing those sounds.
Ask your child about the song. Say something like, ""Which parts of this song do you love?""
After a while, your child may express interest in learning the instruments that make the sounds they gravitate towards.

, It can be difficult to settle on one instrument for your child, especially if your child is eager and excited about music. See if your band allows kids to rent a certain instrument for a set number of days to try it out. You can let your child experiment with several different instruments before settling on one to play., Take your child to museums, libraries, or other venues where music is being played. Exploring music will help your child figure out what kind of instruments they may be interested in.Don’t be afraid to switch up music. While kids’ music is fine, don’t be afraid to play your favorite band or artist as additional exposure of different music types. Your child will pick up on your joy and excitement as you sing along to The Beatles or Beethoven."

Understand your child's interests.,
Examine your child's academic history.,
Talk to your child about the process.,
Prepare your child for standardized testing.",How to Get Your Children Into Private School1," It is important that you find a school that is a good fit for your child. Talk to your child about interests and future goals. Is your child into the arts or music? Is your child striving to get into a top college? Does your child love science? Identifying your child's interest will help you choose a school that matches those interests.Private schools often emphasize certain programs or activities.
Begin to look for schools that cater to and nurture your child's interests. This will increase your child's chances of getting into the school.;
, A good picture of your child's academic standing will help the private school process. Look at your child's past report cards and progress reports. Speak with current and past teachers. What areas does your child excel in? How does your child learn? What areas does your child need help in?


Private schools have different structures. Some schools may be traditional and very structured, while other schools allow children to learn at their own pace.Match your school choice to the academic needs of your child.

, Before you get started, let your child know that you are looking at some great new schools for them. Tell your child that you will be visiting some potential schools and speaking with some teachers.


Be upbeat and positive when you discuss this change. Make it sound exciting and fun.

, Depending on the school and your child's grade level, your child may be required to take an admissions test. The test is one component of the application packet. If you know your child struggles with standardized testing, have them take a test-prep course or hire a private tutor. If you are unable to pay for outside help, work through a test-prep book with your child.Check the websites of private schools in your area to see which standardized tests are required.
High schools are more likely to require standardized testing than elementary and middle schools.
Starting test prep before you plan to apply can reduce any nervousness or anxiety your child may feel about taking the test.

Visit about 10 schools.,
Take your child with you on the tours.,
Carefully examine the general characteristics of the school.,
Ask questions related to the specific needs of your child.",How to Get Your Children Into Private School2," You can visit the website and read about the schools as much as you want, but you will get the best understanding by visiting the school. Visiting multiple schools will help narrow down your likes and dislikes and decide which schools you would like to apply to. A school may look great on paper, but may be different in person.


Start looking at schools early. The fall before your child starts is an ideal time.Pay attention to your gut feelingwhen you visit schools.

, Both you and your child need to like the school and feel comfortable there. Ask your child what they like about the school. Ask your child if this is somewhere they would like to go to school. It is important that your child feels like they are a part of the decision making process.Take time to visit the school at an after school event or during an extracurricular activity. This will provide a better picture of the school's culture.
Tours show the school that you and your child are interested and excited about the possibility of attending.
Many schools have open houses during the fall enrollment season.If your child is young or would be a distraction, you can limit the number of tours you take them on. You may only take them to the schools that you are actually applying to.

, There are key features you should look for when you visit a school. Make a list of questions and take it to each school. Write down your answers as you go through the tour or after you are finished. This will give you a way to compare and contrast each school. Consider the following:Do the students appear engaged and interested?
Are the teachers knowledgeable and enthusiastic?
How does the principal interact with the students, teachers, and other staff?
Do the students behave as they change classes and walk through the campus?
Are the classrooms a positive, fun place for learning?
Are the parents involved with the school?
Is the campus clean, well-kept, and safe? Are the buildings up-to-date?

, Depending on the grade level, learning needs, and interests of your child, you may have specific questions about the school. Make a list of these items and ask them during the visit . For example, if the science instruction or the music program is important for your child, ask to see the facilities, students, and teachers that are involved in these programs. Other aspects that vary by grade level may include:For elementary students, before and after school care, transportation to and from school, and the amount of outdoor time will be important.
For middle school students, academic tutoring offerings and creating a community environment are important.
For high school students, college planning and counseling services, standardized test preparation, and honors and AP class offerings are important.
The GreatSchools website has a checklist for elementary,middle,and high schoolvisits.

Apply to 4 or 6 schools.,
Meet all of the deadlines.,
Submit a compelling essay.,
Complete the interview.,
Utilize any personal connections.",How to Get Your Children Into Private School3," Schools are competitive; apply to multiple schools to increase your chances of getting in.Be honest when you fill out an application. Your child is not perfect and has both strengths and weaknesses. There is no need to sugar coat or present a perfect child.Schools are looking for well-rounded children that fit the culture of the school.
There may be a fee to submit an application. The costs vary by school, but be prepared to pay.

, Schools receive hundreds of applications a year. You do not want your application to be rejected because you did not get all of the paperwork in on time. Late applications may also show that you are disorganized, forgetful, and not a great candidate.If you miss a deadline, you may have to wait a year to reapply.
Try to stay as organized as possible. Keep a list of the application deadlines and necessary materials for each school. Tackle the applications based on their due dates.

, In addition to your application and test scores, your child may have to write an essay. The essay is a time for your child to make a personal connection with the admissions committee. The essay should be centered around a personal experience (e.g. a book they read, a family vacation, a movie, a friendship/relationship) that has helped your child become the person they are. The essay should also discuss why your child wants to attend the school.Do not write the essay for your child. The admissions committee will be able to tell if a parent wrote the essay. However, you can proofread and help your child brainstorm for the essay.
The essay can help your child stand out or make up for below average test scores.

, An interview may also be part of the process. The interview will focus on your child and how the school is a good fit for your child. Your child should be prepared to answer some of the following questions:What is the last book that you read?
What types of things are you interested in? What do you like to do for fun?
Why do you want to go to this school?
Do you have any questions about he school?
Do you think you would like this school? Why?
The interview process is to get to know your child better. The interviewer will not ask your child any questions that your child doesn't know the answer to.

, If you are an alumni of a private school or have any siblings that went to the school, let them know that you are applying. Also, ask your friends or coworkers if they know any admissions officers or anyone that works at the schools you are applying to. Having some type of ""in"" can separate you from other applicants."
"
Pick a preschool style.,
Start a year in advance.,
Go in for an interview.,
Appeal when necessary.",How to Get Your Child Into a Good School1," Preschools come in many forms, from daycare style to academically-rigorous. Consider what type of environment would help your child flourish and look for schools that best fit your child’s learning style.Take a look at the educational philosophies. Does the school believe in learning by play or studying? When do they introduce reading and math? Does the school follow a particular model such as the Montessori Method or the Waldorf approach?
Pay attention to the school’s atmosphere. Do the children seem happy? Are the classrooms and teachers inviting and do they foster a positive learning environment in which your child or children will flourish?
Consider your own child’s learning needs. Think about what your child needs in addition to what you want for your child. Will they be comfortable in big classes or a smaller environment? Can they focus in a group or do they need one-on-one time?
Many preschools will allow a prospective child to spend half a day in their programs to see if it is a good fit. It is important to provide this preliminary exposure to the child and ask them how they felt about their experiences. Often times what we see from the outside may not be what is truly experienced by the child interacting within that environment.
Enquire About the Safety Procedure. Kids are born mischievous; they like to play around and do adventurous things. They must get an environment where they can explore themselves without the fear of getting hurt. Thus, parents must ask the school staff about the safety and security procedures adopted for the kids.;
, Every preschool is different, but often schools fill up fast. Contact preschools that you think would work for your child about a year before you plan to enroll them. This gives you more time to plan financially and make sure you receive a spot.Ask the school, “What are the requirements for admitting a child into your school?” Admissions processes vary greatly, so asking directly often gets you the best information.
If you are looking at a preschool that is part of an elite or prestigious elementary school, consider contacting the school about a year and half before enrollment and prepare for a longer admissions process.

, This is the time when the school gets to know you and your child. Be honest about your family life and your child’s personality. The school is there to help your child bolster their strengths and improve their weaknesses, so it's important to let the school know what those are.Focus less on proving your child’s intelligence and more on letting their personality shine through. Many schools are interested in the interpersonal fit more than the academic fit at this age.
Ask thoughtful questions based on your conversation. This lets the school know that you are interested and engaged in the admissions process. Try a question like, ""My child enjoys creative activities and spaces. What sort of programs do you offer that will help nurture their creative side?"" It may be helpful to write a list of questions you may have prior to the interview.
There’s no need for a resume or portfolio at this age. While this is a trend among some parents at some elite schools, admissions officers generally agree it does nothing for the admissions process.

, Getting on the waitlist isn’t generally too much of a problem. If your first choice school wait lists your child, though, you can always appeal to the directors to reconsider. Do not admonish them for not accepting your child. Rather, provide sincere information as to why your child would be best served in their school.Appeal directly to the director. They are the school’s gatekeeper and have more sway than anyone.
Let the director know what your child will get at their school that they cannot find somewhere else, and why it is important for your child to be a part of this community.
Tell them directly, ""I believe this school is the best option for my child because of the programs and resources it has to offer. I see my child learning and performing better in this school than in any other, and I would like to ask you to reconsider their waitlist position.""
Do not expect that this will automatically change anything. The director is unlikely to bump an existing student when you are on the waitlist. You must still be patient.
It is okay to ask them why they chose not to accept your child. Sometimes the answers they provide you will help you to possibly place your child at an alternate school of choice, or for reapplying to the same school when appropriate. It also shows your interest and initiative to learn more about their decision making process and may even change their mind to accept your child.

Move to a good school district.,
Look at charter and magnet schools.,
Look for special programs.",How to Get Your Child Into a Good School2," One of the easiest ways to ensure your child gets into a good public school is to relocate to a good school district. Inter-district transfers are hard to come by, so often living in the same district as your desired school is usually necessary.Make sure the housing area is in your price range if you consider moving. Many homes in good school districts are more expensive than surrounding area.
Remember, to enroll your child in a public school proof of residence is often required. Move before the academic year starts so your child can enroll with no interruptions.
To find a good school district, look at factors such as class size, student to teacher ratio, test scores, the attendance rates, and what sort of extra support and services the district offers to encourage a holistic education.There are some school districts that are a bit more lenient with accepting students outside of their district if there is a family member or parent that works and/or volunteers for that district. Again this depends highly on the location (state, city, county) of where the school is situated.

, Charter schools are public schools with private oversight, common in many urban areas. Magnet schools are public schools with a special curricular focus such as STEM or the arts. Both often offer private school-level education as a part of the public school system.Both magnet and charter schools often require an application and testing for admission. Find a school that matches your child’s strengths to give them the best chance. Consider hiring a tutor or taking a practice test, if available.
Start early. Try getting your child into a charter school earlier on. Kindergarten is ideal, as slots in charter schools may be harder to come by in higher grades.
If charter schools in your area are assigned by lottery, apply to magnet schools that require portfolios or auditions, as well. This can help you beat chance., Some states and school districts offer special programs. These may cater to gifted students, or helping students from underprivileged backgrounds succeed academically.In elementary school, gifted and talented education (GATE) programs help engage and challenge students who already excel at their normal schoolwork.
Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) programs offer more rigorous courses and college credit for high school students. Note that not all colleges nation-wide accept all high school AP courses. Speak to your child about where they would like to go to college and then contact that college directly, especially if that college is out of state.

Plan early.,
Get a good letter of recommendation.,
Find a tutor.,
Emphasize your child's uniqueness.,
Become familiar with their current teacher.,
Have a backup plan.",How to Get Your Child Into a Good School3," Private school admission generally involves an application, interviews, and testing, all of which need to be completed before the application deadline. Contact the private schools you are interested in a year before you hope to enroll to get information on admissions standards and the application process.Let the school know, “I would like to enroll my child in your school for the next academic year. How can I begin the application process?”
If the school requires referrals, start asking early, as well. Give people plenty of time to pen a quality letter.
Once you know the application deadline, plan ahead to ensure that you have everything in on time.

, The best recommendations come from your child's current teacher or from a family already active in the school. Talk to any friends or coworkers that you know with a child admitted into the program you want for your child.


Ask for a recommendation letter early. Give the person a month's notice minimum to ensure that they have enough time to write a good letter without feeling pressured or rushed.
If you do not know any families at the school, talk to your child's current teacher. They can speak to your child's academic strengths and potential better than most anyone.

, Find a tutor in your area that specializes in helping children prepare for the ISEE or SSAT. These are the most common admission exams used by private schools. Working with a tutor will allow your child to prepare and practice taking mock exams before they actually test.Use your child’s current grades as an indicator of the subjects on which the tutor should focus. If they regularly have lower grades in English than in math, let the tutor know you want to work on your child’s math skills.

, While it’s important for your kid’s education to be well-rounded, you want them to stand out on an application. Emphasize your child’s unique abilities or talents.Don’t list every activity your child has participated in. Instead, focus on where they are talented. Let the school know if your child is a gifted artist, skilled athlete, a multi-instrumental composer, or anything else that will set them apart.

, Your child’s current teacher will be the best recommendation source come time to apply. Be friendly to your child’s current teacher and offer to help out around the classroom where you can.Volunteer for activities such as school plays or science nights if you have the time.
Make an effort to attend all parent-teacher meetings.
Let the teacher know your educational goals for your child. Ask them, “How do you think we can work together to get my child to this point?”

, Your kid may or may not get into your top choice school. They may or may not get into private school at all. Apply to multiple schools, and have a backup plan in case your child isn’t admitted into one of your top choice schools.Check to see if certain schools have an appeal process in place to allow you to restate your case for your child’s admission.
Visit many schools and look for hidden gems. Some schools are popular simply because they are popular. Visit schools to look for one that still offers great academic opportunities but with a smaller applicant pool.
Don’t be afraid of sending your child to public school if necessary. Look into charter, magnet, and district transfer options to get your child into a well-regarded public school.

Ask your kids how they feel about various issues (current events, relationships, values). Allow them to have opinions without passing judgment. Ask your children to help you understand why they feel the way they do.;
, Share these with your child, but do not require that he or she follow your pursuits.


Encourage your kids to have interests of their own. If they show curiosity about a hobby, area of study, sport, or instrument, encourage and support them in any way your finances allow.

, Read on your own, which sets a good example. Read to your kids, to get them hooked on books. Have lots of books in the house. Have bookcases and show how you value books.


Play game books.
Read audiobooks on CD or MP3.

, One never knows how what exposure may influence future life choices.

, These are games where there is not just one answer. Scrabble and chess are examples. Emphasize the value of thoughtful moves rather than the importance of winning.

, School, educational games and television, and a shelf full of books all can't accomplish what you can in the education of your child. It doesn't take much effort to inspire a child's brain in the everyday world - the place where they need it the most. Here are a few simple things you can do to engage your child: count the number of houses, black cars, bicycles, etc. that you pass as you drive; search for letters, numbers, or colors on the restaurant menu; when you are going to use a gum-ball machine, hold out a handful of coins and explain the differences, and that the machine will only take the quarter (then let your child pick out a quarter and put it in the machine - they love this!).

, Children need plenty of free time to discover and explore. Don't jam pack your schedule with errands and activities. Give your child time for free play, day dreaming and roaming around in the back yard.

, Fostering independence in your child is very important for their brain development and how they feel about learning. Sometimes, activities seem too difficult for your child only because you haven't encouraged them to do it yet. For example, things like peeling their own banana, picking out which shirt to wear, and feeding the family cat, are all things that a young toddler can do. Letting your child do things like this makes them feel more in control of their world, which in turn inspires them toward bigger and better exploits. When the world is in your hands, you want to do something with it, don't you?

, Attend school functions, volunteer in the classroom if possible, and communicate with the teacher. Ask the teacher what you can do to help your child.

This ensures that you cover what you want to speak about and don’t forget anything or get off track. It also shows the teacher that you’ve put some thought into the meeting.Write down any questions you have for the teacher. These might include, “Is my child paying attention? Do they complete all their work? Are they meeting expectations?”;
, Before going to the conference, gather any papers, tests, or projects you’d like to discuss. Put them all in a folder and bring them to the meeting. If you have any questions on grades or projects, find things you have specific questions on and have them ready to discuss.If you have questions about your child’s grade, it helps to bring the paper or project so that you can review it together.

, Check in your with your child on how school is going. Ask your child if there’s anything they’d like you to bring up in the conference. Ask about what subjects are easy and which ones are hard. Have them tell you about how they get along with the other children, who they sit with at lunch, and how recess is. Get an idea from your child how school is going and how they relate to their teacher.For example, say, “Tell me about school. Do you like going to school? What’s your favorite part? Are there any people you don’t get along with?”

, If you have other kids, try not to bring them to the conference. Because parent-teacher conferences are often brief, keep the focus on the meeting and not on your small child. Find a sitter.Before the conference, silence your cell phone or power it down.

, Teachers often meet with several parents in one day. Help them keep the day going smoothly by being on-time. Make sure you know how to get to the school and into your child’s classroom. If you’re unfamiliar with the area or are not sure which is your child’s room, arrive early to navigate the situation and not be late.


Make sure you bring all of the materials you have with you.

, When the conference begins, allow the teacher to speak first and tell you how things are going for your child. Teachers often offer insight to what children at their age are doing and feeling. The teacher may have a unique view into your child’s social abilities or struggles in or out of the classroom. Take some time to listen.Pay attention to the information the teacher brings up. It may not sound wonderful, but feel free to ask questions or seek clarification. Say, “Can you tell me an example of that behavior?”

, Be willing to talk and listen. Ask if your child is meeting expectations and school standards and listen to what the teacher has to say. Be ready to hear how your child can improve. If the teacher makes suggestions for what to do at home, listen and don’t be immediately defensive.If the teacher says something you’re not happy to hear, remember that they support your child’s learning and are not there to judge you or make you feel bad.

, Parents and teachers ideally should work together to support a child’s learning. Ask the teacher how you can support your child’s school learning while at home. This might mean having them read each day or spending more time on math problems.For example, if your child has problems staying on-task at school, monitor their homework and restrict activities until homework is completed.

, As your child’s parent, it might be difficult to hear if your child is acting up or not turning in assignments or lagging behind other students. If you hear news that you’re not happy about, don’t explode at the teacher or blame them. Even if you don’t like the teacher’s style, recognize that your child has the opportunity to learn from various people in various styles.


If you find yourself getting upset, pause and take a few deep breaths. Do not let your emotions hijack the conference — stay calm. Remember that you and the teacher have a common goal: the well-being and success of your child. Don't get side tracked by an argument or finding someone to blame., Be conscientious of the time during the meeting. If you have an important question or concern, address it as soon as possible. When you notice that your time is almost up, be sure to begin wrapping up the meeting. This shows the teacher that you respect their time.


If you’re wrapping up the meeting, say, “I’ve said everything I want to say, is there anything more you’d like to add?”

, Let the teacher know that you appreciate hearing from them. Your child’s teacher plays a large role in their life and feedback from them is valuable. Say, “Thank you” and let them know you appreciate what they do for your child.

, Parent-teacher conferences are all about supporting your child, so don’t forget to include them in the process. Let your child know what you learned. Talk about what might be different or change at home, such as a different homework routine. Finally, get their feedback and ask for their suggestions."

Listen to them.,
Think about the big picture.,
Encourage them to play two or three sports a year.,
Attend a practice.,
Be honest, positive, and supportive.,
Acknowledge any personal concerns.",How to Help Kids Find a Sport They Enjoy1," Kids are most likely to both enjoy and benefit from participating in a sport if they have the freedom to choose to do so themselves. As a parent or guardian, look to support the interests they share with you.Organized physical competition can be intimidating for some children. If your kid is seemingly uninterested in team sports, ask them why. For instance, say “Jenny, I heard lots of your friends are signing up for soccer. Have you thought about signing up too?”
Kids that claim to be disinterested in team sports may wind up enjoying them as their skills improve or they try a new sport or join a new team. Focus on the fun they could have by joining in on an activity with a bunch of their friends.;
, You want them to develop into a happy, healthy, and confident adult. You may also hope that they excel in sports and earn a scholarship to help pay for college. Realistically, team sports are much more likely to offer the former than the latter - and it’s important to remember that the former is much more important. Don’t think about what a kid will be the best at, think about what they are most likely to enjoy and benefit from.Social, emotional, and physical development are best facilitated by activities a child actually wants to be involved in. Even if they’re a wrestling star, it won’t do them much good to wrestle every day if they don’t enjoy it.
To help your child find the sport they will benefit from the most, think about more than just their abilities. The other kids (and parents) involved in a particular sport, the opportunities in your area, and your child’s physical condition are all important to consider.

, Many, many parents push their children too hard. This can happen by either pushing a kid to play one sport too aggressively, or by pushing a kid to play too many sports in general. Prevent doing either by listening to your child and encouraging them to participate, but primarily in the capacity that they want to do so.Pressuring a kid to participate in a single sport year round can make them feel like it’s a job. Not only will they lose interest, they will likely receive less enjoyment from participating, even if they continue to do so.
On the other hand, playing four different sports can simply be too much. Two or three seasonal sports for year is ideal.
Worry less about the particular sport, and more about finding the sport that will keep your kid interested. You can help most simply by encouraging them to participate in something - and leaving the specifics up to them.

, There are a few important criteria to consider from a guardian’s perspective. You’re likely already considering things like a potential coach’s qualifications, and your child’s ability to contribute. You can easily get insight that can fill you in by attending a practice, either with your kid or on your own.Pay attention to how a coach interacts with their players. Children's coaches should always focus on allowing and encouraging every kid to put forth their best effort. Signs to watch out for are coaches that give too much attention to talented participants, or disparage any of their players.
Look for positive signs too. Talk to other parents that may be there, and ask how they feel about the league and the coach. Most importantly, pay attention to the kids themselves.
If all of the kids are enjoying themselves, share this information by saying something like. “You know, it really seemed like all of the kids were enjoying themselves out there. Have you thought about giving it a try?”

, While physical size doesn’t have to keep your kid out of sports, they may be hesitant to participate because they are bigger or smaller than the other kids. If, for instance, a kid resists participating in a certain sport for physical reasons, encourage them to consider a different sport.Heavier kids may lack the endurance or willingness to run, but may find out that they’re excellent swimmers. A shorter kid may not be keeping up in the sports they want to play, but might really take to something new.

, If your child is interested in a sport that you have reservations about, share your concerns with them directly. It's important to convey that you have a serious reason for opposing something they want to do. Avoid simply disallowing them from participating without giving them a reason.


For instance, say something like ""There's a lot of evidence that kids who play football are more likely to hurt their brains. Brain injuries can even affect your thoughts and emotions later in life. I'm not comfortable with you playing a sport that increases that risk.""
Similarly, if expenses or time are a concern, you may be able to talk to a coach and find out about borrowing equipment, or ask other parents and coaches to drive your kids to out-of-town events. Of course, you may not have these options.
Point out the advantages of another option by saying something like, ""Boxing does seem like a lot of fun, but it's too dangerous. Have you thought about judo?"" or ""I don't think I'd be able to come to many of your ice hockey games since they're all out of town, but have you thought about playing roller hockey?""

After games and practices, ask your child questions like “Was it fun?”, “Did you win?”, or “Did you learn anything?” to see what their motivations are. In general, the question that the child answers most excitedly is where their true motivation lies.
just For example, if a child is really excited to tell you how fun the activity was, but isn’t as quick to respond to a question about what he learned, his motivation is most likely to have fun.;
, Once you understand your child’s motivation, you can tailor their activities and your approach to their desires.


For example, if a child’s motivation is to have fun, put them in a sport with their friends or with a coach who uses creative drills and exercises. If their main need (to have fun) is met, they can then focus on being competitive.
For a child whose motivation is to learn something new, talk to the coach about teaching that child special skills or work with her one-on-one so she masters a new skill and can use it to become more competitive.

, A major emotion in competition is confidence—many children aren’t competitive because they aren’t confident in their sports abilities.


Talk to your child openly about their fears and dreams, and work together to set goals of what skills to work on. Stay positive around your child, and praise and encourage him during good and bad times.
Even if your child isn’t particularly athletic, they can still gain confidence as you praise their hard work and dedication. Once a child feels confident and comfortable in their abilities, they naturally become more competitive.

, Some children simply aren’t naturally competitive about sports. If this is the case for your child and you’ve tried (unsuccessfully) to instill a competitive attitude, try moving your child to a different sport or waiting a few years to see if their competition level changes. Many children naturally get more competitive as they get older.


If your child is unhappy and not competitive, consider moving them to another activity that would interest them more, such as music or dance classes.
Although having a competitive child can be good for their future endeavors, having a child who is happy and enjoys their activities is even more important.

, A child who is put in baseball when he really wants to play basketball is going to have a hard time getting competitive in a sport that doesn’t interest him. Be flexible with your child’s needs and sign them up for sports that match their interests and abilities.

, If your child is on a team or league where everyone is above his level, he won’t have fun and can easily get discouraged.


Children on teams that never win will lose their competitive drive because they don’t see it paying off. When your child is first starting in a sport, put them in a recreational league with children around the same age and skill level.
If you really want your child to win, put him in a league where he is one of the older athletes.

, As he advances, look for sports and teams that will push your child to progress but not leave him alone, lost, and discouraged. Select and club teams are generally more competitive, but can be a major mental and time commitment.


Talk to other parents before signing up for a sport to see what their experience has been with the team and league. Talk to the coach about his coaching strategy and see if it will be a good fit for your child. If the coach only talks about winning, he may be too competitive.
Look for a coach that wants to win and will run a good team, but who also understands that kids are still growing and learning. Remember your child’s motivations and find a team that will match those and continue to push him.

, Teaching your child that winning or losing isn’t important can help to prevent them from feeling worthless when they lose. Encourage your child to focus on competition with himself, instead of competing against other players.


This not only teaches important life lessons, but also helps a child avoid becoming too competitive. Talk with your child about setting personal goals for their performance, and check in regularly with their coach and your child to check their progress.
Inner competition can be a powerful driving force that can help your child development self-confidence and motivation that can translate to activities off the field.

, After each game, spend some time analyzing the child's performance (in a positive, constructive way).


Ask them what they think they did well, what they can work on in the future, and what would have happened if they had tried harder.
Use the personal goals they have set for themselves as an opportunity to teach problem solving and help older children understand what they can do to keep improving.

, Even simple card or board games, such as Old Maid or Monopoly, can create a positive atmosphere for competition, where people play the game with strategy and the intent to do their best, but not to the point of sabotaging other players or getting angry when someone else wins.

, Play the board game to win, but don’t be a sore loser who acts out when something doesn’t go their way by throwing a tantrum and ruining the experience for the other players.


Children will model what they see their parents do, so use this opportunity to establish proper, healthy competition. Teach them that winning the game isn’t the most important part, but that you learned something and had a fun time together.

, If your child throws a tantrum when they lose the game, take them aside and let them calm down, then talk to them about better ways to express their feelings. Help them realize how much fun they had playing the game by pointing out the things that went well.


Toddlers and young school-age children are especially prone to being sore losers because they are just learning what it means to win and lose.
Help them to understand that it doesn't mean they aren’t good at something just because they didn’t win the game

, In homes with multiple children, sibling rivalry is a natural occurrence. Children with siblings are naturally more competitive in life and in sports because they have always had someone to compete against.


Teach your children from an early age what healthy competition looks like by encouraging each child to do their best. Prompt them to congratulate their siblings on their victories and successes.
Children without siblings are at a natural disadvantage when it comes to being competitive, so look for other children, such as friends, neighbors, or cousins, to build and demonstrate a healthy competition with.

Consider other fitness opportunities for kids.,
Mention athletic options for kids who like music.,
Try outdoor sports with your kid.,
Ask your kid if they’d be more interested in physical activity that includes animals.",How to Help Kids Find a Sport They Enjoy2," The fact of the matter is that not everybody likes team sports. This is entirely okay. It is still important, of course, for your kid to get exercise, and doing so in the context of organized athletics still provides advantages like learning commitment and developing social skills outside of the classroom.Keep working with a kid who is resistant to physical activity until you find something they are interested in trying. The important thing, from a guardian’s side, is to remain supportive and encouraging. They may wind up only being interested in skateboarding or bowling - but both of these can help them stay active, make friends, and commit to improving at something of their own volition.

, Does your kid like music? There are plenty of ways to blend this interest with fitness. Dance, figure skating, and band all offer many of the benefits kids can get from participating in sports. In truth, they’ll wind up with an additional advantage, as a love of music often stays with people their whole lives.Dance doesn’t have to be traditional. In fact, many kids may not be enthused by ballet. Hip-hop, Irish dance, or musical theater, on the other hand, may have them looking forward to every lesson.
DVDs or YouTube videos are great ways to explore different styles of dancing in particular. If the interest sticks, look for opportunities in the nearest city to add a social component to their practice and performance regimen.

, Another way to engage a kid that might not be convinced by the spectacle of team sports is to take them out into the wild. Even from a very young age, many kids simply take to the outdoors, and bringing them on hikes or canoeing trips is likely to perk more specific interests as they age.More specifically, trail running, kayaking, rock climbing, and snow sports are all increasingly popular with young people. If there’s any outdoors activities you enjoy, always invite them to join you - and offer to try something new that they’re interested in with them.

, Got an animal lover in your home? Understandably, they may not be too keen on hugging a pigskin. That said, there a plenty of sports that may resonate with kids who would rather spend time with live animals.For instance, training and playing with the family dog can lead to exercise, planning, goal-pursuit, and even socialization with other dog owners and trainers.
Equine sports are another realm of social and athletic interaction too. While these sports can be expensive to participate in, they provide an entire network of friends and competitors for many youth.

"
"
Don’t overemphasize competition.,
Ask open-ended questions about how they feel.,
Practice with them.,
Don’t compare your kid to other kids.,
Watch out for signs of burnout.",How to Help Kids Find a Sport They Enjoy3," Though this can be hard for older folks to keep in mind, kids don’t care nearly as much about the score as some parents do. While emotional expression following a win or loss will be evident, kids are less likely to obsess about the outcome of a game. It’s for more often the case that they just want to physically express themselves, socialize with friends, and - perhaps most of all - have fun.In fact, the difference between adult and child priorities is often a significant factor in kids losing interest.
For example, when talking about a game later in the day, don’t mention the score. Instead, mention specific things a kid did well, or moments when it seemed as though they were having fun.
As an example, “That pass you sent across the baseline was brilliant. What a great angle!”

, It’s usually the parents that keep bringing up the score or the child’s position on the team, but it can be a lot more constructive and supportive to simply ask how they’re enjoying the sports they’re involved in. For instance, ask something like, “How’d practice go today?”It’s perfectly okay to offer advice too, though it should always come with acknowledgements of what your kid is doing well. Also, the more specific your comments, the more helpful they will be.
For instance, instead of saying, “You could definitely throw further if you wanted,” say something like, “It seems like you’ve been getting to the ball more often and have been making some solid throws. Have you considered using your shoulder more on the long throws?”

, One of the best ways to encourage your kid’s participation and improvement is by enjoying a sport with them. Passing a baseball or soccer ball back and forth in the yard not only gives you quality time together, it also offers the chance to talk about different ways to execute different movements.Do some research to supplement your own knowledge too. If, for instance, you don’t know how to shoot a basketball but your kid is increasingly interested in the sport, watch some YouTube videos about proper shooting form. That way, next time you’re shooting around together, you can offer some helpful, supportive advice.

, Just don’t do it. You’re talking about a children’s sports team. Your kid is also very likely already comparing themselves to everyone around them, and what they need is your support.Instead, encourage kids to set and achieve personal goals. For instance, recording and working to improve their mile time incrementally, or learning a new ball handling move once a week are constructive, achievable goals.
Remind your kid that no one is perfect whenever it seems necessary to do so. Simply say something like, “Making mistakes is part of getting better at something, and everyone does it. I’m proud of you for sticking with it.”
It may also help to recommend a way to move past mistakes. For instance, tell a kid to try something like making a fist each time something doesn’t go their way, and slowly releasing the tension while letting the frustration go too.

, If signs of burnout develop, sit down with your kid to talk about how they’re feeling about the sports they’re involved in. Never force them to continue participating in a sport that is causing them distress.Specific signs of burnout include excuses to skip practice or competitions, never mentioning the sport, and a lack of excitement about participating in activities on and off the field.
If your kid is tired all of the time, isn’t eating well, has lost their appetite, or suffers from frequent nausea and headaches, these may be signs of depression. Encourage them to take it easy for a while, and ask if they’d like to see someone they could talk to about anything they wanted. If so, set up an appointment for them to meet with a mental health professional.

Reading to a child also models a lot of important things about reading: which way to hold a book, how to turn the pages, and the idea that printed words represent sounds and meanings.
Don't be afraid to ham it up when reading to a child. An extra dose of drama adds interest—and reinforces how words and sentences sound.
As your children learn to read, encourage them to ""help"" you find letters and sound out words. You can even drop in little lessons, such as, ""What other word here sounds like 'tree'? That's right, 'see'. Do you see the tree? What letters make that ""ee"" sound?""

, Kids who grow up with books all around them learn to think of books as friends and allies in their pursuit of adventure and learning.

, Let them see you reading, and how much you enjoy reading books and magazines.

, Show them how a good book can expand their knowledge in a particular area, and expand their horizons as well.

, While showing your child books is a good way to build their interest level, a child who finds new books on their own can benefit from an increased sense of independence.

, Show them how a library can be a place of wonder and excitement, and can open up whole new worlds of learning to last a lifetime. And then put the library in your schedule, so you will be sure to visit frequently together.

Check out library books relating to their interest.,
Buy gifts related to the latest interest.,
Incorporate the special interest into everyday purchases.,
Buy things that can help them engage in their interests with others.,
Encourage others to do the same.",How to Encourage an Autistic Person's Special Interests1," They can read about their favorite things at their own leisure, without the expense of constantly buying new books.;
, This will ensure that they like whatever you give them, and they will feel understood and appreciated. Here are some examples of good gifts:


Arts and craft kits (e.g. bead bracelets with cat-shaped beads)
Home and kitchen ware that matches the interest (cat-shaped oven mitts in their favorite color)
Books (a book detailing types of cats)
Outfits (a shirt with a cute cat picture on it)
Toys (a stuffed cat)

, This is particularly easy if you're a parent or guardian. Whenever your child needs something new, see if any have designs related to the special interest. For example, your son could have shirts with pictures of cars, toothpaste with cartoon cars on the tube, car-themed bedsheets, et cetera. Treat it the same way you treat favorite colors or favorite cartoon characters.

, Sharing an interest is not only a good way for you to bond with the autistic person, but for others to bond for them too. For example, if your daughter loves chemistry, you can buy...


Age-appropriate chemistry sets to play with her siblings together
Science books that she can read to her little brother, or that her older sister can read to her
Board games with a science theme
Toys that combine science and one of her siblings' interests (e.g. a dinosaur science kit with her T. Rex-loving brother)

, For instance, when sending birthday invitations, mention the child/teen's special interests, so the attendees can pick out appropriate gifts. Relatives will also appreciate this knowledge, in case they want to bring presents or talk one-on-one with the autistic person.

"
"
Talk about their interests together.,
Set boundaries as needed.,
Find clubs and social opportunities involving their interest.,
Help them find other autistic people.,
Take them to locations relating to the interest.,
Introduce them to people who share the same interests.,
If people laugh at or bully the autistic person, step in.",How to Encourage an Autistic Person's Special Interests2," This is a great way to get to know them and see inside their minds. Ask questions and engage in reciprocal conversation.

, While special interest talk can be a great bonding opportunity, you may find that the autistic person is more energetic than you are. Politely change the subject or bow out as needed.


""I'm feeling a little worn out, so I'm going to get some alone time now.""
""I need to go finish my work. Let's talk more later.""
""Cats are great, but I'm a little tired of talking about them right now. How was your day?""
You can also plan natural breaks: for example, talking about cats during the car ride, and then doing something else afterwards.

, This way, they can learn more about their interests from other experts, and talk with people who love the subject just as much as they do. Search their school, church, and local area for organizations that provide opportunities.

, Autistic people can relate to the intensity of the interest, and finding others like them can improve their self-esteem.

, If your autistic student loves fire trucks, call the fire department and see if they could arrange a class tour. If your son loves dance, take him to see The Nutcracker in the winter.

, Does your friend love to write short stories? Introduce her to your novelist uncle, or hook her up with your essayist/poet friend. This way, they can meet others one-on-one to discuss a topic they both love. They might end up making a very good friend!

, These strategies will help the autistic person find friendly people, but they won't shield them from mean people. Intervene if you see a problem, and comfort the autistic person by telling them that there's nothing wrong with who they are: ""you're okay, they're mean.""


""Hey, he's my friend. Leave him alone.""
""That's rude.""
""There's nothing wrong with being passionate. Stop making fun of her.""
""Lay off.""
""Hey, (autistic person's name), come hang out with me!""

Incorporate special interests into the learning process.They can create great examples and motifs.,
Investigate the field most closely related to the special interests.,
Incorporate the interests into functional play and therapy activities.,
Model good social skills when discussing the interest.,
Explain the difference between talking to someone and talking at someone.,
Realize that they will automatically learn many skills through their special interests.,
Don't overdo the teaching.",How to Encourage an Autistic Person's Special Interests3," For example, if your student loves cars, you could...


Use toy cars to demonstrate basic math facts—from counting to arrays
Drive a toy car around a globe to demonstrate geography and distance
Get a car-themed workbook
Focus physics lessons on car mechanics
Have them build a miniature vehicle using ordinary objects for a science/engineering project

, For example, an autistic person who loves robots might be interested in computer programming or engineering. Focus on these fields to see if the autistic person is interested. It may lead to a fun and fulfilling job someday.

, If you're looking for building blocks to build fine motor skills, pick a set that comes with toy cats so they can build a home for them. If you want to increase strength, turn ""animal walks"" into pretending to be a cat. This will make it especially fun for them.

, Listen well, ask questions, and always be polite. Behave well, and encourage the autistic person to do the same. The following are all important skills:


Nonjudgmental listening
Asking questions
Setting boundaries (e.g. ""I need some alone time"")
Noticing when someone isn't actively engaging with you

, Many autistic people don't automatically pick up this difference. They may talk at people, or may be afraid to talk about their interests at all for fear of being rude.


Say what to watch for (lack of verbal responses, examples of impatient body language, appearing distracted)
Explain how to turn a conversation if the person seems bored (""So how was your weekend?"")
Talk about how to tell when someone is interested, and that it's okay to monologue if their conversation partner wants them to
Explain that it is never bad or wrong to want to share their passions with others.


, These skills will serve them well at school/work and in social situations. They may lay the foundation for a wonderful career!


A teen who scours autism blogs is gaining great research skills and learning to look at multiple sides of an issue.
A boy who goes to theater club is learning how to express himself and make friends.
A girl who plays video games may someday design them.

, Learning and improvement are great, but it should never be at the expense of stability or downtime. Keep things balanced, and make sure there's plenty of time for undirected fun!

Help your child manage stress.",How to Encourage Your Child to Be a Doctor when Grown up," While the idea of having a doctor in the family may be appealing, it is a challenging career that is not for everyone. Reflect on what your child has expressed to you about his or her interests before you encourage him or her to pursue this career path. Some questions you might consider include:


Has your child ever expressed an interest in becoming a doctor?
Does your child have an aptitude for math and science?
What are your motivations for encouraging your child to be a doctor?
Does your child have other passions that might lead to a career?;
, If you have determined that your child already has an interest in becoming a doctor, then the best thing you can do is nurture that interest. There are many ways you can nurture your child's interest in medicine, such as:


Buying your children literature about doctors and medicine. Some doctors write and produce comic books for young children. Consider buying some for your kid.Getting medical related toys. A toy doctor kit may help to nurture your child's interest in becoming a doctor.
Watching medical shows on television. If your child can relate to a character who is a doctor, he or she may become more excited about the profession.

, Your child's school may provide programs that help your child explore future careers. Make an appointment with your child's teacher or principal to ask about career programs in your school.Some schools have children take a career test. If your child takes one, take this as an opportunity to have a natural conversation about what you child wants to be when he or she grows up. You can encourage your child to consider medicine as a career.
On parents' night at your school, a career adviser may come speak to parents. Ask this adviser about encouraging your child's interest in medicine and science. The adviser may have input on how to help your child learn about becoming a doctor.

, Call local hospitals and see if they have any job shadowing programs in place. A hospital may do workshops for children and parents in which doctors talk to kids about medicine. Even if a hospital does not have an official job shadowing program in place, a doctor may be willing to allow your child to shadow him or her for a day.A child may become interested and excited about medicine by interacting with a doctor. Your child can see what it's like to work in a hospital and learn the benefits of a medical career.
Your child will be able to see what a doctor actually does. He or she will be able to watch a doctor interact with patients, deal with medicine, and tackle other challenges of the career.

, These are great places to encourage your child's interests. Keep an eye out for career fairs in your community or in your child's school.At a career fair, you can steer your child towards the medical booths. Have your child talk to doctors, nurses, and other people in the medical community. If booths are giving away any pamphlets, have your child take one. This will give him or her the chance to explore the medical field at home.
If there is a career fair at your child's school, offer to chaperone. That way, you can encourage your child to explore the medical booths during school hours.

, You want your child to look up to doctors. If a child sees doctors as role models, this may make the career path seem enticing. Focus on how doctors help others.Doctors develop qualities like confidence, empathy, and self-motivation. Talk about these qualities when your child visits a doctor. Say something like, ""Isn't Dr. Munro kind? She really understands what you're going through.""
You should also teach your child to value hard work. It takes a lot of work to become a doctor, so talk up a doctor's work ethic. Try saying something like, ""Dr. Munro worked hard to become a doctor and many people respect her for that. If you work hard in school, you could be a doctor just like her.""

, As science and math are vital to a career in medicine, encourage your child to develop a curiosity about the subjects. You can find a lot of moments in daily life related to science and math.Science and math are found virtually everywhere, so point out examples whenever possible. If your child loves sports, for example, talk about the anatomy of an athlete. What muscles and bones does a hockey player need to develop?
Talk about math in terms of everyday things like cooking. You can try doubling a cookie recipe, for example, and have your child figure out how to convert the measurements.

, Many children may protest doing science and math homework because it's ""too hard."" Rather than trying to argue with this, acknowledge that the subjects are hard. Explain to your child that challenges can be fun and exciting.Tell your child a hard problem is not impossible. Say something like, ""Yes, these problems are hard, but think of how exciting it will be to really master this subject. Don't you want to understand how chemistry works?""
You should also let your child know being wrong is not a bad thing. Many children develop anxiety over answering a question wrong. To this, say something like, ""A lot of scientists came up with wrong answers to questions for years. Part of the scientific process is being wrong sometimes."" A wrong answer should be seen as a learning opportunity rather than a failure.

, There are probably many places in your community where your child could learn about math and science. Make a point of visiting these places with your child over the summer and on the weekends.Take your child to a local museum, aquarium, planetarium, zoo, and science center. Your child will have fun, while being exposed to math and science as subjects.
Programs like 4-H, the Girl Scouts, and Boys and Girls Club may sometimes have community events. Some of these events may be aimed at teaching children about math and science. Try taking your child to one of these events.

, You may not have loved math and science yourself as a child. That's okay. However, speaking negatively about the subjects may discourage your child's interests.Do not say things like, ""I was never interested in math as a kid"" or ""I got the worst grades in these subjects."" This may make your child see failure or disinterest as inevitable.
Help your child understand he or she can succeed in these subjects, even if they're hard. Try saying something like, ""I struggled with math as a kid, but I'm so glad I stuck it out and got better.""

, You cannot completely control a child's development. While you may want to push math, science, and medicine, your child needs some independence. Try to be accepting and understanding of your child's interests, even if they deviate from the path you have planned.For example, you may want your child to spend the summer at a science camp hosted by a local museum. Your child says he or she wants to attend art camp instead.
Art camp may not be part of your plan, but remember your child is an individual. Encouraging his or her interests and success is important, but you need to let your child have some independence. If you double down and insist on science camp, you're not letting your child explore his or her own interests.
Try to reach a compromise. Let your child attend art camp, but encourage him or her to explore science on the side. Remember, you have to think about what your child wants rather than what you want. You may envision a certain future for your son or daughter. However, you need to give your child a chance to do what will ultimately make him or her happy.

, You want your child enrolled in as many math and science courses as possible. This will help him or her start developing the proper skill set for a career in medicine.Look into any advanced placement classes your school offers. See if you can enroll your child in an advanced track that focuses on math and science.
See if your school offers summer programs. Your child could take some additional math and science courses over summer break. If your school does not have summer courses, ask teachers and school officials for suggestions. They may know of local summer programs offered to children in your area.

, STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and math. These areas are important if your child wants a career in medicine.See what extracurriculars are offered at your school. Ask your child, other parents, and teachers for lists of extracurriculars.
Look for extracurriculars that focus on math and science. If your school has a science club, for example, this would be an excellent place for your child to develop his or her skill set as a doctor.

, Your child may struggle with certain subjects. As you want to make sure your child has an outstanding academic record, a private tutor can help. One-on-one attention can allow your child to succeed academically in all areas.Figure out what type of tutor you need. Make sure the tutor you choose has experience teaching your child's grade level. If you're looking for a tutor in a specific subject, check a potential tutor's credentials in that subject.
You can find tutors online, through friends, through your child's school, or through local branches of programs like Sylvan and Kumon.
Meet with a variety of tutors before selecting one. You want to ask a variety of questions to make sure a tutor is a good match for your child.

, It can be stressful to pursue a career in medicine. The academic requirements are strict, so your child may frequently feel overwhelmed in school. Work on helping your child with basic stress management techniques.Pay attention to how you talk to your child. You do not want to phrase anything in terms that encourage anxiety. Do not say, ""If you don't get good grades, you will not get into a good school."" This will stress your child out. Instead, say, ""Good grades can help you succeed.""
Help your child manage his or her emotions. Allow your child to feel what he or she feels. Explain it's okay to feel angry, scared, or frustrated. Let your child know that he or she has a choice regarding how these emotions affect him or her. Try to give your child healthy means of expressing frustration and fear.
Model good behavior. Try to manage stress effectively in your own life. Your child will learn a lot of good coping techniques by watching you.

Have meaningful conversations and understand your child.,
Understand the stresses and challenges of both team and individual sports.,
Be a positive role model by being physically active.,
Show your interest in the sport or sports your child plays.,
Encourage your child to try out several different sports.,
Try not to overdo it or put on too much pressure.",How to Encourage Your Child to Do Well in Sports1," Knowing how your child thinks and feels is key to offering them encouragement. Whether you’re motivating them to practice a sport or to do homework, it’s important to know their strengths, weaknesses, habits, and desires.Show your child that you respect how they think and what they want, and that you want to take the time to listen to how they feel.
Ask them what, if any, sports they’d like to play and what expectations they have. Try to understand what they want to get out of any activity.
Your child might say, “I want to be the best basketball player that ever played the game,” and your reaction should certainly be positive. While it’s best avoid knocking them down by telling them their goals are impossible, try to emphasize how working hard for something is a good thing in itself.
Tell them that the effort they put in and the fun they have while doing so is valuable just for their own sake.;
, Team sports can involve unique social pressures, especially when just starting a sport or joining a new team. While some children enjoy being part of a team, having to do an activity in front of people, especially strangers, can be daunting or embarrassing for others.In individual sports, a child can often become their own worst critic, and can come to believe that their personal performance will determine what their parents or coach thinks of them.Getting to know your child will help you understand whether they’re more comfortable with team or individual activities.
Understanding the specific pressures associated with each can help you turn negative stressors into positive motivations. For example, if your child is afraid of looking like they’re not good at something in front of their team, encourage them to work hard and practice to master that skill or ability.Whether the pressure involves impressive teammates or beating their own best time, challenge them to perform to their best ability, but remind them that sometimes you can work hard at something for a long time and still not master it., Being physically active yourself is the most direct way of encouraging your child to value practicing a sport and being active in general. You’re your child that everyone, from kids to adults, has to keep doing something over and over again in order to become successful. In addition to leading with your actions, explain how every muscle and every skill needs to be exercised., You don’t need to be a pro in order to help them stay motivated to develop their own skills. Practice together whenever you can. Spend time on the weekends together practicing, or schedule a few times during week.


Go and see games together. Look for professional, college, high school, or whatever level of competition is available in your town.

, Some coaches prefer that kids specialize in a sport early, but it’s best to let your child try out a number of different activities, even into their teenage years. If they enjoy being active, sampling a variety will help them get to know themselves, what they like, and what their best abilities are.In addition to finding out what they’re good at, trying out different sports is also healthier, typically exercises different muscle groups, and puts them at a lesser risk of injury.You might also try checking in regularly with your child to see if they still enjoy the sport. Try asking questions like, ""How's basketball going?"" ""Do you still have fun at the games?"" and ""Do you still like your teammates and coach?"" If your child says they are not enjoying the sport any more, then you might suggest trying something new once the season is over.
Make sure that you also express acceptance if your child just doesn't like the sport. For example, you might say something like, ""That's okay. There are some sports that I don't like too. You'll find your thing!""

, While it’s great to encourage your child to participate in several different sports and to spend a lot of time practicing, it’s important to remain balanced. Keep an eye on how much time they spend practicing or how much energy they put into one thing. Remember, school, homework, free time with friends, personal or down time at home, and quality time with family are just as important as practicing for a big game.Help your child balance their schedule and divide time properly, and remind them that practicing too hard can result in injury, becoming overtired, or losing interest in an activity.
Avoid putting too much pressure on your child to practice. Keep them engaged with positive motivation, by setting a good example, by practicing with them, and by being a great cheerleader, but don’t treat any activity as a life or death situation. Avoid treating practice like it’s a chore.

Watch how your child expresses himself or herself.,
Consider your child’s interests.,
See how your child solves problems.,
Make cautious assumptions based on genetics.,
Talk to teachers and people who interact with your child regularly.,
Take learning-style quizzes.,
Match your child’s learning style with your teaching style.,
Find programs that cater to your child’s strengths.,
Teach your child to study based on his or her learning style.,
Don’t completely limit your child to a single learning style.",How to Determine Your Child's Learning Style," When a child is more comfortable learning in a certain style, he or she will also be more expressive through that same style. For instance, auditory learners express themselves best through words. At times, it may seem as if auditory learners aren’t paying attention because they are always trying to talk over you. Kids who are auditory learners also have a tendency to read out loud instead of quietly to themselves.Visual learners are more apt to express themselves and reveal their emotions through facial expressions, and may seem to be always watching others’ faces. By watching others, a visual learner is actually storing these images for future use.Kinesthetic learners express themselves through body language, and may seem unable to keep their hands to themselves. They often imitate others, particularly when it comes to movement (such as hand gestures and walking style).Also, these types of learners don’t worry about getting their hands dirty. They like to touch everything, whether it’s people or objects.;
, A child’s primary learning style is also normally reflected in his or her interests. For instance, auditory learners usually show an interest in music and sounds. They may be able to remember all the words to numerous songs, while possibly struggling to remember what they just read in a book. They may be easily distracted by noises and loud sounds, usually find games and activities far more exciting when music is involved, and probably love music class in school.Visual learners often have interests both in reading and watching TV, due to the common thread of visual stimulation. They may also enjoy looking at photographs and other interesting objects. Visual learners often have extensive vocabularies (due to their time spent reading) and may have imaginations that are equally large.Look for an interest in physical activities with kinesthetic learners. They like to do everything from swimming and running to playing baseball or basketball. Gym or art class may be kinesthetic learners’ favorite subjects, as they are able to keep their hands busy. These types of learners also enjoy games, but often can’t sit still long enough to read.

, We all draw from our strengths when attempting to solve problems, so kids tend to utilize the attributes that correlate to their learning styles. Auditory learners tend to talk through and discuss possible solutions to problems, for instance. You may hear them mumbling to themselves as they tackle homework assignments, or they may ask you to help talk them through a tough math problem.Visual learners use their eyes to solve problems, which means they quickly notice if something is out of place or amiss. They often excel at matching games or anything that tests their ability to look at something and identify changes at a later point in time. They also tend to keep a neat and tidy room, as they are quick to observe things that are out of place.Kinesthetic learners will usually try to solve problems with their hands. For instance, they may count with their fingers while trying to solve math problems. They often like flash cards as a learning tool, since they can interact with and touch the cards. They often love science projects and building contraptions meant to do a specific task., Blanket assumptions should always be avoided when it comes to children and especially how they learn; there are plenty of exceptions to every rule. However, there is good evidence that females are more likely to be auditory learners, while males tend to be visual learners. Factor this into your initial assessment, but don’t write it in stone.Even as babies, girls are often more responsive to sounds and learn to talk earlier (because they listen more intently), and they tend to take up reading more quickly once in school. Boys are often more visually alert as babies and tend to pick up on spatial concepts like spelling and math more quickly. But again, don’t make simplistic assumptions.
If you want to avoid assumptions based on “girls are better at this, boys are better at this” evidence, focus more on the reality that learning styles run in families. Most children will have a learning style that matches that of one parent, or occasionally may have a blend of styles from both parents. So, if you can identify both yourself and the child’s other parent as visual learners, there is a good chance that the child is one as well.

, No matter how active you are as a parent or how closely you observe your own child, sometimes other people will pick up on tendencies and indications that you miss. A daycare provider, preschool teacher, or pediatrician (to name a few examples) may be able to provide keen insights into your child’s learning tendencies.


You’ll want your kid’s teachers to be involved in shaping your child’s learning experience after you determine his or her learning style anyway, so involve them earlier in the process as well by asking for their insights on your child.A preschool teacher, for instance, may be able to tell you that your child understands the notion of subtraction best when visual cues (like blocks) are used; tends to repeat what he or she has just heard as a mechanism for remembering; or thrives in hands-on learning activities. Such qualities provide strong clues for a dominant learning style., Unless there is a concern about a potential learning disability or other issue, a child’s learning style is not something that typically needs to be professionally diagnosed. If you are content as a parent with a “more than likely” assessment based primarily on your own knowledge of your child, you may want to take one of several quizzes that can help provide initial indications. Search reputable child- and family-focused websites for short, multiple-choice tests about your kid’s habits and behaviors.You’ll encounter questions similar to: “While in the waiting area prior to a doctor’s appointment, your child … A) colors or draws pictures in relative silence; B) spends most of the time talking to you and possibly others in the room; C) unloads the box of toys in the waiting room and quickly shifts interest from one item to another.”
For a question like the above, answer “A” indicates a visual learner, “B” an auditory learner, and “C” a kinesthetic learner.

, Whether you homeschool your child or just provide help with homework it’s helpful to match your teaching style to your child’s learning style.


The best way to teach auditory learners is through verbal instruction and reading out loud. You should also incorporate songs or music into your teaching style. For example, if you want them to memorize a scientific equation, try putting it into a song.
The best way to teach visual learners is through visual aids, flashcards and educational videos. For example, if you are trying to teach them state capitals, draw a map of the U.S., outline the states and indicate where the capitals are located.
The best way to teach kinesthetic learners is by allowing them to do hands-on projects. For example, if you’re trying to teach them about volcanoes, have them build an actual model of a volcano., When choosing an educational program for your child, find one that complements his or her learning style.For auditory learners, traditional educational programs tend to work best. However, you may also want to consider enrolling your child in an educational program which focuses on music or has a strong music department. If there are magnet schools in your area, look for one that specializes in music.
For visual learners, traditional educational programs also work well. However, in some areas there are magnet schools which focus on the visual and performing arts.
For kinesthetic learners, a Montessori program may fit their learning style best. These types of programs take a more hands on approach to learning. You can find Montessori programs in your area by conducting a search online for “Montessori schools near me.”

, In addition to choosing the right teaching method and educational program to suit your child’s learning style, it is equally helpful to teach your child how to study based on that style.For auditory learners, have them create rhymes to memorize information, such as facts and dates. If possible, have them record lectures so that they can study by listening to the recordings.
For visual learners, have them use flashcards when memorizing information. They can also study using their textbooks, particularly ones with graphs, pictures and charts.
For kinesthetic learners, have them use flashcards to study, particularly when learning facts, dates and processes. Encourage them to take breaks when studying, as they need more time to process information (and often to release pent-up energy).

, Nearly every kid has a dominant learning style, but that doesn’t mean they can’t learn in other ways. Also, a well-rounded individual needs to be able to acquire and utilize information in a wide range of ways, including through listening, looking, and doing.Complement the child’s learning style with elements of the other major styles. Utilize flash cards with auditory learners and read aloud to visual learners. Help kinesthetic learners recognize that not every learning activity can be hands-on.
Learning styles are not set in stone, and can sometimes shift as a child develops and matures. So don’t assume that an auditory learner will always be strictly so; expose him or her to other learning styles all along the way.

Try to use the same language after a win or a loss.,
Prepare your child for losing or getting cut from the team.,
Don’t be the coach after a tough loss.",How to Encourage Your Child to Do Well in Sports2," It’s certainly not a bad thing to be overjoyed if your child scores a winning goal. However, win or lose, there are certain things you should always say before and after a game.Before any game, tell your child, “Have fun, play hard, and I love you.”
After any game, ask your child, “Did you have fun?” and say, “I’m proud of you and I love you.”
Remind them how excited you every time you get a chance just to see them in uniform or in a huddle.
Emphasize your child's effort, whether they won or lost. For example, you might say something like, ""You did a great job of supporting your teammates out there today. I am really proud of how you played the game.""
Try to help your child reframe the situation when they experience a loss. For example, you might say, ""I know it's disappointing not to win, but your passing was awesome! You've worked so hard on it and I can really see your improvement.""

, Even if your child works hard at something, they will face obstacles in any sport, whether they haven’t made the team or suffered a lopsided defeat. Prepare your child by reminding them that everyone has their time to shine, and it’s okay that today wasn’t their day.If your child is really interested in a sport but doesn’t make a team, try to keep them engaged. Continue to practice with them, look for an instructional or less competitive league, find a sports camp, and encourage them to try out next year.
Remind them to keep things in perspective, and that not making a team doesn’t define who they are or how proud you are of them just for trying.

, Being critical and breaking down where the game went wrong isn’t generally helpful. Instead, try focusing on what your child did correctly, what skills you noticed while they were on the field, and on highlighting any especially fun moments you noticed. Concentrating on positivity and fun aspects of the game will help motivate your child to give it their all again next time, regardless of whether they win or lose.Whether it’s an individual or team sport, your child has a coach. Let them give the tough talk and be critical.
Your child will need you to help them make the loss easier to handle. Kids often have trouble separating a negative event from their identity: they think the loss defines who they are.
Make sure they know how proud you are of them win or lose, and give them affection and attention. It’s best not to let your child be alone after losing, and try to talk to them or keep them talking. Being silent might indicate that you’re mad at them, and too much alone time might cause them to dwell."
"
Be the team’s biggest fan.,
Teach your child what good competition is.,
Use competition as a means of building your child’s self-esteem and social skills.",How to Encourage Your Child to Do Well in Sports3," When attending a team sporting event or practice, be a cheerleader for the entire team. Avoid encouraging negative competition among the players, and don’t undermine the coach’s instructions. You don’t want to make your child or other kids think it’s okay to treat each other with disrespect, or to undermine the coach’s authority.Whenever another child scores a goal or makes a great play, cheer for them just as you would your own child.
Try to communicate with other parents about being a great support system for all the kids on the team: create a strong community and family atmosphere.

, Encouraging competition can be an effective way to motivate your child to do their best, as long as you define what healthy competition is. Explain to them how valuable it is to challenge themselves and to always try to exceed their personal best. Don’t focus on doing better than other kids, but place emphasis on reaching their own potential.When encouraging your child to compete against themselves, don’t define competition and success on winning and losing alone. Put the emphasis on acquiring and developing skills and abilities.
Show respect for the differences between all kids’ skill levels and developmental stages. Avoid comparisons between kids of different ages and abilities.

, Remember that sports are for having fun, developing self-esteem, social skills, and a sense of community.Encourage your child to be competitive and want to work hard to improve abilities, but not for the outcome of winning alone. Help them to set and define goals for the purpose of developing their sense of self and helping them to take pride in their accomplishments. Help them understand that it’s wrong to use competitiveness or being great at something as a means of putting others down.


Tell them how important you think it is to help another person work on a particular task once you’ve mastered that task. Give them an example of how you became good at something, then took the time to share that skill with another person.

Give boys an emotional vocabulary, as they are not generally encouraged to talk or think about feelings as girls are.,
Listen to him.,

Praise him.,
Help him identify his strengths, as boys with low esteem don't know or even realise they have them!,
Help him to be himself.,
Let him feel successful.,
Look at your own self esteem.,
Finished.

",How to Develop Your Son's Self Esteem," They often simply lack the words to express emotion. (A classic example is when children complain of tummy aches when just miserable.) So teaching him to say when he feels angry, frustrated, sad, happy or lonely may appear odd but it is vital that these channels of communication are opened. Your son must know that it's OK and healthy to have and talk about these feelings.;
, Parenting is taking time to listen. Feeling that we have been heard and understood is vital for self esteem. When he tells you something, stop what you are doing and look at him. Acknowledge that you heard him by repeating his words back - tell him what he has told you. It sounds strange, but it shows you listen to him. This way, when he grows up, he'll feel worth listening to.

, Boys with low esteem benefit from you taking the time to appreciate what they enjoy - be it playing football, studying science, collecting models, hiking, music or swimming.

, Let him know that he is appreciated, and don't wait for him to do something special - just take the five seconds it takes to say - thank you darling, you did that really well.

, They don't know that being kind, helpful, sensitive and friendly are strengths, as they are focused on the physical.

, He faces daily pressures to macho, usually a football playing-mountain hiking-rugged-outdoors type, which doesn't suit everyone. Some like drama, music, reading and art. High self esteem comes from knowing who you are and liking that person.

, Boys with low self esteem often regularly experience failure, often because they are smaller, less coordinated, slower to understand or shy. Find something he excels in and encourage him with it. Boys with literacy issues might have great ball skills; one with poor motor skills might be a great communicator.

, Do you run yourself down? Are you shy and nervous? If you don't think highly of yourself, your son might be learning low self esteem from you. Don't put yourself down over it - address it! It's not your fault that no one helped you to see yourself positively, but it is within your power to seek help.

IQ tests are designed to give you a general idea of your child’s intelligence. In this sense, intelligence is defined as cognitive abilities and the quickness that a person processes information. Fundamentally, IQ tests are supposed to measure broad intelligence, not general knowledge.


If you choose to have your child take an IQ test, do so knowing that it is just one form of evaluation used to gauge natural abilities and talent.
Know that IQ tests may not give you a full or accurate reading of your child’s abilities. It should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluation to ascertain the full scope of your child’s abilities.
Understand that IQ tests have been criticized as biased towards certain cultural and ethnic group, and should be given in the language that your child is most proficient in.;
, Aptitude tests are another type of formal evaluation that gauge your child’s natural abilities and talents. Aptitude tests are used to measure a person’s ability to develop skill or proficiency in a certain task or subject area. In this, many aptitude tests are different than IQ tests in that they will give you a better idea of your child’s ability to master certain subjects, skills, or ways of thinking., Take some time to gather your child’s current and past grades and evaluate them. Try to look at patterns over time in certain subject areas like english, math, science, and social studies. This should give you an idea about your child's proficiency and ability. However, when coming to a conclusion about your child’s grades, you should remember that while grades give you an idea of ability, they also reflect other factors:


Your child’s interest.
Teacher ability.
The timing and environment that the subject is introduced in., No matter what grade your child is in (daycare, pre-K or K-12), your child’s teachers and other supervisory figures can give you a great idea of your child’s interests and abilities. After all, teachers and caregivers (depending on the environment) might spend more time in an educational and mentoring capacity with your child than you.


Schedule a meeting with your child’s teacher or caregiver.
Ask them about your child’s interest and abilities.
Ask them if they think there is a reason why your child excels in one area or does not excel in another., One of the best ways to discover your child’s abilities is to have your child explore and engage in a wide variety of dramatically different activities. You can do this through formal or informal means. This way, not only will you be able to see how your child performs in different types of situations, but you’ll also be able to see what your child is most interested in.


Consider signing your child up for athletic activities, artistic activities, and intellectual activities.
Suggest activities to your child, but if they refuse to go, you should reconsider the activity.
While having your child sign up for many extracurricular activities is a good thing, make sure that your child is not over-committed and still has time to be a kid.
Make sure your child plays with peers and friends of different cultural and socio-economic levels. You never know when someone from a different background will introduce an activity that your child will excel at., Take time to watch your child play and observe how your child plays and what your child does. Don't assume that your child's play is trivial or meaningless. A child will act and play in ways that may reflect differing natural, individual interests, intelligences and abilities. When you observe your child:


Make a journal of interesting things your child does when at play. What characterizes your child’s play? Is she thoughtful and deliberate or is she dramatic and emotional? This could give you great insight into her abilities.
Think about the subject relevance or career relevance of what your child is doing. If your child likes to sort her Legos by colors and plans her building down to the smallest detail, perhaps she has natural organizational abilities.
Observe your child at different types of play. See how she plays with other children, too., Often times, your child will articulate the best insight into her own abilities. Don’t discount the fact that your child may actually know her and her talents better than anyone else. At the very least, your child will know her own likes and dislikes, which are often as important as natural talent.


Ask your child what academic subjects she thinks she is best at as well as which she enjoys the most. Make sure you differentiate between enjoyment and talent.
Ask your child if she thinks she’s good at any sports as well as which sports she enjoys the most.
Ask your child if she thinks she is good at art and if she enjoys doing artistic things.
Your child may not be able to articulate what she is good at. However, if she enjoys certain activities, this may point to a talent she is unaware of., In the early 1980s Howard Gardner began to change the education world by publishing his book entitled ""Theory of Multiple Intelligences."" His theory at first established seven intelligences. He believes that each person varies by experiencing and expressing intelligence in different areas. He identified areas involved in the brain by mapping brain activity and as observed in broad cultural acceptance of varying abilities or intelligences and distinguishing the person's reactions to, interest in and ease of using concepts related to these intelligences.

, Think about whether your child has excellent visual and spatial ability. People with great visual and spatial ability might not demonstrate excellence in other types of activities, but do shine when they focus on activities that are very visual. People with this sort of intelligence can be tracked into certain career paths in which they can be very successful. Consider:


Does your child like to design things, look at maps, draw or doodle?
Your child might enjoy activities that enable them to create models or charts.
Your child might have a budding career as an architect or graphic designer., Interpersonal intelligence is defined as an individual's ability to socialize and interact with other people. Not everyone is gifted in this ability. If your child has strong interpersonal abilities then you might want to enroll them in specific programs that nurture this gift. Consider:


They might enjoy leading or organizing efforts.
See if your child is interested in extracurricular activities like Model United Nations or student government.
Your child might have a career in sales, leadership, or politics in store for them., People with intrapersonal intelligence are really good at understand themselves, their motivations, and they often look inward for direction and guidance. Children with intrapersonal intelligence might be more introverted rather than extroverted and may not be interested in group activities or socializing as much as other children.


If your child demonstrates intrapersonal intelligence, they might be interested in self-directed learning, reading, and cause-and-effect analysis.
Your child might be a gifted writer or thinker. Consider enrolling them in a creative writing program or encouraging them to start a collection.
Try not to discourage your child's self-directed activities. They might just be figuring out the world on their own terms., Logical or mathematical thinkers are often very deliberate in their thinking. They reason things out. They calculate activities and consider consequences. If you believe your child is a logical or mathematical thinker, you should nurture their abilities. Consider:


Does your child think in the abstract sense?
Does your child like to explore the connections between things and people?
Your child might like to experiment with things and solve problems.
Your child might have a career as a scientist or mathematician in store., Bodily-kinethetic thinkers have a high level of control over their body, hand-eye coordination, and their range of motion. They can handle tools and objects with precision and skill. In addition, consider:


Does your child like to build things by hand, and can they use their hands with precision?
Bodily-kinethetic thinkers communicate and learn well through physical activity.
Children who have bodily-kinethetic intelligence might be good things where they can use their hands or physically build things. They might be great surgeons, mechanics, or sculptors., People with linguistic intelligence demonstrate a high command of language and words. They can articulate ideas well, can learn by listening and reading, and often enjoy communicating with others. Try not to confuse linguistic intelligence with a troublesome child who talks back. They might just be trying to learn or communicate.


Children who are linguistic learners might like writing and reciting poetry, public speaking, or reading.
Your child might be a budding politician or poet.
Nurture linguistic learners by enrolling them in activities in which they write, read, or perform., People with musical intelligence are extremely sensitive to sound, rhythms and all things aural. They are often drawn toward music and things musical.


Does your child demonstrate a fascination with music?
Can your child play musical instruments with skill or sing with perfect pitch?
Consider enrolling your child in music lessons or have them join chorus or band at school."

Figure out their other obligations, like the amount of time they need to spend on homework for school, or time they need to spend practicing for extracurricular activities.

This is important, as the internet offers a wide variety of potential dangers to children. Make sure that:


If they are cyberbullied, they let you know. At the same time, they should not engage in cyberbullying. This is especially important for children between the ages of 8 and 13, who may be spending a lot of time on the internet.
They should not engage in “sexting.” Make this clear to children ages 11 and up.
Tell them they’re not allowed to use Snapchat and similar applications when they are alone in their bedroom. You may ban the applications for children under the age of 16.
They should not divulge personal information, such as their full name, address, phone number, or their school to people they meet online. Say something like ""There are a lot of dangerous people on the internet who try to pretend to be people they aren't."", The first thing you should do is initiate a conversation about creating a plan. This talk is intended to introduce the idea of the plan and provide them with basic information about it.


Explain the need for the plan in rational terms. Let them know that it is designed to protect them and help them manage their obligations.
Discuss what the plan will do. For example, explain that the plan will limit their usage of certain media formats., You also need to spend time calmly and rationally explaining your expectations for how they will behave when using media and communications technology. Let them know:


That they need to act responsibly and within the bounds you have set for them online.
If there is any type of media content you want them to avoid. For instance, you may not want your 12-year-old child to play graphic first-person shooter video games. Explain to them that you think this desensitizes them to violence.
Share any other concerns or expectations you may have for their behavior., Before drafting your plan, you need to consider and then take steps to incorporate your child’s thoughts about it. By using their input to design the plan, you’ll get them on board with it. This will make it easier to enforce the plan.


Think about your child’s concerns about the plan and weigh them. For instance, if your child has a deep desire to be able to watch a certain TV program, you should probably allow them unless it interferes with something substantial.
Implement as much of their feedback as possible, while still maintaining your objectives.
When you can’t incorporate something your child has strong feelings about, explain it to them. For instance, if they want to be able to play Xbox for two hours after school every day, say: “I know how much you want to play, but I think that is a bit excessive and it will likely hurt your studies. Let’s try an hour and see how that works.”, After you’ve talked to your child and determined the goals of the plan, you need to put the plan down on paper. By putting it down on paper, you’ll make sure everyone is clear about the details and parameters of the plan. Remember to be as specific as possible.


List the amount of media use time your child will have every day. If you’d rather a weekly number, provide that. For instance, you may want to say they have one hour a day or seven hours a week.
List the activities they are not allowed to engage in, or limitations on certain activities like Snapchat.
Specify which devices they can use, when they can use them, and where they can use them., After crafting the plan, you need to print it and post it. By making the plan readily visible, you’ll remind both you and your child of the specifics. You’ll probably notice that making the plan visible will encourage your child to follow it.


Print the plan and post it in a public place in your home.
Give a copy to your child.
Share the plan with any other adults in a position of authority, like a significant other, or grandparents., You should make your child an active part in both the plan’s design and discussions over how it is implemented or changed. By including your child, you’ll help give them ownership of the plan. Thus, they’ll likely respect it more and abide by it.


Ask your child to be part of creating the plan. Say “Would you please help me design the plan? I think it’ll work a lot better with your input.”
Consider your child’s concerns and hesitations about the plan., Your discussion of the plan should not end with designing the plan together. You need to make sure to continue discussion about the plan while using it. By holding periodic conversations about the plan, you’ll be able to adapt it based on changing circumstances.


Keep a dialogue ongoing about the plan during the first several weeks of its implementation. This way, you’ll have a good idea about how it is impacting the life of your child.
Talk to your child about the plan every couple of weeks. Keep your mind open to their input. In fact, consider asking “Do you think we need to change the plan at all?”

, Media use plans are not intended to be used in a static way forever. Make sure to change and adjust the plan based on changes in your child’s schedule, obligations, and maturity.


Reconsider the plan at the beginning of every school year.
Consider tweaking the plan after report cards. If your child is very successful, consider giving them more TV, gaming, or internet time. If your child is not successful academically, lower their media use time., You can also program your electronics to shut off, block use, or require a password. By doing this, you’ll take away the temptation of your kid accessing media that they shouldn’t be using under their media use plan.


Set your router to block your kids’ internet protocol addresses after a certain time. For instance, if your program states that they won’t have access to the internet after 8PM, have your wireless router disconnect them at that time.
Have your TV lock after a certain time. If your media use plan states that your kids aren’t allowed to use the TV after 8PM, have it lock itself with a password after that time.
Password protect tablets and cellphones. Unlock them for young children when they’re allowed to use them.
Block certain apps like Snapchat from your child’s phone., While you may be able to block your kids use of the internet or cable after a certain time, you may not be able to take this approach with general cell phone or computer use – they’ll still be able to watch downloaded movies, play video games, and more. To solve this problem, have your kids log their own use.


Keep a media use journal in the kitchen or in the living room. Have your child fill it out on a daily basis.
Try not to scrutinize the journal for minor overuses – let your child know that you just want to use it to monitor their habits.

, One of the easiest ways to enforce the plan is to employ the honor system. Under the honor system, you’ll trust your child to use or not use media depending on what their media use plan stats.


Central to using the honor system is communication. Make sure you explain your expectations and maintain communication about them.
Tell your child you trust them to monitor their own use. Say something like “I trust you to abide by our plan.”
This approach might be best for more mature children or ones who have shown themselves to be very responsible. You might be able to judge this based on your child’s responsibility when it comes to doing their chores on time or succeeding at school.

Think about memory storage.,
Scrutinize the battery life.",How to Choose an Android Device for Your Child," Your kid will most likely have to look at the device for hours either for reading lectures or taking down lesson notes. Pick one that has a large screen, enough that it wouldn’t strain their eyes even after using it for long periods.


Android devices like Samsung Galaxy Tabs or Google Nexus tablets should fit the requirements.
If the school required the purchase, then ask the administration if there’s any particular unit that you need to buy. This will save you time on having to figure out which Android unit to get.;
, If your kid’s going to use the Android device just for entertainment purposes like video games, listening to music, and watching videos, then basic units like the entry level Samsung Galaxy series (Fame, Y, etc.) should be enough as it has enough hardware power to support most Android app games.

, If your child needs to use the Android device for special cases like supplementing physical disabilities, then you need to base the unit you’re going to buy on the specific situation you have.


In example, if your kid has speech defects or is mute and needs a device to aid him or her to communicate, buy an Android tablet—or any unit—with a large screen that he or she can use to conveniently write messages on.

, Your child won’t need extremely expensive Android gadgets, even if they’re going to use it for school. You also have to take into consideration that they won’t be able to take care of it as much as you could. Buy one that won’t be too expensive to replace in case it gets lost or damaged.

, Consider your kid’s physical attributes. You don’t want your five year-old son or daughter dragging a massive 10-inch tablet around the house, school, or anywhere they need to go. Buy a unit that they can easily carry and use anywhere, anytime.


Android devices are known for portability and mobility so this should be one of the factors that you need to consider.

, Get an Android device that’s lightweight and easy to carry around.


The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro series are all lightweight and extremely thin. Your kid would hardly notice it inside their bags.

, The storage capacity of the device you’re going to purchase depends on how your kid will be using it. If it’s for school, buy a unit with enough space to save all their lessons.


Every Android brands have units that have expandable memory feature wherein you can use an external memory card to expand its storage capacity. Ask the salesperson if the Android device you’re going to purchase has this feature.

, If your child’s going to use it out of the house most of the time, then pick a device that has a longer lasting battery life and will take some considerable amount of time before it needs to be recharged.


LG Android phones, like the G series, are known for its long battery life span.

Provide positive guidance to your child.",How to Keep Your Child Tech Safe," As an adult, you have the responsibility of guiding your children on technology use. But consider why before setting up rules.


Balancing real life and technology use. Unrestricted screen time is harmful to children, and it is addicting. Children need limits to help them not spend all day in front of screens.
Appropriate material. The internet has a tremendous amount of wonderful material for young audience. Unfortunately, it is also full of sites, games, and images that are wholly inappropriate.
Cyber crime. The internet can take advantage of individuals unwary of bad practices like viruses, games with in-app purchases, identity theft, pedophiles, and the like. Children are very easy targets, because they are trusting and not very savvy about such things.
Social networking. With social networking, there is a lot of great benefits to being able to network with friends and family. For teens, it is often a primary way of communication and not having access to it can be socially problematic. However, having it has raised several problems:
Cyberbullying. Bullying online happens, and since it happens silently on the screen parents can be completely unaware that a child is being bullied, is being a bully, or a bystander.
Sexting and other photos. Young children and teens can take photos and send them easily. What they may not consider is that once a photo is sent, it is out of the child's control. Even with Snapchat (where the photo is posted temporarily), one cannot be certain the recipient is the one intended.;
, There is a big cognitive difference between a five year old and a fifteen year old. A child that's overly trusting may need some restrictions on what they do online, and be limited to using non-online apps.


If your child is age five, for example, it would be better to block all non-game or non-learning sites and restrict device time to one hour per day. When your child is sixteen, however, this is often seen as far too restrictive.
The general responsibility level of your child. Kids and teens vary a lot in what they can handle in terms of responsibility. Tailor your rules on technology based on the level of responsibility your child consistently shows. (However, understand that responsibility is not quite the same as judgement. A child can be very responsible, but still not yet quite have the judgement to negotiate the internet in the same way as an older child.)
Consider the appropriateness of games, applications, and the like. Even if your 7 year old is old enough to play a first-person-shooter game, it does not mean it is appropriate for them.

, One fourteen year old may be very responsible, while another not. Guidelines for one child may not be appropriate for another--you as a parent are generally the best judge.


This can be a tricky thing, especially with multiple children in the household close in age. Keep in mind, too, that children will often share or sneak in time with another family member's device.
Even responsible children can get into trouble online, and not understand how or why. (Such as posting photos, chat features, downloading games). Even the most responsible child or teen needs to be monitored.

, Technology should not be a giant list of ""don't""'s, but you'll want to set some ground rules for your child so that they get a basic idea of what they should and shouldn't do online. Make sure the list of rules is age-appropriate (""no accessing websites without checking with a parent"" may be good for a child in early elementary school, but sounds ridiculous in high school) and there are consequences for violating these rules.


A sample list for a preteen may look something like:

No downloading software or apps or buying in-app purchases without permission. This may include free apps as well. The parent needs to know what programs are on.
No installing programs on the computer without a parent's knowledge. (Be aware sometimes this can happen by accident on certain sites without the child realizing he or she downloaded a game, however.)
No tampering with programs installed by a parent (e.g. antivirus software, parental controls).
No accessing sites that are not known and trusted. The parent decides what is known and trusted.
No texting or IM'ing people you've only just met online. (For younger children the rule might be only doing so with family.)
No use of the internet to bully or harass others, whether they're known in person or not.
Parents have the right to access technology at any time, for any reason. This for reasons of monitoring what is being accessed, usage, and so on. The parent is ultimately responsible for what the child is doing, and is paying for usage and the device, so this is the rule. That does not mean the parent should be a tyrant about this, but it should be clear that the device is monitored.


Try to base these rules on past behavior, as stated above.

, Some parents allow their children to sign up for social media sites when they're under the age of 13 (which is the age restriction for most social media sites, due to child privacy laws), while others forbid their child from using social media until a certain age, if at all. This choice is completely up to you, but it should be made responsibly. Additionally, anyone-whether over 13 or under-should never use social media in a way that endangers them or others, or bullies people; make a rule with your child or teen that if they are found behaving this way, their social media privilege will be revoked.


As a general rule, a child under the age of 10 probably should not be on social media sites such as Facebook. Because your child is still fairly young, they may not properly understand that what you put on social media is out there forever, and they may make some bad choices.
Those under 13 that are allowed on social media should have their accounts supervised to make sure that they're not abusing the accounts.

Only check your child's social media account once in a while or if you have a good reason to suspect your child is abusing their social media privileges. If you do this too often, your child may feel that their privacy is being violated, leading to a loss of trust and a bad parent-child relationship.


Set special rules on some social media sites; certain websites are known for having many, many bullies.

, Before putting these rules in place and starting to enforce them, bring your child into the decision. Lay out the ground rules. Explain which rules are non-negotiable (for example, no tampering with parental controls or using social media for engaging in bad behavior), and which rules you'd be willing to compromise on, and let your child give their input. Be willing to listen and compromise, but also be sure to not let your child run the show. You are a parent, not someone who comes up with ideas that your child scraps.


Be smart about making exceptions. It is always best to be consistent, but due to circumstances you may need to be flexible with internet use. Some exceptions to consider:

Homework (or similar work) does not fall under ""screen time"". If your child needs an hour to work on that research project, it is not wise to take it out of your child's Minecraft time...this will likely end up with a poorly research and rushed project!
You may want to allow Skyping with friends and family to not count or fully count towards screen time.
Although the internet should not be routinely used as a babysitter, sometimes a parent may elect to allow some extra time for extraordinary situations. Used sparingly, this may help out parents in a pinch.
Always explain the reason behind each of your rules, including consequences that may follow infractions. This will help make things more clear for your child and not seem like you are making arbitrary rules. This does not, however, mean your child will fully understand the reasons. Nor does it guarantee your child will fully agree.



, For younger kids, there is little reason to have full (if any) internet access. Many systems (such as Nabi) make it impossible for a child to get on the internet, and adults control what gets downloaded.

, Administrator accounts on any device - computer, tablet, phone, or so forth - prevent your child from installing or uninstalling software on the device without your knowledge. It also prevents them from changing settings on the parental controls if parental controls have been installed. Make sure the password is something hard to guess (so don't use a pet's name, a birthday, or anything else that your child could easily figure out), and don't let your child know what it is.


As with all passwords, don't write the password anywhere in the computer, even if it's in the administrator account. A child with good enough computer skills would know how to find this without signing in to the administrator account.

, Spending too much time in front of screen is not good for a child's brain and eyes. For young children, one or two hours of screen time per day should be enough. Set a limit on how much time your child can spend on the computer, and enforce it.


The only exception to your child's time limit should be if they're trying to do their homework and have run out of time. However, you may want to do this sparingly, as many children and teens put off their homework and then rush to get it done at the last minute. Consider limiting this to when they have a big assignment only.

You can also stop homework from counting towards screen time. Make sure your child is on task when working on homework online.


Use of multiple devices at the same time should be avoided.
You may want to set parental controls on the child's accounts that prevents them from logging on at nighttime hours, and perhaps limits their time on the devices in general. However, be careful about this - some parental control programs have been known to be faulty, even ones that come installed with the computer's operating system!

, Many children stumble across things on the internet that they don't mean to; often, the best way to prevent this is to prevent those ""things"" from being accessed. Create a balance between safety and freedom. You should strive for an environment where your child is safe, productive, and fun.


If your child repeatedly breaks rules regarding internet usage, try setting a password to prevent him or her from accessing the Internet on their own.
For younger children, using ""safe search"" can also be useful. Be warned that safe search often blocks false positives, i.e. websites that don't actually contain inappropriate content.
Depending on your child's behavior, you may want to use a program that requires sites to be whitelisted before they can be accessed. However, a few programs go over-the-top and block sites such as Google, so be careful as to what you install. In many cases, it may be better to use a program that allows you to blacklist sites, rather than whitelist them.

, Unfortunately, most children and teens end up misusing the internet at some point; if and when this happens with your child, you'll need to respond accordingly to prevent it from happening again. Depending on how serious the offense was, it may work to simply take down the offending content, or you may have to impose a temporary ban on a certain technology.


Do not ever yell or curse at your child during this process. For example, rather than shouting, ""Why on earth would you do that?! That's such a stupid thing to do!"", say calmly, ""I understand that you showing our address in that video online was an accident, but it's still against our rules of the internet,"" or, ""Your behavior towards your classmates online is unacceptable, and we agreed that you would not use the internet to behave in this way"".
Everyone makes mistakes once in a while. If it's the first time a minor rule was broken or your child simply forgot about a minor rule, be willing to forgive your child for what they have done.

, A parent should be a good mentor so that a child will come to you if anything happens. By setting a good example and responding appropriately to both positive and negative behavior, your child will have a fun and safe experience using technology.

Be specific.,
Focus on effort, not outcome.,
Remark on good strategy.,
Nix the comparison praise.",How to Compliment Your Kids1," Generalities don’t make for great compliments. Show your child that you’re really paying attention by offering clear and specific praise. Instead of saying, “What a beautiful painting, Meghan!” you might say “Meghan, I really like the colors you chose for your painting. The swirl of blue and pink is beautiful.”;
, Most compliments refer to the outcome rather than what it took for the child to reach it. But, that makes praise ineffective unless the outcome is stellar. Praise your child no matter the outcome by speaking about their effort. This works better because a child can’t always control the outcome, but they can control their effort.High-five your child and say something like, “You practiced hard in band today, Ben!”

, Good praise is not person-oriented, but process-oriented. In addition to praising your child’s effort, another helpful method is to speak highly about the strategy they used.For example, your daughter is struggling with reading until she changes her study habits to include drawing pictures that help her explain the story and its characters. You might praise her by saying, “Reilly, your new way of studying seems to be really paying off! I can tell that you’re starting to like reading more now.”

, A go-to type of praise is saluting a child for doing better than their peers. While social-comparison praise may make a child more motivated, it also teaches kids to focus on competing rather than mastering a skill. Plus, this sort of praise only works if your child continues to outperform others.For instance, you don't want to say ""Jessica, you are so much smarter than your classmates"" when your child wins the spelling bee. Instead, say something like, ""You won the spelling bee, Jessica! You must have worked really hard, sweetie!""

Think about the perks of learning more about new technology.,
Think about the disadvantages of not staying open to learning new technology.,
Find the right teacher.,
Don't be afraid to ask questions.,
Be prepared to make mistakes and to find out what works best for you.,
Explore the system on your own.,
Be patient.,
Optimize your technology.",How to Be More Open to Learning New Technology," Learning new technology can help simplify basic life tasks, and can even open up the possibility of experiences you never even dreamed of. Think how much easier it becomes to pay your bills online instead of having to head to the payment counters, find a car park and deal with queues. Then there are all the amazing options available to you of staying connected with family and friends who live in another city or country––all through the ease of your computer in your home. The ability to use video chat will help you to feel as if the people you miss are just in the next room from you! Finally, but importantly, you will empower yourself to stay in touch and in control of the increasing expectations that citizens participate and respond using online facilities, from liking or complaining about a business to sending your opinions to consulting or rule-making authorities and even voting.


As you're learning, remind yourself how much the specific piece of technology will benefit your life. Technology is a tool for easier living, so be ready to take advantage of it.
There is nothing ""magical"" about technology. It is all understandable in plain terms and even programming is something you can learn using online courses if you find yourself fascinated by it. Do not let the ""voodoo of new"" put you off learning.
Technology can help you to keep track of many things in your life, from making inventories of home items (for storage, moving, insurance, etc. purposes) to meal plans. As an added bonus, all of this information will sit on your computer or other digital device, found with a simple search––no more rummaging around for your lists and plans!
Even if you don't get anything out of the experience, learning new things helps keep your brain sharp. Learning is never wasted.;
, If you're resistant to allowing someone to help you learn new technology, whether it's because of your pride or some other reason, it's important to try to let go of your resistance. One way you can do this is by picturing yourself struggling to figure out technology on your own and imagining how that would feel. There is never an age at which we ought to know how to learn everything on our own and there will always be a teacher willing to show the way, be it a grandchild, a community college lecturer or an online buddy. Set aside worries of feeling frustrated or embarrassed about having someone tell you how to do something you think you ought to already know how to do. Remember that many people love to help guide others to discover how to do something.

, Finding the right teacher is crucial to learning correctly, as it makes or breaks the experience. Your teacher should be someone who is more or less certified to teach you, as well as someone who has a personality that you find tolerable. It's better for you teacher not to be someone you have previous attachments with, like your son or your girlfriend or husband. They are inevitably either annoying or distracting, so find a teacher that you have no personal attachments for. Reach out to them as much as possible and try to get to know them a little–this might help you learn to like them and their teaching methods.


Research the options. If there is nobody within your circle of friends or family who seems appropriate to be the teacher, look at community college, night class or online options for learning. In some cases, it may be best to choose someone who doesn't know you, so that you don't feel shy or embarrassed about your lack of experience.

, Even Einstein asked questions, so don't be embarrassed. Often we don't want to ask a question, simply for the reason that it seems too simple, like we should already know it, but the fact is you're not helping yourself by holding back on asking the simple questions. Without understanding the entire system, even the simple parts, you will not be able to get the full experience of the technology. Even when things seem simple, everybody misses little things once in a while. Take a deep breath, tell yourself that it's not such a big deal, and ask your pressing question.

, Mistakes are an important way to learn the way that does work and while we're conditioned to avoid mistakes, this is unrealistic. In fact, a lot of technology works around ""mistakes"" by providing more than one way to reach the outcome you're after, in recognition that people have their own intuitive preferences for getting things done. A good example is the use of mouse or keyboard shortcuts to make things operate on a computer screen––some people prefer one way, others the other, but both work and hence, both are equally valid.

, Once you've got the basics down, try exploring the technology on your own with your new-found knowledge. This can help you see what is most useful to you specifically about the systems, and get you more interested in investing some time learning to properly use it at a new level. With the excitement of learning what you like about the technology on your own, you might find that you are more willing to learn about the rest of the system as well.


When it comes to operating systems on computers and digital devices, ease of use is now the main feature. Be reassured that it's fairly hard for beginners to break anything in the virtual system of digital devices, so give things a go. Of course, it also doesn't hurt to learn early on how important it is to back up any of your virtual information, from photos to bank statements. You should also know that when you chose an easy-to-use OS such as Windows, you sacrifice power for usability, and if you choose a more complex OS, such as Linux, It is difficult to use, but offers greater functionality and more complex features.

, Not only with the technology, but also yourself. Learning the ins and outs of a new technology can be confusing, frustrating, and can take a long time. Be patient and learn to simply take a moment and take a deep breath if you get annoyed. Patience is key because without it you cannot sufficiently understand the technology, and your view and memory of the experience will always be negative in your mind and will turn you off from using the technology again on your own.


Give yourself plenty of breaks to digest the information. Your brain tends to lay down new understandings when you're not actively working on the problem. Avoid focusing constantly on the learning but intersperse it with doing completely different things.
Take it one day at a time. There is no need to learn it all at once, so be patient and learn one new thing per day. This ensures that you understand every concept.

, One last but important step to enjoying the learning experience when it comes to new technology is to ensure that you're using the equipment and systems that are optimized your own needs. For example, if your eyesight is poor, increase the size of the text in the browser, online documents and anything else read on screen––learn how to do this for each device, as it varies across computers, phones, eReaders, etc. And if you want to text but you find it hard to press the tiny buttons on a cellphone, purchase one with bigger keys or get one with large on-screen touch keys. There is usually a solution to anything that makes it easier for you to use the technology, so don't let your own special needs stand in the way of using technology.

Aim for quality over quantity.,
Wait until you mean it.,
Resist praising the obvious.,
Keep it mostly in the home.",How to Compliment Your Kids2," It’s understandable that you want your kids to feel good about themselves at all times. But, too much praise can make it lose its power. Either the child will start depending on praise or they will stop believing your words.Instead of praising for any and every little thing your child does, time praise for optimal impact. For example, tell your middle-schooler, “You made an “A” on your math quiz, Ryan! I can tell you must have studied hard.” But, skip the praise if your child always passes their math quizzes.

, Empty, insincere praise is noticed by children. A monotonous “Great job!” or “Awesome!” thrown around when they didn’t actually try hard or when you don’t actually mean it can make your child distrust you. Instead, save your compliment for when you are truly impressed.

, Telling your daughter every day that she looks beautiful may seem wonderful on the outset, but over-praising general characteristics or skills that come easily can backfire.For instance, praising a kid for an easy task that they have long since mastered can make them wonder whether you think they’re incompetent or whether you can’t figure out how easy the task actually is.

, Parents love to gush about their kids’ accomplishments, but doing so in front of an audience may not be the best time. Telling your friends and anyone else who will listen about your kid’s successes can create even more pressure for your child to perform. Some children may even be embarrassed by public praise.Wait until you get home and share the excitement with your spouse. Do it in front of the child by saying something like, “Honey, Todd has been practicing really hard in baseball.” This works better than boasting to your friends that “Todd’s the best baseball player on the team!”

"
"
Build a solid connection with your kids.,
Give them opportunities to make mistakes.,
Be age-appropriate.,
Skip the bribes.",How to Compliment Your Kids3," Sometimes, parents use excessive praise as a stand-in for a real connection with their kids. Showing that you noticed an increase in a grade or improvement in a skill isn’t the same as sitting side-by-side with your child, helping them to improve.You can strengthen the power of your praise by having a strong core relationship with your kids. Spend one-on-one time with them. Talk about their successes and struggles often, and help them brainstorm ways they can improve., Parents often lean heavily on empty praise when their child isn’t taking on any new challenges. You run out of things to say, so you repeat the same general statements. Your child can build a sense of autonomy if you regularly help them identify new skills to try, and praise them for their efforts in these activities.Letting them do things on their own shows that you believe in their abilities, which counts much more than empty praise.

, The manner in which you praise your child should evolve over time, depending on your child’s developmental stage and unique needs. Typically, younger children require more praise than older children because they have fewer successes under their belt. When your child starts to see themselves as capable of mastering a skill, they don’t count on praise as much.Young children thrive on the observe-comment variety of praise. You see them do something noteworthy and exclaim it, like “Wow, you did it!”
Older children require more specifics in terms of their effort or strategy, such as “You have really been practicing on the recital music, Joe. Your sound is incredible!”

, Many parents lean heavily on tangible rewards to get their children to continue positive behaviors. However, parenting experts suggest refraining from using cash as a form of praise.On one hand, cash doesn’t allow you to expound on why they deserve praise, such as effort or strategy. Also, getting cash doesn’t help your child build an appetite for mastery as an internal motivator—they are simply doing it for the money.

Be mindful of choosing the right media for young children.,
Use screen-time to teach older kids lessons.,
Download apps that teach and reinforce important skills.,
Monitor video game content beforehand.. Video and interactive computer games are favored by children, but have been shown to promote aggression in some studies.,
Use video games to educate.",How to Encourage Healthy Interactive Screentime for Kids1," Even when a movie or TV show is characterized as “educational,” parents still should be cautious. Too much screen time can still be a detriment to your child’s development, particularly in very young children.


If you are selecting screen time choices for toddlers, lean towards those with an interactive element in which the child is being shown some visual or audio aspects, being given instructions, and then asked to do something as a result.;
, If your child is going to watch TV or a movie, ensure that they are gaining something from it rather than using it for pure entertainment. Not all media is created equally, meaning that some choices will be more appropriate for your child than others.It can be helpful for older children to watch films or shows in which they are learning some aspect of history, geography, art, or another subject taught in school. It can help, once again, if the show or the parent interacts with the kid, reinforcing and asking questions that are presented on-screen. Examples might include “When did dinosaurs become extinct?” or “What was the Ice Age, again?” right after the information has just been presented.
Children will get used to this approach with practice, but only if you are actively involved. If you use the screen as a babysitter, the children are unlikely to get much out of it.

, iPads and other similar tablets are all the rage with kids. But, again, not all play on these devices is equally helpful or educational for your child. Experts suggest choosing applications that give children the option to select their own preference for play, enabling them to engage in the way that best suits their learning style.


Try those that involve skills already learned at home or in school, such as reading, selecting shapes, adding numbers, or drawing pictures. Parents magazine has helpful suggestions for kid-appropriate apps to download., Look on the box or label to see what age the game is most appropriate for. Avoid those with violence, graphic content, or foul language.


Watch your child as he or she plays. Does the game seem to provoke aggression? Does your child act negatively due to losing? Does he or she say inappropriate words?Be clear and consistent about where you draw the line. Don't fall into the trap of ""all the kids in school are playing it.""

, If your child has a video game console or plays games online, you can encourage healthy use by previewing them yourself. Play the game to see for yourself what it involves. This helps you ensure that the game is actually appropriate for your child.


Once you have played the game, you can use your knowledge of it to drive home helpful points. For instance, you might say, ""I noticed the main character had to forage for food. In what ways does the war affect their family?""

Know the official recommendations.,
Come up with reasonable rules for your household.,
Sit down and share these rules with your children.,
Explain to your kids that you will monitor their usage.,
Enforce consequences as necessary.",How to Encourage Healthy Interactive Screentime for Kids2," You can set reasonable and healthy guidelines for your children’s technology use by looking to the experts. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents should avoid allowing infants and toddlers less than 18 months of age from interacting with or watching TV, smartphones, or tablets. The only exception for this rule is video conferencing, which experts view as a healthy form of media usage.For kids ages 2 to 5, the AAP recommends that parents limit media consumption to an hour per day of high-quality programming. In these cases, you should also be sure to view the programming with your child. If you must keep your young child occupied while you handle chores or errands, choose to let them listen to pre-recorded stories on a CD.
For kids over 5, the organization allows parents to decide for themselves what they deem most appropriate.
Make extra effort to enforce age-based guidelines in households with children of different ages. It may take some creativity and supervision if a toddler and teenager are living together.

, If you have children over five, you will need to decide what rules you would like to implement in terms of how much screen time they are allotted. Older children may be mature enough to work with you on setting healthy limits for screen time. So, involve them so that they understand what you are doing and why it’s important.


You might say, “We’ve learned that too much screen time can lead to violence, risky behaviors, and obesity in kids. We want to restrict screen time so that everyone is healthy. What devices do you enjoy using the most? How much screen time per day do you think is fair?”If you are co-parenting, you might listen to your children’s suggestions, before sitting down alone together and working out a schedule that meets your family’s needs. Be sure to consider the unique needs of each child. For example, an 8-year old may not have a need for excess screen time, while a teen may need the computer to conduct school-related research. Set your rules accordingly.

, After you have decided on a schedule the suits your family, be clear about these guidelines with your kids. It may help to post a schedule in the common area of your home like near the TV or computer.


Say, for instance, “I have posted our weekly schedule for screen time. As you can see, during the week, screen time is restricted to homework-related usage with one hour of entertainment of your choice. On the weekends, there is a little more flexibility. If anyone has any questions, I’ll be happy to answer them.”, Set parental monitors on your TVs, smart phones, tablets, and computers that prevent your child from accessing inappropriate content. It may also help to recommend games, movies, or TV shows for your adolescent to consume. To ensure that your children are visiting positive websites and watching/playing age-appropriate films and games, you should inform them that you will be monitoring their internet and TV habits.


Give them a head's up so they can't complain when you check their usage. You might simply say, ""I will be checking your devices every now and then to make sure you are using them appropriately. I just want to be sure you are safe when online.""Nonetheless, you won’t be able to control everything your adolescent views. Take the time to chat with your older child or teens about different idea or beliefs presented in the media. For example, you might say in response to a TV ad, “These ads are designed to make you want to buy a certain product, but they are often misleading. If you buy this pill, do you really believe it will make you this woman’s size?”

, Since kids hate to lose their beloved video game or TV show access, you can ensure that household chores or academic responsibilities are obliged by using screen time to reward or punish.


For example, if your child’s grades are falling, you might reduce weekly screen time to that needed to complete homework only until grades are satisfactory again.
In addition, if you find that media use has a negative consequence on your kids, you may need to make further cuts on screen time or limit certain types of media.

Model healthy technology use.,
Make it a family affair.,
Encourage non-tech interests.,
Discuss and correct negative media messages.",How to Encourage Healthy Interactive Screentime for Kids3," The best way to make sure your children use media in a responsible way is to set the same standard for yourself. When the adults model healthy and appropriate screen time, the children are less likely to pull you into a power struggle of “Well, you get to watch TV!” Setting a double standard is especially likely to backfire with a teen.


Remember, your children learn from your example. If they see you texting instead of engaging in your current environment or lounging on the sofa while binge-watching Netflix, they are less likely to see the benefit of restricting screen time.
Furthermore, research shows that kids with parents who are constantly tuned into their cellphones or other forms of media are more likely to act out.Therefore, setting limits on yourself could be advantageous for the entire household.

, Using screen time to deepen the bond between parent and child is an excellent way to use technology wisely. Instead of letting your young child or teen veg out in front of the TV while you do chores, sit down with them and take the time to not only monitor what they are watching but interact with them regarding the content.


To a younger child, you might ask them to explain the storyline or tell you the moral of the story. For an older child, you might ask trivia questions pertaining to the content of the show or film. This allows you to turn passive viewing into an interactive learning opportunity., It’s easy for adolescents to become so wrapped up in media that they forget the world around them. Make wise use of the time your child has away from the screen to engage in hobbies or activities that don’t involve technology.


Rather than having a toddler watch TV while you do the dishes, come up with little ways they can help you. Get your older child or teen involved in sports, music, or reading.
Plan a family game night or crafts night. Or, have everyone make up a story or joke. Come up with creative ways for your family to learn and have fun without technology.

, In addition to exposing children to violence or profanities and promoting sedentary behaviors, the media also exposes adolescents to negative messages about their bodies.


Have a discussion with your child about these messages. Remind them that human bodies come in all shapes and sizes. Those displayed in the media are often retouched and altered so that every body part appears more perfect than normal. Explain how unrealistic these images are, and discourage your teen from watching programming where such misleading messages are presented."

Once you have made up your mind to babysit, spread the word. Let family members and neighbors know, post an ad on community boards at the library or pediatrician’s office, or try online sites like Care.com.As you gain experience, try to add more qualifications to your resume such as CPR or first aid training. Also, try to add more responsibilities like picking children up from school or tutoring.;
, Being an au pair goes beyond supervising children; you must also learn how to connect to the children by keeping them entertained. Use your creativity to find activities that allow you to interact with the children in a playful and fun manner.Determine the age of the child or children in order to ensure the activities will be entertaining and engaging.

Your coordinator can assist in locating other au pairs in your area.

, Children are not perfect; they will misbehave, test limits, and sometimes push you to your limits. The important thing to remember is to respond to their misbehavior as an adult—and not as their parent. Avoid yelling, arguing, or inflicting any type of physical punishment.Always keep in mind that you are an adult, and they are a child.

CPR and first aid courses will teach you the skills needed to treat cuts and wounds, assist with victims of choking or drowning, and treat sudden onsets of illness. Determine the level of training needed and contact a training center in your area for more information.


Courses include 30-minute “citizen” CPR courses, full first aid courses, or full on CPR and AED (Automated External Defibrillator) courses. Determine your need before signing up for a class.Classes are offered both online and in-person and can range from 30 minutes to 3 hours.Visit sites like the American Red Cross, the American Heart Association and the National Safety Council for information about how to register for a class.

Make eye contact and engage them in conversation in order to make them feel important and cared for.Remember that parents always come first to children. While building your relationship with the children, try not to compete with parents for their time and attention.

, Although not compulsory, you will almost definitely be expected to help with housework in your new home. Make sure you're fine with doing laundry, making beds, washing dishes, vacuuming and dusting, and cleaning bathrooms.


Prepare for your cleaning duties by making sure your current dwelling is kept tidy. Become familiar with cleaning devices such as dishwashers, vacuums, and washers and dryers.
Some au pairs are only responsible for light housework that involves the children such as doing their laundry, keeping their rooms tidy, or picking up their toys., While most au pairs aren’t required to prepare full course meals, they are usually asked to cook small meals and snacks for children. Be sure that you are capable of packing school lunches, preparing snacks, and cleaning up after mealtime.Always be aware of cultural differences in the types of foods consumed as well as the time of day meals are eaten.
Try searching for and practicing kid friendly recipes that suit the tastes of the children. You can also make an activity of it by involving the children in the cooking process., Some au pairs are required to chauffeur children to and from various destinations. For example, some are required to take children to school, to sports practice, to doctor’s appointments, or to daily outings.Learning to drive (specifically in the state where you’ll be residing) is a crucial step in becoming a good au pair.


You can learn to drive through online driving schools that allow you to take courses online at your own pace. Most require both classroom and behind the wheel training.You can also go to DMV.org to check out the requirements needed for each state in the U.S., and to find additional resources for driver’s education programs.

, Some au pairs are responsible for running errands that pertain to the children and the household. Common tasks include grocery shopping, dropping off or picking up dry cleaning, or driving the children around.Be prepared to assist your family with various chores and always keep a helpful attitude.

Whether it is arriving to work, picking up the children, arriving at appointments, or putting kids to bed, deadlines should be strictly adhered to. Failing to do so can cause a loss of trust from the host parents.Keep a planner and know your schedule ahead of time so you know exactly what time you have to leave one spot in order to arrive at your next destination on time.
Instead of leaving “on time,” always leave early so you have some wiggle room for the unexpected.

, Parents often request the services of au pairs because their family life is hectic. The job of an au pair is to make the host parents’ lives easier by being on top of various events and appointments. Be sure to use a planner such as a cellphone or appointment book to keep track of all appointment dates and times.

Give your child some light chores to do.,
Reward your child with positive praises.,
Encourage good habits of saying thank you and sorry.,
Talk to them and get them to talk back.,
Get your child to play with other children.",How to Build Your Young Child's Social Skills," Children can already understand some instructions, as early as when they are 2 or 3 years of age. Giving a little work to do will make him or her learn to obey and follow instructions. Remember, this is not to make your child feel tired or sad. It is good for your child when he or she starts learning to know that helping out is a good thing to do. Example of a chore: ask your child to help tidy up the mess he or she made while playing.;
, Tell them that they have done a good job afterward. Say words like Good, or Brilliant after they have done what you ask them to do. This will make them feel appreciated and acknowledged after they have done something good. Always try to avoid negative words. If your child fails to do something, tell him or her that it is okay and that he can do better next time. Always remember to avoid negative remarks.

, Always say “Please” and “Thank You” where necessary. Another phrase is ""I’m sorry"" when he or she does something wrong. If you always practice this yourself, your child will imitate these habits. They will learn to copy what we do to them and what we do among ourselves as adults. Establishing a connection between their apology and the reason they are apologizing also helps build empathy, which is vital in good communication and interaction. You can do this by bringing their attention to the subject of their apology. You can tell them: ""Do you see how sad you made your friend feel?"" instead of just ""Say sorry.""

, Get them to say what they feel about anything. Have them confide their feelings about anything, by observing their reactions to the world around them and letting them know that you are open to their thoughts and feelings on any subject. They will learn to express themselves better. This practice is very good because you do not want them to keep their frustrations to themselves. This way, as an adult, you can learn to understand and handle your children better.

, This is a way to break their anxiety and nervousness around people. Start with small groups. Your child will also learn to share things among friends. He/she will learn to understand that sharing is a good value and children can only understand and appreciate it with other friends.

In these situations, you can quickly draw on techniques that help you stay calm in the heat-of-the-moment. Before you become irritable with your child, simply shut your eyes and count to ten., Deep breathing is a great exercise to call upon in moments of impatience. Plus, you can do this exercise any time and any place. Draw in deep, cleansing breaths from your nose for a few counts. Hold the breath for a second. Then, slowly release the air through your mouth.

Try deep breathing when you become impatient and notice yourself becoming relaxed and more in control., Reciting a calming phrase aloud or in your head may help you to get a hold on anger and impatience before they get out of hand. Try saying something like, ""This too shall pass"" over and over again until you feel more capable of calmly dealing with your child., Younger kids are more likely to have temper tantrums when they are asked to tackled tough subjects. Reasons for tantrums vary from being hungry to being tired, but some kids simply will have them when they don't want to do hard work. The trick to easing a tantrum is to not become rattled or get drawn into an argument. Stay quiet and relaxed during the tantrum. This will help your child calm down sooner. Place a hand on their shoulder or back to offer reassurance. Ignore any acting out behavior and refuse to say anything until your child has stopped the behavior.

, Small children may have a hard time focusing on their work after a long day of school. Give your child (and yourself) regular breaks to use the restroom, have a snack, or collect themselves after an especially difficult assignment.It may even be a good idea to let your child do some other after-school activity before starting homework in the evenings.

, Model good attention and concentration skills by doing your own work while your child does homework. This helps set a good example that even parents have to do homework. Plus, you’ll be less impatient if you’re using your child’s homework time to do something constructive, too.


Try paying bills, writing out the week’s grocery list or menu, or reading a book during homework time., If you find yourself becoming impatient on a regular basis during your small child’s homework time, you may need to call in reinforcements. Some parents simply have a harder time coaching and guiding small children who don’t really know how to study appropriately.

If your impatience stems from the work being too difficult or taking up too much time, it may help to talk to your child’s teacher about cutting back on homework or being more realistic about what is assigned.If you can’t seem to explain concepts so that your child understands or your child is really struggling, it may help to hire a tutor who has experience in this area or have your child evaluated for a learning disorder.

Say words of encouragement that are specific.,
Help your child to cope with failing.,
Nurture your child's interests.,
Help your child to cope with fears.,
Show that your love is unconditional.",How to Build Children's Confidence1," Help them to appreciate the good things about themselves. Being confident is about having self-esteem. By believing in them, they are more likely to believe in themselves. Confidence from adults boosts a child's self-image because they often look up to adults. Use verbal and non verbal cues to impart confidence in your children. For example, when you see them working hard a homework assignment, say ""I know it's tough, but you can get through it. Take it one step at a time."" Or if they showed organizational skills by putting away toys when you didn't need to ask, give a thumbs up or a high-five and say, ""Awesome. Thank you for taking initiative and putting away the toys yourself.""
Give hugs. This can help to provide a sense of security and support.;
, Praise beyond their performance or accomplishments. Focus your encouragement by pointing out what specific characteristics or actions they are displaying that are good. Make sure the words of encouragement focus on things that the child can control in their own behavior.Consider saying,""I know it's a tough class, but you are a hard worker and I believe in you.""
Focus on their interests and what they have done well in the past. Consider saying, ""You've very creative. You draw buildings so well"" or ""You can do it. I've seen you hit the ball many times.""

, No one is immune to failure or loss at some point. Help your child to learn self-compassion through encouragement. Children need to learn resilience despite failures so that they can be able to recover from problems.Your child's self-worth should not be measured by their performance alone. Teach them the importance of their ""inner voice"" that tells them to be kind to themselves, to be generous in spirit to others, and to acknowledge that each person has faults.Encourage your child to understand that set-backs area part of life and can be overcome. Be a positive motivator for your child, rather than focusing on their faults.
Help your child to plan ahead for the possibility of success or failure. For example, before a soccer match, talk with your child about how they might feel if they won the game and how they might feel if they lost. Provide reassurance that it is not just about winning or losing, but it is about putting in the best effort to help their team. Explain that one game does not determine the future of their team.
Change your child's negative self-talk about their failings into words of inspiration. Consider saying, ""I know that you're worried about your grades, but I am so proud of how hard you've worked this semester. Don't be too hard on yourself. You can do this.""

, If they fall in love with nature and outdoors, they may want to learn more about forests, animals, rivers, and plants. Cultivate and encourage them to learn and explore their interests further. Take them on trips. Have them attend wilderness classes. Provide them with books. Your child will likely be more confident when they are doing something that deeply interests them.Avoid choosing what you think they'll like. Give them a wide variety of activities to explore. Allow them to guide you. For example, if your child likes to draw while others in your family are into sports, encourage your child to draw things that relate to sports or the types of physical activity that he or she enjoys. Have your child make a book of his artwork to feel a sense of accomplishment.
If your child is more shy or has difficulty connecting with other kids, find ways to connect your child's interest to others. If they are interested in animals and plants more than other kids, maybe they would be interested in joining Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, or a 4-H Club. This may help to teach them how to relate their love of nature to others who share the same interests., Your child may have social anxiety or phobias that decrease self-confidence. Assist your child to understand that their fears are not as bad as they seem. Young children may have imaginative fears of monsters or the dark that take time to overcome.Talk with your child about their fears. Provide reassurance that they are safe. Consider the bedtime routine of tucking them in at night as a way to soothe their fears and make them feel safe. This private quiet time can help to make your child feel relaxed and less anxious about their fears.
Reward brave behavior when they are facing their fears. Use verbal praise that is specific. Consider using a sticker program or other rewards for younger kids.
Assist your child in overcoming anxieties by exposing them to difficult situations in a controlled way for a short time. For example if your child has difficulty saying hello to strangers, help to model the behavior and teach them to say hello for 15 minutes in the grocery store or a similar place. Provide words of encouragement during this time.

, No one is perfect. Accept that your child will do things right, and sometimes make mistakes. Learn that they can grow when you guide them. Express how your love is there no matter what happens. This will make them for safe and more secure with themselves.Tell them that you are proud of them when they are acting appropriately.
Tell them that you love them. Make a point to talk about how you love them often. By using words or hugs to express their love, they will better understand that you care and are feeling supported. People who feel supported are more likely to succeed in life.Avoid making your child think that your love is based on their performance--in school, in sports, or in their other activities.

Use helpful study aids.",How to Be Patient When Doing Homework with Your Young Child2," You can preserve your own patience going into homework time by making sure you and your child are on the same page. Sit down with your child and talk about what they need to work on this school year. Then, map out a plan that makes sure they can do the homework that is assigned and cover other important skillsets in the specified amount of time.Think about what has worked in the past, or what may have been helpful for their siblings at that age.
Include your child in this plan, talking to them about what time they prefer to do homework and which aids are more helpful.

, You and your child are both less likely to become frustrated when you know what to expect. Set a consistent schedule for homework, on weekdays and weekends. Stick to this plan as closely as you can. That way, your child has structure around their homework time just as they do at school., For small children especially, homework time may require a lot of guidance. Situate them in an environment where you can supervise their work. The area must also be quiet enough to help them focus.A popular place in many homes for homework is the kitchen or dining room table. Make sure the area is well-lit, stocked with the necessary supplies, and free of distractions like the television or toys. Ask other family members to steer clear of the area during homework time whenever possible.

, Plan out each night’s (or week’s) homework assignments and ask your child what they think is the best way to divide up big tasks.Working on one aspect of a project at a time reduces frustration and builds confidence as they move along.

, If you’re not a natural teacher, you might struggle with explaining new concepts to a kindergartner or first-grader. You’re less likely to grow impatient with your child when you have practical aids on hand to help them learn new topics.


Find out what skills your child is learning and research books, toys, and online videos that may assist them. One free online resource for homework help is HippoCampus.org. It features educational video content in over 13 subjects.Every child has their own learning style, so using a variety of learning methods may assist children who learn better through hands-on or auditory approaches."

Encourage them to try first.,
Make suggestions, but don’t supply answers.,
Praise their efforts.,
Offer less help and more space over time.",How to Be Patient When Doing Homework with Your Young Child3," Young kids are accustomed to their parents swooping in to help them when they are confused or scared. Try not to let this become a habit during homework time. Your child may need you to read the instructions, but let them take a stab at completing any problems on their own first.


If they ask for your help, say, “Let me see you try first.” If they ask a question about something, say “What do you think?”
When reviewing what they have done, don’t check and correct all the work. Make sure they get the hang of it and suggest that they look back over it. But, never correct their work for them. Teachers need a measure of your child’s understanding, not yours.

, Although educators believe parental involvement is key to a thriving student, they notice that children whose parents offer more coaching often have poorer performance. Show them how to help themselves instead of over-functioning and doing the work for them.For example, show them how to use resources to check over their work or find answers.

, Children need to see that you are proud of their accomplishments, so be sure to give a high-five for positive efforts towards a task. You might also display art projects or great test grades., As your child starts to get the hang of doing homework, slowly reduce the amount of time you spend hovering over them. Let them develop some autonomy with homework.

Back off a bit and let them come to you if they have questions. Review their work only once they’re done rather than throughout the time they’re working. Also, give them more physical space by moving your work to another area or allowing them to work in their room or another space.
You’ll still want to remain in the general area or check in periodically. Kids work best when they know you are nearby."

Avoid putting too much pressure on your child.",How to Build Children's Confidence2," Depending on the activity, children can learn a lot more by doing it themselves--making a sandwich, feeding the dog, or setting the table for dinner. Though it may be messy and take more time, it can also be greatly rewarding for your child's confidence.Patience is key to helping your child grow in confidence.
Give children the time and space to try something new and learn from their mistakes. Provide help when they ask rather than doing the project or activity for them.
For example, your child is interested in pouring their own glass of juice into a cup. While they may be able to do so, but with some difficulty, you may at first want to do it for them. Take a step back and help them learn to pour their own glass. Even if they make a spill, you can teach them what to do when a spill happens. Use this as a teaching moment.

, One way to foster confidence is to see and do different things with your child. By sharing in these new experiences with them early on, you can teach them that life is not so scary or overwhelming as it may seem. Spend quality time with your child after school or on weekends in places that are different than your usual routine.


The experiences don't have to be expensive. It about building your child's interest in your community, in nature, and in learning. The more that they see and do, the less small or isolated they may feel.
Go a different park or library than usually do. Take them to a natural history museum. Go to a state or national park.
Take them to a restaurant with food they've never had before. Show them a community garden. Take them to a farmer's market.
Take them to a sporting event that you both don't usually watch or attend.
Teach them about giving back. Take them to a local food-pantry to sort cans or donate goods. Bring them to a retirement community to spend time doing activities with older adults. Join in a charity walk that helps a local non-profit.

, It is important that your child learn about how certain risks can help build confidence. In tough situations, we take chances, make choices, and learn to take responsibility for those decisions. This is the same with children.Foster your child's resilience and curiosity by encouraging them to try new things. When your child makes age-appropriate choices, they will feel more confident.
Be mindful of risks that may harm versus healthy risks that can be teaching moments.
For example, if your child feels shy in front of large groups, encourage them to enroll in a theater class. Help them use creativity to overcome their fears. Even if it's a small part with a few lines, they can feel more confident about being in front of people.

, For young children, they may want to be helpful and show that they can do things. Consider giving them chores around the house that may match their strengths.For example, if your seven year old child likes to organize things, ask them to help with sorting clothes and putting them in piles.
Or if your ten-year-old like cars, have them help you wash the car or clean the interior.

, Avoid blaming them if they aren't living up to your expectations. Remember that their confidence may be based on trying to please you. Set realistic goals and expectations depending on the child's age and stage of development. If they see that you are anxious and upset, they may lose their confidence and become withdrawn.Avoid comparing your child to others by fostering unconditional love and acceptance. If you child gets a C on a test instead of an A, don't start comparing them to their straight-A sister or brother. Provide encouragement and ask them what they need for support.
Instead of focusing only on their performance, allow them to play too. Balance your child's activities with fun and relaxing things that you both can share. If your family has some difficulty with setting time for schoolwork and for having fun, create a schedule for times to play and times to do work. This structure may help to teach your children better time management as well as the importance of breaks.

Reinforce good behavior.,
Provide support when they make a mistake.,
Act as a role model.,
Point out good behavior in others.",How to Build Children's Confidence3," Offer appropriate praise when you child does something well. Encourage them. Compliment them and be specific. Praise them when they are working hard and sticking with something challenging.
For example, don't say ""You are good kid."" Instead say,""I like the way you cleaned your room. You have good organizational skills.""

, If a child does something inappropriate like spill a cup of grape juice on a carpet, learn to correct them in a supportive way. Avoid yelling at them with harsh words. Teach them that making mistakes can be a way to gain wisdom and learning for the future.


Encourage them during set-backs. Help them to understand the importance of persistence.
Mistakes can be learning opportunities. For example, if they spill grape juice on a white carpet, teach them the tools about how to clean up the spill, and what are good cleaning agents for such a spill. Get them involved in how to clean, rather than just punishing them for their mistake.

, Children learn the most from your behavior. Children invariably imitate adult behavior, good and bad. They want to act like adults themselves.Your actions ultimately influence their future behavior. Teach them about good manners and appropriate etiquette in different situations. If you are at special dinner party and your children are present, help them talk to other adults in a polite way. Teach them about shaking hands with adults when meeting them, or giving a hug to their relatives.
Take note that your child is watching how you do things. If they see you swearing, they are more likely to swear. If they see you helping someone, they are more likely to help others.

, Whether the people are your friends, family, or even strangers, show your child what good behavior looks like. Talk with your child about what that person did well, and what they did in the process.Choose role models such as ordinary heroes in your community or people who have overcome adversity throughout history. Avoid using modern-day celebrities as primary examples of good behavior.
Help your child to understand that these admirable qualities are attainable by using real-life examples. Show them how resilience and confidence are possible despite challenges.

Let your child choose a sport based on interest, not on what you once played.,
Help your teen find a sports role model.,
Maintain a good perspective on both winning and losing.,
Show respect for coaches and referees.,
Learn to forgive yourself after making a mistake.,
Be encouraging to teammates.,
Applaud good plays from both teams.,
Be cordial and friendly with other parents and teens.,
Have fun.,
Reflect on your behavior and improve as necessary.,
Remember you are the parent, not the coach.,
Avoid cursing or showing anger.,
Don’t put down the other team.",How to Build Sportsmanship in Your Teenager," Encourage your child to pick a sport he or she enjoys for the fun of the game instead of what you think will bring community recognition or your own sense of pride.When investigating local sports programs, compare leagues and community teams. Often leagues have try outs that may be stressful for kids, while community teams through the local Parks and Rec offer more inclusive teams.
Most communities have sports teams for children with disabilities as well, so explore all the options to find a program that offers the best possible experience for your child.
Be open to your teen trying a new sport and not being forced to play the same sport each year if it is no longer fun for him or her.;
, Focus on strong role models that are also humble and active in the community. It is easy to focus on the athletes who are in the headlines, but there are also many local fan favorites in lower leagues that are more accessible. Find athletes that are focused on professional and fair sportsmanship instead of showboating.Give an older teen the opportunity to also be a role model for younger players. A high school baseball team would gain great perspective on the game by volunteering with the local pre-school-aged special needs t-ball league. You will find the little players idolize the older players and the older players gain from the volunteer time.

, Pushing your son or daughter too hard may drive him or her to give up and quit. Always model a positive attitude about the outcome of the game, regardless if it is a win or loss. Find positive plays to talk about and the game as a whole –both good and bad plays—and discuss lessons to be learned. The team should not be punished or belittled for a loss. While you can point out parts of the game that need to practice to improve, physical or verbal punishments are not OK.

, You cannot expect your son or daughter to respect the coaches if you are not treating them like they are deserving of respect. At the end of each game make it a point to shake hands with the coaches and thank them for their efforts. Just as the players shake hands with the other team after the game, you, too, should be modeling good sportsmanship., Don’t sulk or become passive aggressive. Even if you are not aware of it, your children are watching how you react to your own mistakes as well as the mistakes of other people.


It may not seem like that big of a deal to get really upset about a poor round of golf, but this just shows your kids the game is all about winning., Some of the biggest competition for your young player can come from his or her own team if the focus is on being the best individual player. Your player needs to understand what it means to be on a team and encourage others on the team. This can be as simple as cheering others on or taking extra time to help another teammate practice.


Encourage your teen to help other players with skills he or she has mastered. Also, use the same approach for areas he or she may need practice in, encourage team members to help one another.
Focus on the process over results. Recognize growth and progress instead of just wins., While it may not always be possible to cheer for both teams, there are going to be plays that are pretty amazing for the other team you can cheer on. Make a special point of making positive comments in the moment to members of the other team to model good sportsmanship.


Attend a game for a local team of younger kids with your teen just to cheer them on. This will help remind you both about the fun parts of the game and how great being part of a team feels. Make it a point to teach strategy and focus on the good you can learn from other teams., Remind your teen that the other team and families are just like you—they are there to enjoy the game. In the event that you run across a parent who is aggressive or angry about something game related, do not get dragged into a confrontation. The best thing you can do is ignore the negative behavior and not give it an audience., Encourage networking with other families and build a positive community. Involve the whole family in cheering the team on, celebrate each game and start meaningful traditions. An example would be going out for pizza to celebrate each game, not just each win.Cheering on your teen can be fun if you focus on making it about the enjoyment of the game and not always about winning. Encourage your family and your teen to do nice things for the team and cheer on teammates.

, There may be times that you do not model the best behavior. But recognize that each one of those times is a chance to learn and grow for both you and your teen. Don’t be afraid to use your mistakes as a learning opportunity for your son or daughter by apologizing for the misstep and talking through how you can do better.


Encourage your teen to also talk through his or her mistakes. Learn together., Your job as a parent is very different than a job as a coach. As a parent, you are there to guide all of your child’s experiences and not focus on demanding performance. If you see a coach demanding too much, speak up. You are also an advocate for your son or daughter if needed.If you are the coach, don’t be harder on your kid than others. A coach should be fair and this means for all the players even your own.
Even if you are the coach, you are also always the parent first. Your child should not be treated tougher nor should he or she get a “free pass” on negative behavior.

, You cannot expect your teen to develop good sportsmanship if you are angry when things don’t play out the way you want them to. Regardless of how important any game appears, this is still just a game. Putting stress and pressure on your player to be perfect or fight harder can end the fun for him or her.

, A good sport does not need to hurt others to build himself or herself up. Congratulate the other team on a win. Find meaningful strategies used by the other team and teach them to your athlete.Do not tolerate poor sportsmanship from your teen or yourself. Remember, you can learn something from every other player.

Provide a nurturing home.,
Determine if your Child Meets Gifted Criteria.,
Determine What the School Needs to Offer.,

Search for other educational options.,
Don't Depend Totally on the school.",How to Advocate for an Appropriate Education for Your Gifted Child," As a parent, you are actually much more important than any school, any class, any instructor. Nurture his or her gifts without pushing too hard. And remember he or she is still a child, and needs time for playing, socializing with friends, and ""just being a kid"".;
, You may need to meet with the school's guidance counselor, principal, and teacher to find out the standards of your country, state, school district, and so on. In the U.S., your child may qualify for special education services by law. Remember your child can be intelligent but not necessarily meet the criteria for gifted.

, A child can be gifted many ways. Usually when ""gifted"" is used, it refers to literacy, math, art, science, and the humanities. What do you want your school to offer that it is not at present? A school can usually offer an accelerated literacy curriculum, for instance. However, a student gifted in sports, social competence, or religious understanding is less able to be helped in a traditional academic setting.

, The laws in your country and local area will vary in what your legal rights are, and what choice you may have open to your child.

, Teachers are often very willing to accommodate your child's needs, if you open a dialogue. Teachers can often move faster in providing stimulating, challenging curriculum than working through the administration.

, Networking and support can truly be useful in getting what your child needs.

, Be sure you've done your research, and understand what can be changed, and what cannot. Get the support of parents, teachers, and administrators. A power point is highly recommended.

, Gifted children vary as much on how they learn best as any other kind of student. Realize, however, that just because you like a certain style of education, does not necessarily mean that is how your school will educate your child.

, In the United States there are sometimes private schools, magnet schools, and charter schools. An independent program can be useful for a gifted child to really explore a subject deeply. You can also opt for homeschooling, if you can manage this. High school students may be able to take college and university classes at local institutions, community college, or on-line.

, Remember that there are lots of educational opportunities outside of formal education. Find mentors in your gifted child's field who can guide your child. There are also student internships, summer programs, museums, concerts, and more. Research opportunities and go with them. Learning doesn't happen just in school!

Provide plenty of positive feedback when they’re signing their words or demonstrating self-control such as waiting in line patiently or helping a friend put away toys.,
Have fun with it.",How to Teach Manners to a Toddler," Children who cannot speak yet are still able to communicate these words by learning a little sign language. For example, when you say ""please,"" make the sign for it at the same time. This reinforces the sign and the verbal word while giving your pre-verbal child a way to communicate back. As you repeat this often, your child will pick up the sign and begin to sign ""please"" when she asks for something.;
, This means once you introduce manners, stick with it and rehearse the trait several times a day. Make it a part of everyone's behavior. It may take time, but young ones are smart and will get it. Teaching manners early in life will pay dividends long after they’re out of the house (not that you want to think about that yet!).

, Children make you better people because they mirror the way you act.

, Let them know how polite and thoughtful their actions are to others.

, Remember that teaching manners is often the first step in getting young ones to think beyond themselves. Some families have ""anti-manners"" dinners where all rules are thrown out the door. Try sticker charts to reinforce positive behavior or a ""manners"" month for those who may need a refresher. It won’t happen overnight, but when you see them in action, you’ll be so proud. It’s not uncommon to first see the fruits of your labor when you’re out of the house, around others, or visiting Grandma and Grandpa.

Examine your own beliefs and feelings about money.,
Evaluate and address your own spending habits.,
Appraise your general work ethic.,
Think about the values you want to instill in your child.,
Look carefully at your work habits.,
Invest in your child’s education early on, making this a high priority as early as possible.,
Encourage your child to do their best in everything they do, especially in school.,
Be careful not to over-emphasize the value of accumulating money to your child, but rather what can be accomplished with it.,
Teach your child about budgeting early on, by finding ways for them to earn and manage money.,
Be very cautious in insisting that a child must work at a young age.,
Encourage your teen to think about the future by sharing your financial plans with them.,
Since starting and running a business is one way your child can become wealthy, guide them into starting a very small one, such as raising earthworms or even just selling candy.,
If your child is good at something at a young age (like football, baseball, or electronics) ask them if they have fun doing that, and ask them how they got so good.",How to Raise Children to Be Rich," Do you believe that earning an income is a privilege and challenge; a good thing that can help you achieve your dreams and goals, or do you see it as a “necessary evil” to getting through life? If your thoughts tend toward the latter, you’ll have a hard time convincing your child that building wealth is a good thing. It's difficult to instill positive financial values that will help your child achieve success if they come into conflict with your own. Carefully think about your attitudes toward money and where they came from. No matter how you feel about money, it's good goal for a parent to assist your child in growing up to be a financially responsible and secure adult.;
, If you spend more than you earn, or if you spend your money frivolously and neglect to save and invest, don't expect your child to develop better habits. If you're currently having trouble providing for your family's basic needs, and money is a constant source of stress in your household, consider looking carefully at how you are modeling spending habits and the work ethic. Identify your problem areas, and work to correct them. Develop a budget and stick to it. Start saving money and invest for retirement and college funding, even if it is in very small amounts. These steps will have benefits right now for the entire family and will set a good example for your child to follow.

, Hard work over time is the only way to financially succeed for most people. Are you a conscientious worker? Have you tended to change jobs often, unsatisfied with your career? If so, discuss with your child how you are determined to alter the choices you've made regarding work. A large part of thinking positively about making an income is in having a job you enjoy. If you are not happy in your work, take action and make realistic plans to get a different job. This is a valuable lesson for your child to experience. Watching you make these tough changes will have a lasting impression on your child.

, Most everyone has mixed feelings about money and about work. Examine how you feel about the ways you make and spend your income. Talk to your child about your goals and methods - don't send mixed messages. If you want your child to aspire to build wealth, espouse the virtues of making plans, persistence in following them, and accepting roadblocks along the way. Be careful what you say about the wealthy and what they choose to do with their wealth. It's what you do with yours that counts. Avoid making comments that suggest having wealth is somehow wrong; rather, emphasize the good that can be done by earning an income and then using it to advance your goals, to include helping others. At the same time, discuss how wealth, in and of itself, doesn't necessarily brings happiness. Praise the ingenuity and work ethic of financially successful people while also encouraging your child to be ethical, charitable, and socially responsible with money. Avoid complaining about your job around your children. While this is a common feeling for many of us, if this is what a child observes day in and day out, it may instill in them the feeling that work is negative and something to be avoided.

, Successful adults are more likely to spring from secure homes, where parents have enough time to spend with their children, teaching and modeling important life skills. If you realize that you feel that you have to work constantly to support your children, reconsider your decisions and find a way to do with less, showing your child that you value them by spending time with them rather than making more money to buy more. While your children may make comments that others have more material items than you do, you'll be able to point out that, by having less things, you have more time for each other, which is much more valuable in the long run.

, Planning for education is likely to lead to better results. Look for the best educational experience for your child, whether in a public or private school, from the beginning, in kindergarten or pre-school, one that will challenge your child and prepare him or her for college or other advanced technical training in the area(s) they are interested in.

, Early on, encourage your child to get good grades, but stress the importance of doing as well as they can and then being happy and satisfied that they did just that, no matter the grade. This will develop in them the attitude that what's important is the energy they put into it, not necessarily someone else's impression of that effort. For sure, if your child is getting poor grades, you must be involved and ask why they are not doing better. Be ready to help them address any problems they may have with learning, and make sure your home is an environment conducive for studying. Seek advice from teachers and school counselors. Consider getting a tutor if your child is still struggling. Instilling a feeling of satisfaction in achieving good academic performance, you can help your child on the path to self-reliance and self-esteem.

, Most every parent, at some point, says that “money doesn’t grow on trees.” It’s important that children understand that making money requires initiative and hard work. All too often money only enters the discussion when you’re refusing a child something, and this can cause your child to see money as a source of stress, rather than as a means to accomplish their goals.

, If you provide your child with an allowance, help them to develop a budget that includes making short and long-term goals that include a savings plan, no matter how small. Teach them about investments and the miracle of compound interest. Be careful not to bail them out if they spend their money too quickly. Let them experience the consequences of their actions while they live under your roof. If a child wants something that they could reasonably save up and buy with their allowance or earnings, teach them how to set aside a little money each week so that they can eventually buy the item, and have them keep track of their savings.

, A child's job is to grow and learn, not earn a living. Do not make your teenager get a job. Resist this temptation - there's plenty of time to work for a wage after their education is complete. This is the surest way to cause them to feel that earning a living is not a positive and rewarding experience. Mowing lawns, cleaning their rooms or common areas in the house, helping with dishes - these are all tasks that come with sharing a living a space. Avoid paying them an allowance for these endeavors. Instead, reward them for assisting other family members in getting their personal chores done, or for setting up and running a lemonade stand, or helping a neighbor with a project. Remember - 'working' is not a responsibility of childhood - ensure they have time to be kids. Those who do well in life, financially, do so because they enjoy doing what they are doing. If your teen insists they want to work a summer job rather than pursuing other learning experiences, because they have set a goal that requires funds, that's all right, of course, but help them to develop a good work ethic and appreciate the value of a balanced life of work and play and relaxation.

, Discuss the importance of setting goals early, but also in being flexible as changes must be made along the way. Building resilience and flexibility are great life skills to appreciate and learn early on. Encourage your child, even while in elementary or middle school, to think about what they want to do “when they grow up.” Emphasize that they may change their minds a few times, but have them research their choice and write out a plan of how they might accomplish it. By thinking through a plan with timelines and goals at a young age, they will develop the ability to list what's required to reach those goals and how to earn the funds they'll need to fulfill their dreams. Help them be realistic in setting attainable financial goals, but be careful not to set unnecessary limits. With hard work and persistence we can all do amazing things. It's important for our children to understand that building wealth is a lengthy process for most of us, but that they can have or do just about anything they want if they’re willing to set goals for themselves and conscientiously work toward those goals. Patience is a virtue.

, Encourage spending a little of it, and investing the remainder--either by expanding the existing business or starting a new one.

, Only do this if they can make a lot of money doing it.


Do not push them to be perfect at it. All kids get better with time. For example, straight A's would be amazing, but a couple B's are okay. Just tell them they did great and help them do better next time.
Also, if they want to stop, ask them if they're sure they want to stop and let them know the bad things about quitting it, and let them know all the things they would be giving up by quitting. If you make them continue, they are most likely going to quit once you can't control them anymore.

Avoid pressuring your child.",How to Raise a Child Who Loves to Read," Teaching your child to read can start in the womb. Let the fetus listen to Western Classical music by placing headphones against your tummy - Classical Symphonies have a highly beneficial effect on the forming mind. Read to the kid before and after birth as much as possible. Try to avoid baby talk. Talk to him or her as you would to any older child or adult. Give the growing little one ABC building blocks, and enact children's stories and simplified Shakespeare stories for them in a way that excites their imagination.


Fill your home with books and Illustrated Classics for Children. Stock up all the traditional fairy stories - Hans Christian Andersen, Aesop's Fables and Grimm's Fairy Tales. Buy plenty of books for yourself to set an example of the love of reading. The books you choose do not have to be new and expensive, and indeed, showing your child the joy of reading and exchanging or sharing books is another important life lesson in reading fast, sharing, and not cluttering. Purchase a wide range of books both age-appropriate for your child and all kinds of other books for your home. If your child gets used to seeing books in every room and lining the bookshelves, this image becomes very important when they start to think about the importance and entertainment value of reading. Show excitement about buying and borrowing books and don't forget to get many books for yourself too.
There are many bookstores that cater for children but you can just as easily go to used bookstores or library book sales with your child, starting at a young age. Take your child with you as this help them to be intimately involved in the journey to loving reading. Let them choose a few books as well as you selecting some books that can be read together, so that they feel they own the decision about some of the books.
Consider even buying two of the same books so you can both read and use them as a challenge. When you finish, you can ask each other questions about the book.
Used books are cheap! For the younger child, look into picture books and independent reading books as well as sing-a-long or listen and read books to help them gain the knowledge to read better.

Art books can be found on bargain tables in book stores; place these on your coffee table and encourage perusal at any time.
Buy or build bookshelves to house your precious reading material. If your child sees a wide range of books and can see each title at a glance, they will be more likely to pick one up and read it. Place books in different rooms in your home, maybe in baskets or on stands.;
, Reading sources such as magazines, newspapers, etc., are another way to interest your child in reading. Invest in subscriptions to magazines that you enjoy and with content suitable for a child. If your child sees you reading different media, they may get an interest in such varied topics as fashion, current events, sports, animals, films, etc. Newspapers are great to teach both you and your child about the real world. Read these at the breakfast table or after work in a comfortable setting minus the blaring TV. This sets an example to your child about what people do to learn and relax at once. Newspapers are something your child recognize as a source on what is happening outside of your family circle.


Teach your child how to read a newspaper, including finding relevant information in different sections of the paper, such as world news, public notices, cartoons, etc.
Many family oriented magazines include a kid's section. Direct your kid to that section so that they can do the puzzles, enter the competitions, and read while doing so.
Listen to audiobooks on CD or Mp3.
Given the increasing popularity of e-readers, the iPad, etc., also consider including these sources of electronic reading material in your child's life. Depending on age, there are electronic books such as the Leap Pad® learning system that allow the child to read the books using a pen; these are generally aimed at children aged from toddler to around 10, although foreign language versions can be used longer if wished. Beyond that, older children can progress to the more detailed (and costly) eBooks for e-readers, iPads, computers, etc.

, Books are ideal gifts for birthdays, holidays, Christmas, traveling, as rewards, etc. Many books that are given for a special occasion or reason will become a special memory and will be long treasured. Write a loving message in the front so that the memento is well remembered.


Remind your relatives and friends to give books they loved as children to your child, to broaden their knowledge of different literature from different eras.

, If you can teach children to see books as their lifelong friends, they'll have innate respect for them. The love of reading will come from observing your love of reading, from the pleasure of getting new information for themselves from reading, and from the sheer utility of being able to read such things as game manuals, school information, and TV programs!


Inform your child of the rules of caring for books such as not drawing or writing in library books, and not throwing away unwanted books but donating them instead. Avoid lecturing; simply explain in terms of why books are special objects and deserve our respect.

, Let your child choose favorite books to read and borrow, and encourage your child to explore the library and enjoy all of the activities it offers. Your child will come to associate visiting the library with being close to you, spending time around enjoyable things to read and do, and as a place of quiet, thinking time.


From early on, teach children how to be responsible with library books and have them take responsibility for the fees associated with returning books late. This is good learning about self-responsibility, anticipation, meeting deadlines, and being conscious of sharing responsibilities. It's also a lesson in budgeting if you insist late fees come out of their pocket money! Only do this if the child can go to the library alone on foot or on bicycle to return the books. Imposing a penalty on them for your forgetfulness teaches the opposite lesson.

, Show them pictures of famous authors and tell them about their lives. You child may decide that he or she wants to write books too; do all you can to encourage this by providing paper and pens, and commenting favorably on all writing efforts.

, Try reading at certain times during the day, such as at midday sitting in the sun, or by a warm fire, or in bed, or before breakfast. Leave stacks of reading material in such places as your bed and on a chair so that your child can see books and reading matter as a normal part of your lifestyle. This reading role modeling will encourage your child and you can be assured that if you are a reader, then so will be your child.

, Children benefit from listening to reading and reading along. Get your child to sound out words and to read a sentence as you continue the story. This makes them feel a part of the learning process and helps to make the story more interactive. Also tuck them in bed, read aloud, and let them fall asleep to a good story. Make this a daily habit. Keep the reading habit up for as long as your child enjoys you reading to him or her. This can even go into teen years if you turn reading out loud into a household activity at least once a week, in which the whole family gathers together to listen to an interesting book while relaxing.


Find a love interest in a particular book. Some children fall in love with a book, Peter Pan, Snow White, Cinderella, Lassie etc. Read it to them over and over when they ask. Read the book especially at bedtime as they fall asleep. If your child ever has nightmares, you can use this favorite book to calm them and help them return to sleep.

, If your child wants to read at night before bed, let them read for a time limit and then lights out. Tell them they can read with a flashlight in the dark if they want. Make it fun and a special reward for good behavior. Small children really love this ""big boy/girl"" reading reward, and it becomes a good habit for them to read before they sleep.


""Come to terms"" with the advancing technology, as the days are gone when nights were used just to read and study. Computer games and Xbox are here as well as TV and texting on cell phones. Try to encourage your child to fit in some reading every day.

, As your child gets older, pay attention to subjects that interest your tween or teen. Focus on bringing books into the house that reflect their growing interests and continue to reward them with books and book vouchers.


Encourage your child's curiosity in finding answers to questions they might have. This will often lead them to books on the subject and further encourage the reading habit.
Don't neglect books in foreign languages. If your child is bilingual or shows an interest in other cultures, foster this through reading books in other languages as well. Even if you don't know a second language, there are many options available to help your child - and you - learn as you go.

, At first, join a book club that's suitable for young children and families. As they get older, take them to a book club for their age, and when it is time, let them go alone or drop them off and you can grab a coffee or read a book yourself. They will see that other people their age are interested in books and that this passion isn't as dorky as some of the teenagers might be suggesting.

, When your child is not interested in a certain book, just put it away. Try to read to them what they are most interested in but also introduce new books all the time. Casually leaving interesting books lying around all the time is often the best way to get them enthused without pressuring them.

Decide on the placement of your turntable.,
Ensure that your receiver has a phono input.,
Run RCA cables from the turntable to the receiver.,
Connect the turntable's power supply.,
Switch the receiver's input selector to ""phono."",
Test the turntable.",How to Add a Turntable to a Stereo System," The key consideration is that your turntable should be as level as possible; this keeps the stylus from applying uneven pressure to your records. In addition, avoid stacking your turntable directly on top of another electronic component, as this can lead to electrical interference that degrades the audio signal.;
, Turntables produce an audio signal that is much quieter than other components like CD players, and therefore they require an extra stage of amplification. BUT! This depends on the stylus, you have both Moving Magnet, and Moving Coil stylus. If you don't know what stylus you have it might be a Moving Magnet. Moving Coil's are much more expensive, and often bigger. If your receiver has a set of inputs labeled ""phono,"" you can readily plug in your turntable (with Moving Magnet). If it has a set of inputs labeled Phono MC/MM) with a switch, you can mount both the styluses. Otherwise, you have 2 options for providing phono amplification.


Your first option is to buy a freestanding phono preamplifier, you get these for only MM or with MM and MC. This component is wired between your turntable and receiver using RCA cables to bring the signal up to an audible level.
A second option is to buy a turntable with a built-in preamp. Check the owner's manual for your turntable to determine if it has a built-in preamp, noting however that this feature is fairly rare.

, Your turntable will likely already have a pair of integrated RCA cables. Simply connect these 2 cables to the ""phono or MM/MC input on the back of your receiver. Both the cables and the jacks will be color coded (red and white) or red and black. so that you can plug the left and right channels into the correct jacks.

, The turntable's power cord is best plugged in after it is connected to the receiver. This reduces the risk of damaging any components in case of a short circuit or other electrical failure. For extra protection, consider plugging your turntable and other stereo components into a surge protector.

, To run the turntable's output to your stereo system, you must rotate the receiver's input selector dial to ""phono.""

, After powering your receiver on and setting the input selector accordingly, you can play a record on the turntable. Ensure that sound is being produced from both the left and right speakers.

",How to Build a Custom Fiberglass Subwoofer Box," The specific speakers/drivers you use will have their own requirements and recommended enclosure volumes. Determine the inside air volume necessary to produce an adequate amount of pressure.;
,


Sealed enclosures are best for tighter bass and driver response, but do not offer the same amount of bass resonance as other types.
Ported enclosures produce additional, deeper bass, but at the cost of of mid-range bass and tight responses.
Band-pass enclosures are a special design that provide exceptional response at a specific frequency range. They are not suitable for all drivers or all types of music.

, Use cardboard, tape, and glue to form the shape.

,, The fiberglass box is now larger than the pattern.

, Lap joints 3/4"" (all equal).

,, Two coats of resin and mat will be extremely strong. Use an automotive body filler, such as Bondo, to further strengthen and seal the box.

, Start with a 40 or 60-grit sandpaper to even out uneven or rough areas. Move up to a 200-grit or higher sandpaper to finalize the finish.

,, Polyfill will dampen the pressure inside the enclosure to simulate a greater overall air volume.

Hide your speaker wire by installing cable raceways.,
Tuck the speaker wire under your baseboards.,
Run the speaker wires above your ceiling.,
Hide your speaker wires in a flexible cord cover.",How to Hide Speaker Wires," Raceways are long PVC conduits that are just wide enough to accommodate a few cables or wires. They can be opened and closed along their lengths, so it is easy to place the speaker wire into the raceway and then snap it closed. Because of their lightweight PVC construction, the raceways can be cut to the required length with a hacksaw or utility knife.


Cable raceways are available at most hardware stores and several specialty stores that sell home theater equipment.
Raceways can be mounted to walls, floors, and ceilings using double-sided tape. The raceways are usually sold with this tape already mounted to the back and ready for application.
Raceways can be painted to blend well with your wall, ceiling, or floor color. Latex-based paints work best with PVC.;
, If you have a carpeted room, it is easy to hide your speaker wires between the carpet and your baseboards. Gently tuck the wires into the gap, using a flat-head screwdriver to push them completely under the baseboard and out of sight. This solution works well for hiding the wire from surround sound speakers in the rear of a home theater setup.

, This option is particularly easy to utilize if you have a suspended ceiling or have not installed a drywall ceiling yet. Speaker wire can be easily run through ceiling joists, or it can be suspended in a cable tray, which can be purchased from a hardware store. When running the wires down from the ceiling to your speakers, you can paint them to match the walls.

, If you have re-arranged your stereo system temporarily for an event, cord covers can tidy the appearance of speaker wires trailing across the floor. These covers are available in fabric and rubber constructions, and allow you to tuck the wire underneath them while providing a secure, unassuming surface for people to step on. Cord covers can be purchased from most hardware stores.

Extend the rabbit ears into the two holes in the ceiling.,
Turn on your antennae and TV or radio and experiment with different rabbit ear positions to optimize the signal performance.",How to Use Your Home Wiring as a TV or Radio Antenna,"


Going in a straight line above the electrical outlet, drill two small holes in the ceiling directly above the outlet. The holes should be drilled approximately 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) from the wall on which the outlet is located, and should be approximately 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart.
Use a stud finder to locate the stud nearest to the electrical outlet. If possible, drill the ceiling holes at equal distances from the stud.;
,


The rabbit ears antenna should be mounted at a height that will allow the fully extended rabbit ears to protrude several inches into the two holes which were drilled into the ceiling. Mount the antenna into the wall using a large screw, drilling directly into the stud above the electrical outlet.

,


Make sure that the extended rabbit ears are sticking through the holes at least 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm), preferably even further. This will allow the rabbit ear antennas to receive the bounced signals from your home's electrical wiring.

,


Try various positions of the rabbit ears to find a position which provides clear broadcasting. You may want to try protruding only one rabbit ear through the ceiling holes. You may also try retracting one or both of the rabbit ears back towards the antenna.
The goal of trying various positions is to determine the location of the rabbit ears which will best connect to the bounced signals from your home's wiring. This may require a substantial amount of experimentation, depending on the electrical strength of the outlet you are utilizing.

Some universal remotes lose the programmed codes when both batteries are removed. When replacing batteries, do so one battery at a time. This ensures that there is a current running with just enough voltage to keep the stored codes from getting erased.
If you’re worried you’ll forget and remove both batteries, use a label maker or paint marker to write a reminder on the inside of the battery cover.;

You can enter setup mode in most universal remotes by pressing a button that says something like “setup” or a combination of two buttons (like On and Off at the same time).
If you don’t have the manual, visit the manufacturer’s website and search for one to download.

, For example, if you’re programming your remote to turn on your television, press the button on your remote that says “TV.” Depending on your remote, you may need to hold down the button for a few moments.

, These codes are located in the universal remote’s manual, but some remotes have internal lists that can be accessed from the setup screen. Since these codes vary across remotes, you’ll need to use the ones that work with your specific remote.


There are websites which contain links to various manufacturer’s codes.You can find them by searching for the manufacturer and model of your remote along with the word “codes.”
Typically, you’ll have to type in a numeric code and wait a few moments before receiving a screen confirmation or LEDs flashing in a certain pattern.
Some remotes have a feature called Learning Mode which doesn’t require entering codes.

Wherever you find your escort, research her.,
Be on time, or call if you will be more than 10 minutes late.,
Know what's on menu in advance and do not deviate from it.,
Never ever discuss sexual acts or money in person.,
Money first always!,
Be nice, treat her like a lady, and be respectful.,
Don't feel like you need to blow her mind sexually.,
Try to read her cues.,
She will not be offended if you need to leave right after.,
Tip!,
Ask her if she would like to be reviewed.,
Always be clean!!!,
That's it!,
Bring wine or a gift.",How to Be an Escort's Favorite Client," Does she have a website, does she have ads going back at least 6 months, does she have reviews (although some escorts do not like being reviewed)? Google her name and phone number or email before contacting her. Also expect her to want to screen your for her own safety; be respectful and provide whatever info she requires.;
, Unless you are giving notice of a time change well in advance, expect to pay for the time you missed. If your 60 minute date was supposed to start at 7 and you get there at 7:15, STILL LEAVE AT 8. Please respect the escort's time and schedule, and don't linger. Even if the escort genuinely enjoyed the time with you, it is annoying and awkward if you overstay. If you want more time, ask and if she says yes, expect to pay for it at the rate previously discussed.

, Escorts use code words like, CIM, greek, GFE, PSE... google these before you call or email.

, For your own safety! If it is a sting, they will try to get you to say what you are there for out loud. When in doubt, kiss the girl or ask her to get more comfortable. If she complies, green light!

, If you must refer to it at any time, call it a gift. Do not hand the money directly to her, set it down where she can see it, or wherever you were told to beforehand, (often by the sink in the bathroom).

, She is a real person, you don't need to be intimidated and you certainly shouldn't feel superior either.

, While noble, and very sweet, she is there for you. Do not hold back at the beginning because you want to last for her, this often ends in not being able to finish at all. Which nobody wants. You can take care of her after if you enjoy that, but no pressure here either.

, She is a real women with real likes and dislikes. Not everyone wants to be talked dirty to, or smash-cuddled post coitus. Some might love it though!

, Whether you need to get back to work, or just aren't into idle chit-chat and cuddling, do your thing. She will enjoy the extra down-time. If you have a genuine rapport or chemistry, or if you are just enjoying the company and a break from real life, then stay the whole time! She will be happy either way.

, Always tip. No one care if it's $20 or $200, tip your escort. Unless she was terrible. Tipping lets the woman know that you liked her and that you appreciate her time and effort. This is especially important if you want to see the escort again. If you went for a twofer, then tip extra well!

, If yes, keep it simple, and do not fabricate. If you say she did something that she didn't, other clients may expect that same service in the future.

, Very very clean. If you just came from work or whatever, take a quick shower at the location. You don't want to be known as the 'Smegma-Guy'.

, Real advice from real escorts.

, Escorts love this and you will go right to the front of the line, hopefully. Wine can help to get you both relaxed and comfortable, and is a good social lubricant when you have to make all the magic happen in an hour or two. You can ask in advance what she likes, and don't forget the glasses! Gift certificates are always a safe bet if you want to bring a gift, stores like Amazon, Victoria's Secret, Bath and Body, etc. If you know the escort well, you may want to give her more personalized gifts like lingerie, jewelry, and perfume. ****Super extra bonus points if you buy her drinks/take her to dinner first, (WHILE she is being compensated for her time at her usual rate). If you really enjoy her company and can afford to do this, this is the best way to make her feel special. Remember she is on the clock though, and do not ever ask her to meet for free. That is a line neither of you should cross.

, Some topics, such as religion or politics, may invite discussion and debate. While this is not a problem in itself, if you are looking to keep arguments off of your Facebook page, you may want to avoid any controversial topics. Stick instead to neutral items, like:


Family pictures
Funny animal memes
Non-political blog posts
Memories and old stories
Interesting videos

, Try to avoid posting complaints on your social media pages, especially complaints directed towards specific people, businesses, or groups. Someone who disagrees with your complaint may become defensive, and this can start an argument.If you have an issue with a particular person, keep it off of social media.
If your boss sees you complaining about work or your coworkers, they may be able to fire you.
Any complaints about a particular business should be posted to their wall. Keep a civil tone, even if they have done something wrong.

, Sometimes, people like to vent about their lives on social media, but this does not mean that they want advice. It is best to avoid giving people unsolicited advice. Only give suggestions if the other person specifically asks for your assistance.For example, if someone announces that they are sick, you should not say something like, “Oh, just try taking a multivitamin. You’ll feel much better.” Instead, offer a sympathetic statement, such as “I’m sorry to hear that. Let me know if there is anything I can do.”
Try not to judge how you see other people portray their children, relationships, or personal life on Facebook. If you are seriously worried about their behavior, try calling them instead.

Take a deep breath.,
Use ""I"" statements.,
Present evidence.,
Ask questions.,
Invite them to talk over private message.,
Thank them for their opinion.,
Avoid insults and name calling.",How to Be Civil on Social Media2," If you see a post that offends you or makes you angry, take a moment to calm down before you respond. Close your eyes, and take a deep breath. Do not let yourself respond until you no longer feel any anger or sadness.If you are emotional or upset, you may want to wait ten minutes before responding. Make yourself a cup of tea, or answer a few emails. Walk away from the computer if you have to., Instead of blaming or attacking the other person, frame your opinion as an “I” statement instead of a “you” statement. These can defuse tension. It makes it seem as though you are inviting discussion instead of provoking an argument.For example, instead of saying, “you are completely wrong about this. You have no idea what you’re talking about,” you might say, “I disagree. I think that there are other ways of looking at the issue.”

, Instead of reacting emotionally, try providing statistics, data, historical facts, and other forms of evidence to support your point. By providing evidence, it does not seem as though you are attacking the person. Rather, you are simply disagreeing with their idea.You might say something like, “Actually, statistics show that pit bulls are not as aggressive as other breeds of dog.""

, People can react defensively when their viewpoint is challenged. To show them that you are interested in their perspective, try asking them questions. They may be more willing to have a civil conversation, and they may provide thoughtful reasoning or evidence. If you still disagree, you will be responding to their viewpoint, not launching a personal attack.You might ask, “Would you mind explaining your perspective on this issue?”
You can also say, “I would really appreciate it if you could walk me through your reasoning. I am very curious about your point of view.”

, The comments section of a social media page can lead to large public arguments. To keep the debate civil, ask the other person if they would like to continue the conversation over private message.You might say, “I would love to keep talking to you, but perhaps we should continue this conversation in a private message.”

, Sometimes, it is more civil just to thank someone for their opinion without engaging with it. Thank them for expressing their opinion, and do not engage with them further.


You can say, “While I don’t think we see eye to eye, thank you for contributing to the discussion.”
You can also try saying, ""I think we will have to agree to disagree, but I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me about it.""

, Calling other people names or insulting them can only weaken your case, and it is more likely to provoke a full-on argument. No matter how upset you are, try to use calm, rational language.Do not use words like “idiot,” “moron,” “stupid,” or “crazy.”
Do not curse at the other person.

Ignore inflammatory remarks.,
Stop responding.,
Block the other person.,
Report abusive content.",How to Be Civil on Social Media3," If someone is posting deliberately offensive material, try to avoid responding. The person may be looking for an argument. By telling them off, you are not changing their mind but rather feeding their desire for attention.For example, if someone says, “Everyone who supports this team is an idiot,” you may want to ignore it and move on.
If you see someone posting hate speech, the best thing you can do is not engage them personally. Report them to the website. If they are threatening violence, call the police.

, If the person reacts with insults or threats of violence after you have already started a debate, stop talking to them. There is probably little you can do to change their mind, and the conversation may only continue to frustrate you., If the other person starts harassing your profile, private messages, or other friends, you can block them.

Hold all objects by your feet.,
Never talk on your cell phone.,
Don't move too much.,
Think about odors.",How to Practice Good Elevator Etiquette," While waiting for the elevator, stand away from the doors. Someone may be exiting at this floor, and you should always let them exit before you attempt to board. Stand to the right of the doors so that the left and middle is open for those getting off the elevator. Don't board the elevator until everyone has gotten off., There is a lot of debate about this particular point: do you hold the door or not hold the door? When deciding whether or not to hold the elevator, use the following suggestions to guide you:


Don't hold the door if you are in an elevator full of people. You will be delaying everyone in the elevator and cramming one more person into a tight space.If you are alone in the elevator, it’s good elevator etiquette to hold the elevator for a person approaching the elevator.
Don't hold the door for a friend or colleague who has taken a quick side-trip, such as to get coffee or go to the restroom. Never hold the door more than 15-20 seconds on a crowded elevator.

, When the elevator doors open and you see it is full, don't try to be that person that squeezes into the elevator when you don't fit. If you have been waiting in line and the elevator fills with the person before you, just wait patiently for the next. Don't be the person asking for the elevator to be held. If you cannot make it before the elevator doors close, then wait for the next elevator politely instead of being rude. The people in the elevator's time is just as important as yours.

, If you are standing near the buttons, be willing to push a button for someone who asks. You can also ask someone who has just entered what floor they are going to.


Don't ask someone else to push the button for you unless you cannot clearly push the button yourself.

, When you step into an elevator, file in so others can board behind you or board on another floor. Stay farthest from the door if you will be the last person to step out. If you are traveling to the ground or top most floor, it's better to stand farthest from the elevator doors after you board the elevator. This way you will avoid inconveniencing others.


If you happen to be riding in the front, make sure to step off the elevator when the doors open on each floor. When in this position, hold the elevator with your hand as the people from the back of the elevator make their way out.

, When you reach your floor, get out quickly so that those waiting to board can do so. Don't worry about letting other people off first unless they are already exiting. Simply exit in a quick and orderly fashion. However, do not shove your way out or knock people over in the process.


If you're in the back, announce your floor is coming up as it approaches. A simple ""Excuse me, my floor is next"" is enough. Then, make your way to the front, or wait until the elevator stops.

, When only going one, two, or three floors, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Unless you are injured, unable to climb stairs, or carrying heavy objects, you shouldn't take the elevator for one floor. Taking the elevator for two or three floors, especially during busy elevator traffic, is also considered poor etiquette.Reserve the elevator for people who have long walk ups or who are unable to climb the stairs.

, If the elevator is busy enough to have a line, never break in line. Wait your turn just like everyone else. If you are in a hurry, try to arrive earlier or take the stairs.

, One of biggest issues with elevator etiquette is whether or not someone should make small talk. Most people are hesitant to engage in conversation while in an elevator. If you must talk, break the ice politely. It never hurts to say ""Good Morning"" or ""Hello"" to people.


If you are with someone, don't continue conversations while riding the elevator with someone else. Put the conversation on pause until you get to your destination.
If you want to speak to a colleague in the elevator, keep the conversation light. Never gossip or discuss personal or private information while in an elevator., There is nothing more annoying than having someone stand six inches from you on an uncrowded elevator. If the elevator is crowded, give as much space as you can without crowding others or yourself. Follow these guidelines when standing on an elevator:


If there are one or two other people on the elevator, go to separate sides of the elevator.
If there are four people, go to each corner.
If there are five or more, spread so each person is equally spaced in the elevator.

, Making quick eye contact, smiling, and nodding is appropriate when entering an elevator. After that, turn around and face the door. Keeping your back towards the door and facing the passengers is a huge break in etiquette and can make some people feel extremely awkward., When carrying briefcases, purses, backpacks, shopping bags, or other bulky materials, keep them low either directly in front of you or beside you. Legs take up less space than upper bodies, so there is more space for bags.


If you are at the back of the elevator and carrying a bulky object, keep it low, announce your exit as the floor nears, and excuse yourself if you accidentally bump someone when exiting., A huge elevator faux pas is talking on your cell phone while riding. End all conversations before entering the elevator, or put the phone on mute until you exit again., Elevators contain a limited space, and in busy office buildings, many people try to fit into one car. Unnecessary movements can annoy fellow passengers, or cause you to make unwanted bodily contact. Jiggling your leg, pacing, moving your arms, or other movements can result in you rudely bumping into other passengers.Texting or looking at your phone is a common way to avoid eye contact with strangers. However, do not text in a crowded elevator. Operating your phone takes space, which is limited in an elevator, and the movement can cause you to bump people.

, Good hygiene should be practiced every day, but especially if you are taking elevators on a regular basis. The small, confined spaces can draw attention to any body odor. Try not to pass gas or belch while riding in the elevator. If you do, excuse yourself. Don't bring extremely smelly food onto the elevator. Instead, bring your food in containers. Never eat in an elevator. Never apply perfume or lotion. What smells normal to you may make someone else very sick."

Show politeness to show your refinement.,
Give up your seat if someone is standing.,
Hold doors open for people.,
Take care of people.,
Mean what you say, and say what you mean.",How to Be an English Gentleman1," Being chivalrous seems outdated to many people. However, at it's base, chivalry just means being polite to other people. It doesn't even need to be based on gender. Politeness goes across all boundaries, and it's a large part of being an English gentleman, as English gentleman are meant to be refined. In fact, it's right there in the title, gentleman.A contemporary English gentleman treats the women in his life with politeness and chivalry, while at the same time, recognizes that a woman is an independent, intelligent person.;
, If someone is standing, particularly if it's someone who has less capability to stand for long periods, such as an elderly person, it's chivalrous to give your seat up. An English gentleman would never sit if someone near him needed a seat. Traditionally, gentlemen always gave up their seats for women in the room, but today, politeness dictates doing so for anyone who may need it., That is, never just let a door slam on someone behind you, no matter who they are. At least let them catch the door. A better option is to actually stand back and hold the door so they can pass through ahead of you.True English gentleman put aside childish behavior, like not taking the time to hold open a door., Of course, it's not your responsibility to take care of every problem for every single person in your life. However, part of being a gentleman is being willing to step up and help when you can do so. Take the time to figure out what people need, and offer help as you can.For instance, if you notice someone is struggling with their bags, offer to lend a hand.
If a family member has a car break down, offer to come help.
George Bernard Shaw noted that a true English gentleman gives more to the world and other people than he takes away., If you've ever heard the term ""a gentleman's agreement,"" then you understand the meaning behind this directive. An English gentleman's agreement relies on the fact that the two men are honorable and will hold to their word. The point is, if you give your word as a gentleman, you have a duty to follow through.In fact, the phrase ""gentleman's agreement"" appeared in print as early as 1821, in the British Parliamentary records, meaning the phrase originated with the British."
"
Discuss your noise issue with your neighbour.,
Let your neighbour know how you are being affected by their noise.,
Refrain from using confrontation as a way to initiate a conversation.,
Suggest coming up with a compromise.,
Write a letter.,
Take notes of every interaction.",How to Deal With a Noisy Neighbour1," Approach them calmly and politely with your complaint. Ask that they quiet down and come up with a plan together of how to solve noise problems.Calmly approach your neighbour with your issue. If you have never actually met in person or spoken to one another, make it a point to introduce yourself. Say, “Hi, I’m Mary. I share the wall with you and live next door.”
Broach the topic of noise bothering you, but do so as respectfully as possible to be careful not to offend them. Say something like, “I’m not sure if you’re aware, but the walls are really thin here so I can hear a lot. It kind of keeps me up at night.”;
, You may be studying. You may have young children or elderly relatives at home who can’t take the excessive noise. Help them understand why need to be quieter.For example, if you are a college student, explain to your neighbour that you need peace and quiet to study late at night. Be honest and say something like, “I’m not trying to ruin your night, but it would be amazing if you could try to keep it down between the hours of 10 and 3. Those are prime study hours for me.”
Another way to confront your neighbours about their noise is mentioning the household members they might be interrupting. Be sincere and say something like, “Hey, I have a baby and even though I love rocking out, it’s hard to get my baby to stay asleep with all of the noise. Can you please, please keep it down? My sanity will thank you.”

, Do not blame or accuse, and definitely do not threaten your neighbour. If you are confrontational toward them, they are far more likely to respond by being confrontational toward you. Remember that you're seeking a solution, not a hostile standoff.


Stay away from using blaming language such as “you are” or “you need to”, instead focus on how you feel and convey that to your neighbour.Do so after the loud party though, never try to have a rational conversation in the midst of the loud noises happening.
Avoid coming to your neighbour with an angered or disgruntled attitude. If you feel like you’re too irritated to have a productive, mature conversation, save the conversation for a later date when you’ve calmed down some.

, Could they keep it down before or after certain times of the day? Could you or your neighbour wear headphones to help minimize the noise? Adhere to noise complaint procedures your building has set in place to help guide you with your compromise.


Look into the rules of the apartment complex and/or residential area you reside in. Ask that your neighbours be respectful of any courtesy hours that might be enforced.If you are unsure of how to come to an agreement with your neighbour on your own, use the development’s rules as a guideline for how to resolve the issue., If the problem continues, try writing your neighbour a letter. While it may seem formal, it may also be a clear and effective way of communicating your complaint in the least confrontational way possible.


Take time to compose the letter. As with your initial contact, be polite and factual. State the result you are looking for with your initiation of complaint.
Keep a copy of the letter as part of your written record of the actions you have taken to resolve the problem.

, Record the outcome of the conversation with as many facts and details as you can recall, and do so immediately. You will be able to demonstrate that you tried to resolve the problem yourself.


Careful notes of your actions can help your case if the problem becomes an ongoing one or you need to make a formal complaint later. Dates and times will be useful to write down as well as copies of any tangible forms of conversation (texts, emails, letters).

Be on time.,
Take the embarrassment out of situations.,
Get people to talk about themselves.,
Don't be showy with what you have.,
Be fair.,
Try not to cause a fuss.,
Pay attention to potential problems.",How to Be an English Gentleman2," Punctuality is a gentlemanly value because it shows you value the time of the people around you. Therefore, to show you are a gentleman, make sure you are always where you will say you will be at the time you say you will be, with the exceptions of emergencies, of course.Being on time also includes calling when you say you will.

, That is, try to keep others at ease by making situations embarrassment-proof, if possible. For example, say you are at dinner with some friends who don't know to put their napkins in their laps. Instead of pointing it out or pointedly placing yours in your lap, leave your napkin on the table as they do, to avoid embarrassing them.The idea also holds for guests. Make it so the guest is always right and feels comfortable in your home. For instance, if they leave towels on the floor in the bathroom, don't say, ""Why would you leave towels on the floor?"" Just quietly pick them up, and put them in the laundry.
Oscar Wilde defined an English gentleman as a person ""who never hurts someone's feelings unintentionally,"" which is why this step helps to make you an English gentleman.

, A mark of a true gentleman is humility. That means not bragging about your accomplishments, as well as not hogging conversations. When having a conversation with someone, ask them questions to get them talking instead of going on and on about yourself.For example, you could say, ""Tell me about yourself,"" ""What do you do for a living?"" ""How was your day?"" or ""What have you been reading lately?""

, If you are a wealthy person, don't be showy about it. Don't flaunt the fact that you have wealth. Even if you aren't a wealthy person, try not to flaunt when you get something new. This idea goes back to putting others at ease, as showing a person what they don't have can make them uncomfortable.For instance, if you get a new car, don't post it all over social media. If someone mentions they got a new job, don't try to one-up them with your job or salary.
Robert Smith Surtees, a 19th-century novelist and editor, noted that anyone who talks too much about being an English gentleman isn't one, and the same applies to being ostentatious., An English gentleman doesn't cheat his friends or his enemies. If you play a game, follow the rules, rather than ruthlessly trying to get away with cheating. Also, treat those around him with equal fairness. For instance, don't favor an employee at work just because you're better friends with that employee. Rather, base promotions on merit and hard work., As a guest, an English gentlemen is polite and proper and always defers to his host. In other words, you should be the perfect guest. Don't make a fuss about what should be served at dinner, for instance. Rather, you should happily eat what's served at the meal, even if it's not your favorite food, with compliments to the chef., One way to put people at ease is to anticipate problems and take care of them before they come into play. For instance, if you know someone is down on their luck with finances, invite them to a more modest place you know they can afford when you have dinner with them. Even better, invite them over to your house for dinner. This type of consideration also applies to things that you know make people uncomfortable. For instance, if you know your friend prefers to have their back to the wall when out in public, always offer them that seat."

Make generosity a part of your day-to-day life.,
Stand your ground.,
Be a hard worker.,
Consider traveling.,
Speak the language.",How to Be an English Gentleman3," Being generous doesn't mean that you need to give away handfuls of cash every day, though it can, of course, mean being open with the resources you have at your disposable. However, it also means being generous with your time, love, and support, in such a way that you make the people in your life feel like they are valued.In other words, make time for the people in your life. Tell them you like them, love them, and value them often. Show you care by acting out small kindnesses, such as having a cup of coffee ready when a person gets up, warming up the car ahead of time, or bringing someone flowers just because.
Part of being generous is to give without expectation of it being reciprocated. Part of the definition of an English gentleman is one who is able to give more than he takes.

, When it comes to moral decisions, a gentleman will stand his ground. In other words, you don't take the easy way out by skirting the rules, nor would you bend on a decision if it would harm other people in some way. Basically, you need a moral code, and you need to stick to it., While a strictly old-fashioned definition of an English gentleman would be someone who didn't work, a more modern definition usually means someone who is willing to work hard for the things he wants in life. It's an unwillingness to take ""no"" for an answer. You must be willing to overcome the obstacles that life throws at you with class and grace., While traveling does take some money, it provides you with invaluable lessons about the world, including how to get along with a wide variety of people from differing backgrounds. Learning about the world will only help you appreciate it more, as well as teach you the injustices you need to fight against.While English gentleman traditionally referred to a gentry class person, it now has the meaning of any well-bred, educated person. Traveling can help you achieve those qualities.

, While speaking well isn't necessarily a value, it often does distinguish an English gentleman. An English gentleman phrases things in polite ways that may come off as slightly stilted to some ears, just because it's a bit formal. For instance, you might say ""Pleased to meet your acquaintance,"" rather than ""Nice to meet you."""

Find a nice, slim-fitting jacket.,
Choose dressy pants.,
Add a pair of suspenders.,
Consider a waistcoat.,
Add the details.,
Be yourself.,
Dress for the occasion.",How to Be an English Gentleman4," A suit jacket can cover a wide variety of occasions, particularly if it's in a nice fabric. Pick one that's slim-fitting, as that's more the modern style. If you aren't sure where to begin, consider getting fitted at an upscale suit shop where they can measure you and find the right jacket for you.A jacket should be form-fitting at the shoulders, though it shouldn't be so snug that it makes the jacket ride up or down.If you don't have the funds for a brand-new jacket, you can pick up some really nice ones at thrift shops. The only problem is you'll need to spend some time hunting around to find one that fits you and that is made from a decent fabric.

, Traditionally, English gentlemen wore high-waisted pants. While the high-waisted part is optional, when wearing a suit jacket, pick an appropriate pair of trousers. They can be made from the same material as the jacket, or they can be made from a complementary neutral color for a more casual look. You can even get away with a nice pair of jeans, depending on the occasion., Nothing says old English style like a pair of suspenders. However, it's not just about looking good. Suspenders don't cut into your waist like a belt can do. You can find suspenders at almost any shop that sells suits, though you may also hunt around at your local thrift stores for a lucky find., ""Waistcoat"" is just a fancy word for a suit vest, which goes under the suit jacket but over the suspenders. Like the suit jacket, it should be slim-fitting, hugging your shoulders and chest. You shouldn't have gaps at the shoulders. Of course, you still need room to breathe. Also, the buttons of a waistcoat should be buttoned, with the exception of the bottom button, which can be left undone.Usually, the waistcoat will match your jacket. Sometimes, they will be made out of the same material, though other times they will just match in color.

, A tie or bow-tie makes any jacket a little fancier, so pick one in a complimentary color, preferably of the hand-tied variety. You should also add a handkerchief that matches the tie in you jacket packet. Cuff links also make a nice addition, adding a bit of subtle glamor.Shoes are also important. Pick a dressy shoe in a complementary color. Brogues are traditional English shoes and make a good choice if you can't decide., While finding a good style is important, a gentleman is able to make his own style. In other words, it's not necessarily about finding the latest trend. Rather, it's about finding what works for you and then wearing it well. Part of wearing something well is to make sure everything you wear is in good condition (no holes or stains) and to wear it with confidence., While it can be fun to dress the part of a well-dressed English gentleman, always keep the occasion in mind. Wearing a suit, tie, vest, and suspenders to an informal barbecue is going to look a little strange. In other words, keep it classy, but don't overdo it.On the other hand, if you're invited to an event that calls for black or white tie, make sure to dress that part, too. That is, dress up by wearing a tuxedo and the required white or black tie.

Enlist the help of a mediator.,
Contact the local authorities if other approaches have failed.,
Involve the police in your issues with noisy neighbours.,
Take legal action.",How to Deal With a Noisy Neighbour2," If you find that the noise can’t be resolved between just you and the other person, seek out resolution with the help of a third party. Sometimes a board member or apartment manager can help facilitate the conversation and avoid fueling the conflict between you and the neighbour.If your building doesn’t have mediation procedures, talk to your landlord or super about the noise complaints.
The super or landlord will act as the middle man and notify the neighbour of the complaints they’ve heard anonymously, sometimes with an official reprimand., Some areas have a non-emergency police option, 311. In areas without a 311 service, you can likely find a local, non-emergency phone number for your local police department (or sheriff’s office) by looking online.When you call 311 or your local non-emergency line, let the dispatcher know where you are exactly. If you are in an apartment complex, give the complete street address including the apartment number. Be prepared to give info about your entry code if your community is gated as well.Give a brief description of what is going on. Tell them what is currently happening. Say something like, “I’m trying to file a noise complaint on one of my neighbours who is having a party that is not in accordance with our community rules.”
If you want to remain anonymous to protect yourself against any potential retaliation, tell the operator that you don’t want to be contacted by the officers sent to the scene. The officers will contact your neighbour regarding the complaint, but will leave you out of it and not reveal your identity., If the issue can be or has been dealt between you, your neighbours, and your landlord, leave the police out if it. However, if you find that you have not had much success with dealing with things internally, call the cops.911 should be reserved for emergency situations, not a thump or two. Call the cops if there’s a loud party going on or if there is a band playing at all hours of the night.It is integral that the cops be called only in situations where the noise will still be going on at the time of their arrival. If not, contact 311 or your local non-emergency line, for non-emergency noise complaint situations., Legal action should be your last resort as a result of trying every possible way to reach a solution and not finding one. Use the notes you have taken during past indiscretions with your neighbours as supporting documents to build your civil case for small claims court.Sue your neighbour in court for money damages or as a court order for the neighbour to stop the noise, or “abate the nuisance”, which is what it’s referred to in legal terms.It might be difficult to sue for noise damage because determining damages is pretty subjective. If you still want to give it a try in small claims court, use your log that you should have been keeping from earlier steps. Show that there is excessive and disturbing noise on several occasions caused by the neighbour you’re suing.
Show that you have asked that he or she stop being noisy on several occasions and it hasn’t been resolved. Show evidence of police involvement and your interactions with your neighbour that have remained ineffective to resolving the issue of noise.

Live in an apartment that is on the top level of the apartment building.,
Check out the neighbourhood that you’re trying to rent or buy in.,
Let your landlord know upfront that quietness is important to you.,
Rely on other methods to reduce noise levels.",How to Deal With a Noisy Neighbour3," It often comes with a heftier price tag, but it can be the most effective way to avoid noisy neighbours. Sound doesn’t affect apartments on the top level like it does on the ground floor. Consider that when you’re on the hunt for an apartment., Checking out the neighbourhood you plan to live in before you buy is the best way to get an idea of what the noise level will be like. Take note of your surroundings.


On the street you plan to live on, check to see if there are basketball hoops, skateboard ramps, or other equipment that create a lot of noise or cause kids to congregate loudly in one area.Avoid streets with a bus stop, intersection with stop signs, a club, an empty lot, or a halfway house near it. In other words, avoid busy locations with heavy commuter traffic.

, When you’re on the hunt for a place, let your landlord know that living in a relatively quiet building is important to you.Gauge the landlord’s willingness to accommodate your personal preference. If he or she tries hard to place you somewhere quieter, this will be an important indicator of what the landlord is willing to do to make sure you feel comfortable.
If you hear buzz phrases like, “This is a young building”, be prepared to be surrounded by a few college parties. If that is a dealbreaker for you and what you’re willing to accommodate in a living space as far as noise levels go, it might be wise to pick somewhere else to live.

, Even in your most concentrated efforts to stay away from loud noise and/or noisy neighbours, noise can still trickle in and get on your nerves at any given time. Construction might be going on randomly or a neighbour might insist on mowing the lawn at 9 am on a Saturday morning.Invest in a pair of noise-canceling headphones or a white noise machine to reduce the volume of noise your place might be absorbing.
Another way to absorb sound and reduce its impact is by installing bass traps or other sound-absorbing materials onto your walls.

Know when moshing is appropriate.,
Start in a way that lets people get out of the way if they prefer.,
Pick a good place for moshing.,
To start moshing with your friends, you can probably clear some space by pushing each other around and jostling in good fun.,
If you are not starting the mosh pit yourself, you will need to know how to join a mosh pit in progress.,
When entering the mosh pit, expect you will be hit.,
Make noise as desired.,
Stay alert.,
In good sport, make an effort not to use the hard or sharp parts of your body, such as your knees, elbows, or skull when making contact with other moshers.,
Be careful when kicking that you don't hit anyone, and absolutely do not wear steel-toed shoes.,
Stop moshing immediately.

,
Depending on the injury, the injured person may need your help getting out of the mosh pit, but if they seem able to help themselves out, it may be best not to interfere.,
If you see someone on the floor, try to help them get up as soon as possible so they are not trampled.,
If you see someone unconscious, you should not move them by yourself.,
If people are continuing to mosh, you may need to form a sort of wall between the fallen person and the moshers while another person watches the person on the ground.,
Ensure that your helper watching the unconscious person is also ready to catch or push you forward if you are falling backward.,
If you are sent for help, talk to a security guard or building employee who can help control the crowd, as the person may still be in immediate danger, while someone else calls an ambulance.,
If you are injured, stop moshing and try to exit the mosh pit.,
Keep whatever part of you is injured closest to the exit, as less moshers will be coming from that direction.,
If you fall down, it will be difficult to get up.,
With your arms still protecting your head, get as high as you can, out of the direct path of kicks and knees.,
Now that your head is a bit higher and you can see what's coming, it may be safe to take both arms off your head and manoeuvre your way up into a standing position.,
If you suspect you are injured, or you are not sure, then make your way out of the mosh pit.,
If you fall and cannot get up, protect your head and assume the fetal position.",How to Practice Mosh Pit Etiquette," At many concerts mosh pits will not be allowed and will be dispelled as quickly as they form. If you are asked to stop moshing, then stop.;
, Starting a mosh pit is probably the most dangerous part of moshing because people can be caught off guard and/or find themselves in the mosh pit against their will. The safest time to start a mosh pit is with a small group of your own friends in the middle of the crowd. This way, all of you are aware of what is happening and not likely to trap a non-mosher in your mosh pit. Others can join when they see the fun, but they will at least know what they are getting themselves into.

, Don't start a mosh pit too close to the stage, as this will decrease the amount of room you have to dance. You still want to be in the crowd though, so that other potential moshers can find you. Look around to be sure no one nearby is likely to be trampled. A mosh pit doesn't always stay within its boundaries, so people around the edges are likely to be bumped around. Be sure none of them are overly scrawny, injured, or very small (including children). It's also wise to check that anyone wearing jewelry does not have spikes long enough to impale you, should you run into them.

, People around you will probably move away until you have enough space to dance and mosh as you please.

, If it is your first time moshing, bring a friend who is strong enough and willing to drag you out if you are injured.

, There is simply no other way to mosh properly. With that in mind, you can either observe the mosh pit for a few moments and wait for a small opening to jump in (like crossing the street, or playing a violent version of jump rope), or you can simply dive in. You are less likely to harm anyone if you enter the mosh pit backwards, seeing as your back is unlikely to cause a lot of damage. As a bonus, you are also less likely to be punched in the face. Grit your teeth as much as possible to avoid biting your tongue when getting knocked around.

, You are always welcome to yell or give a hearty battle cry when entering the mosh pit, although it is unlikely you will be heard if you are at any concert worth moshing at.

, Now, when actually moshing it is easy to get distracted by the sheer joy of it, so try to remain aware of those around you. Feel free to dance as wildly and off-beat as you see fit. Moshing moves are, needless to say, as much from the heart as possible. Don't be surprised to see flailing, kicking, or moves that look suspiciously like football tackles.

, Remember, you are dancing, not fighting. This is surprisingly easy to forget. Think of it rather as a sort of battle-dance, in the sense that your dancing may appear aggressive without actually being intended to cause harm.

, Closed toes are obviously recommended though, to prevent trampled toes. All punches should be aimed over the head, like a fist-pump, so as not to cause injury.

,, To help someone out, they may need to lean on your for support, or it may be best to simply protect the injured side of them as they make their way out.

, Be careful when doing this as you will have to lower your head to a level where it could easily be kicked. Try to put most of the mosh pit behind you and bend from your knees, as you are less likely to fall over. Remember to clench your jaw, so that if you are hit in the head you won't bite your tongue.

, If you can shout loudly enough to get other people's attention, then do so. It is likely you will not be heard, but try getting at least one other person's attention to help you protect the unconscious person from getting further trampled, and if at all possible, to get the attention of a security guard.

, This is best done facing the mosh pit with the unconscious person a little behind you. Plant your feet firmly below your shoulders, and bend your knees slightly. When moshers come towards you try to absorb the hit and push them away. Take one step forward and lean into the moshers if you can, as this stance will give more space to the person on the ground behind you and also decrease the chances of you being bowled over by a direct hit.

, Obviously, you should not fall on an unconscious person. Eventually people around should notice the problem and begin clearing away. Speed up this process in whatever way you can, and send someone for help as soon as possible.

, If there is no one else to call the ambulance, then call after finding someone to control the crowd.

, It may help to shift your weight toward the brunt of the mosh pit so you are not thrown off balance when hit.

, Cover your head with your arms and make as much noise as possible, as your greatest danger is being kicked in the face because you are not seen or noticed.

Stand when they enter the room.,
Bow or curtsy if you are a subject of the royalty.,
Address the royalty properly.",How to Meet and Greet Royalty1," This is one of the most important things you should do when in the presence of royalty. If you are waiting in a room for the Queen or other royalty to arrive, you want to be sure to rise as soon as you see them enter the room. This is a show of respect for their position. If you happen to be somewhere in public, perhaps sitting in a park, when royalty walks by, be sure to stand up in that situation as well.You should stay standing as long as all royalty is standing, unless you are directed to sit down. For example, if you are going to be having dinner, you would wait until all the royalty is seated. If someone is going to give a speech and you have stood for them, you will most likely sit down when the speech begins.;
, Anyone for whom the royal is the head of state should bow or curtsy. This includes you if you are a citizen of the country where the person is royalty. Men should give a slight bow of their head, but not bow with their whole body. Women should give a brief curtsy. If you are not a citizen of the royalty’s country, you don’t need to bow or curtsy because they are not your head of state.Non-citizens can still bow or curtsy, if they wish to, as a show of respect, but citizens must do this or it will be seen as a sign of disrespect.

, Part of being royalty means being addressed with terms of honor, so make sure you address royalty respectfully. When greeting the Queen, address her as “Your Majesty” the first time. If you address her after the first time, call her “Ma’am,” pronounced like “jam.” Address male royalty as ""Your Royal Highness” the first time, regardless of their rank or title. Use ""Sir"" at all times after the first time.For female royalty who are not the Queen, you should address them as ""Your Royal Highness,” and then ""Ma'am"" after the first address.

Call first to make sure visitors are allowed.,
Observe the hospital's visiting hours.,
If the patient's door is closed, knock and wait for permission to enter.,
Keep your visit brief.,
Don't ask about any surgical or test results.,
Bring a gift card.,
Stay positive.,
Assure the patient that he or she is missed at work, school, church, or social groups.,
Don't be hurt if you are asked not to visit.,
Avoid being difficult.,
Know who's in charge.,
Reap the benefits of co-operation.,
Visit a hospital only during visiting hours.",How to Practice Hospital Visiting Etiquette," Even if there are visiting hours provided on the website, etc., the person you are wanting to see may not be well enough to see anyone at the time.;
, This is absolutely vital; non-visiting hours are used mainly for ensuring sufficient recuperation for the patients, so that they get well quickly.

, You can't be sure whether or not a medical procedure is taking place or if the patient is sleeping.

, The patient is likely to tire easily but may be too polite to ask you to leave. Also remember that you're not likely to be the only visitor and having many visitors can be tiring.

, If the patient wants you to know, he or she will tell you. Otherwise, this can seem too personal and very invasive of the patient's privacy.

, Instead of flowers or candy, consider purchasing a gift card to the patient's favorite store. A post-surgery patient usually can't eat for several days, so candy isn't a very tactful gift. Hospital rooms are small; there may not be room for flowers and they are usually a nuisance when the patient is ready to go home.

, If visiting a co-worker, refrain from mentioning the latest round of budget cuts or layoffs. If there is any bad news from the home or work front, try your best to not relay it unless you think that it is absolutely essential. It is best for the patient to be relieved of bad news until they're well enough to cope again.

, Days are very long at the hospital, and a patient can quickly feel isolated and out of touch.

, Most patients value their privacy and may not want to be seen hooked up to machines and drainage tubes. Moreover, if they feel really ill, they're genuinely not up to receiving visitors.

, Doctors and nurses are professionals and expect to be spoken to with respect for their work and assistance. Choose to be pleasant, calm and patient whenever you discuss a patient's issues with the medical staff. Trust that they can do their job and that you can leave, while the patient is being treated effectively.


Realize that they will not divulge confidential information and that even as a family member, there are limits to what you can know and ask to be done.

, It isn't you as a member of the patient's family, even if you have a medical degree. The staff at the hospital are highly trained and know what they're doing. Avoid trying to tell them what to do or not adhering to their requests. It can make the entire ordeal worse for the patient than it could be if they're associated with a difficult relative.

, If you co-operate with staff at the hospital, it's likely that they'll be more willing to listen to your requests to help the patient in particular ways.

, By visiting at the right times, you'll have a better chance of seeing your loved one and not annoying the staff. You will also be more likely to get the attention of staff, as wished.

Don’t say “pleased to meet you.” This is a very specific point, but an important one.,
Refrain from physical contact.,
Eat only when the royalty is eating.,
Avoid personal information.,
Dress appropriately.",How to Meet and Greet Royalty2," If you are meeting royalty, it is a given that you are pleased to meet them, as it is an honor. Therefore saying “Pleased to meet you” is unnecessary. Royalty may not necessarily be offended by you saying this, but you will definitely look foolish.The best alternative is to simply say “Hello,” or you can use the widely accepted “How do you do?” You must be courteous and give a greeting, but you don’t want to come off as foolish by saying the wrong thing.

, The general rule is that you do not touch royalty, except in some circumstances when they initiate it. If the Queen or other royalty reaches a hand out for a handshake, grip it briefly and gently. Never give a tight squeeze or a hard shake. Further, never go in for a hug or kiss on the cheek or hand. This type of physical affection with royalty is bad form.There have been one or two instances where the Queen of England put her arm around someone and the person reciprocated the action. It is wise to follow the lead of royalty, but never do something like this unless they do it first.

, Tea and light snacks are often part of a meeting with royalty, but you should never eat if they are not eating. Likewise, if you happen to be eating at a dinner with the Queen, once she has stopped it is customary that everyone stops.If you do have tea and snacks with the Queen, never slurp your tea loudly and take small bites of the food. Slurping and crunching loudly are sure ways to look foolish in front of royalty.
Never chew gum when you are meeting royalty as this is disrespectful.

, A sure way to offend royalty is to refer to something in their personal lives that you may have heard about or read in a magazine or tabloid. It is acceptable to engage royalty in small talk if you are in their presence for an extended time, but try to keep the conversation away from personal information.


Don’t ask about some scandal you heard reported in the news. Don’t ask about other members of the royal family.

, It is best form when meeting royalty to dress as you might for a professional interview. In general, royalty would not expect you to be put out by purchasing something expensive specifically for the meeting, but it is courteous to be dressed nicely. A suit for men, or at least dress pants, and a button up shirt and tie is the best option. Women should dress conservatively in either a pantsuit, slacks with a blouse that covers well, or a long dress paired with a sweater or cardigan."

Ask.,
Be observant.,
Remember that more often than not, the style/size of clothing that is on the top of a stack is the style/size that is on the bottom.,
Be choosy about what you take into a dressing room.,
Mind the return policy.,
Just like you make mistakes, so do retail employees.,
Employees have lives outside of work.,
Keep an eye on your children.,Do not reach into windows/displays even if it is easy to do so, ask for assistance

,
Do not say ""I could get this cheaper at the mall/online/etc"".",How to Exercise Clothing Store Etiquette," If you do not know something, asking does not hurt and will invariably save you, and the workers, valuable time.;
, Look around for any signs on sales, prices or clothing information. A lot can be said in a sign, and you'll save yourself from asking a stupid question.

, Find your approximate size, lift up the top of the stack and grab the size, and gently place the rest back where they were. That way, there is less folding for the employees. A stack can take quite a long time to refold, and if there are a lot of stacks that need folding, it is quite a mess.

, When there is no limit on how many things you can take into a dressing room, please be mindful of other customers and limit what you take in there to about five articles of clothing. This way, you won't accidentally leave a pile of clothes or hangers on the floor and take up too much time in the dressing room, thereby leaving other customers hanging.

, Ask what it is before you leave the store and remember it. Some stores accept exchanges only, while others accept refunds with the tags attached, while still others accept unconditional refunds. If you do not ask, do not be shocked and angry if your items aren't accepted back. Generally, a good rule of thumb is to leave the tags attached and bring it back in 30 days.

, Please do not question their value as a human being in their faces when they make a mistake. Just because they work retail does not mean that they are automatically exempt from feelings.

, Please be mindful of closing times and do not be offended if you are asked to leave.

, Children are terrible about ripping tags off, messing up displays, and being nuisances to the staff of the store. Do not expect the employees to be babysitters. This is also for your child's safety, as there are things that can hurt them in a clothing store and potential child predators lurking in the aisles.

,, It is annoying and offensive to the employees. If you can find something cheaper somewhere else, you need not announce it.

Understand the benefits.,
Be prepared for the difficulties.,
Start recruiting people right away.,
Use smartphone technology.,
Focus on the logical rideshare flow.,
Find incentives.,
Consider growing the campaign.",How to Start a Rideshare Campaign in Your Neighborhood," In most populated areas there are cars and most people drive alone. That means that many seats in the cars are available for passengers. If people join to use these extra seats, fewer drivers end on the roads, saving money and gas, easing traffic congestion, and preserving environmental resources. Another positive factor working for ridesharing is that it is getting easier: more and more people have a smartphone with the ability to connect with other users and use the GPS to find people in the vicinity to join rideshares with ease.;
, In many places, there is a long tradition of warning young people against hitch hiking with strangers. People also like the freedom of going in their own car and not being a burden to other people. These values work against starting up a ridesharing community, but it is still a more than feasible goal. After some time, people get used to it and it starts to be normal.

, Talk to your friends, coworkers, and neighbors about the possibility of ridesharing. Post to some local websites, forums, or classifieds. Gather interest in the campaign.

, Look for an app that has users in your area or an app that you think has potential, start recruiting users and promote the ridesharing community.

, Get to know your area and find corridors where people are going the same way at approximately the same time. If you work in a business park, find a common area where many people live or pass by to work. There might be a public transport station where people can transfer to ridesharing. You can use Google Maps and the traffic option to see where there often are traffic jams and schedule or map routes to avoid them (change the time and see when it happens during the day and week).

, Are there any HOV lane (high occupancy vehicle) in the area? Are there reserved parking space for carpoolers? If three people carpool, the gas bill and toll road cost will be reduced to one third! Use these points to get people excited about ridesharing.

, If you want to go large, get financing and hire a project manager who can do the steps above in iteration and grow the user group. He or she can facilitate for a continued growth structure, where carpooling is not just benefiting those who drive together but also the other cars and public transport on the road and the overall community.

Enjoy time to yourself.",How to Deal With Being Replaced," Being replaced in a relationship is hurtful because we all need connection and to feel like we belong. You might feel sad, confused, stressed, or angry about your friend or former partner moving on.Trying to deny that you're hurt and angry will just leave you even more frustrated when you hear about or see the other person.Name your negative feelings as they come up. Don't judge them, justify them, or try to change them.It may be helpful to take slow, deep breaths when you're feeling emotional pain.Remember that your thoughts and feelings will not last forever. When you start to get upset and think about being replaced, you can say to yourself, ""I am feeling hurt. This feeling won't last forever. I can get past this.""Write down how you're feeling in a journal to bring yourself some closure.;
, Reflect on the relationship in which you were replaced, left out, or rejected. You may have some responsibility in how things happened, even if they ended up treating you badly. Reflect on your role and decide if you want to talk to the other person about what happened for some closure.Consider seeking advice from a friend who knows your situation and can listen to you without judging. Find someone who can empathize with you and help you figure out what happened., If you need to, talking to the person who replaced you may give you some answers and allow you to detach from the pain of being rejected. Focus on finding out what went wrong to better improve your future relationships.Make sure you're calm before you approach them. Notice any tight sensations in your body or difficulty breathing.Those sensations may be a sign to leave this conversation for later, or that you may need to calm yourself down first. Try taking about ten deep breaths and say to yourself, “This is a difficult situation. All I can do is my best, no matter what the outcome may be.”
State honestly how you feel about what happened.For example, ""I feel confused"" or ""I feel angry.”
Be clear about what you want or need from them. For example, ""I need to know what happened.I'm wondering if I offended you or did something wrong. Would you be willing to talk about it?""
Listen to the other person's words and feelings.Know that you may not get an answer from the other person or that they may not want to engage with you. If you can't get them to talk with you, or if they can't talk to you maturely, let it go., Your natural reaction to being replaced might be to work harder to get back in with that friend or former partner. Be true to yourself, what you like, and what your values are. You shouldn’t have to change who you are. Before trying to fit back in with them, ask yourself:Why do I want to be a part of this group or relationship?
What will I have to change about myself to be with them?
Is it worth it to change?

, You might be tempted to wallow in self-blame. This is not going to help you resolve your feelings on any level. Most likely, the reasons why your friend drifted have more to do with your friend rather than anything you did in particular. Your friend might not be as mature as you, or be mature enough to realize how hurtful your friend’s behavior is.

There is always two sides to a situation. Avoid taking all the blame because it’s not a realistic way of looking at the situation, and it can prolong hurt feelings if you beat yourself up with blame.

, The more you stay away from seeing your ex or former friend on social media, the less you'll be re-exposed to them and who they replaced you with. Stop torturing yourself by looking at the pictures of them with the person they replaced you with.Keep in mind that you're only seeing the good things on Facebook or social media that they post. You're not seeing the full picture of what it's like for them now that they're with this new person.Consider hiding them, de-friending them, or blocking them from your social media accounts.
Consider deactivating your social media accounts briefly or permanently so that you don't have to encounter seeing them with the new person.
Avoid commenting on, liking, or sharing their posts or pictures., It’s natural to feel angry when you're replaced, but you don't need to act out to get their attention.Avoid gossiping, spreading rumors, or being mean to them on social media.

, After you’ve been replaced or rejected, you may start to feel negatively about yourself. You may start to believe you’re not worthy of relationships, but you are. Learning to accept yourself again may take some time and may be challenging, but you can do it.Give yourself a break for any mistakes you’ve made. Everyone makes mistakes, and you can learn and move on from them. This knowledge can enrich your future relationships.
Avoid calling yourself names. That’s not going to help you move forward.

, Even though you’ve been replaced or rejected, you will be okay with time. Remember that now you have more time to focus on yourself and find better relationships. Your ex might have moved on quickly, but this just shows they're not capable of being alone.Prove to yourself that you're capable of being alone by:Focusing on your unique abilities and qualities.
Starting a new hobby.
Participating in sports or other active pursuits.
Focusing on your education or your job.

, To help heal from your sense of being replaced, spend time with other people. Reconnecting with others and trying to find somewhere else where you belong will help you get over the loss of your other friends.If you’re not sure where to meet new people, you can try:Volunteering.
Joining a sports team.
Talking to someone new at work or at school.
Joining a gym.

, Being replaced or rejected never feels good. But it’s important to remember this is a normal part of life. Not everyone you meet is going to like you and you’re not going to like everyone you meet, either. Sometimes relationships have to end. By accepting this, you can focus your energy on yourself and creating better relationships., Make sure you’re making and keeping friends or romantic partners who are actually good for you. Look for people who:Listen without judging.

Accept you for who you are.

Respect your feelings and needs.

Help you when you need them.

, Pay attention to what’s going on in the lives of your loved ones and check-in with them regularly to show you care.Show that you can support and provide a safe space for your partner or friend.Avoid giving advice or criticizing. Try to listen to your loved ones without telling them what to do or judging them. For example, if you sister tells you she is having trouble with her husband, don’t try to offer her advice or criticize her for marrying him. Just listen to what she says and offer your support. Steer clear of critical sounding phrases such as, “You should have…” or “I would have…” Instead, try saying something like, “I am sorry you are having these problems.”
Avoid trying to think of your response as your friend talks. If you are focused on what you are going to say next, then you will not be able to give your full attention. Focus on your friend’s words, not on what you want to say in response.
Ask questions if you don’t understand. If your loved one says something that is unclear, then ask for clarification. Try saying something like, “I think that what you are saying is ___. Is that right?”
Reflect back what they say. Echoing your loved one’s words can help them to feel heard and it can also keep you focused as you listen. Try echoing by repeating a short phrase out of a sentence your loved one speaks now and then. For example, if you friend says, “I had to go to the doctor before work this morning to get a tetanus shot,” then you might echo by saying something like, “Oh, a tetanus shot.”

, It is important to recognize that your time is just as valuable as other people’s time.Therefore, you have the right to say no if someone asks you to do something and you not have the time, energy, or desire to do it.


For example, if your friend asks you to help her move over the weekend, but you have already made plans to go out of town with your boyfriend, then you have the right to tell your friend no. Try saying something like, “I can’t. I already have plans. Maybe you can ask your brother to help you?”
Keep in mind that you also have the right to just say no if someone asks you to do something you don’t want to do. For example, if a friend asks you to complete some of his homework for him, then you can simply say, “No.” You do not have to offer an explanation.

, Make sure that each of you are invested equally in the relationship. Schedule regular plans with each other and keep those plans. Regular contact will keep the relationship stronger.Keep in mind that if you’re the one who’s always making plans or always doing all the work, the relationship may be more one-sided. Your friends or your partner should be making time for you and initiating plans, too., Your relationships will be stronger if you are able to take time for yourself and enjoy being alone by yourself for an hour or two, or even an entire day or night. This will help prevent you from trying to spend too much time with new friends. Not giving them personal space might encourage them to put some distance between you.Develop hobbies you can do on your own, like reading.
Set aside time regularly to be alone.
Do something nice or special for yourself when you do have to be alone.

Assess what is bothering you.,
Consider your own behavior and lifestyle.,
Talk to your other neighbors.,
Talk to the offending neighbors nicely.,
Suggest alternatives.,
Take matters into your own hands.",How to Deal With Annoying Neighbors1," Are the neighbors simply noisy? Is their property a nuisance or hazard? Have they damaged your property in some way? The level of annoyance should determine how much action you take. For example, the neighbor with an infant who cries at 4 A.M. isn't doing anything bad on purpose. Some things you may not be able to prevent or control.
Before taking any official actions, consider how you might solve the problem on your own by talking to your neighbors.
However, if your neighbor's behavior puts you at immediate risk, such as a sanitation issue, don't hesitate to speak up.;
, You may have behaviors or habits that cause issues for your neighbors.


If you tend to be noisy or messy, consider quieting down or cleaning up.
If you have annoying habits, your neighbors will be less accommodating if you complain about them.
Therefore, make sure you are on your best behavior and see if your neighbors follow suit.

, You should see if they are having problems or issues with the people you find annoying or that are causing issues for you. If others are having the same problems with the offending neighbors, this justifies your complaint.
If more than one person is having the same problem, you can consider talking to the offending neighbors together.
There is strength in numbers. If you need to make a formal complaint, you should do this jointly.

, Being demanding and mean to your neighbors can cause hard feelings and may tempt them to be more annoying. Instead, use kindness and reason when dealing with them. Be clear about what is bothering you. You just can't say they are bothering you for no reason.
Be straightforward, but reasonable. Don't yell or shout at your neighbor as that will just cause the situation to escalate.
If your neighbors aren't home often or if you can't get them to agree to sit down and talk, write them a polite letter that states your concerns. , Be creative in thinking of ways to allow the neighbors to do what they do, but in a less annoying manner.


For example, if they like to have noisy parties, ask them to end them earlier or have them only on the weekend.
If their property is a nuisance with tall weeds, garbage, or clutter, offer to help them clean it up.
If they have a pet that is causing a problem, suggest how they can keep the animal on a leash or build a fence.
If they have caused damage to your property you can suggest how they can fix it.

, Do what you can to fix the situation, especially if it is something the neighbors can't help or aren't able to fix. For example, if your problem is a crying infant at night, try sound proofing your walls.
If pets or kids are coming into your yard, consider building a fence.
Try to resolve the situation yourself before lodging a complaint.

Stop looking.,
Move your line of sight.,
Put up visual barriers.,
Talk to them about it.,
Talk to the council or even the police about your neighbor's responsibilities.,
Accept it.",How to Cope With Naked Neighbors," It might be as simple as not looking. If you're guilty of deliberately peering through the bushes or over the fence, then you're not helping yourself. Unless it's totally unavoidable, avert your eyes from those peeping spots!;
, If it is impossible to avert your eyes, move yourself. Sit, stand, sunbathe, mow the lawn, etc. from a different place than from where your line of sight falls upon your naked neighbors.

, If the birthday suit patrolling in your neighbor's yard or garden is continual, then use fences, bushes, trellises, an already well-grown tree transplant, a new outside shed, etc. to block the view.


Install mirrors reflecting back into their yard. That way they'll get the message that you can see what they're gazing upon in those reflections.

, If you've tried to block the visual impact but it's still really bothering you, let them know. Provided they're reasonable and open-minded, they'll listen and perhaps suggest compromises that you can all reach. They might even be prepared to put up higher visual barriers at their expense or to only go naked after dark. And you could offer to remove your telescope from the second floor that focuses on their back yard. You get the drift...


Yes, talking to them about this will be embarrassing. Put on a friendly face and be charming. Ranting or yelling is far less effective than courtesy and a show of embarrassment.
Try simply popping your head over the fence and saying something like ""Er, I hope you don't mind, this is somewhat awkward for me but I and my family can all see you guys wandering around without clothes on."" Your neighbors might be shocked to find out you're actually able to see them.

, They're on private land but there may be laws relevant to decency should your neighbors parade their nudity in full view of the street or where it can be reasonably presumed that they're likely to be seen publicly.

, Lighten up, chill out and let them be. Perhaps they can't stand your noise levels, your bad exterior decorating or your long-winded discussions over the fence. Who knows but nobody's perfect and the human body is something we all share.

If you find your neighbor's behavior is violating terms of the lease in your building, then you can let them know politely they are breaking the lease.
If they are breaking established rules set out in a lease, this can give you some leverage if you make a complaint with your landlord.
If they aren't violating the lease, you can still try to complain to the landlord.

, Give them documentation about the incident with the offending neighbors and any attempts to get the neighbors to clean up their act.


The landlord might not want to hear about minor complaints such as small amounts of noise or things beyond your control, like a crying infant.
It your complaint regards a larger issue such as property damage or illegal activity, the landlord or management company will likely want to step in quickly.
Make sure you give them evidence you have resolved the issue yourself. Landlords will not want to deal with someone who is a constant complainer.

, There may be local laws regarding noise and disturbance, property maintenance, and pet control.


See if your neighbors are violating any of these.
If they are, consider making a complaint to a condo association or neighborhood organization.
You can also call the police if any of these violations get out of hand.

, If you feel threatened in any way, you should call the police. The police will respond to complaints about noise or domestic disturbance.
You may even save someone's life if you call about a domestic disturbance at a neighbor's property.
The police can visit the property to determine if a violation is taking place. For example, if they are violating a noise level ordinance the police can assess that and write a citation.
The police can keep your identity anonymous so the neighbors won't know who made the complaint.
Make a complaint to your local precinct for less immediate concerns. Use these wisely, as too many complaints will be a nuisance to police and may be a distraction from their job.
The police are unlikely to be able to help about something like a dangerous tree limb or overgrown property, so keep your complaints to noise, disturbances, or troublesome behavior. "

Don’t expect any financial reimbursements unless you have lost money due to your neighbors. If your neighbors, for example, have a dangerous tree limb or overgrown property, the court can order them to remedy the issue and/or pay a fine.

, Your lawyer can give you insight on how to file a suit and what to expect from your complaint. Provide all details, documentation, and evidence of formal complaint to your attorney.
Make sure you tell your attorney about any attempts to remedy the situation outside of court. Provide any documents relevant to these attempts such as voicemails, text messages, letters, etc.
If you have suffered property damage or financial losses due to your neighbors, then provide any receipts you have, photos, insurance claims etc.

, Keep in mind that only cases where smaller amounts of money are requested or complaints about local ordinance violations can be processed by small claims courts. Most small claims cases have a damages request limit of $5000.00.
You will need to fill out an application and provide documentation behind your complaint.
Provide receipts or estimates of the damages, and how you arrived at the amount of your requested damages.
Provide any other documentation regarding your complaint against your neighbors such as letters, voicemails, text messages, or emails. You can also provide photos of property damage or a poorly kept property.
If you have called the police, provide any police reports filed in relation to your suit.
Pay the court fee.

, There are several stages to a small claims suit. You will have to file an application and pay a fee, and provide any documentation.
The court will have to notify your neighbors or any other defendants of the suit.
The court will then schedule the court date, and this may take several weeks.
The court case will then take place and the judge or magistrate will make a judgement.
If damages are awarded to you, it may take several weeks or even months to start receiving your settlement. You may even receive it in installments.

Recognize the signs of kleptomania.,
Identify addiction-related stealing.,
Understand that pathological stealing is generally not personal.",How to Understand Why People Choose to Steal1," Kleptomania is a type of impulse control disorder in which a person repeatedly has the urge to steal items that are not needed or that have very little value. A kleptomaniac may not need the item or might even have the money to purchase it. Still, the person compulsively steals because they get a rush from doing it.People with this disorder do not steal for personal gain. They do not usually plan out thefts or collaborate with others to complete them. Instead, these urges come on spontaneously. The person may steal from public places such as stores or from the homes of family or friends.
If you know someone who can’t seem to stop stealing, suggest that they see a doctor. Kleptomania can be treated with therapy and medication.
You might tell the person: ""I noticed that you took something out of that store. I know that you had the money, so I'm guessing you just had a desire to steal it. I'm concerned and I don't want you to get into trouble. Maybe you should talk to a professional. I'm willing to go with you."";
, A kleptomaniac steals merely for the rush and doesn't take the value of the stolen items into consideration. On the contrary, other forms of pathological theft are driven by addiction. In fact, stealing — along with financial difficulties — is often described as one of the warning signs of addiction.


A person with a substance abuse problem or gambling addiction may take money from relatives, friends, and coworkers to fund their addiction. Lying is also a component of this type of theft; therefore, if the person is confronted about the issue, they are likely to deny having a problem.Other signs of addiction may include making friends with a new group while neglecting existing friendships, having trouble with the law, having difficulty functioning at school and work, and having rocky relationships.If you suspect someone you know may be stealing to fund an addiction, get the person professional help immediately. You can approach the person and ask about the behavior: ""Lately you've been behaving differently, withdrawing from your friends, and having trouble keeping money. I'm worried you might have a drug problem.""
If the person is in denial about drug use, you can arrange to stage an intervention. An intervention involves other people who care about the person joining you in reaching out to them and explaining your concerns. This can serve as an impetus to get the person into addiction treatment.

, People who steal pathologically are generally not doing it to intentionally harm anyone. The stealing meets a need — whether emotionally or literally. People who steal for pathological reasons may feel guilty about their behavior, but still be unable to stop it without intervention."

Recognize the signs that someone is sociopathic.,
Understand what drives a sociopath.,
Realize that sociopaths are expert manipulators.,
Don't expect a sociopath to care about your feelings.,
To deal with a sociopath, think like one.,
Consider avoiding the person completely.,
Put up your guard.,
Be skeptical about anything the person tells you.,
Carry on a neutral conversation.,
Never share personal information.,
Avoid talking about what makes you happy or upset.,
Keep your cards close to your chest.,
Show the sociopath that you're on to him or her.,
Do not become indebted to a sociopath.,
Document harassment if it takes place.,
Get professional help.",How to Deal With a Sociopath," Sociopaths have a personality disorder that prevents them from feeling empathy for others. Although they often seem friendly and likable, they use their charm to get people to do things for them. The following traits are common among sociopaths:Superficial charm; everyone seems to like them.
Lack of remorse; they don't feel guilty when they've done something wrong.
Lack of empathy; they don't seem to care when someone else is hurt.
Propensity to lie; they do it casually, like it's nothing.
Incapacity for love; those closest to them realize something is missing.
Egocentricity; they light up when they're the center of attention.
Delusions of grandeur; they often perceive themselves as superior to others.;
, Sociopaths aren't driven by the desire to make the world a better place, help others or be accountable in their closest relationships. ""Doing the right thing"" is not a motivator for a sociopath; rather, sociopaths are motivated by having power over other people and using it to get what they want: more power, money, casual sex and so on.Even if a sociopath takes an action that appears to be good-hearted or kind, there's usually an ulterior motive.
Sociopaths often cheat on their partners, since they don't feel guilt for doing so.

, They're dangerous because they're capable of making people do whatever they want. Sociopaths use a variety of strategies to cause people in their lives to do things for them. They often pit people against each other to achieve their own ends, or have others lie for them to cover up the truth.


Sociopaths are often at the center of love triangles, or the people to break up a marriage.
In a workplace setting, they might undermine coworkers to make themselves look good in front of the boss.
In a friend circle, a sociopath might cause drama that forces people to take sides, while he or she coolly controls the entire situation.

, A sociopath does not care who gets used or hurt, because sociopaths have no conscience or scruples against taking gross advantage of your kindness and goodwill. A key characteristic of a sociopath is that they can not comprehend that others have feelings or can be hurt by their actions.


Sociopaths don't change to become empathetic. No amount of ""talking it through"" or giving the person extra chances is going to make him or her a better person.
If you can distance yourself enough to realize it's not really about you, you'll have more power to stand up to the sociopath.

, Once you recognize that someone in your life is a sociopath, you'll be able to see what drives the person and where his or her weak points are. If you try to handle the person like you would someone without a personality disorder, you'll just end up getting frustrated or pulled back into the person's drama.When you interact with a sociopath, keep your guard up and resist the temptation to talk it out or change the person.
Remember that sociopaths aren't motivated by love, but by power, so you want to show them you won't give them power over you.

, Sociopaths aren't easy to deal with, so if you can cut the person out of your life, that might be best. Your relationship with the person isn't likely to improve. If you're dating someone you think might be a sociopath, or if the person is a friend, you should strongly consider breaking off the relationship.


This is especially true if you have an empathetic, sensitive type of personality. Sociopaths prey on this personality type, so get out while you can.In some cases, though, it's impossible to break things off. Maybe the sociopath is your boss at work, or worse, your parent, child or sibling. If that's the case, you'll need to learn effective ways to handle yourself around the person.

, Don't let yourself be caught off-guard in a vulnerable situation when the sociopath is around. Showing your real emotions will make you a target, since the sociopath will see you as someone who can be easily manipulated. When you have to interact with the person, show that you're completely in control of yourself.


Try putting on a cheerful face whenever the sociopath is around. Even if you're not feeling particularly cheerful that day, you don't want to reveal your true mood to the person.
It's important to show that you're not someone who's easily cracked or swayed. If you're feeling vulnerable, try to stay away from the person for the day.

, Remember that sociopaths are highly skilled at pushing people's buttons to get a rise out of them. If you anticipate this before it happens, you'll be less likely to become a victim of the sociopath's manipulations. Stay calm and casual no matter what the person says.


For example, you might be having a perfectly fine morning at work when your sociopath coworker comes up to you and tells you the boss has a big problem with your latest report. Don't believe what the sociopath tells you until you hear it straight from your boss's mouth.
Or the sociopath in your group of friends might casually tell you about a party you weren't invited to. Wait until you get the story from someone else before you react.

, Instead of letting the sociopath do all the talking, speak up and take the conversation where you want it to go. That way you can keep it in comfortable territory, never giving the person a chance to catch you off-guard with some kind of barb. Agree with the person in complimentary ways whenever you can.


Talk, talk, talk, about anything and everything that is neutral and safe, like weather, sports, and so on.
Continuously change the subject (especially if he or she says something to try to harass you) and try not to have any long moments of silence.

, Never talk about your family, friends, business, finances, dreams, goals, and so on. Sociopaths want to use you, your loved ones, your resources and your connections. To prevent the person from getting what he or she wants, show that you don't have anything up for grabs.


If what the person wants from you is your money, don't let it be easy to find. A sociopath will open your bank statements and look at your account without your permission, so be careful to keep your records secure. Create the impression that you do not have a lot of money and that your friends and family do not have a lot of money, so you won't be seen as a target.
If the person wants power, create the impression that you are not well connected.
If he or she wants to use you, make yourself less desirable.

, If the person knows what you truly love and enjoy, or what makes you angry and sad, they can use that information as a weapon against you.


Avoid complaining, since any information about your weaknesses, things that cause you mental, emotional or psychological pain, or anything that annoys, bothers or hurts you they will use as arsenal to terrorize you.
Don't let the person know when your feelings are hurt. The sociopath will be more likely to repeat the behavior so you'll get hurt again.

, If a sociopath knows your plans ahead of time, he or she might use that knowledge to harass, belittle, discourage or humiliate you. If you plan to do something, don't tell the sociopath about it ahead of time. Wait until you have completed your task before sharing the information.


For example, if you plan to change jobs, first take the exam, go to the interview, get the new job and resign from the old job before you share the good news with the sociopath. Once the event has already taken place, he or she won't be able to find a way to keep you from doing well.
If you live or work with the sociopath, use periods of time when he or she is out of the office or away from home to make small purchases, make small changes or get things done.

, If you want a sociopath out of your life completely, he or she has to realize you aren't going to be duped. The sociopath will eventually give up and move on to another easier target.


Do not react when the person harasses you.
Calmly call the person out when he or she blatantly lies.
Show that you're not susceptible to his or her manipulations.

, One major way that sociopaths get people to do their bidding is by creating a situation that gives them power. Don't do anything that the sociopath could later use to control your behavior. For example,


Don't borrow money from a sociopath.
Don't accept gifts in any form. If the person wants to ""put in a good word for you"" with the boss, politely decline.
Don't accept help in any form.
Don't do anything for which you might later feel the need to apologize.

, If you feel the person is trying to undermine you, it's important to start collecting evidence. Since sociopaths are often quite popular, you might find yourself in a situation where no one believes you unless you have proof that you're being wronged. Save emails and other correspondence so you can share it with the other parties involved if need be.Be careful how you document your interactions with the person. Recording someone without their knowledge is a felony in some states. If you're being harassed and you need to gather proof, you may want to first speak with an attorney to figure out the best course of action.

, If you feel emotionally susceptible to the sociopath, and he or she is having a negative impact on your life, it will help to talk about it with someone who isn't involved. Seek the help of a therapist or psychologist who can help you work through what's happening and give you more tools to deal with the sociopath.

Report at school.,
Handle discrimination at work.,
Make a police report.,
Speak up for yourself and others.,

Deal with stress.,
Practice self-care.",How to Overcome Discrimination," Experiencing discrimination can make you feel low, unworthy, or less important than those around you. Don’t take these experiences to heart. If you’re struggling to feel positive about yourself, start by making a list of your positive qualities. This can help you see the great things about yourself and remind you of who you are.Your list can include physical traits (such as, “My favorite part of my body is my hair”), characteristics (such as, “I am kind, generous, and compassionate”), and your social qualities (such as, “I enjoy making other people feel good and laugh”). You can also practice ways to raise your self-esteem.;
, Negative thoughts can perpetuate feelings of anxiety, depression, and thoughts that things are bad and will never improve. Find ways to stay positive about making changes and feeling good about yourself. Create goals instead of dwelling on negatives, and put things in perspective.For example, ask yourself how you’ve grown or matured as a result of your experiences, or if you’re able to relate to people better due to your own experiences. If you’ve experienced discrimination for being a minority, you might relate to other minorities differently.
If you feel like things will never change and you’ll always feel hopeless, think back to other difficult times when bad things improved for you., Part of being empowered is knowing that you can make a difference. Create some goals around issues of discrimination that matter to you. For example, if you want to make a difference on a personal level, respond to discriminatory comments. If you want to make a difference on a larger scale, organize a group to fight discrimination on your college campus. This can help you feel confident in yourself and your abilities by knowing that you’re making an impact.Face your fears and overcome them. For example, stand up for someone and show that you’re on their side or talk about discrimination during class.

, Know who you can go to for support around issues of discrimination. Find a friend who will listen to you and support you in your struggles. You don’t have to spend lots of time talking about discrimination, just knowing a friend is there and willing to listen is often enough.Have people you know you can talk to and be with comfortably.
Meet in-person instead of texting or calling on the phone.

, If discrimination causes you to feel sad, anxious, invalidated and affects your self-worth, a therapist can help. Your therapist can validate and support your experiences and feelings. You can learn coping skills to manage the effects of discrimination.Therapy can help you learn assertiveness skills and help to increase feelings of empowerment.

, A support group is a place you can meet with other people who also share similar struggles. You can safely share your thoughts and experiences in this group without worrying about judgment or ridicule. Most importantly, you will realize that you are not alone in your struggles. If you’re looking to meet like-minded people with similar experiences or desires for change, a support group can be a great place.Give and receive advice, share resources, and talk about how to make changes.
Find a support group by calling your local mental health clinic, university counseling center, or by doing an internet search.

, Schools and universities often have policies against discrimination and bullying. If something happens on your school or university campus, report it. If you’re in primary or secondary school, report the discrimination to a higher authority, such as a dean, principal, or disciplinary office. Educational programs and activities that receive federal funding prohibit discrimination.For example, discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, disability, and age are prohibited. You can report it at http://www.ed.gov/ocr/complaintprocess.html


, Laws within many countries prohibit discrimination in the workplace. For example, in the USA, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the laws and regulations.If you experience discrimination, report it to your manager, human resources department, or the regulating governmental authority.


Examples of discrimination in the workplace that are prohibited include age, disability, pregnancy, race/color, religion, sex, and national origin., If you want to take legal action, your first step is to file a police report. When submitting a report, make sure it is in writing and not just talked about or discussed. Go to your local police department to file the report. Discuss as much as you can about the incident: when it happened, who perpetrated, what was said or done, and how it was handled. Be clear in expressing what was wrong and how it affected you.Have a clear case and if possible, prove the discrimination. If there’s any doubt, people may question your allegations, which can make any formal proceedings more difficult.

, If you feel like you’re being discriminated against, speak up. If you know someone else is experiencing discrimination or suspect it happening around you, say something. Let people know that you care and want to help them, and resolve to be a positive force in your community against discrimination.Let people know that you will stand up for them if they’re experiencing discrimination.

, Advocacy groups exist to help raise awareness, safeguard rights, express concerns and find solutions.You can propose changes in policy, ask for increased inclusion, and take steps to make all people involved feel comfortable. Find an advocacy group that will help you make a difference. For example, join a women’s center, LGBT safe space, or diversity group and advocate for what’s needed. It can be helpful to meet with other like-minded people who also want to make a difference.


Find ways to make a difference in the workplace, school or university, community, or local government. Do an internet search to find an advocacy group near you or join a national group.

, If you’re struggling with issues around discrimination, don’t hold your feelings in or hope that they will go away. Find a healthy outlet for your emotions so that you feel safe to acknowledge and express your experiences and feelings around them. Try journaling, playing or listening to music, dancing, or painting. Focus on letting your feelings out and not bottling them up.Find activities that help you clear your mind and feel better after you’ve completed them.

, Find some healthy outlets for stress, such as relaxation. Practice every day to keep your stress levels low and deal with accumulated stress.Find an activity that feels restful, relaxing, and calming and that you can realistically do every day. You might want to try daily yoga, qi gong, tai chi, and meditation.


Practicing relaxation for 30 minutes each day can help keep depression away and can help stabilize your moods.

, Even simple tasks like getting enough sleep and eating nutritious meals can ensure that you feel your best and help you feel good emotionally.Fuel your body and help yourself feel good. Do activities that you enjoy and pay attention to how you feel.


If you need a pick-me-up, go on a walk or do some exercise. You can also call a friend or listen to music that helps you feel good.

Recognize that words can hurt.,
When you think about a joke, think about what subject matter it deals with.,
Consider that a vulnerable person may be listening to your joke.,
Ask yourself whether you are punching up or punching down.,
Choose insults that cover things that people can control, or make unflattering comparisons.,
Apologize if you hurt someone.,
Ask yourself if it will add anything good to the world.",How to Not Make Jokes That Are Highly Offensive to Others," Write down a few of your prominent characteristics, and imagine if people used them as an insult. It would sting, wouldn't it? Now take into account that some people are especially sensitive, and some characteristics are used as insults. How many times has a woman heard that she is too emotional, a disabled person heard that bad things are ""stupid,"" or a black person taken extra safety precautions because they are stereotyped as violent? Words and microaggressions add up.;
, Some topics are more likely to strike a sensitive spot than others are.


Death
Others being hurt (from mild injuries to serious ones like rape)
Stereotypes about a group of people
Suggesting that people do something harmful

, For example, imagine yourself telling someone ""jokingly"" to kill themselves while the person is secretly dealing with self-esteem issues. Or that a rape victim will hear you joking about rape, or that the person listening to you talking about ""cutters"" secretly struggled with self-harm for five years.


Even if a vulnerable person isn't nearby, you'll be shaping people's opinions of those who are vulnerable.
Or maybe a rapist may hear you making a rape joke. Do you want a rapist laughing along, secretly considering you an ally?

, ""Punching up"" means poking fun at the more powerful party in this scenario, and it often challenges unfair power dynamics. ""Punching down"" means making fun of those who are not in power. Punching down should be avoided as it hurts the people who are most vulnerable, and they will quietly stop considering you someone they can trust. Punching up, when done well, causes no real harm (besides perhaps bruising inflated egos) and invites productive critical thought.


Making fun of women, LGBTQIA people, people of color, disabled people, fat people, poor people, and other marginalized groups is punching down.
Jon Stewart was punching down when he made fun of the autistic people who protested against Autism Speaks.Autistic people felt that they were fighting against a huge organization for their right to exist, and Jon Stewart was joining the voices telling them to shut up.
Misandry jokes, such as ""men are so hormonal; lesbians go in locker rooms with women all the time without harassing anyone"" are an example of punching up. These people don't hate men; they're turning the tables on the harassers and pointing out the myth that men have no self-control., For example, people can't choose how intelligent they are, but ignorance, rudeness, and bad behavior are all choices. Feel free to get creative to come up with unique insults! Try mixing and matching from some of these...


Personal odor (Did you bathe in a swamp?)
Comparisons to disgusting things (trash, slime, dirt)
Animals (muddy pig, frog wart)
Ignorance (He is about as well-informed as a man who sits in his house all day making fart noises.)
Rudeness or general terrible personality (You are the human equivalent of a mosquito.)

, While a good faith comedian's jokes are usually well-received, you may eventually tread on someone's toes by accident. You can minimize damage by taking responsibility for it and apologizing wholeheartedly.


""I'm really sorry that I upset you. I didn't think that it would hurt you, and I should have known better. I apologize.""
""I'm sorry my race joke caused such an issue. My intent was to deconstruct white privilege, not to make things worse. Looking back, it was an ill-advised joke. I'm truly sorry.""

, Will your joke be well-received? Will it cause genuine smiles, or could it cause pain? A good joke makes the world a happier place for everyone.

Ensure you have a creek, brook, stream, or any other small river of water with low banks and houses on either side.,

, Enter the body of water(creek from now on) in a good, easily traversable spot. You will return to this point if you want to end it or do something less manly.(For the purpose of this tutorial, the objective is to reach a drainage pipe 30 meters from the starting point.)

, DO NOT go splashing around in the middle. This will cause noise and attention.

,,


If there is a gap between sand bars or paths, look for a way to cross. Don't be afraid to get your feet wet. Just try not to make any noise if you must.

Understand that some people steal to meet their basic needs.,
Realize that stealing can happen due to peer pressure.,
Notice a lack of empathy.,
Recognize that some people steal to fill emotional holes.,
Consider that some people steal just because they can.",How to Understand Why People Choose to Steal2," Desperation is a common reason behind many thefts. A person may not have a job or source of income or have insufficient means to provide for their family. As a result, the person steals to feed children or provide shelter. , Being in the wrong crowd can also prompt someone to develop a habit of stealing. In such cases, the value of the stolen item may not matter as much as the thrill of taking something and potentially getting away with it. This type of stealing is very common in teens who are susceptible to peer pressure. They may do it to look cool or be accepted by a group of peers., A teenager or person who has difficulty seeing the ""bigger picture"" may steal without really thinking through their impulsive action might affect someone in the future. The person is not pathological — they are capable of empathy — but in the moment they may act without thinking how stealing will hurt the person or business from which they are stealing. If confronted or asked to think through their actions, this person probably would not steal.

, In some cases, a person who has suffered an early attachment loss or trauma may steal to compensate.These individuals’ basic emotional needs are not being met. In an attempt to fill an emotional hole left behind by a parent or caregiver, the child may compulsively steal to resolve feelings of deprivation. Unfortunately, the stealing does not resolve the issue, so the individual steals more and more., Unfortunately, some thefts occur simply because the person has the opportunity. Maybe they get a sense of excitement from taking what’s not theirs. Perhaps they see it as a challenge. They may steal out of greed when they already have plenty."
"
Involve the authorities.,
Reestablish safety as soon as possible.,
Try to follow your normal routine.,
Take care of yourself.,
Lean on your support system.",How to Understand Why People Choose to Steal3," If you have had something stolen from you, the first logical step is to report the theft to the police. Give your local police as much detail as you can to help them identify the stolen property and any potential suspects. Taking action right away is your best chance for recovering the stolen items and capturing the thief.If your identity was stolen, there are specific steps you must follow to recover from the theft and protect yourself in the future. Visit the Federal Trade Commission’s at IdentityTheft.gov for more information., If you have recently had your home or personal property burglarized, it’s important that you recover your sense of security. Repair any damages that were done to your home. Have a security company come out and inspect your home for “weak spots” such as the window frames and door hinges. Alert your neighbors and verify that they are taking precautions to protect themselves.It’s also a good idea to create a safety plan for you and your family on how to respond if a theft happens in the future. You can develop best practices for securing valuables and decide on a place for children to hide if a burglar gets in the house.

, Although it may be difficult to go about your life as usual, you must. It’s perfectly normal to feel afraid after going through a traumatic ordeal such as a burglary; however, you must not let fear incapacitate you., Don’t allow self-pity to make you neglect your general health and well-being. Experiencing a theft can cause a great deal of stress in your life. Try to get adequate sleep each night. Eat well-balanced meals and exercise to increase your strength and emotional well-being. If you nurture your mind and body during this time, you can more easily move beyond the negative feelings you are experiencing., Turn to neighbors, family, friends, and your local community to recover from a theft. Be honest if there is something someone can help you do to feel more safe and secure in your home or community. Don’t hesitate to draw comfort from close friends and relatives who are ready to offer you support.For example, you might ask a neighbor: ""Would you mind keeping an eye on the house this weekend? We'll be out of town Friday and Saturday and I've been uneasy since the break-in.""

Check out your own negativity before tarring everyone around you with the same brush.,
Take your reflection and use this to help you to feel less negative.,
Turn negativity around you it on its head.,
Remind yourself that the negativity in other people is your perception.,
Find a source of compassion.,
Prepare yourself.,
Do not avoid people you perceive as negative.,
Give a reason to leave negativity behind.,
Practice patient tolerance.,
Remember that it may seem very easy to leave the negative people around you and hard to deal with them.",How to Stay Positive Amid Negativity," Consider in what ways you might be contributing to the negativity you perceive around you by your thoughts and actions. Some examples to consider include:


You think everyone else is negative because your ideas are never well received. Perhaps your ideas need more thinking through first and people are being constructive in their feedback, not negative.
You think everyone else is negative because you don't like their advice. Yet, maybe their advice is telling you the very things you need in order to improve yourself, your project, your work, your creations, etc.
You think everyone else is negative because they're always telling you what to do. In this case, you've slipped into a generalization––are people really always telling you what to do? Or is this perhaps an exaggeration of a few times this has happened and you're making more of it than is real? And what are they telling you to do exactly? Think this one through carefully.;
, If you do consider that maybe some of your impression that others have been overly negative around you is partly how you view their actions toward you, then you're on the right track to resolving those aspects of negativity.

, Be a source of positive vibes, comments, and morale. However, the trick to this is to be more thoughtful and caring about what lies at the heart of their negativity rather than trying to be an unrealistic ray of sunshine. In particular, there is a fine balance involved of being positive without being a preacher or a dismissive sort, as the latter two attitudes simply confirm to those feeling negative that nobody's listening anyway. Some ways to go about this include:


Acknowledge complaints but don't commiserate or agree with them. Instead, suggest a solution, a change, a new direction or a source of help.

For example, if someone is complaining that they can't manage the workload, you could say something like: ""I can see you're swamped. How about delegating some of that to Jenny, who has been asking for weeks for a new direction in what she works on?"" .


Acknowledge the sadness, exhaustion or confusion of another but offer a way forward.

For example, someone may lament that they are just feeling too overwhelmed to participate in doing something about climate change. You could reply: ""I know it's a huge and scary issue. But it's an important one that affects our lifestyle and happiness. I'm heading down to the climate rally this weekend and I have room in the hybrid for you.""


Acknowledge the insecurities but don't buy into them. Instead, offer a compliment and ask for more of the good.

For example, someone might be whining that they're never any good at doing X and they never get picked because of that. In turn, you could say something like: ""It must seem hard to feel that your liberal arts degree isn't taken seriously among all the economists here. But you have amazing insights into how to keep all of the workers here happy and creative, which isn't something I see the economists managing to do at all. Don't give up. I'll remind everyone at the meeting this week that you had a great idea about the water cooler jamboree and we'll go from there.""



, Realize that in the majority of cases, life has dealt ""negative"" people raw deals, harsh outcomes and nasty bites. And some people nurse these wounds longer than others. And while those experiences are not an excuse to remain in the doldrums eternally, and it's a fair thing to say that practically every person has such experiences in life, it's not appropriate to presume that the person should just be ""over it"" or capable of finding the sunshine with a bit of prodding. Some things to bear in mind when interacting with others include:


We take people as they come to us. We don't know what stage they're in as they work through their issues and they might be delicate, they might be on the cusp of resolving it, they might be so fragile they're about to explode. The best thing is to not probe but to be a source of support, understanding and reasoned acceptance.
Realize and respect your own limitations. If you are feeling fragile, vulnerable, down, etc. yourself, then you are more likely to find another person's negativity bruising. It becomes an equation of two bruised people rubbing each other up the wrong way when you don't feel that functional yourself. So be absolutely aware of your own state before blaming others for your feeling negative or forming ""let's backstab"" gossip cabals; both approaches may feel cathartic but are actually digging your own negativity well even deeper.

, For yourself, then for the other. It isn't something you can buy off the shelf. It has to be learned, experienced and be generated from a place of personal understanding. Standing in another person's shoes takes courage and is often something that doesn't come to us until we've had a hard knock and lived through a similar experience. You'll know you can be compassionate when it ceases to be all about nurturing just you but spreads outward to help nurture others too.


Remind yourself, no matter how difficult it seems at times, that the ""negative"" human being confronting you is experiencing the same things you are, living in your part of the world, earning a living as you are, striving to make life better just as you are.
Get sufficient sleep for your body's needs. Lack of it is a major source of feeling negative and lacking in compassion. Test yourself––do you tend to feel more negative on days after less sleep? Most likely you will, so use that knowledge wisely.

, If you don't prepare yourself to stay positive amid the negativity, then you really can't deal with the negative ones. Prepare your mind that there will be lots of people around you who will throw out negative comments to you. It's you who need to stand out and deal with them. Don't let them dominate you. It's you who will bring the change to their minds.

, This may go contrary to much advice about cutting out people who bug you. That's easy initially but it's not very different from sweeping dust under the rug––it's still there and it still needs to be dealt with eventually. Dealing with negativity is similar––push it away from you and it may seem as if it has disappeared from your life. The trouble is, that's all you've done, pushed it away. You haven't taught yourself how to handle it, how to cope when it arises again (and it will definitely do so, possibly from the people you least expect or want it from). The thing with negativity is that, everyone expresses some at different points in life (see the discussion earlier). And sometimes you do too. It's a coping mechanism and you are going to encounter it again and again and again. Thus, it is better to learn to deal with it in ways that don't involve pushing it away. Namely, learn to stand up for yourself so that negativity bounces off but the person doesn't.


Avoiding a negative person will not resolve their negativity in relation to you. Indeed, they're most likely to say even more negative comments about you. It may get to the point where they forget why they got to the stage of hating you but they know they do and that's enough for them.
Don't care what they think? Good for you but that still hasn't resolved the fact that you do care about being swamped in negativity. And if you reach out and be kind, you might not change their opinion of you personally but they will know that there is kindness in the world, there is a chance for them to find their own courage to balance the negativity with some positive action and brighter emotions.

, Be a role model of not spreading negativity. While it's true you don't need to explain anything to negative people, sometimes you have to. If you explain or start to show them the reasoning behind your positive statements and actions, day by day they will decrease the level of negativity, at least around you, in an effort to match your likely upbeat, reasoned or practical response. Because whenever they try to make you negative, it will pop up in their mind that it's going to be useless to spend the time carping about life around you. At that point, you've warded off at least one negative soul and obliged them to keep their negative attitude away from your sphere.

, Whenever the negative people start complaining around you, why don't you play a patience game with yourself? You can just keep quiet and count down numbers and see how long you can be patient. You can also try to divert your mind toward thinking about funny things. Make up different characters of these people in mind (funny ones) and when they will appear in front of you, you won't be able to stop laughing or smiling and thus they will get a little tiny bit embarrassed or wonder why you can't take the barrage of negativity seriously. They may think twice before they come and disturb you.

, Don't let yourself stoop to that though; instead, go on and show them the greatness of being positive, practical, reasoned and solutions oriented.

Create boundaries of interaction.,
Help to redirect their insecurity to something positive.,
Avoid spending too much time on emotionally draining people.,
Explore trust issues with a jealous partner.,
Be in control of your own emotions.",How to Deal With an Insecure Person1," People who struggle with insecurity may need constant reassurance and support, which you can't always provide. Talk with them about boundaries so that you don't feel overwhelmed or frustrated by their behavior.


For example, if you're in a relationship with someone who's insecure, they may want to know what you're doing and where you are. While it's important to check in with them via phone or text, talk with them ahead of time about boundaries when you're out or away from them. Stick to what you both agree to do.
Perhaps you have a co-worker or classmate who seems to need your constant attention. Define good times to talk and interact with them. Consider saying things like, ""I want to be available for you, but I also have some work to do. Why don't we talk after class or at lunch?"";
, Insecure people are often anxious about something or someone. Maybe they have been hurt by old boyfriends. Maybe they've been bullied about the way they look. Help to reduce their anxiety and focus on positive thoughts.


Act as a reminder when they seem to be focusing on the negative, and try to redirect their thoughts to positive things. For example, ""I know those people can be mean, but remember that you have my support, and the support of your friends.""
If the conversation appears fixated on the negative, refocus the conversation on something positive that you see in them or neutral topic of conversation. Consider complimenting them for something. Or discuss topics of mutual interests such as movies, sports, or other activities.

, Insecure people can be emotionally draining, and seem to make you feel more tired afterwards. They may act dependent on you for all their needs. Avoid feeling like their caretaker, and set boundaries.Motivate them to find ways to cope without you always there.
Set specific times when you'll talk and meet. Instead of avoiding them completing, make sure to set times that work for you and them.
Be clear and polite that you need to have some space, but that doesn't mean you don't care for them. Explain to them how personal space or time away from each other can be healthy at times.
Remind them that you can't be solely responsible for making them feel better. That's too much for one person. Not only is that emotionally exhausting, but you may inadvertently enable them to depend on you 24/7.

, You may have a partner or a spouse that appears to act jealous and insecure. They may seem to act irrationally or fearful that you'll leave them. Provide reassurance and define ways to keep the relationship healthy.When a jealous person comes forward with accusations, provide reassurance rather than getting upset.
Demonstrate how you plan to stay committed and faithful, but that for the relationship to work it must be built on trust.
Explore any past issues that your partner has had with feeling rejected, unloved, or lied to by former partners, friends, or family.
Encourage a sense of independence in your partner. Find ways to encourage them to have an independent life rather than fixating on yours. Help them to find personal goals that are fulfilling for them.

, Recognize when insecure people are making you feel anxious, upset, sad, or frustrated. If you are feeling unable to talk with or help someone who is feeling insecure, take a step back and assess what might be best for you.If you feel like they are stressing you out, politely tell them that you need to talk with them later and hope to have a better conversation then.
Take a break from whatever or whoever is bothering you. It can be as simple as getting some physical distance from the situation for a few minutes or more until you feel calmer. Try saying something like, ""I know you're feeling anxious, and I'm here for you. Right now I need to take a break to unwind a bit. I'll be ready to help you again in an hour.""

Understand their perspective.,
Be kind and respectful.,
Ask them about what's bothering them.,
See opportunities to get to know them better.,
Provide reassurance and empathy.",How to Deal With an Insecure Person2," People who struggle with insecurity often feel anxious about work, school, friends, family, or their own self-image. It can seem to come out of nowhere, or it may be triggered by past negative events. Be open and willing to listen.Listen to what's bothering them. Things that seem small to you might actually be bigger, deeper issues for them. For example, if the person is worried about the shoes they're wearing, this insecurity might reflect a larger anxiety about whether they fit in with their peers.
Be non-judgmental. Try to understand how they may feel, and what you might need if you were in their shoes.
If they are hesitant to talk with you, consider just saying a few words to show you understand their feelings, such as ""I'm sorry about what you're feeling"" or ""That sounds tough.""

, While some insecure people may come off as rude or cold, avoid letting your own insecurities or judgments play out. Be kind, polite, and respectful. While it may be difficult to be this way at times, it will make it easier in the long run to deal with someone who is feeling insecure or unappreciated.Use body language that indicates you're willing to help and listen. Maintain eye contact and give your full attention.
Smile and be open to talking with them about what's bothering them.

, If the two of you are friends, it's important to talk with them about how they're feeling. If they are acquaintances to you, consider ways to be more open and talk with them, without making them feel uncomfortable.


Consider starting the conversation in a general way, but then point out something that you've noticed in them. For example, ""Hey, how's it going? I noticed you didn't come to practice after school yesterday, and wondered if you're doing okay?""
Be open to the fact that some people may not feel ready to talk about what's bothering them, but it's important to show that you're concerned. For example, ""It looks like it's been a tough day. If you want to talk, I'm here.""
If you need to stop the conversation, then use polite words and say something like, ""It was nice to talk with you. Okay if we catch up more tomorrow?"" or ""I hope you feel better. I'm free to talk more the evening, if you'd like.""

, Sometimes, insecure people feel underappreciated or unloved. By showing an interest them, you may help them to feel better.


Spend time with them one-on-one if possible. You may be able to see what's bothering them in a more real way. Insecure people are less likely to be open and honest in larger crowds.
Consider asking them to do things with you and your friends. Make them feel included.

, Show that you care with your words and actions. Demonstrate that you are emotionally connected to their feelings and insecurities in a genuine way.Say things like, ""Just know that I'm here for you and care about you"" or ""I know you can overcome what you're facing. You're a strong person.""
If this person is a close friend, family member, or partner, consider giving hugs or other forms of affection as appropriate. Only hug them after asking first and if they are open to this.
Tell them it's going to be okay, and things will get better. Provide hope and motivation to succeed rather than reminding them of the bad things.

"
"
Encourage them to work on their own self-esteem.,
See how the insecurities impact themselves and others.,
Focus on the positive.,
Communicate with them about what they're doing well.,
Encourage them to find activities they enjoy.",How to Deal With an Insecure Person3," While you can try to boost the person’s self-esteem with compliments and by being a supportive friend, the person will also need to do some work to develop their own self-esteem. Try to encourage your friend to work on their self-esteem by providing examples of what has worked for you.

For example, you might encourage your friend to try daily self-affirmations and say something like, ""When I'm having a crummy day or feeling low, I like to boost myself up with mirror compliments. I start by looking at myself in a mirror and then I find one nice thing to say to myself, like ‘My hair looks so full and shiny today! I love it!’""

, Insecurities can come out in a variety of unhealthy ways. Sometimes people will act rude, jealous, or controlling. Some insecure people may lack insight into how their behaviors are damaging to themselves or others. Try to understand how insecure people impact you and others in these ways:Relationships. Do you feel your partner is needy, dependent, controlling, or untrustworthy? Help them to be less dependent and more trusting.
Work. Do you feel your co-workers are manipulative, rude, or jealous of you? Help them to find positive things in the workplace, and be friendly.
Family and Home. Do you feel like your family or relatives are judgmental, paranoid, rude to others, or constantly depressed? Help to reduce anxiety and stress in the home by being a role model.

, Insecure people often focus a lot more on the negative aspects of their lives such as a lack of love, support, money, or appreciation. They feel like they've been victimized (and maybe they have in the past). Give them positive things to focus on.Keep conversations positive and light. Avoid topics that could lead to a venting session or more negative talk.
Remind them of things that are positive or encouraging. It could be a positive quote, a cat video, pictures of family or friends, or other things that boost their spirits.
Sometimes, it can just be telling them that you like their shirt, shoes, a decoration on their bag, or a new gadget they're using. Tell them something to feel good about themselves.

, Help to boost their self-esteem by focusing on the things that they're doing well, rather than reminding them of the bad things. It's important for insecure people to feel like they have worth and value.


For example, say things like, ""That meal you made was fantastic"" or ""You seem to really know a lot about baseball"" or ""You are such a great artist.""
Let them know that you notice the little things that they do well. Often the ordinary and daily tasks can be overlooked, but a reminder that they do things well can be reassuring. For example, ""Thanks for helping me understand that math problem"" or ""Thanks for giving me a ride"" or ""You are so organized with your calendar.""

, Insecure people may feel like everyone's against them or that they have little to offer. Help them to find activities that they enjoy. Encourage them to find things that are uniquely interesting to them, rather than just going along with others. Consider activities such as:Intramural sports, fitness classes, or outdoor clubs
Art or music classes
Volunteering with different non-profits or other organizations
Enrichment classes at a local community college or university
Clubs or online social groups such as those through Meetup.com

"
"
Evaluate if their mood or behaviors are getting worse.,
Encourage them to talk with a counselor.,
Identify other supports available to help them.",How to Deal With an Insecure Person4," If the person appears to be increasingly upset, depressed, irritable, or anxious over a few weeks, consider reaching out to your work, school, or community about ways to help them.


If in school, talk with a teacher, school counselor, or advisor about the changes in their behavior.
If at work, talk with a supervisor or colleague about if they can offer additional support.
If at home, talk with other relatives or friends for advice.

, Insecure people may feel like they have a limited support system, or don't trust those around them. They may have difficulty with coping, and instead use unhealthy ways to cope. Approach them about talking with a counselor as a way to cope with what's bothering them.Remind them that counselors are non-judgmental and focus on providing support and healing.
Help them to find counselors through their school, community, or place of worship. Help them to normalize going to counseling for support.
See if there are support groups available, depending on the issue or insecure that they're facing.

, Make sure that an insecure person knows that they're not alone. Show them that people care about them. Encourage them to connect more with the supportive people in their lives.Reach out to positive and supportive people. Discuss with those supportive people that more encouragement is needed for those who are feeling insecure.
Help them focus on ways to feel included. Encourage them to do new and different things. Find people who can go with them, so they feel less alone or anxious.
Identify ways to encourage independence in them. They may feel like they can't do things on their own. Teach them how being more independent will make them feel more confident and less insecure. Be positive and supportive as they find ways to cope better with what's bothering them.

Consider what makes you fail to trust other people.,
Think about what you expect from others.,
Decide whether you're prepared to trust or distrust life.,
Be discerning rather than suspicious.,
Give people their space.,
Deal with past pain.,
Make a decision to find more constructive ways to cope with breaches of trust.,
Stop expecting others to know what you want.",How to Overcome Trust Issues in a Relationship," Trust is harder for some people than others, often due to past experiences, recent letdowns or maybe even the way you were raised as a child. If you have had people let you down, fail to support you or fail to come through when you asked for their help, you may find it hard to trust. On the other hand, if you've had supportive people who have guided you through hard situations and have helped you to learn to cope with disappointment, you're more likely to have learned to trust people. If you do find it hard to trust, some of these issues may be stumbling blocks for you:


You feel that people aren't reliable; you generalize this to include every person you encounter, regardless of their reassurances.
You feel a need to shield yourself against being hurt by putting up defensive barriers before you even give other people a chance.
You don't like asking for help and feel it's just easier to do things yourself to make sure they're done properly, or at all.
You are a poor judge of character and seem to end up with more-than-usual untrustworthy types in your life.
You are sometimes a pushover and seem to attract people who take advantage of your generosity or willingness to be helpful.;
, Perhaps you have very high expectations, maybe too high. Some of the following things can cause trust issues in relationships:


Do you expect people to just ""know"" what you want or to ""mind read""? This can often be a cause of lacking trust in others because they don't do things you've imagined should be done but failed to articulate.
You expect people to give as much as you've given. The thing about giving is that giving in relationships shouldn't be about weighing up who has done what. If you didn't give freely but expected something in return, then you will feel a lack of trust if the other person doesn't reciprocate.
You have low expectations of other people all of the time. In this case, it's hard for you to trust anyone.
When it comes to romance or intimacy, you have tough expectations that your partner will stick close by you. This can lead to smothering and even stalker-like behavior if taken to too great an extreme.

, Think about the wider consequences of not trusting everyone throughout your life. It takes great effort, it alienates you and it leaves you constantly suspicious and disappointed. Is that an enjoyable way to live life? Hardly. Think about the bigger picture and how trusting will more likely result in positive outcomes that will far outweigh those negative times.

, Trust is not about gullibility; gut feelings and critical analysis are still important parts of your outlook on life. There will be times when you think something is fishy and on such occasions, it's worth changing your approach and finding out more details before placing your faith in a person or a deal. But it also pays to be discerning, to realize that most people mean the best and expect to do things on an even level with you.

, Whether it's for an intimate relationship or a business or social acquaintance, nobody likes to be smothered by someone who wants to know their every move. A cornered animal will always fight like crazy to defend itself and you can expect very similar behavior from a person who feels followed, pursued, and treated suspiciously. By backing off and letting people feel they have space around you, you create a space for honesty and greater sharing.


If you sneak through people's belongings, writings (journal) or follow them about, stop now. It's highly likely they either know you're doing it or will find out soon enough and it's creepy, it's controlling and it's likely to destroy their trust in you. Two sources of broken trust do not make for a mended whole.

, Failed love, failed business deals, failed friendships––they all take their toll in the memory bank. But they are a part of your life, not all of it. Bad things do happen, yet how we react is what matters. Try to stop dwelling on what went wrong and start looking instead at what you learned from the experience.


Be aware that the more you focus on what was negative in the past, the greater it becomes with each retelling. What purpose is this really serving you? Often is becomes your own personal safety story rather than a reflection of reality. Over time, its retelling wears thin on those people who could otherwise be in a position to help you and guide you to better, happier choices. Try to let go of such stories that you tell yourself.

, There is no guarantee in life that your trust won't be broken. But you can make a decision to deal with such breaches in ways that don't add to a negative view of life. For instance:


Realize that some people are simply bad eggs. Not every person is though, so keep seeking the good.
Take the lesson out of the situation you've gone through. What can you do better next time? What did you do to contribute to the breach of trust? For example, you may have failed to notice tell-tale signs or not done checks that would have revealed issues earlier.
Forgive the person who breached your trust. If you don't, you carry that person with you for all times, into the future. That gives away too much of your own power.

, Unless you're prepared to articulate your wants clearly, you cannot expect people to mind read. Learn to speak clearly, be assertive about your needs and stand up for what matters to you. It is unfair to blame others for letting you down if you've failed to make it clear in what ways you expected more from them.


Set ground rules in business and intimate relationships that work not just for you, but for both parties. With both of you knowing the expectations, then you have clear boundaries and understandings.

Figure out what they want.,
Stay calm.,
Tell the person to stop what they're doing.,
Be honest, to a point.,
Document and report bullying or harassment.,
Treat minor irritations for what they are.",How to Make People Leave You Alone1," If someone, or a group of people keeps bugging you, it's important to figure out what they're looking for, so you can figure out how to approach the situation. Learning to confront and deal with the person's expectations will end it more quickly.



Bullies are looking for a response, and take delight in getting a rise out of people to make themselves feel superior. If someone is looking for a reaction from you, stay calm, confront them, or get help if necessary. Avoiding the situation can just perpetuate the harassment and make it worse.

Harassers may be attracted to you. Even if their behavior seems annoying or cruel, it could be a sign of infatuation. It's important to avoid making excuses to get out of the situation, and confront these expectations honestly, getting back-up support from others. Tell harassers you're not interested, nothing will change that, and you'll contact the authorities if this behavior continues.

Irritating people are often just socially awkward people, who might be annoying, but unaware. Being irritating might just be a sign that someone can't or doesn't recognize that you're feeling annoyed and would rather be left alone. Stay calm and communicate this to them to stop the behavior.;
, Whoever you're dealing with, you can stop the behavior more quickly if you're calm, cool, and collected. Remember, bullies want a reaction, and socially awkward people might be hurt inadvertently if you get very angry or upset with them.


If bullies repeatedly fail to get a rise out of you, they'll get bored. This is how bullies operate. They'll quickly move on to someone they'll be able to get a reaction from.
Dont' take it personally or let harassers make you feel guilty. If someone is bugging you, it's not something you asked for or deserve. Stay calm and address the problem.

, In as even a tone of voice as possible, just say clearly, ""Please stop."" You don't need to say why you want them to stop


If you feel like your'e being physically threatened, put a hand out in front of you, making a ""stop"" signal. Say, ""Just stop, please.""

, The best way to let people know you want to be left alone? Say so. To end most irritating behavior, all you've got to do is turn to the person who is bothering you, make eye contact, take a deep breath, and say in a calm, even voice, ""Please stop doing that. You're bothering me.""


If someone keeps asking you for a date, and you're feeling harassed, it's important to be honest. Don't say, ""I've got a partner"" or ""I'm busy on Friday"" to get out of the situation quickly. Instead, say, ""I'm not interested. Sorry.""
Don't tell bullies anything. If you say, ""You're bothering me,"" or ""This is really annoying,"" you're just confirming that they're getting the reaction they want. Ignore the behavior, stay calm, and say, ""Stop please"" if you must.

, If someone is being more than annoying, don't try to take it on all by yourself, and don't let yourself be manipulated into a situation you won't be able to handle. It's very important to document any kind of harassment, bullying, or abuse, and report it to the proper authority.


Get witnesses to in-person bullying, and keep any texts, e-mail, or other digital correspondence that suggests the harassment you're reporting.
If this happens at school, tell your teacher, counsellor, or principal as soon as possible. At the workplace, tell your supervisor, or boss. At home, call the cops.

, In some cases, if someone keeps pushing your buttons, it's way easier to loosen up a bit instead of letting yourself get so annoyed. If your little brother is being a pill and won't stop asking you to play basketball, for example, it would be better to give him 15 minutes of hoop-shooting than to have to keep telling him ""No"" for the next two hours. Recognize when it would be easier to be the bigger person.


Try bargaining. Say, ""I'll play on one condition. I can do 15 minutes now, but then you've got to occupy yourself, ok? We can play more this weekend, but if you come bug me again today, I won't. Deal?"" Make sure the person agrees to your terms, and stay firm with your rule.
It's never easier to give in to bullies or harassers. If they attempt to negotiate ""just one date,"" it won't end there. Negotiation should only apply to minor irritants, not to serious harassment.

Collect evidence.",How to Support Victims of Stalking," The victim may feel frightened, scared, confused, sad, or hopeless. Let the person discuss feelings, thoughts, ideas, and plans. It’s not your job to take over, problem-solve, or do everything, just listen. If the individual asks for help, offer it, but don’t make it your job to solve all the problems. Focus on showing your support by listening without interrupting.


For more information, check out How to Be a Good Listener.;
, Saying things like, “If only you would have left the relationship sooner” or, “Well, you did leave the window unlocked” are not helpful. Nobody asks to be stalked and it is a terrifying experience. Avoid any criticisms or judgments and focus on helping the person.


Avoid saying more subtle things that express blame as well, such as, ""If only you had left sooner,"" or, ""I wish you hadn't given your number out like that."" Someone who says these things might mean well, but the phrasing implies that the person could have prevented being a victim, which isn't true.

, Every stalking case is different. If you helped someone else with a stalker, don’t expect things to be the same with this friend. Be sensitive to differences and don’t make choices for the victim. Let this person make their own choices.You may wish to present options, but do not make the decisions for them.


Especially if life feels out of control, it can be important for the person to have control over certain aspects of responding, as stalking can feel very out of control.

, While the victim may be nervous or afraid to tell friends and families about the stalking, it’s important that people know. The stalker may try to inadvertently get information from unsuspecting friends or family. For this reason, it’s important to alert those around the victim as to the situation.Help the victim come up with a list of people to talk to about the stalking. You may wish to help tell friends and family members and alert them what to do in case the stalker comes around. You may want to provide a photo of the stalker.

, If the person is immediate danger, call emergency services. Do not take any chances if someone’s life is in danger. Trust your instincts if you feel like there is danger. Treat all threats as real and immediate.Whether a threat is direct or indirect, report it to law enforcement. You may also want to encourage the person to file a police report for things like vandalism or voyeurism. If the person feels overwhelmed, offer to call law enforcement.

, Stalkers often harass their victims by calling frequently and sending frequent letters and emails. Consider offering to screen your friend’s phone calls, emails, and mail if there are concerns that the person might try to communicate in these ways. This may help to reduce your friend’s fear for a while., A safety plan helps someone reduce the risk of harm from a stalker or stalking situation. It is an individualized approach for what the person is currently experiencing that can include certain steps, precautions, responses, and safety contacts. The safety plan may include a record of previous stalking attempts and police reports, a contact list of friends, family members, and professional help, and specific people to call or steps to take in certain situations.You can help this person safety plan by including law enforcement and professional advocates.

, Encourage your friend to always have a charged cellphone with them. Keep your cellphone charged and accessible to take any phone calls. If your friend calls for help, be ready to spring into action. You may not be able to rush over, but you may be able to call authorities like law enforcement to assist your friend.


You may want to create a codeword that signals danger. If your friend says the codeword, that means that they need immediate help.

, The victim may feel unsafe wherever they go. Help your friend find safe spots, such as 24 businesses or highly populated areas.You may want to accompany the person or switch off with other friends for a period of time so that your friend is not alone.


If the person is being followed, tell them not to go home. Instead, go somewhere public where other people will be, or call emergency services.
Encourage the person to change up their usual routine often to prevent the stalker from finding them throughout the day. For example, if the person usually goes to the gym after work, then they could alternate between going in the morning, during their lunch break, and after work.

, You can help install security features with your friend. Install motion sensor lights outside and keep them on at night. Change the locks on all the doors and make sure all windows lock securely. Assess for any hiding places and remove them (such as shrubs or bushes). If the doors do not have peepholes, install peepholes.Ask your friend to consider fostering or adopting a dog as a sort of alarm system.

, Some victims may downplay the stalking, or try to be nice to make the stalker go away. Encourage your friend to firmly and calmly let the stalker know that contact is not appreciated and must stop immediately. Discuss the importance of not responding to texts, messages, emails, or phone calls.Encourage your friend to call police immediately if accidental contact occurs and the stalker begins to follow the person.

, Remind your friend that it is unsafe to allow contact from the stalker, even if the messages do not appear threatening. It is best to cut off all contact and not respond to any communication. Contact law enforcement, discuss the situation, and ask them to handle any further communication. If communication is necessary (for example, around child custody), the police are the only ones to contact the stalker.If a meeting is absolutely necessary, meet at a safe public place, like the police station.

, If the person is being harassed, encourage them to get a new, unlisted phone number. Save the old phone number, or hand it over to law enforcement to screen calls. Save any phone calls or voicemails the person leaves, as these can be used against the person to build a criminal case., Encourage the person to use a post office box (PO box) as an address. This can help protect their location and not disclose their home address.You can also offer to collect this person’s mail for them.


You may suggest getting a new email address and adjusting social media settings so that the stalker cannot get in contact. Encourage the person to use a different name on social media, change the photo, or block the stalker.

, Collecting evidence is crucial when building a case against the stalker. Keep all items, emails, letters, voicemails, text messages, and video surveillance related to the person and the stalking. Help your friend to arrange the evidence chronologically and to keep it in a safe space. If your friend want to pursue a legal case, it is crucial to maintain all evidence.if the stalker enters your friend’s property, encourage them to video or photograph the events (after they have made contact with the police) if it is safe to do so.

Reflect on your partner’s truthfulness.,
Decide if your loved one is manipulative.,
Determine if your loved one disregards rules or social conventions.,
Ask yourself whether your partner seems impulsive or hedonistic.,
Question what makes you and others attracted to your partner.,
Think about how your partner responds to the needs of others.,
Consider whether your partner has very few friends.,
Consider the kind of people your partner seeks out.,
Recognize the difference between a sociopath and a psychopath.,
Understand how sociopathy and psychopathy are diagnosed.,
Realize that not all sociopaths are violent.",How to Recognize if Your Partner is a Sociopath," Telling lies comes naturally to a sociopath. Rather than feeling guilty about lying, as most people would, sociopaths can tell outrageous untruths without feeling any remorse. A sociopath may lie about anything and everything, including his or her job, marital status, and past.Sociopaths lie for many reasons. Some lie to manipulate people into doing what they want. Others simply do it out of habit or for a thrill.
If caught in a lie, a sociopath may invent more lies to cover it up. This can make it difficult to untangle their web of deceit.
For instance, maybe your boyfriend says he's been at his friend's house, but his friend just posted on social media that he was out of town. When you point this out, your boyfriend then makes up a new friend that you have never heard of before.;
, One of the defining traits of a sociopath is having a skewed conscience. Because they don’t have a normal sense of right and wrong, sociopaths will manipulate and mislead other people to get what they want without considering how it makes their victims feel.A few manipulative techniques that sociopaths favor include taking advantage of your sense of pity, making you feel guilty, flattering you, and assuming a fake personality.
Does your girlfriend always expect you to pay for everything--not just dates, but her bills, cosmetic treatments and all-girl's getaways? And, when you say ""Hey, I don't have money to pay for that,"" she says ""If you loved me, you would get it for me?"" This can be a form of manipulation.

, Sociopaths see themselves as superior to others and often disregard the social norms that other people live by. They feel that laws, unspoken rules of politeness, and other common conventions do not apply to them. However, they are good at pretending to observe social norms in situations where they think it will benefit them.For example, are you often fearful of getting into trouble in their presence? Maybe your boyfriend has a total disregard for paying bills on time, so your shared vehicle gets repossessed. Or, your girlfriend goes and jumps in a private pool despite a clear sign saying ""No Trespassing!""

, Sociopaths are self-centered and usually don’t feel fear or anxiety to the same degree other people do. As a result, they tend to live according to their whims. They do what feels good to them in the moment without thinking about the consequences of their actions.Irresponsible spending, risky sexual behavior, and unsafe driving are a few impulsive behaviors that sociopaths may engage in.
Have you and your significant other had problems with cheating? Maybe your partner tells you that they slept with someone else because you had upset them. This demonstrates rash decision-making along with instant gratification without any regard to the consequences--both of which indicate sociopathy.

, Many sociopaths manage to fly under the radar because they are very charismatic. Though they do not feel emotions the same way most other people do, they are skilled at mimicking displays of feelings and creating the illusion of rapport with other people. This superficial charm helps sociopaths get their way.For example, when you are introduced to new people, do they always comment on how outgoing and charismatic your date is? Do you introduce him or her to relatives and they immediately believe your date is like the greatest? Maybe this person even acts differently in different settings or around certain people. They may change their likes and dislikes depending on their audience at a given time.

, Does he or she show empathy? Sociopaths have a limited ability to feel other people’s pain or happiness, so they rarely feel remorse or guilt for doing things that hurt other people.A sociopath may be able to put on a convincing display of empathy if the situation calls for it. Due to sociopaths’ well-developed social skills, most people have a hard time recognizing that such displays of emotion are fake.

, Sociopaths don’t enjoy friendship the way most other people do. Due to their lack of empathy, most sociopaths only want to spend time with other people when they can get something out of the interaction. Other people may also cut contact with a sociopath when they catch on to his or her pattern of lying and manipulation., Many sociopaths have an inflated self-image and see themselves as superior to others. As a result, they often try to surround themselves with high-powered, prominent people. They may do this in an effort to climb a career or social ladder, present a certain image to the world, or simply reinforce their ego., Sociopaths and psychopaths share some traits, such as a charming demeanor, lack of empathy, and a tendency to lie. However, psychopaths’ symptoms are more extreme and dangerous. Psychopaths are far more likely to hurt other people than sociopaths are. Sociopaths have a skewed sense of morality, but psychopaths have no sense of morality at all.Experts believe that psychopathy arises from primarily genetic factors, while sociopathy can be the result of genetics, childhood trauma, or both.

, The DSM, the official handbook for mental disorders, does not use the terms sociopath and psychopath. Instead, it groups sociopathy and psychopathy together under the term antisocial personality disorder.


Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed based on the traits sociopaths and psychopaths share, including lack of consideration for others, lack of guilt, and disregard for social customs and rules., Psychopaths are more likely than sociopaths to engage in violent behavior. Sociopaths might deceive and manipulate people to get what they want, but they usually do not hurt others physically.Sociopaths might not be physically violent, but their lies and manipulation can still be hurtful to the people around them. If you think your partner is a sociopath, take steps to protect yourself emotionally.

Just say you want to be alone.,
Set a time limit or make plans.,
Read.,
Keep your inbox full.,
Invent a pressing activity if necessary.,
Just close the door.",How to Make People Leave You Alone2," If your parents, siblings, children, or neighbors won't stop bugging you, the easiest way to nab some privacy is always to just say so. There's nothing rude about needing a little alone time, and as long as you say this as if it's normal, and not like you're irritated, most people will go along with it happily.


Stop what you're doing, look at the person who is bugging you and say, ""I need a little bit of alone time, ok? I'll talk to you soon.""
If you've got a guest who has overstayed their welcome, and you'd like to get them to leave, don't invent an elaborate excuse, just walk to the door and say, ""Well, thanks for stopping by. Need some alone time now, if you don't mind. I'll see you soon.""

, If you can't take the time to talk to someone, schedule it, or delay it for a time when you do have some free-time. In some cases, this is a much faster way to get out of a conversation and get someone to leave you alone. That way, you can decide when you want to socialize, and keep your alone time on your own terms.


Say, ""Hey, I'm interested in what you're saying and would love to help out, but I need a little bit of time to decompress before I'll be any use. Can we talk about this in two hours?""
Don't be afraid to delay to tomorrow something that you don't have the time or energy for doing today. If you need alone time, you need alone time. Tell someone that you'll get back with them when you're ready.
If you want to be really devious, tell someone to call you in two hours, then leave the phone off the hook. Make up a story later.

, Many people will instinctively leave people alone who are reading, and you can use a book as a great solitude prop. If they don't get the hint, it's still easy to look up quickly and say, ""Shh, I'm reading please.""

, If people can't get a hold of you, they can't bug you. If you want people to stop bugging you online, shut off your smartphone, tablet, computer, and other electronic devices that may easily give others access to you, or keep your inbox full to have a ready-made excuse. Without this access to social media, texting, or phone calls right at your fingertips, others will have a tough time connecting with you, and will get the hint in the future as well.


If someone continually harasses you online, block them, document the harassment, and report their account. Change your privacy settings to the strictest, if possible.

, Some people won't take the hint, even if you make it explicit, and even if you're kind, and in some cases it is easiest and quickest to just make up a little white lie. Used correctly, it can work.


Make sure that your lies are solitary activities. Nobody will be able to verify or accompany you if your excuse is that you have to take a shower and catch up on your email.
Some people think elaborate excuses are kinder than the truth, but this can often have side-effects. If you say you've got to go to the store, your lingering neighbor might say, ""Oh, I was just on my way there, let's go together!""

, If people really aren't taking the hint, go to your room, shut the door, play some music or put headphones on, and grab that solitude by the horns. Put a sign on the door that says, ""I'm fine, just need alone time. I'll come out at 6.""

Wear headphones or earbuds.,
Use closed body language.,
Look busy.,
Cut off conversation with one-word answers.,
Look as ""normal"" as possible.",How to Make People Leave You Alone3," If you're locked into a podcast or some tunes, you've got a ready-made excuse for not having heard something someone said, and most people will take the hint, and won't even try. Even if you're not a big music fan, just wear headphones and listen to nothing. It works great as a prop.

, You can learn to look unapproachable by giving people the impression that you're closed off to communication.In general, the physical signs of ""closed"" body language that help to communicate a desire to be left alone include:


Crossed arms
Crossed legs
Slouching
Looking downward
Avoiding eye contact

, If you look like you're completely immersed in an activity, people will leave you alone for the most part. Bring a book, a stack of papers, or pull out your phone, and put on a calculated scowl, to look like you're concentrating really hard.


You can take this too far and elicit unwanted attention. Don't scowl so hard and make such hefty work sighs that the person next to you says, ""What you got going on?""

, If, despite your unapproachable nature, someone tries to approach you, you can cut most conversations off by being generally distant and un-socialable. Avoid making eye contact, keep your resting face blank, and use single-word responses, no matter how difficult the question.


If someone says, ""How you doing?"" just say, ""Fine."" If someone says, ""What you up to?"" just say, ""Nothing."" If someone says, ""Can I get you a drink?"" just say, ""No."" This will get boring quickly, and you'll be alone again.

, Of course, you should dress however you want to dress, because the way you look and your appearance aren't code for being approachable or not approachable. You can, however, avoid unwanted attention by blending in with the crowd. If you're out in public wearing a beaver hat and a purple zoot suit, it's likely someone will want to talk to you. Just wear what everyone else is wearing, and you'll be practically invisible.

Realize the patterns in your family of origin, especially if one or more of your parents was alcoholic or addicted in some way.,
Ask a trustworthy friend for feedback about your relational patterns.,
Acknowledge the truth that pleasing and helping others, even when it keeps them from taking responsibility, makes us feel good.,
Decide to trade the false love of enmeshment for real love.,
Communicate clear boundaries to the other person.,
Enforce those boundaries.",How to Recognize and Break Free of Relational Enmeshment," Often, an addict’s family enables them to continue destructive behavior, protecting them from the consequences of it by rescuing them, covering for them, and so on.;
, When we're stuck in enmeshment, we sometimes refuse to listen to people outside the situation, who notice our unhealthy patterns. To break free, we must be willing to listen to feedback about how our rescuing and enabling actually hurts the person we’re trying to help. We must be open to the truth about ourselves.

, But ultimately, it’s detrimental to us, to the other person, and to our relationship. Facing the truth (that your helping is actually hurting) is an essential step toward healing.

, “True love is not wrapped up in a drive to rescue, overprotect, control, or manipulate. It genuinely wants the best for the other person,” Clinton writes in his book Break Through. “It is grounded in our heart’s desire to cherish, honor, and treasure another person simply because of who they are. ...True love offers a safe place to be you; it’s not driven by a desire to rescue or a need to perform. True love values the other person for who they are and celebrates healthy separateness.”, For example, if you’re in the habit of writing checks to your adult child when they get into financial trouble, this enabling behavior is keeping them from growing up. But warn them ahead of time that you won’t be doing that anymore. Tell them they will need to be responsible for their own financial life. Expect some resistance—after all, you’ve taught them an unhealthy dependence on you. Changing the pattern begins with clear communication.

, An enmeshed person’s goal, whether they realize it or not, is to protect the other person at all costs—even if they’re protected from the consequences of their own bad behavior. A person with healthy boundaries allows others to experience the consequences of their own choices. But it may not be easy to stick to your guns. Be strong. Get help from a trusted friend or counselor to help you enforce the new boundaries you are setting.

Recognize that you have a problem.,
Reflect on your jealousy.",How to Overcome Jealousy1," Before you can begin to tackle your jealousy, you need to admit that it's a real problem that is taking over your life and keeping you from loving the person that you are. Jealously can be truly debilitating and can keep you from reaching your goals and becoming a better person. Here are some signs that jealously is taking over your life:


If you spend most of your time wishing you had what others have, instead of appreciating what you have.
If you are constantly comparing yourself to your friends, family members, and coworkers, and finding that you always come up short.
If you are jealous of a specific person and can't hang out with her for five minutes without wishing that you had her clothes, her looks, and her attitude.
If you are jealous of all of your friends' relationships, and wish your relationship could be half as good as theirs.
If you're in a relationship and you can't stand it when your significant other interacts with anyone of the opposite sex. You are convinced that every other girl has only one goal—to steal your boyfriend.
If you're so obsessed that you are constantly looking at your significant other's Facebook, or even his phone or email, for signs that he is cheating on you.
If you can't go more than a few minutes without comparing your relationship, your career, or your family to the relationships, careers, and families of everyone you meet.
If you are incredibly jealous whenever one of your friends hangs out with a new friend. If this makes you ask, ""What's wrong with me?"";
, Once you admit that you have a real problem with jealousy and want to tame the ugly green dragon, you have to understand why you are having feelings of jealousy to begin with. If you feel like you are missing out on what others have, then there must be some inadequacies in your own life. Here's how to understand where your feels are coming from:


Are you jealous of just one aspect of your friends' lives? For example, if you're only jealous of your friends' romantic relationships because yours doesn't stack up to theirs, then you should try to improve your relationship on its own terms, or end the relationship if it's not worth saving. Are you jealous of your best friend because she is pursuing her career as an artist, while you're afraid to take that step? This may be a sign that you should rethink your career path.
Are you jealous of absolutely everything anyone has? If you think that you don't have anything that people could be jealous of, then you are suffering from insecurity and a lack of confidence. You need to work on improving how you view yourself before you can move on from your jealousy.
Are you jealous of the way your friends look? Do you feel that your life would be so much better if you looked like they did? Try to develop a unique style, spend more time with a healthy diet and exercise, and just learn to love your best features by looking in the mirror and reminding yourself of the things you love about yourself every day.

"
"
Improve who you are.,
Improve what you do.,
Improve your relationships.",How to Overcome Jealousy2," If you are a chronically jealous person, then the chances are that you feel that you are not a person who is worthy of admiration because you are not exciting, interesting, or dynamic. It's time to work on making yourself into a person who has no reason to be jealous because you're so happy with who you are. Here's what to do:


Develop your self-confidence. Write down all the things you love about yourself and make a list of your flaws. Work to address as many flaws as you can, and you will start feeling better about who you are. If you feel better about being in your own skin, you will be much less likely to be jealous.
One of the most common reasons to be jealous is for material reasons. If you're jealous of a friend who has a lot of money, or whose family has a lot of money, while you do not, you should accept that you won't be able to buy all of the things she can. Instead, make your money count. Save up your money to buy just a few key items for your wardrobe or apartment that will make you feel good about what you have.
Work on your body. If you're jealous of your friend because of his rock-hard abs, start hitting the gym more often in order to reach that goal. Remember that, while everyone is born with a unique body, you still have a lot of control over how that body looks. However, if you think that everyone around you looks better than you do and that there's nothing you can do to change that, then you may have body image problems and should seek help from a doctor.
Remember to be yourself. You won't beat your jealousy if you're obsessed with doing what your friends do, looking like your friends, or having the same relationship your friend has. No two people are alike, and you'll only feel worse if you're trying to emulate someone else. Though different people should inspire us in different ways, don't forget that you are a unique individual and never compare yourself to anyone else.

, You may be jealous of others because you can't stand the things you do on a daily basis. To avoid this, you should be proud of the hard work you do and should also be excited to pursue your interests. If you're busy pursuing your own goals and interests, you won't have time to be jealous of what others are doing.


Do more of the things you love. If you spend a lot of your time wishing you were more like your friends, it may be because you don't do a lot of things that you're proud of. Become more cultured by reading more poetry, plays, and novels, or work on developing useful skills, such as knitting or fixing furniture. The more you do to improve yourself, the more happy you will be to be you.
Work on your career. If you're jealous of someone for following her dreams, or jealous of someone who got a promotion at work, you should either work harder at your own job, or think about changing career paths so you can do what you really want.
Set goals for yourself and reach them. Start small. If you've never run before, train to run a 5K without stopping to walk. If you succeed in this goal, you'll be proud of what your capable of, and will try to set other goals for yourself as well.

, If you are jealous of someone for having so many friends or for maintaining an awesome relationship, it's likely that there is something lacking in your own relationships. Try to spend more time engaged in meaningful conversations or activities with your friends, and work on having open and honest relationships.


If you're happy with who your friends or significant other are, then you would have no reason to want the relationships others have. If you have a strong relationship, then you will already feel validated and secure.

If you have a friendship that is based on jealousy, it may be time to end it. If you feel that you have a friend who tries to constantly make you jealous by bragging about all of the things she has, it may be time to move on.


Improve your relationship with your family. If you don't spend enough time with your family, you may be jealous of the close relationship others have with their family members. Make the effort to call home or hang out with your folks more often, and you will feel better about your relationship.
Improve your love life. If you're in a serious relationship, work on having honest and open communication to help you address the things that aren't working. If you're single, work on being happy with being unattached and being excited to find someone in the future, instead of spending your time being jealous of everyone in a committed relationship.

Remind yourself of how lucky you are.,
Be a more generous person.",How to Overcome Jealousy3," When you're blinded by jealousy, it's impossible to see things objectively and to understand how fortunate you truly are. Remind yourself that you're lucky just to have running water, food to eat whenever you want it, good health, and even access to a computer. Here's how you do it:


Understand how fortunate you are compared to most people in the world. Remind yourself that many people in the world do not have many basic things that you take for granted. It's likely that you've never had to deal with real hunger, that you're healthy and can see a doctor fairly easily, that you have enough clothes to stay warm, and that you don't feel oppressed in the place where you live. This is more than many people can say.
Understand that you have many things people would be jealous of. Make a list of at least twenty things you have that people would want. It could be as basic as ""running water"" or more elaborate, like ""the ability to talk to make anyone laugh.""
Understand that anyone you're jealous of doesn't have a perfect life. Be realistic about the people you are jealous of. Make a list of all the things they have that you are jealous of, and then ask yourself if you have anything they would want. For example, you may be jealous of your friend's amazing relationship, but she could be wishing that she had two loving, doting parents like you have. You may be jealous of your friend's new promotion, while she could be wishing that she was a talented artist like you are.

, If you spend more time helping others, you will not only feel better about yourself for being more generous, but you will have a better understanding of what you have that others would be grateful for.


Volunteer in your community. To get a concrete sense of how fortunate you are, you can volunteer in your community to help people learn English, read, or get enough food at a soup kitchen. Being around people whose basic needs may not be met will remind you how fortunate your own life is.
Help out the people you know. Help a friend who is going through a relationship issue, or motivate your friend who is struggling in his classes to finish school. Understanding the hardships of others will make you see that everyone is struggling in some way, and that you're not the only person who wants to improve your life.
Do the little things for someone you love. Help a friend who is going through a hard time do her laundry, or give a ride to a friend whose car broke down. You'll feel like a more helpful person and will appreciate what you have even more.

"
"
Come to terms with who you are.,
Avoid jealousy in the future.",How to Overcome Jealousy4," Reflecting on your jealousy and working to make yourself a better person can go a long way in addressing your problem. Still, you have to understand that no matter what you do, you will never be perfect, and that there will always be things you want.


Realize that life isn't fair. You won't be able to have everything you want, no matter how hard you try, and there may be people who are truly more fortunate than you are. But once you accept this fact, you can let go and stop trying to have it all.
Enjoy being yourself. You may be a flawed individual like everyone else, but make time to enjoy your quirks and really learn to love being you. Make time for alone time, and really appreciate your own company.
Focus on your positive qualities. Though there still may be a few things you lack, focus on the parts of your life that you love, such as your relationships, or your amazing job. Emphasize the things you have and love instead of thinking about the things you want.

, Once you've worked as hard as you can to beat the jealousy that was taking over your life, you still need to make sure that it doesn't real its ugly head in the future. There are a few things you can do to make sure you don't see green in the future:


Never take anything for granted. Every morning, remind yourself of at least ten things you are grateful for. Making a routine of this will reinforce that you are a person who should not be jealous.
Avoid situations that may lead to jealousy. If you can't help being a little jealous as a girlfriend, don't date a guy who tends to hang out with a lot of females. If you have a friend who seems to have everything and who you can't stop being jealous of her, try to spend less time with her if it's making you feel bad about yourself.
Recognize your jealousy. As soon as you realize that you're getting jealous of someone again, go home and reflect in a notebook. Why are you jealous of this person? How can you work to stop the jealousy before it gets out of control?
Remember that it's healthy to be jealous once in a while. Don't beat yourself up if you can't stop being jealous about absolutely everything. If your friend just got a brand new car and you wish you could afford one, or if your friend just announced that she's getting married while you really wish you had a boyfriend, it's okay to feel jealous for a little while. When jealousy consumes your life and informs your every action, then you have a real problem.

Analyze the person's faults.,
Look at patterns of infatuation.,
Give it time.",How to Overcome an Infatuation1," It’s difficult to see nothing else about a person you’re infatuated with except for how amazing they are. However, no one is perfect and everyone has flaws--even them. Make a list of their negative qualities to bring you back down to reality.


Finding these flaws will likely take some time. Engage with the person outside of your regular circumstances or spend more time with them than usual. Chances are, seeing them outside of your typical scenario will show you a different, and unflattering, side.;
, Have you been through this before? Chances are, if you’re infatuated with someone now you have likely been in the same situation previously. If obsession is a common occurrence in your life, tell yourself so.


For example, when your feelings get overwhelming, remind yourself that this is just something that you do. It’s not indicative that you are completely in love with or can’t live without this person, it’s simply a tendency you have. Coming to terms with that may make you realize that your infatuation is just a habit., The saying “time heals all wounds” is popular because it is true. Look back at other moments in your life when you were obsessed or infatuated with someone or something. Ask yourself how you feel about them today. Chances are you are completely over it and over time, this infatuation will be a distant memory, too."
"
Think about someone else.,
Use your imagination.,
Snap out of it, literally.,
Distract yourself.",How to Overcome an Infatuation2," Telling yourself to simply stop thinking about your infatuation won’t work. In fact, there’s proof that trying to stop these thoughts typically makes them worse. Instead, encourage your mind to think about something else: another person.


Think about the person you are already in a relationship with, if you are in one. Ponder a time when you felt really close and connected to the person. You’ll likely find that experiencing these feelings kick the other person out of your head.If you aren't in a relationship, focus on someone else you admire, such as a close friend, a family member, or a respectable member of your community.

, Play mind games with yourself whenever you start to obsess about the person. Occupying your brain with a clever trick can stop the thoughts and encourage you to think about something else.


For instance, imagine your mind as a small room that has a person with a broom living in it. Think about the person sweeping away dust and dirt on the floor of that room whenever your infatuation enters your mind. Continue this game until the floor is completely clean and the thought leaves your brain., Pain is an excellent deterrent and can be used to stop obsessive thoughts. Wrap a rubber band around your wrist and snap it against your skin whenever you begin to think of your infatuation. Eventually you’ll likely associate the pain with these thoughts and stop.Combine the wrist snap with a visual aid, like a red light or a stop sign. Think of these images whenever the unwanted thoughts pop up.

, Redirect your brain by engaging in an activity. You’ll get your mind off of what you’re infatuated with while enjoying yourself at the same time.


For example, read a book, watch your favorite television show, exercise, or call someone. The positive feelings you generate from these activities will likely eventually replace the negative you feel over your infatuation."
"
Talk to a professional.,
Consider the underlying issue.,
Confide in your loved ones.",How to Overcome an Infatuation3," Patterns of infatuation are often indicative of a love addiction. You may have become dependent on the feelings you experience when you are infatuated with a person so you tend to repeat the same behaviors. A therapist may be able to help you break the cycle.


Ask your friends, family members, or a doctor for recommendations. Look online for names if you don’t feel comfortable asking those you know., Talk with a therapist about why you became infatuated with this person. They may help you realize insecurities you have about yourself that were temporarily resolved because of the obsession. They may also help you discover a psychological reason for your infatuation.For instance, you could have borderline personality disorder and may not know it. Infatuation and obsession over a person could be a sign that you are struggling with this condition., Talking about your infatuation may help you realize a few things you never did before. Those close to you may be able to help you identify the reasons why your infatuation is senseless, which may give you the encouragement to move on. They can also offer you support when you’re feeling hopeless about the situation.


Consider also asking your support system to help you get over the person by spending more time with you, helping to eliminate the person’s presence in your life, and reminding you of how imperfect they are, when you’re struggling."
"
Practice self-care.,
Volunteer your time.,
Put yourself in someone else’s shoes.,
Let go of always needing to be right.",How to Overcome Emotional Immaturity1," Self-care involves taking care of your physical and emotional well-being. When you feel your best you will be able to give freely to care for others. A good start would be getting regular check ups at the doctor, eating nutritious food, getting some exercise, and enjoying some of your favorite hobbies. Neglecting yourself can cause you to feel fatigued and depressed, which make it difficult to grow.
, A sign of emotional maturity is allowing others’ needs to come before your own. Volunteering somewhere allows you to help others and can help you achieve humility. Seeing how other people live and being able to empathize with them is a step in the right direction towards emotional maturity.



Find volunteer opportunities in your area such as an animal shelter or senior center. You can also simply give your time to someone who is need, such as a co-worker, neighbor, or family member., An emotionally immature person typically only sees one side of the situation: their own. They tend not to see what someone else could be going through. If you try to imagine yourself as that person, however, you may learn something new about yourself, and them.


For instance, when you have a disagreement with someone, consider things from their perspective. Ask yourself what previous life experiences that person has had, if they knew the same information as you leading up to the situation, and what is going on in their home life. Imagine yourself as them once you’ve asked yourself these questions and you may be able to change your stance.Let's say your friend is a person of color who tells you that you are naturally privileged. With emotional maturity, you should be able to take a step back see how being of the majority race gives you more privilege than being a minority., Hearing that you are wrong is often difficult, as is not getting your way. However, you’ll need to let that go if you want to be emotionally mature. This type of maturity means being OK with allowing someone else to win an argument or two, or letting them have the last word.


Learn to say, “Let’s agree to disagree” when you are in a debate with someone. Allowing yourself to let it go and not have to win for the sake of winning can help you keep integrity and a relationship with the person with whom you are having the disagreement."

Giving someone the “silent treatment” is a form of exclusion. Bullies may also laugh at or whisper about a victim when the victim can see or hear them.Bullies who engage in relational aggression may act “hot and cold” in their relationships, acting friendly towards a victim one day and shunning them the next.;
, Bullies often label their victims negatively or call them names. Name-calling is an easy way for bullies to gain a sense of power by singling another child out and making them feel different or inferior.Name-calling, teasing, or other put-downs are damaging enough, but it can be especially harmful when part of relational aggression, as these put-downs are often coming from people the victim considered friends.
Labeling a peer with negative adjectives such as “stupid” or “ugly” is a form of name-calling.
Name-calling may also involve the use of racial or religious slurs.

, Gossiping and spreading rumors about others are two favorite tactics of bullies who use relational aggression. These bullies may tell other people’s secrets in an attempt to curry favor with friends or gain a sense of control over the person whose confidence they have betrayed. They may also invent mean-spirited rumors to make others look bad.If the bully was friends with the victim, they may share things that the victim shared privately. This betrayal can have a significant impact on the victim's ability to trust people in the future, and may make it difficult for the victim and bully to ever resume a friendship.

, Bullies who use relational aggression often do not form genuine friendships. Instead, they form alliances to manipulate others or improve their social standing.


Some bullies will strategically make friends with certain people while shutting others out. They may also manipulate their “friends” by threatening to withdraw their friendship, or by acting friendly one minute and cold the next., Cyberbullying is bullying that happens via electronic means, like over the internet or text messages. Cyberbullies may use technology to threaten a victim, humiliate or embarrass them, or manipulate them into doing something.Even though it doesn’t occur in person, cyberbullying can be just as harmful as real-world bullying. The internet, particularly social media, provides an ideal medium for spreading rumors and excluding others from groups.
Cyberbullying may include posting rumors or rude comments on social media pages or forums. It also may include a form of exclusion in which everyone is a part of an online group except for the victim.

, Victims of relational aggression are at risk for mental health disorders, including depression. A child who often seems withdrawn and sad or shows little interest in participating in activities with other children may be experiencing bullying from their peers.Other signs of depression may include hopelessness, changes in eating or sleeping patterns, withdrawing from friends or social activities, and acting irritable or agitated.

, Victims of relational aggression may have poor relationships with other people. They might seem to have no friends, or they may make friends and then drop them again quickly. On-and-off friendships are one of the warning signs of relational aggression.People who experience relational aggression may be abandoned or ostracized by their friend group. This can damage their self-esteem, leaving them less likely to seek out other friends.

, Children who experience relational aggression may seem nervous about spending time with their peers. They might express the desire to stop going to school or participating in their usual social activities. Increased shyness or uncharacteristic problems with socializing may also point to problems with relational aggression., Children who are the targets of relational aggression may suddenly start having a hard time at school or in their extracurricular activities. Their grades might drop, or they might have a hard time focusing and staying productive. They might also have a harder time carrying out their responsibilities at home.In severe cases, dropping out of school is a possibility.
Bullies who use relational aggression are at risk for having trouble in school, too.

, A child who is a victim of relational aggression may become secretive about their phone and internet use. They may seem agitated or upset after using the computer or the phone, or they may seem distressed when they receive texts and emails., Relational aggression is a form of bullying that undermines a person’s social status, friendships, and relationships. Unlike physical bullying, relational aggression is often subtle and difficult to spot. Manipulation, social exclusion, and spreading gossip are several examples of relational aggression., Children and teenagers are more likely to engage in relational aggression than adults. The highest rates of relational aggression are found among middle schoolers and high schoolers, though this type of bullying has been observed in children as young as preschool age. Girls are more likely than boys to be the perpetrators and victims of relational aggression.In general, relational aggression can happen to anyone. The rationale behind it varies. A person can receive this type of treatment due to their looks, speech, who they are currently friends with or dating, where they are from, or simply being new to the environment (e.g. school or dorm). The specific social group determines the exact criteria for who belongs and who doesn't.Though relational aggression is most common in children, especially pre-teen and teen girls, adults sometimes use it as well. Factors like an abusive or neglectful home life, substance abuse in parents, and negative media consumption can influence a child’s likelihood for becoming relationally aggressive with other children.

, Relational aggression can negatively impact a child’s friendships and performance at school. Children who are bullied this way often experience loneliness, depression, and low self-esteem. Children who are relationally aggressive with others also experience negative consequences. Though these children may have higher status in their social groups, they are more likely to have unhealthy social relationships and be disliked by their peers.Children who are victims of relational aggression sometimes become bullies themselves in an attempt to take back some social control.

, Relational aggression can be subtle and go unnoticed by teachers, and it may be easily dismissed by adults. The victim may be ashamed or embarrassed, and it's important to take their concerns seriously. Make sure you child knows that home is a supportive place where they can express themselves without judgement. Listen without offering advice, particularly if you are tempted to say something like, ""Words can't hurt you,"" or ""It's just a phase,"" or ""I think you're overreacting.""Instead, see if you can find out more details. You can say something like, ""That sounds really painful. Can you tell me who else was there and how long this has been happening?""

, Reach out to someone at the school, such as a guidance counselor, and explain what is occurring. Talk to the counselor about the possibility of addressing the subject with the class as a whole and providing information about relational aggression and how to deal with it. Organizations like The Ophelia Project (http://www.opheliaproject.org/girls.html) provide curriculums for teaching children of all ages about how to identify this type of bullying and how to create a culture of inclusivity and understanding., Relational aggression can be devastating, and will likely leave your child feeling betrayed, confused, anxious, and isolated. There are many things you can do to help your child rebuild their self-esteem, from role-playing and discussing how they might assertively respond to their bullies to connecting them with a counselor or therapist. You might also try getting your child involved in a new activity where they can meet new people."

Work on being positive.,
Practice being grateful.,
Enter relationships for the right reasons.,
Take accountability for your actions.,
Respect other people’s boundaries.,
Look for the lesson in each experience.,
Tell the truth.",How to Overcome Emotional Immaturity2," Emotionally immature people focus on the negative aspects of what is going on around them. They become irrationally upset when things don’t work out the way they want and take their negative behavior out on others. Focusing on the positives in situations and believing that it will work out can keep you emotionally stable., Catalog some of the people and things you are grateful for by writing them down. Place your list in a safe place so you can remind yourself of all you have to be thankful for when life gets challenging. This can help combat anxiety and depression that might hold you back.

Ask yourself how you can make each situation you enter a “win-win.” Then realistically determine what will happen if the scenario doesn’t work out the way you want. You’ll likely see that the potential negatives aren’t really that big of a deal and you’re able to handle whatever comes your way.
For example, you set a goal to move to a new city but you were delayed after a job loss. With emotional maturity, you can bounce back and develop a new plan that helps you reach your goal while considering your new circumstances.

, Stop always focusing on what you can get out of relationships. Instead, think about how you can help each other. Be generous with your emotions and try not to take other people for granted.


In romantic relationships, avoid seeking out someone only for physical reasons, as emotionally immature people tend to do. Rather, look for someone who can fill your emotional needs and for someone who you can enjoy spending time with., Everyone makes mistakes; however, the way you handle them is a sign of your emotional maturity level. Projecting your errors on others is a sign of emotional immaturity. Taking responsibility for what you’ve done wrong shows that you are mature.


For instance, you shut out a friend who is trying to help you. An emotionally immature person may refuse to see that this is not helping the situation. Meanwhile, if you are emotionally mature, you will recognize that you are wrong and apologize to your friend.
Practice saying phrases like “I’m sorry” and “That was my mistake.” People are more accepting to slip-ups when the person is genuinely apologetic rather than trying to blame others., Boundaries are created for protection. Pushing these boundaries makes people feel uncomfortable and violated. Respecting these boundaries shows that you are mature and care about other people’s needs instead of your own.


People who push their agendas on others and focus more on what they want rather than what is beneficial for both parties typically end up hurting others. However, emotionally mature people would rather make someone else feel better than get what they want. This is especially true if they know getting what they want will make the other person uncomfortable., Even in the worst of situations, there is valuable learning you can do to grow and improve your life. Sometimes in the heat of the bad situation it can be difficult to tease out the lesson, but it is up to you to reflect afterward to identify what you have learned. Consider how will you use what you have absorbed to become a better person. It can be helpful to write it down., Emotionally immature people tend to lie. They may lie to get out of their mistakes or use it as a way to make them seem more appealing. Either way, their main focus is to make themselves look better instead of living with integrity.This step may take some effort on your part. Being vulnerable and open with your flaws is difficult for anyone, particularly people who struggle with emotional immaturity. However, you’ll find that telling the truth gains respect, from others and yourself. Let go of your pride and simply say the truth. You’ll feel much better about yourself in the end.

Confide in others for help.,
Talk to a professional.,
Join a support group.",How to Overcome Emotional Immaturity3," The path to emotional maturity can be a tough one. Having people around you to support you can make a huge difference. Tell your family and loved ones about your journey and ask them to keep you accountable.For instance, you can say, “I’ve decided I’m going to take steps to become a better person and more emotionally mature. Please let me know when you feel that I am slipping and not behaving the way I want.” Those who love you can keep you in check. And remember to accept their criticism in a mature manner.

, Becoming emotionally mature can be a difficult process. Talking to a professional about how to get to this goal is often helpful. A therapist or counselor may help you understand why you haven’t reached the maturity level you desire and can give you pointers on how to get there.


Ask friends and family the name of a therapist or counselor they trust. You can also ask your primary doctor for suggestions if you are having difficulty finding someone to help you., Joining a support group that helps you to work on these behaviors can help you reach the maturity level you desire. It also puts you in contact with people who may have suggestions on how you can get there and who can hold you accountable when you fail.


For instance, part of your emotional immaturity could cause you to have an explosive temper or narcissistic qualities. Joining a support group for people with similar problems can give you the help you need to combat them."

Build a strong relationship.,
Work on your own honesty and emotional interactions.,
Show your boyfriend that he can trust you.,
Avoid manipulation.,
Choose a quiet and appropriate time to talk.,
Be close to him.,
Guide the conversation but avoid manipulation.,
Don't force anything or make him uncomfortable.,
Engage in a meaningful conversation.,
Ask good questions without prying.,
Make it an ongoing dialogue.,
Do not abuse his trust by telling anyone.",How to Persuade Your Boyfriend to Open Up to You," Genuine openness often comes naturally when you're in an equal, mutually beneficial partnership. However, even in the best relationships, some people have trouble opening up about what makes them tick or what upsets them, so you may still need to work on getting him to open up gradually over time. But a strong foundation will really help.;
, Lead by example in your relationship; be open and honest with him, and share your feelings calmly, without flying off the handle when you're upset. Your boyfriend may feel that opening up about something upsetting will lead to a big fight or upheaval. Show him that you can handle even the curve balls with grace and a cool head, and he may be reassured that he can open up without drama.

, This can be hard in any relationship, especially in the early stages. Building trust takes time, but you can help the process along by being loyal and dedicated to him, not sharing any private information you already know about him with others, and letting him get to know your friends/colleagues and see you interact with them. If you betray his trust now or have done before, he probably will not trust you with anything too personal.

, It may be tempting to try ""tricking"" your boyfriend into sharing his feelings or experiences with you. However, this doesn't do anything to make your relationship stronger; in fact, it generally hurts your long-term trust. Stay genuine with him instead, and you'll see a big impact over time.

, Pick a calm time; don't try to get him to open up during a fight or disagreement; even if he does open up in the heat of ""battle,"" it'll be tinged by the strength of emotion at the time, and you may not like what he has to say when he's heated. Instead, work on talking about both your feelings and experiences in a calm moment when you're alone together.

, Maybe put your arm around him or snuggle with him; physical touch can be a strong reminder of the bond between you. The focus isn't on making it sensual, which can be distracting or, at the extreme, even manipulative. Only use physical closeness to reflect the warmth between you and provide some comfort during what might be a difficult conversation.

, If there's something you want your boyfriend to open up about, you can lead the conversation there. However, you want to avoid coming on too strongly or overwhelming him. Gently change the topic or link the topic to a piece of information you would like to know. Try telling him something personal about yourself and ask him to tell you something in return. Say that you trust him, he is likely to tell you that he trusts you (or he might say he is not sure if he trusts you yet, in which case, try to comfort him and let it go for a while and try again soon.). You could say things like:


""I have always wondered why...""
""I would really like to know...""
""I know you find this hard to talk about but maybe if you shared it with me it would help.""
""I hate that you shut me out of your personal life; I love you and want to help you.""
""Please let me help you...""

, If your lead-in to the conversation doesn't get a good reaction from him, or if he clams up or literally tells you that he doesn't want to talk about it, respect his wishes. Don't push the topic further; just accept that this isn't the right time for him.


Be patient with him and let him tell you in time. The key is be supportive, kind, and patient.

, If your boyfriend does start opening up, make it a meaningful moment. Your goal is not just to dig into his secrets; the goal is to have an honest and open talk about the topic at hand. Don't stop talking as soon as he reveals the feelings or details you were hoping to know. Allow him to talk to you and show your interest in what he has to say. If he is uncomfortable talking about something, respect that and don't talk to him about it unless he wants to. Talk to him and comfort him about whatever he says (good or bad).

, Since opening up can be uncomfortable, you want to avoid a long list of overwhelming ""interview-style"" questions. Don't interrogate him. Focus on listening to his answers and showing interest. That being said, it is okay to ask questions about how events turned out or how it made him feel. Keep talking as long as he seems to want to.

, The openness doesn't have to stop as soon as this particular conversation is over. If you feel he has more to share or wants to confide in you more, look for more opportunities in future to talk about the topic again. Don't force it, but encourage him to continue being open (about the same topic or others) in the future, and be supportive of what he shares.

, Let him know that he was right to trust you. As tempting as it may be, don't tell your best friends anything he has asked you to keep private.

Identify your fear.,
Spend time alone.,
Strengthen your sense of identity.,
Stop trying to control others.,
Get help breaking the pattern.",How to Overcome Emotional Dependency1," Most of the time, feelings of neediness or dependence are rooted in fear. Think about how you would feel if the person you’re dependent on left. Ask yourself what in particular scares you about that scenario.For instance, if you’re emotionally dependent on the person you’re dating, you might have an underlying fear of feeling unlovable.;
, Find a time when you won’t be interrupted, and sit quietly with yourself for a while. Notice where your mind goes and what kind of urges you experience. You may find some thought patterns or habits you weren’t previously aware of.Don’t distract yourself by checking your phone or tidying your room when you do this exercise. Devote all your attention to introspection, even if it’s uncomfortable.

, Think about who you really are when you’re not trying to please anybody else. Identify your core values, the things you want to achieve, and your idiosyncrasies. Work on building a sense of self that doesn’t depend on external validation.If you don’t have a strong sense of identity, step out of your comfort zone and explore some new things by yourself. See which activities, people, and ideas resonate with you.

, When you depend too much on other people, you may end up trying to control them – or feeling miserable because you can’t. Accept that other people have the right to their own thoughts, feelings, and choices, and realize that these won’t always involve you. Channel your energy into taking control of your own choices and thoughts.For example, if you get jealous when your friend wants to spend time with other people, don’t try to guilt-trip them. Take a deep breath, remember that people can have many friends, and think about what you’ll do with your free time instead.

, If you feel locked in a cycle of emotional dependency and can’t manage to break out on your own, don’t be afraid to seek help. Talk to a trusted friend or relative, or get help from a counselor or therapist."

You have lived your life before he came into the picture and sure he must have made you feel complete, but never forget that you are born an individual.;
, Remember that every relationship is different and just because the previous ones didn't work out or just because your friend's relationships set an example to you, doesn't mean you can apply the exact same principles to every relationship. Being clingy and letting your boyfriend take the place of God in your life, just to ensure this relationship doesn't slip away, is the wrong way to go.

, Men enjoy, honour, and need space more often than women do. By letting your life revolve around him all the time, he may feel too suffocated. You need to let him have night outs with friends and let him spend individual time nurturing his personal and individual life for him to come back to you energized.

, Men love confident women. Confidence in a woman attracts men and when a man can see that a woman is able to handle herself with grace, he sees her as a healthy woman and thus sees that he can have a healthy relationship with her.


Men love women who take care and look after themselves.
Remember, that you have to be CONFIDENT and not OVERCONFIDENT. Let there be times where you consult him on decisions you need to take and make it a point to share your feelings from time to time, to stay connected with the relationship.

, Every once a week (or however often you want) make sure that you pamper yourself. You could do this by going for a head massage, a manicure, pedicure, facial, a bubble bath. Or if you do not wish to spend, you can just light some candles and dip your legs in hot water in the comfort of your home.


Remember if you neglect yourself for your boyfriend, you may lose you appeal and charm, something that he fell for you for in the first place.

, Take time off and spend time with yourself. Use this time to reconnect with yourself. Take the phone off the hook, switch off your mobile phone and just do whatever you like, but do it alone. Solitude once in a while, helps one reconnect with oneself and feel happy about oneself. You could do this by pampering yourself, listening to your favorite music, watching TV, catching up on a movie, reading a book, a walk to the park or an evening watching the sunset. It makes you realize that you need to love yourself for others to love you.

, Everybody is gifted with a talent, but one needs to nurture it to get better. Find a hobby and work at it to get better. This not only takes your mind off your relationship for a while, but it also builds up your esteem, confidence and keeps you healthy and happy. Take up anything like painting, playing a musical instrument, pottery, sewing, reading, fishing, drawing, etc.


If you have difficulty finding a hobby, you can keep trying different things till you find something you like the most.
Join a dance/book/singing club to make new friends while you are at your hobby. It will make the process more interesting.

, You obviously have had friends, relatives and your family, who were the people in your life before you entered into a relationship. Don't throw away or ditch any of these just because you have a boyfriend. Not only will you need them someday, but having these people and spending time with them, will help you stay connected to yourself.

, Don't devote all your time and affection to your boyfriend, Keep meeting new people, take up new projects and be friendly, Build acquaintances and make friends.

, Plan your dates and time with your boyfriend well in advance so that you know when you have time available to reconnect with yourself.

, You may be a girlfriend/partner/wife now, but you also are daughter/sister/mother/cousin/friend/aunt and most importantly you are yourself. Strike a balance between all these relationships and yourself.

, Do not devote all your time to yourself, this will not help. You are in a relationship and you need to reserve your time, love and affection for your partner too. Strike a balance between him and yourself and spend time accordingly. Do not phase him out.

, Most of the time, the reason for being clingy and devoting everything to your boyfriend may be a result of low self esteem and confidence in your self. Check for such an issue, identify the problem and come up with resolutions to build your esteem. It is important to have faith in oneself.

Take responsibility for your emotions.,
Practice meeting your own needs.,
Build your self-esteem.,
Accept other people’s limitations.",How to Overcome Emotional Dependency2," Accept that dealing with your feelings is your own job, not anybody else’s. Realize that, while you may experience your emotions strongly, they don’t define who you are or control what you do.For example, you shouldn't expect others to stop what they're doing whenever you're in a bad mood or have a tough day. Instead find healthy ways to cope with negative feelings without needing others to ""fix"" it for you.
If you can, give yourself a chance to calm down and stabilize a bit before reaching out to a friend.

, When you feel down, look for healthy ways to soothe yourself. Try giving yourself a pep talk, going for a walk, or writing in a journal.Be careful not to replace one type of dependency with another. For instance, if you have anxiety, it’s not a good idea to start using alcohol to calm yourself down.
If you do find yourself turning to alcohol or other substances for emotional reasons, seek help from a doctor or mental health specialist.

, When you feel good about yourself, you’re less likely to depend on other people for attention or approval. Take stock of the things you like about yourself, and remind yourself of your good qualities frequently. Increase your self-esteem by challenging yourself to try new things and finding ways to help others.Your self-talk is a big component of your self-esteem. Instead of criticizing yourself, talk to yourself in a friendly, encouraging way. Say things like ""I can do this. I am a capable person. I am in charge of my destiny. Whatever happens, I will do my best.""

, Look for the good in people, and keep your expectations reasonable. Don’t get angry if someone occasionally disappoints you. Remind yourself that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.For example, no one is perfect. If a friend forgets your plans, give them the benefit of the doubt, especially if it's a one-off. Otherwise, it's like you expect everyone to be flawless while you are entitled to make mistakes.

Know what you want.,

Focus on your own goals.,
Work towards interdependency.",How to Overcome Emotional Dependency3," Ask yourself what kind of life you want to live, and make a plan that will help you get there. Prioritize your own goals and values instead of trying to please other people.Don’t confuse fulfillment with getting lots of attention from the person you’re emotionally dependent on. Think about what would make you happy even if they weren’t in your life.
Create and pursue your own goals, rather than trying to meet other people’s expectations.

, Plan your schedule based on your own needs and wishes. Incorporate time for self-care and activities you enjoy, like visiting friends or going out to the movies. Don’t let other people’s plans dictate your life.For instance, if your significant other goes home to visit their family, don’t mope about being alone. Find fun or productive things to do with your free time instead.

, Avoid becoming overly dependent on anyone by spending time with lots of different people. Stay in touch with your family, and make plans to see your friends regularly. If your social circle is small, you can meet new people through work, classes, or social clubs., When you help other people, you’ll feel dependable, not dependent. Reach out to your family and friends when they need some extra support, or look for volunteer opportunities in your area.Help other people simply for the sake of helping them. If you expect something in return, you’re still in a dependent mindset.

, If you feel like you are becoming too focused on other people, step back and focus on your own goals for a while. This might mean doing something as simple as finishing a household task (like painting your room), or it could mean taking steps toward a major life goal (like applying to go back to school)., Dependency isn’t healthy, but neither is emotional isolation. As you break free of your old habits, seek out emotionally healthy people to spend time with. Cultivate relationships based on mutual respect, honesty and empathy, not neediness.For example, try to brainstorm some solutions to your personal problems a bit before running to others for advice. This helps you learn how to problem-solve while also taking into consideration that others might have practical advice, too.
If you are really feeling stuck, seek help from a therapist.

Try a new approach to banking.,
Use smart budgeting.,
Decide to live within your means.,
Go to credit counseling.,
Avoid vindictive spending.,
Listen and don’t jump to conclusions.,
Avoid blaming your partner.,
Talk to a therapist.",How to Prevent Financial Troubles from Destroying Your Relationship," Have a conversation with your partner about each of your values around money. Often, people inherit the beliefs, values, and attitudes around money from family.Before getting into the next argument about money, sit down and talk about how your partner relates to money.


Understanding your partner's attitudes and views might explain why he or she is hesitant to discuss money, or why he or she feels the urge to overspend. Whatever your partner's relationship to money, it is important for you to understand it clearly.
Ask your partner, “What did your parents or family members teach you about money? Can you remember your first memory involving money? Do you have any financial goals? Do you have any fears around money? Was your family fearful about money when you were a kid?”;
, If you have thoughts such as, “We’ll finally be financially okay once he stops overspending” or, “I’ll be happy once she changes her behavior,” recognize that you’re placing your happiness onto someone else only if he or she changes. Remind yourself that you are engaging in a false belief based on your own thinking; no one can “make” you happy, and no one can “make” you feel anything. This is an opportunity for you to face your own beliefs around money and any fears you may have. Resolve to explore your own relationship to money before demanding your partner to change.Ask yourself, “What is it I want my partner to change? How does this relate to my own beliefs on money? Is there something I need to change in how I relate to money?”

, If having “enough” money is the only thing that makes you or your partner feel secure, you may find that it causes constant worry and conflict in the relationship. If you perceive your partner spending money on an unnecessary item as a threat to your relationship or a threat to your own security, it may be time to reflect on your relationship with money.Ask yourself, “What makes me feel secure? How does money play a role in me feeling secure? When do I know I have enough money? When is it okay to spend more money than expected?”

, If one partner handles the day-to-day spending and the other partner deals with long-term savings, this can cause problems in the relationship. This kind of task division can cause conflicts. If you want to handle one job at a time, consider switching roles each month by one person handling daily expenses while the other handles investments, then switching.You can also share the roles equally. Set a time each month to pay bills, discuss spending, and look over savings. Plan something fun to do together afterward, such as going to a movie or going bowling. This way, the money talk will feel less like a chore and you will have something to look forward to afterward.

, If your current situation isn’t working well or causes many difficulties, approach banking in a new way. For example, you can share one bank account (used for paying bills, household expenses, groceries, and vacations, and cars) and then have separate accounts for your own personal spending. Be creative in finding an approach that works for you and that minimizes conflict., When you first fall in love, you may throw caution to the wind and spend money on special experiences together. Yet, before you know it, you may run out of money which can lead to conflict. Find a realistic way to budget that both of you agree upon. You may work with a financial planner, create a budget on your own, or use an online/smartphone application to track your spending.While nobody likes to budget, it can be helpful to track your spending for a month to see where the money goes. After that month, see your “money pits” and figure out a plan to spend money more meaningfully the next month. Slowly allocate your money to places you’d rather spend it.

, Instead of accusing each other of bad spending habits, learn to live within your means. Don’t take out any debt that isn’t necessary. If you want a big purchase, save up for it. If you feel an impulse to buy something, tell yourself to wait one day (or one week) before you buy it. Make it a goal not to fall into debt.By living within your means, you can avoid future problems that could threaten your relationship.


If you are in debt, you may want the advice of a financial planner. Make it a priority to get out of debt as fast as you can.

, If you have problems with your credit, you may consider seeing a credit counselor. You can find help for managing debt and creating a budget. You may also enroll in a debt management program (DMP), which can help you manage your debts. Some creditors will waive or lower fees. Many credit unions, universities, and military bases offer services for credit counseling.Ask what services are offered and how payments work. Some places offer payment plans.

, Don’t spend money just to spite your partner or “get back” at him or her. If your relationship gets to this point, it’s likely the relationship is in a state of neglect and needs attention. Don’t use money as a weapon.Recognize that vindictive spending does not help you manage money in a positive way. Change your approach by talking about these financial decisions one-by-one, and coming to a solution together.


If your partner makes a financial decision that you do not agree with, don’t try to get revenge. Ask yourself, “What is this accomplishing? Is getting revenge helping us move forward as a couple?”

, Instead of interrupting your partner when he or she speaks, listen to everything being said. Don’t plan what to say next or think of a comeback. Just listen and wait for your turn to speak. This shows respect and can help you better understand your partner.It can also help prevent arguments by not jumping to conclusions about what your partner did or why he or she did it. Engaged listening can prevent fights by fully understanding your partner.


Look your partner in the eyes, keep your body language engaged, and asked questions. You can say, “Is there anything else you’d like to say?” before moving on.
For more information, check out How to Communicate Effectively .

, Perhaps a hidden expense is exposed or your partner makes a large purchase without asking you first. Your first reaction may be to blame your partner or jump on the defensive. If blame is a normal part of your interactions, recognize that casting constant blame can be abusive. If you are feeling blamed, tell your partner how you feel without pointing the blame back.Instead of blaming, use “I” statements. While blaming is often an accusation, you can learn to state your own feelings and concerns without blaming your partner.For example, instead of saying, “That purchase you made set us back and now we can’t afford our vacation,” say, “I wish you would have told me about that purchase beforehand. I’m sad that it’s affecting us now, and will affect our vacation together.”

, A psychologist or therapist can help you and your partner when your own efforts have failed. Working with a therapist can help you and your partner relate to each other better when discussing finances and break out of unhealthy patterns. Find a marriage or couple’s therapist, who specialize in working with couples in conflict.For more information, check out How to Attend Couples Counseling.

However, if he seems genuinely mad at you, then you may need to back off for a while. Though you don’t want to wait forever to try to get back in his good graces, you should give him at least a few days until he seems to soften toward you and is more eager to talk. Even though you’re in a rush, if you try to talk to him too soon, it may just lead to another fight or to more misunderstandings.


If he completely ignores you and gives you the cold shoulder when you approach him, then he’s not ready yet. Don’t force it.
Once he’s open to at least making eye contact and talking to you, then he may be willing to talk.;
, Once enough time has passed and your boyfriend seems to have softened towards you and is more willing to talk, then you should find a quiet place where you can be alone to have a meaningful conversation. Make sure you pick a good time when he isn’t stressed about something else and looks willing to talk. Having the right timing can help everything go by more smoothly.


Let him know that you want to have a talk with him instead of catching him off guard and surprising him with the conversation. Even if he’s not looking forward to it, he’d rather have a heads up than to be surprised.
Wherever you are, make sure it’s not easy for you to be interrupted by your friends.

, If you feel like you really messed up, then you need to be open about it. Don’t just say, “I’m sorry that you’re mad because I…” and put the blame on him for overreacting. Instead, look him in the eyes, speak slowly, put away all distractions and say, “I’m truly sorry for what I did.” You can go into it and explain exactly how you feel and why you really messed up, and how much it hurts you to know that you hurt him. It depends on what you feel and what you’re willing to feel.


Of course, if he’s the one who wronged you, you should avoid apologizing just to make things blow over, and should really think about whether you want him in your life instead.

, If you’ve said your part and he was willing to listen, then you should listen carefully when he tells you how he’s feeling. You can look into his eyes, stop fidgeting, and really hear what he has to say. You may be surprised by exactly how he’s feeling. Avoid interrupting him to argue with him while he’s talking, or acting like you don’t agree with a word he’s saying. Let him know that you care enough to listen first.


Even if you feel like he’s misrepresenting what happened, it’s good to hear his side of the story. Once he tells you his part, you can both talk about what happened more and work to reach an agreement and to make up.
If you really do listen, then you may even see that your boyfriend has more to his side of the story than you thought. You may even realize that you hurt him in a way that you didn’t intend at all.

, If you’ve made up with your boyfriend, congrats! You can now move on with your lives — as long as you work not to repeat your mistakes. Give him a hug or a kiss, and just get physically close with him to seal the deal. Just make sure that he’s genuinely over it and that you’re not making him uncomfortable. It goes without saying that you shouldn’t use affection — kisses or more — to try to win him over when he’s angry, because that won’t be a good long-term solution.


Once you’re on your way to making up, some physical affection is important for continuing your bond. Even just a pat on the hand, a squeeze on the shoulder, or a kiss on the cheek can go a long way in helping you reconnect.

, Once you’re on your way back to being loving and affectionate, then you and your boyfriend can begin to grow more intimate again. Don’t be afraid to let him know how much he means to you, how upset you were when he was angry, and how happy you are that he’s back in your life. Be honest about how much he means to you and even think about elaborating to show him how much you love his sense of humor, his intelligence, or other aspects of his personality.


Don’t suck up to him or tell him you’re crazy in love with him if you’re not. Be honest about how you really feel about him.
Let him know how sad your life has been since your fight, and how hard it is to get through the daily grind without him.

, Don’t think that romance is meant for the boys! Girls can be romantic just as well as boys can, and you can find a romantic gesture that makes your boyfriend swoon. Make him a mixed CD, get him tickets to see his favorite band, write him a letter about how much he means to you, or take him out on a surprise date. These gestures can help your boyfriend see how much you hate fighting and how much he means to you.


Of course, it’s not about how much money you spend on him, and money won’t ever fix your romantic problems, but about the thought and effort that counts.

, Another thing you can do to get your boyfriend back in your good graces is to do something new and exciting that he’s always wanted to do. Maybe he’s always wanted to try rock climbing; go to a gym and check it out if that sounds like something you’d like. Maybe he wants to go to a baseball game with you; go with him and don’t complain about it if you’re not that into sports. Maybe there’s just a new restaurant he’s been talking about — surprise him with a reservation.


The most important thing is that you’re able to come up with the idea on your own. This will show that you pay attention to what he cares about.
Again, just make sure he’s really ready to reconcile before you plan an elaborate surprise activity, or your plans may fall flat.

, After you and your boyfriend have made up, you should be a little bit extra cautious around him. Try not to bring up sensitive subjects, especially not the subject that started the fight, and try to keep things peaceful, light, and fun. You shouldn’t completely act like a different person who only wants to appease him, but you should be mindful when you speak and try to avoid starting a fight again as much as you can.


If you’re eager to move your relationship forward, give it a bit of time before you mention saying “I love you” for the first time, moving in together, taking a trip together, or doing anything else to take the next step.

, It’s important to reconcile with your boyfriend, but even trying to make it up to someone has its limits. If you keep trying to talk to him again and again, showering him with love letters, or just calling him all the time to check in or asking if he loves you, then you’re going to bring more insecurity to your relationship, and you’ll make it harder for you both to heal after your argument. Instead, take it slow and trust that your relationship will strengthen over time.


If he’s forgiven you but still needs some space, give it time and he’ll come to you when he’s ready.

, When one of your guy friends is mad at you, you may be tempted to tell your other friends about it. However, you should avoid talking about it, unless you’re genuinely looking for advice on how to fix the situation. If you’re bad mouthing the guy or saying negative thing about him when he’s not around, then it’s likely that he’ll find out and that he’ll be more angry with you than ever.


In fact, it’s far better that you say good things about the guy “behind his back” so that he’ll be more inclined to forgive you if it gets back to him.

, It can be hard for guys to be honest with each other, but if you want to move forward in your friendship, then honesty really is the best policy. Let him know what caused the fight to begin with and what you wish you had done differently. Being honest and open with him in this moment will lead him to respect you more and will make him much more likely to trust you and to want to be friends again.


Let him know how you really feel and what you want to gain from the conversation. Don’t play it cool just because you’re afraid of showing your true feelings.

, Tell the guy that you’ve felt terrible about the fight, that you hate being in conflict with him, and that you really appreciate his friendship and couldn’t imagine your life without it. If you really made a mistake, then it’s time to fess up and tell him what you did and how you feel so you can both move on from it.


Just come out with it. Say, “I’m really sorry that I hurt your feelings. I really regret it.” Don’t give him a half-hearted apology just so you can both move on; show him that you really mean it.

, If you and your guy friend are tight, then there’s nothing wrong with giving him a hug. If you’ve both genuinely made up and are excited about being friends again, just give him a tight bear hug to let him know how much he really means to you. Guys aren’t as verbal about how much they appreciate their friendships, so if you’re shy when it comes to talking about it, you should tell him how you feel as much as you can and then give him a big hug to cement the deal.


If you’ve never hugged him before, you may be nervous about it, but it won’t be a big deal if you just act like it’s perfectly normal.

, After you’ve reconciled, you can be a little bit extra nice to your guy friend without making it obvious that you’re trying to suck up to him so you’ll be back in his good graces. Do a small favor for him, like picking up coffee, if he needs it, or help him cram for an exam or prepare for a job interview. You can also just make sure to treat him with a bit more care and respect, and avoid offending him or making careless comments.


If you can think of something he’s been wanting to do, like going to a certain concert or movie, invite him to come along with you.

, If you really want to prove that you learned your lesson, then you should be careful, moving forward. Avoid getting into fights with the guy, and more importantly, avoid doing whatever you did to cause the fight to begin with. Pay closer attention to how you act and learn to read the guy’s body language and facial expressions to know when he’s getting upset or uncomfortable, and try to keep this from happening.


If you just keep doing the same old thing and fighting again, then you’ll never have a fulfilling friendship. If you really care about your guy friend, then you should be willing to change your ways.

, One thing you should avoid is apologizing to the guy over text, Facebook, email, or any other way that doesn’t require you to be there in person. Making the effort in person shows that you actually care and that you’re not a coward. Of course, if there are special circumstances, like you and the guy are hundreds of miles apart, then a phone call may be best, but you should stay strong and apologize in person to show he’s worth the effort.


If you apologize online or over text, then the guy will think you don’t really care enough to put in the time and effort.
If you don’t apologize in person, then the guy may not even respond.

, This is never a good tactic. Sure, you may be anxious to know whether or not the guy is mad at you, but asking him if that’s the case time and time again is guaranteed to make things worse. Though you may think that asking him a lot will make him move on faster, it’ll actually make it take longer for him to get over it because he’ll be getting a constant reminder of what happened.


The truth is, when he really stops being mad, then you’ll instinctively know it. Asking a million times won’t change a thing.

, If you really want the guy to stop being mad at you, then don’t give him the lame apology where you make it clear that you’re only apologizing so he’d stop being mad at you. Don’t say, “I guess I should apologize,” or say “I’m sorry” in a passive aggressive way. Instead, make it clear that you’re sincere in your feelings and in your regrets. If you apologize while clearly not meaning it, that won’t get you anywhere.


Make eye contact, turn your body toward the guy, and let him see how much pain you’re in when you apologize.
Don’t make excuses for your behavior, either. Own up to whatever happened.

, Another thing you should avoid is trying to hash things out with the guy at the wrong time. Don’t try to talk to him before he has something important to do, like to pitch in a baseball game, go on a job interview, or take a test. Make sure you talk to him when he seems not stressed and approachable. You should also avoid asking if he’s mad in front of others; if you’re not making the effort to talk to him one-on-one, it shows a lack of seriousness.


If you’re asking the guy during a bad time, then he’ll already be annoyed that you didn’t put more thought into when to have the conversation, so you’ll be starting off on the wrong foot.

, Of course we all hate knowing that someone is mad at us. That said, if the guy is really fuming, then you shouldn’t try to reconcile with him that same day. Give him a few days, or maybe even a few weeks, to cool off before you feel like you can talk and be friends again. If you try to talk to him right away, then he won’t be ready to listen and will get more and more annoyed — and angry.


It can be hard to be patient in these situations, but you have to learn to do just that. Find a way to keep yourself occupied until the guy is ready to talk. In the meantime, you can even focus on exactly what you wanted to say to him.

Don't waste the time you get.,
Borrow from each other's time.,
Make appointments with each other if important or serious topics need to be discussed.,
Don't compete with each other.",How to Make Your Relationship Survive While Working Opposite Shifts1," The last thing you want to do is spend the limited time you get together complaining about how little time you get together. Treat your time together as precious opportunities not to be wasted.That said, spending a lazy afternoon (or mid-morning, or late night) doing nothing together is not necessarily wasting time. If you're spending enjoyable time together, it is time well spent.
Sharing a meal together whenever possible offers one ideal way to communicate and spend quality time with one another. For example, if you work the graveyard shift and arrive home at 8 a.m., eat ""dinner"" with your partner as he/she eats breakfast before work.;
, When you work opposite shifts, each of you will end up with a lot of solo time, which can in fact have some benefits. Be fair in offering up some of this ""you"" time when it can be transformed into ""both of you"" time. As is the case in so many ways in a relationship, an equitable give-and-take is essential.Occasionally offer up some of your sleep time to share with your partner, and expect the same of him/her. Don't sacrifice too much sleep, however, or you will be more cranky with your partner and less productive at work.
Work with your partner to save up vacation days so you can spend them together. Although you may work opposite shifts, you and your partner can schedule time off work or vacation on the same days, so that you can maximize the amount of quality time you spend together.

, It may seem a bit much to have to pencil in times to talk to your significant other, but important discussions require both partners to be mentally alert and emotionally available.For example, if you bring up important topics when your partner arrives home tired from work, he/she may lack the energy and mental clarity to fully engage in a serious discussion.
Instead, set aside a time that allows each of you to mentally and emotionally prepare for an important conversation, be it about money, family, or another topic.
Actually, setting appointments can work for less serious matters as well. It can help you ""block out"" specific periods of time for the both of you to spend some enjoyable time together.

, When you work opposite shifts, it can sometimes seem like all your partner does is sleep, because that is what he or she is doing during your brief overlap times. You'll come home, see the sink full of dishes or the living room in disarray, and feel like you're the one doing all the heavy lifting in the relationship. If home chores actually are inequitable, try to remedy that; if not, try to understand how hard your significant other is working while you sleep.Divide household chores equally between you and your partner. Be realistic about each of your individual skill sets and the times of day (or night) you have to complete the chores, though. You may even want to post a chore sheet so that each of you can confirm that the other is indeed working just as hard as you to keep the household functioning.
Consider hiring help to complete certain chores during acceptable hours if your partner lacks the skills to complete those chores. For example, if your partner has time off during the day, but lacks the skills to mow the lawn, hire a gardener or lawn care specialist to mow the lawn during daylight hours. You don't need your neighbors calling the cops on you because you're trying to mow by flashlight after midnight.

Reduce contact.,
List flaws and problems.,
Make it a point to notice others.,
Give it time and move ahead.",How to Stop Loving Someone1," If you can manage it, cut off all contact with the object of your affections. This doesn't mean “do it if you feel like it;” rather, it means “do it if you can manage to do it without making things harder elsewhere in your life.” If you work alongside your unrequited love, for example, flatly refusing to communicate with him or her is only going to make things worse at work. Just do as much as you reasonably can.


Stop calling, e-mailing, texting, or otherwise reaching out to your love. If he or she contacts you, either don't respond, or politely decline any offer to converse or spend time together. This will help put distance between you quickly, which you'll need in order to begin seeing past your feelings.
Have excuses on hand to decline offers to spend time together. If you see your love in person on a regular basis, you may be invited out, for example to get a drink after work with other coworkers. Decline these offers by explaining that you're too tired or too busy, whether you really are or not. Again, the goal is to increase the space between the two of you. Eventually, if you never hang out, the other person will stop asking.;
, Once you're in less contact with the person you love, cement your new distance by examining reasons a relationship would never have worked out anyway. Start with the obvious one: the person you love doesn't love you back. No amount of convincing could have ever changed that; emotion trumps reason when it comes to love and romance. From there, add more reasons.


Focus on potential problems with the relationship first. Think about awkwardness with mutual friends, relatives, and coworkers. Write down mundane things like schedule conflicts as well; think about friends your love has that you dislike, and then imagine having to spend a lot more time around them.
Add flaws to fill out the list. It's tempting to just list your own flaws, but now's not the time: that's tantamount to beating yourself up over something that never happened to begin with. Instead, think critically about the person you love. This is difficult, but it's good practice. Think about annoying habits, views you disagree on, and times when you were disappointed by his or her words or actions.

, Now that you're not spending leisure time around your unrequited love, it's important to begin noticing how many other attractive people there are all around you. It's true that you're unlikely to feel a spark with most of them, but that doesn't mean you can't appreciate a pleasant voice, a nice butt, or a great conversation for what it is. Make a conscious effort to focus on the attractive qualities of others you see and meet. Before long, you'll find that there's plenty of room in your heart for new crushes.


Don't worry about finding someone else to fall for just yet. At this point, just prove to yourself that you can have eyes for others, instead of one who doesn't deserves you.

, Unfulfilled dreams of romance have a funny way of drying up and blowing away when you stop feeding them. However, getting to that point takes time. Stick with your plan: make room for others, stay away from the person you fell for, and remind yourself of flaws and problems when you're feeling weak. One day you'll wake up and realize that it no longer breaks your heart to think about what could have been, and you're looking forward to a new adventure instead.


It's likely that, in the absence of an actual relationship with the person you loved, you'll eventually look back and realize you never loved them at all – you were just intensely attracted. It's hard to really, truly love someone when it's all one-sided. Take comfort in this fact as you work on getting to the point where you can acknowledge it for yourself.

Keep in touch.,
Establish rules for unilateral action.,
Rely on your circle of friends for support.,
Do something for you.",How to Make Your Relationship Survive While Working Opposite Shifts2," Modern technology provides many convenient options for sending along a quick “hello” or planning your upcoming time together. Even small gestures like a short text message or well-timed voicemail can help sustain each of you during long stretches apart.Although you may not be able to spend time together physically, you can still communicate by sending emails, text messages, or by calling each other throughout the day. For example, if you work the graveyard shift, call your partner during the last break of your shift as your partner is just waking up and beginning his/her day.
Of course, if you do get the occasional chance to drop in while you know your loved one is on a break, take it. Even a few minutes of face-to-face time can provide a needed boost of energy and appreciation.

, When you work opposite shifts from your partner, you will have no choice but to divide up some of the important decision-making responsibilities. The person at home during the daytime will primarily be put in the position of making quick decisions on subjects like finances, home repairs, and issues related to any children you may have.First and foremost, of course, you have to demonstrate trust in each other or your relationship isn’t going to survive regardless of what times you each go to work. If you need to be consulted on — or even approve — every little decision that has to be made, then you may have a relationship problem that is bigger than working opposite shifts.
That said, it makes sense to lay out some ground rules together for what decisions should and should not be made unilaterally by one of you while the other is unavailable for consultation at work. Perhaps, depending on your circumstances, changing your cable TV plan to get a better deal is OK, while trading in your car for a new one is not. Or, hiring a plumber to fix a leaky sink is a “yes,” while hiring a plumber to completely remodel your bathroom is a “no.”

, Few people can thrive when they have to spend long stretches separated from their relationship partner. While no one else can completely fill this void, you can manage some of the loneliness by turning towards other people you know and care about.If you have family nearby, spend more time with them when your partner is unavailable due to work. They can offer you support when you need it, or just someone to talk to comfortably. Also, think of the “bonus points” you can earn with your parents by spending more time with them!
Partners in a couple often find themselves drifting away from their old, individual friends in favor of “couple” friends. One of the possible advantages of opposite shift relationships is that it is much easier to keep your own circle of friends. You can watch football or go bargain-hunting with your friends without worrying if your partner will be bored or annoyed.
If you find yourself turning down some of your limited time with your partner in favor of more time with your friends, however, you may have some deeper relationship troubles brewing.

, If you have kids, you’ll likely have no problem filling your time while your significant other is at work. Otherwise, you may find yourself with some free, alone time. Use this time to your advantage by doing something for yourself with it.Seize the opportunity to take up a hobby that you enjoy but that does not interest your partner. It could be knitting, stamp collecting, gourmet cooking, golf, or any one of a number of activities.
Don’t feel guilty about using your time this way while your partner is off at work. If it makes you happy, it will benefit your relationship. Encourage your partner to take up his/her own hobbies as well.
Eventually, chances are that your shifts will change, you’ll have kids, or some other factors will cause you to lose this time to yourself. So enjoy it while you can.

Focus on the difference between “love” and “in love.” When you've got a long history with someone, it's hard to imagine you'll ever stop feeling some sort of special connection with him or her, even if you know you'll never want to date that person again.,
Give yourself distance.,
Record the breakup.,
Busy yourself elsewhere.,
Meet new people.",How to Stop Loving Someone2," That's normal. Where confusion arises is in understanding that even if you still love someone, you can end up not being in love with them anymore. Try to grasp this difference so that you can be more at peace with your residual feelings without feeling as though they're indicative of a spark that's no longer there.


Think in terms of relatives. You love your parents and siblings, but you'd never say you're in love with any of them. There are other types of love aside from romantic love. It's okay to remember someone fondly and admit that a part of you will probably always love them, as long as you can be clear with yourself that it's a familial kind of love. All you have to focus on is getting over the “in love” part of the equation. There's no need to rip your guts out and rearrange them, too.

, A breakup is devastating for both parties, and you're going to need time and space away from your ex to successfully cope with it. At the most basic level, this means cutting off contact with your ex and avoiding spending any more time around him or her than you absolutely have to. Unfortunately, sometimes your ex won't be able to make the same commitment. If your ex keeps reaching out to you, meet somewhere neutral and explicitly tell him or her to stop contacting you.


Be clear and firm. It might be heartbreaking in the moment, but it's for the best. Remember, you're not getting back together – you broke up for a reason, after all (and possibly for several reasons). No matter what your ex says, space and time away from each other is good for both of you in the long run. If he or she isn't strong enough to accept that, you'll have to be strong enough for the both of you.
Be civil. Don't come out of the gate swinging; don't attack your ex for contacting you, or whine about it. Instead, shoulder the responsibility yourself. Say things like “I really need time away from you to heal; I can't handle seeing or speaking to you right now.” Keep the focus on yourself and what you need, rather than being accusatory or spreading blame.

, Writing is a useful tool for getting thoughts and emotions out of your head and clearly organized so you can handle them better. Few life events are as overwhelming as a protracted breakup after a long and close relationship, so take advantage of your literacy and write things out. Describe the breakup; describe how you felt when things were at their lowest, and how you still feel when the weight of it hits you. Write down anything you can to make the burden easier to bear.


Write down a list of everything you dislike about your ex, and add to it whenever you think of something else, even if you've already got a similar item. Don't dwell on this list; hate is pointless and damaging to your own psyche. Instead, just use it as a way to vent, and as a clear reminder of why the breakup had to happen when you feel your resolve wavering.
If you're completely overwhelmed by an experience, write it down and then shred or burn the paper it's on. This helps push the experience out of your mind.

, The absence of a significant other in your life has likely left a vacuum of empty time in your daily schedule. Fill it with things that have nothing to do with the breakup or your ex. It's okay to spend some time moping or reflecting, but it's very easy to end up wallowing in your own bad feelings without a plan to keep yourself occupied.


Take up or increase your exercise regimen. Exercise is a proven way to reduce bad moods – it can even combat clinical depression, in some cases. Exercise as much as you safely can, as many days per week as you can.
Socialize more. Get in touch with old friends or make new friends by joining clubs and visiting social events – whichever way you approach your social life, make it a point to increase the time you spend around others who like you. Knowing that you still have a place in your social landscape really lifts a heavy heart.
Take up hobbies. Anything from collecting items to building them in your garage is a good choice. As long as you can spend time and see constructive results, your hobby will help you cope by channeling a lot of your energy into something creative and positive. Even practicing new makeup styles or outfits can work, provided you take the time to work at it.

, Eventually, it'll be time to go out and start dating again. Don't rush into this; it isn't fair to use someone else as a “rebound,” and it prevents you from properly coping with your own feelings. However, once you're able to control your emotions when you think back to your ex, nothing will help boost your spirits quite like going on dates with some new people.


Attend every party and social event you can. If you don't know people who throw parties, look up dance nights, open mic nights, and other free or cheap community events, and plan to attend. Dress up and look your best; you never know who you might meet.
Sign up for an online dating service. Free services, such as OKCupid, are really the only way to go here, since there's no guarantee you'll meet anyone you really hit it off with. That said, online dating sites are a great way to set up dates and test the waters again without having to make a commitment right off the bat. Date around some and try to have fun with it.

Seek professional help if you can’t feel better on your own.",How to Stop Hating Your Ex," However, numbing your emotions often causes you to pick up unhealthy habits. It also prevents these emotions from being properly identified and expressed.


For example, people may drink alcohol, use drugs, comfort themselves with food, exercise too much, or shop excessively to help numb painful feelings after a breakup.
If you notice yourself doing these things, acknowledge it and try to stop. If you can’t stop, you may need to seek professional help.;
, Maybe you have terrible thoughts or wish the worst regarding your ex. Nonetheless, chances are, these harsh feelings are hiding something less sinister beneath. Our strongest emotions sometimes hide behind other socially acceptable ones because these strong emotions may be scary or embarrassing to express.Take a moment to decipher what you are really feeling. Becoming more aware of these feelings may help you to move on. Grab a pen and paper and write down some of the thoughts or feelings that come to your mind. Also, notice any physical sensations you are experiencing.
People often experience anger as tightness in the shoulders or back; fear may feel like a pit in your stomach; sadness may feel like a hollowness in your chest or throat.How would you label this feeling? Shame? Disappointment? Rejection? Guilt?

, The only way you can move on from hate is to recognize that you are in charge of how you feel. No outside person can make you feel a certain way — only you can.


Take responsibility by changing your language. Instead of saying, “He made me feel worthless,” it is correct to actually say, “I feel worthless.” The other person didn’t make you feel that way.
This strategy may seem like it’s removing all responsibility from your ex. It’s not. In fact, changing your perspective about who’s in control of your emotions helps you. How? If only you can make yourself feel hate or guilt or sadness, it also holds true that only you can make yourself feel joy and excitement, too. You will experience all these emotions again, without your ex.

, Thoughts of your ex may bring up feelings of anger, maybe even rage. Instead of going down that path, learn ways to to calm yourself and not get carried away by negative feelings.


Try deep breathing. Inhale a full breath for a count of five. Hold it for five seconds, then release for another five. Repeat until you begin to feel calm.
Take a few deep breaths and slowly count up from one. Try counting to 10 but, if you still feel angry, keep going. Concentrate on the numbers, not on your ex.
Learn more methods by reading the wikiHow article How to Calm Down.

, Nine times out of 10, you are thinking about what went wrong or how you were done wrong on a daily basis. This process only enhances your negative feelings. Rumination is the act of thinking about situations over and over again — not to problem-solve, just to brood. You can decrease the hate you feel towards your ex by reducing the amount of time you spend obsessing over the relationship. Here are two ways to stop rumination:Learn from your mistakes. Rather than stewing over what went wrong, identify the ways you grew or learned from the relationship.
Release what you can’t control. A relationship is a two-way street of give and take. Both partners have to contribute to make it healthy and worthwhile. If you hate your ex for not being faithful, not putting in effort, or never wanting to compromise, you must recognize that these are all things out of your control. You can’t change or control the other person.

, In order to stop hating your ex and move forward with your life, you must let go. Let go of the pain, let go of trying to control, let go of the hold it has on your life. Performing a ritual can often give you the closure you need to look to the future more positively.


Letting go rituals can consist of any actions you want to take to say goodbye to a past relationship.Write your ex a letter (you don’t have to mail it — tear it up or burn it if you want) expressing your feelings. Go to the beach and fill your palm with sand, letting it slip through your fingers to indicate the loss. Light a candle and think good thoughts and recount memories with this person before blowing out the flame.

, Reach out to friends or family members with whom you can share your feelings, or take your mind off things. You may even be able to find a local support group through Meetup to talk to others who are going through similar experiences.


Be wary of falling into a rumination trap with others. Having a source of comfort is important, but you don’t want to spend your time with friends constantly badmouthing your ex. Focus on planning fun activities for the future instead of dwelling in the past.

, It can be easy to get lost in negative circumstance and develop a “woe is me” attitude. However, when you focus too much on what’s wrong, you fail to notice what’s right. Despite your past failed relationship, look around you at all the others who love and value you. Tell them how much you appreciate their presence in your life.


Being grateful to others can actually make you feel good. Science tells us that people who practice gratitude experience more positive emotions, feel lonely less, feel happier, and have stronger immune systems. , It can be tempting to rush into a new relationship after a breakup. You might have difficulty with loneliness. You might want to prove to yourself (and your ex) that you are lovable and worthy. This is a bad idea. Using another person to help you get over an ex is unfair to the newcomer. Taking a break can help you learn from your past mistakes. Use this time to develop and figure out what it is you truly want in a partner. Learn to enjoy life on your own before adding another to the equation again.

, Neglecting your health will not help you to heal and move forward. Make positive decisions for your future by eating right, exercising, and engaging in regular self-care.


Don’t skip meals; eat three to four balanced meals each day. Avoid alcohol or drugs.
Find a physical activity you enjoy and engage in it regularly. Exercise generates endorphins which can lift your mood. Take up a hobby or participate in an activity that makes you feel good and relieves stress. Some ideas might include gardening, meditating, hiking, or painting.

, What goals have you been putting off? What did you dream about doing before this relationship?


Spend some time pondering your future. A breakup is an optimal time to reevaluate and determine whether you are leading the life you desire.

, Breakups can lead to a host of negative feelings about oneself and others. If, no matter how much time passes, you continue to feel hatred toward your ex, mistrustful of others, or unworthy of being in a healthy relationship, you may need outside help.


A mental health counselor can assist you in identifying the source of your discomfort and offer practical solutions for overcoming this roadblock in your life.

Take the discussion of food off the table.,
Learn to respect each other’s views on food.,
Shop and cook food together or have separate trips.,
Create a set of rules and boundaries when it comes to your meal choices.,
Determine if your problem goes beyond what he/she is eating.",How to Make a Vegan Paleo Marriage Work," If you disagree about what to eat and don’t plan to see the other’s view, remove the topic completely from the table. Doing so many be the best way to maintain a healthy marriage without constantly getting into arguments about which lifestyle is best.


Agree to disagree about how you’d like to eat. If you feel as though you can have a healthy, productive debate without hurt feelings getting involved, by all means hash out your differences. However, if the conversation becomes a forum for mud slinging and damaged egos, decide to table the discussion and just agree to disagree. This is the way many couples who feel passionately about opposing political parties (for example) co-exist.
Keep pious opinions to yourself. You may feel as though you know best, however so does your spouse. Realize that not all nutritional programs are an ideal fit for every body. What may work for your spouse could leave you feeling sick. Instead of looking down on your spouse for his/her choices, appreciate that he/she took time to consider which plan might work well and be supportive.
Don’t bring eating habits into every argument. Do you find that every time you have an argument on nearly any topic you come back with, “Well, yeah you eat too much meat (or sprouts)!”? Pull back from bringing your vegan-paleo lifestyle into discussions that have nothing to do with your food choices in order to stay focused on the topic at hand.;
, Obviously you both have an opinion of what you eat and why you eat certain foods. Instead of belittling or bashing each other’s choices, exercise respect and restraint when discussing nutrition.


Make an effort to try to see your spouse’s point of view surrounding his/her food choices. More than likely you respect the choices your spouse has made in life, so make food no different. Appreciate his/her decision to opt for this type of nutritional lifestyle and try to see where he/she is coming from. Perhaps he/she has had stomach issues after consuming meat and is trying to steer clear in order to feel better. Or perhaps he/she wants to build more muscle before a triathlon so eating meat helps.
Avoid sabotaging each other’s food plans if you do the majority of the shopping. If you are the one elected to do the grocery shopping in your family, avoid “forgetting” to buy your significant other’s favorite foods (whether it’s a rump roast or a bag of greens).
Have meals together without making immature comments about each other’s plates. There’s no reason to start whining about how “gross” your spouse’s salad may appear or how “disgusting” it is to eat meat. This will only create an unappetizing meal experience for everyone so try to keep rude comments to yourself, ignore what’s on the plate and focus on the person across the table.

, Make the eating experience collaborative even if you aren’t eating the same foods. Try sharing at least the same side dish, cocktail or dessert to blend the meal.


Consider a his and hers grocery shopping outing where you hit your favorite stores separately so you both end up with exactly what you want. If you want prime cuts of meat but he/she desires organic produce, and you can’t find everything at one store, make grocery shopping a solo excursion.
Avoid a running commentary while you are cooking or shopping. Whether you are tossing the salad or browning meat, stop yourself from using the evening meal as a platform to push your nutritional ideals.
Cook your own separate meals together. Even if you both eat completely different meals, you can both get in the kitchen together to cook. Crack open a fine bottle of wine, put on some music and let the cooking begin.

, If you have the discussion up front about what you can and cannot discuss in terms of your eating habits you’ll have an easier time accepting the large roast or turnip greens on the countertop.


Identify certain foods that may be completely offensive to one spouse or another. To be fair, exercise common courtesy when cooking certain foods that may be offensive to your spouse. If you are a meat eater, back off from bringing home a whole chicken (head and all) or pig feet to your vegan mate. Or if the smell of cooked turnips makes your paleo spouse’s stomach do back flips, cook turnips when he/she is out of town.
Establish rules as to what you will and will not cook if you are the designated chef in the house. Try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes if you are the one who cooks most evenings. If there are certain types of food that you find to be offensive, find an equal substitute. For example, if you are the vegan but cannot go near meat, consider cooking fish or even lean, pre-prepared chicken breasts. In fact you can have your grocer add seasonings and prepare the meat so all you have to do is transfer it from package to pan.
Determine how you will approach feeding the children. If you have kids set boundaries and ground rules about what is acceptable and unacceptable at the table for the kids. Hash out what you plan to do early in your child’s life (or optimally before birth) so your children are not confused or see one spouse sabotaging the other spouse’s efforts. Also, consult with your pediatrician before imposing any type of defined nutritional lifestyle as growing children require more of a balanced diet.
Have a night where you eat something you can both enjoy. Whether it’s pasta or breakfast for dinner (pancakes or French toast), be sure you identify one night where you find common ground.

, Although your conflicts may center around food and eating habits is the there a deeper issue at hand? Whether its control in the relationship or your overall concern about your spouse’s health, decide if you are at odds with your spouse’s eating choices or if there is something more that needs to be discussed.


Do your food arguments seem to crop up around other situations? For example, does your spouse become agitated with what you are eating before his/her parents come to visit or while stressed at work?
Could something in his/her past be negatively influencing his/her opinion. Seeing animal abuse or cruelty could be the driving reason why your spouse is a vegan, but has also influences his/her view on the consumption of meat in general.

Act as if you are someone who can remain calm. Build your confidence in the moment by telling yourself you can do it and do it well.For example, say to yourself, “I am calm around my ex and don’t feel nervous.”
Think about how you would respond if you were over your ex or not upset at them. For example, how would your future self in five years treat them?;
, If seeing your ex fills you with panic or fear, switch your attention to your breathing. Focusing on your breath can help you calm both your mind and your body. At first, just observe your breath without wanting to change it. Then, slowly lengthen it. Count up to five on the inhale, then exhale for five seconds. Do this for several breathing cycles until you begin to feel calm.While many people count their breaths, you don’t have to.
Take your breaths from your belly. It can help to put your hand on your belly to ensure that your breaths come from there and not your chest.

, Engaging your senses can help you feel calm and grounded. If you start to feel stressed, tune into one sense at a time. Tuning into your senses allows you to access calming strategies no matter where you’re at or what you’re experiencing.For sight, look at a calming scene or cherished photo. You can also smell a scented candle, pet your dog, or listen to calm music.

, Recognize that you don’t need to react right away. Take the space between an event and your response and approach it in a controlled manner. For example, instead of saying something mean or running away, take a pause and ask yourself, “How would a mature adult respond?”Think about the person you’d like to be (or the person you look up to). How would they respond in this situation? Consider that response before you react.
If you’ve had a bad run-in with your ex, think about what could improve the next run-in. Notice what triggered you and made you feel on edge and work on curbing that reaction.with similar feelings when near your ex.

, Your first step to being calm is noticing when you don’t feel calm. Tune into your body for cues such as breathing faster, sweating, shaking, increased heart rate, or the flight-or-fight response. When you feel these things, they mean that you’re stressed or on guard. Recognize when you don’t feel calm so that you can more quickly place yourself in a calm state.Notice other situations which make you feel stressed and find ways to calm yourself. This should make it easier to deal.

, If seeing your ex triggers strong emotions, don’t give into that intensity or wallow in it. Find something that can distract you. Look away, talk to a friend, read a magazine, do literally anything to take your mind and your emotions off of your ex. If you see them, walk in a different direction, stop at a vending machine, or do something else that can distract you.If you’re not intensely triggered when you see your ex, you might try reflecting on the situation, such as telling yourself why it’s not as bad as you think it might be. You can also talk yourself through it by saying, “It’s okay if I see them, I don’t have to get worked up over this.”
Don't turn to drugs or alcohol. This would only relieve the pain temporarily, and you need something positive that actually improves how you deal with your feelings in the long run.

, If you end up speaking to your ex, don’t be aggressive or hostile in your words. Aim to be gentle and firm. There may be hurt feelings on both sides, so don’t be afraid to acknowledge the sting of seeing one another or interacting. Aim to say words that are if nothing else, kind and neutral.For example, say, “Hello, Alex. I wasn’t expecting to see you here. I hope you have a nice time.”
As the old saying goes, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.”

, If your ex is purposefully trying to get your attention by calling you names or spreading rumors, do your best to stay out of it. They might be trying to provoke you or show the power they have over you still. As hard as it is to ignore these hostile and angry behaviors, do your best to ignore them or act as if they don’t bother you.Don’t perpetuate childish behavior, either! If you’re not in a place to act maturely around your ex yet you need to communicate, opt for a message or email instead of in-person contact or a phone call., If you know you’ll run into your ex somewhere (say, a restaurant or a concert), have someone with you to act as a buffer. You might invite a friend to come with you or stand next to you if you see your ex. This can help you feel protected or at least not alone. After all, there’s strength in numbers.


If you suspect you might see your ex somewhere, have a friend go with you. If nothing else, they can distract you from seeing your ex or help you stay calm.

, If you’ve moved on and found a new partner, don’t rub it in your ex’s face. At best, they might think you’re a jerk, and at worst, they might feel very hurt and upset. Think about how you would feel if they did that to you. It’s generally not a nice move and doesn’t feel good.Your new partner may feel used if you try to flaunt them in front of an ex. This can cause problems on many levels!

, Avoid making contact with your ex, especially at first. Try to stay clear of them as much as possible so that you don’t feel nervous or uneasy in their presence. For example, if you know they go to the library every Tuesday night, don’t stop there for a few weeks if it’s likely you’ll run into one another.


There may be some situations when you can predict seeing your ex and others when you cannot. Do your best to predict their presence and steer clear if necessary.

, Don’t put all of your aggression onto your ex, especially if you run into them. If you want to go right up to your ex and give them a piece of your mind, take a moment and talk yourself out of it. Have a supportive friend to talk to instead so that you can work through your emotions on your own time and not pull your ex into it.


Even if your ex was awful, there’s so much you can do once you’ve broken up. If you do want to share your thoughts, consider writing a letter instead.

, You might feel stressed when you see your ex now, but it won’t likely stay that way forever. With time, you may be able to see them without feeling overwhelmed or upset. Give it time and realize that the intensity of your feelings will likely go away.This is true of feeling calm around your ex, too. If you don’t feel calm at first, keep trying your coping strategies.

However, any attempts at contacting your ex will only dredge up painful feelings for one or both of you, and it will only prolong the inevitable. Remember that you broke up for a reason: one or both of you were fundamentally unhappy, and that won't change.If your ex's phone number was saved on your cellphone, delete his/her contact information and delete any previous text message conversations or phone call records on your phone.
Erase, blot out, or discard any physical copies you've written down of your ex's phone number (like from an address book, for example).
Consider blocking your ex from contacting you on your cellphone. Generally this is done by going into settings, clicking on privacy, and blocking the number of your ex, though the exact method will vary depending on the type of phone you have.
Turn off your phone any time you plan on drinking alcohol (if you meet legal drinking age) so that you do not text or call your ex in a moment of weakness.;
, Some people are able to remain friends with an ex. However, if you don't think you can be friends without having romantic feelings for him/her, it may be best to cut off all ties with that individual. Even if you've deleted your ex's phone number, you may still be able to send your ex private messages or comment on photos and status updates.Unfriending/unfollowing your ex on social media will help remove temptation to contact that individual. It can also provide you with space and privacy while you heal from the breakup.
Remember that if you remain friends on social media, you'll have to see whom that individual is in a relationship with in the future. You'll also be generally reminded of your time together, which may create feelings of longing.
Remember that you can always send your ex a friend request or follow him/her in the future, once you've gotten over the breakup. If you're feeling vulnerable and may try to contact your ex, though, it's best to cut that individual out altogether for the time being.

, You may not need to do this, but some people may find it helpful to create some distance between mutual friends while the breakup is still fresh. If you think you might be tempted to ask a mutual friend to ""report"" on your ex, or if you cannot separate the emotional associations of your ex with your mutual friends, it may be best to create a little space until you've healed and moved on.Let your friends know what you're doing and why. If you don't communicate with them, they may worry that you've decided not to be friends with them as individuals.
If your mutual friends bring up your ex around you, ask them to stop doing so, at least until you've healed from the breakup.
Avoid any situations or social events where your ex may be present. For example, if your mutual friends host a party or invite you to an event, ask them in advance whether your ex will be there.

, The best way to heal yourself emotionally after a breakup is by accepting that the relationship is over. This may be difficult, especially if you were the rejected partner, but recognizing that it could never work out is important.Until you have found some sense of closure, you may continue to feel temptations to call or text your ex, and doing so will only prolong the suffering and emotional vulnerability you're feeling.


It's okay to feel pain and sadness - these feelings are normal. But dwelling on those feelings or convincing yourself that you've lost your ""one true love"" will only delay your healing.
Recognize that it's okay to be alone for a while. You can find other exciting ways to fill your time, and once you've taken time for yourself you'll be ready to begin an even better relationship with someone new.If you're still thinking fondly about your ex or hoping for some type of reconnection, you haven't found closure yet. It's vital that you avoid contacting, seeing, or even accidentally running into your ex during this time in order to heal and move on.

, If you're coming out of a long-term relationship, especially with someone you shared a house or apartment with, being alone may feel scary or intimidating. The best way to get over your ex (and distract yourself from any temptation to call him/her) is to be around other people as often as you can.Reach out to friends and family members, even if you haven't seen them or heard from them in a while. It's okay if you have to initiate the planning; the important thing is not to be alone.
Try taking up a new hobby or enrolling in a class, and ask a friend to try it out with you. This can be a great distraction from your feelings and a good bonding experience between you and your friend.

, After a long relationship, you probably have a lot of physical objects that remind you of your ex. These may be little gifts and shared objects, and seeing them everyday can be a constant reminder of your past relationship. Getting rid of (or at least hiding) these objects that remind you of your ex can help you feel less compelled to contact your ex in the wake of a breakup. Box up anything that reminds you of the other person. Whether it's photographs, gifts, or belongings that he/she left behind, it's best to keep them out of sight.
If you can't keep these sentimental reminders in your home without dwelling on your ex or feeling tempted to contact him/her, throw them in the trash. Just be sure to arrange for a mutual friend to return any belongings that your ex may want back before you throw anything out.

, Sometimes moving on from a breakup can be difficult. Even after removing the sentimental reminders of your ex, you may find yourself thinking about him or her on a regular basis, and that may give you the urge to contact your ex. If you're having a hard time moving past the breakup, making some changes in your routine or your life in general may help.If you shared a house or apartment, move out and find a new place in a different neighborhood.
If you work together or used to work together, consider looking for a new job.
If you don't want to leave your job but you still work together and share space, ask your boss if you can change desks to be farther away from one another.
Find other ways to change up your routine and your physical surroundings. Do whatever you can to make subtle changes in your life and erase all reminders of your ex.

, Whether you were the person who initiated the breakup or your actions/behavior led to your ex breaking up with you, you may be carrying around some guilt. It's important to accept the past and move on in order to heal. Remember that no matter how guilty you may feel, your ex certainly played a role in things falling apart - and that's okay. Moving on means learning how to love yourself and forgive yourself for your mistakes. Eventually, once you've forgiven yourself, you may be able to forgive your ex as well., Every relationship has its ups and downs. Couples often fight, and sometimes things are said that shouldn't have been. However, if your partner has abused you (emotionally or physically), cheated on you, or otherwise neglected your feelings throughout the course of your relationship, there's a good chance that that individual would not make a good friend.Toxic people who have hurt you and may continue to do so in the future should be cut out of your life.This is best for your getting over that ex as well as for your general mental health and wellbeing.

, Some people never stop feeling some type of attraction towards another person. That attraction may be physical or emotional, but it can make friendship very difficult. If you don't think you can talk to your ex or be in the same room with him or her without wanting to reconnect on some level, you'll need to accept the fact that you just can't maintain a friendship with that individual.If you're having trouble moving on, make sure you cut off all ties completely and at once.
Any time you catch yourself thinking about your ex, make a point of doing something fun and distracting. Go out with friends, watch TV, or find other ways to snap out of that mindset.

, Being friends after a breakup almost always requires time and distance apart. You cannot transition from a relationship to a friendship without time to process and heal (if you're able to at all).If you think you can get over the breakup and ultimately become friends with your ex, you'll need to evaluate your feelings towards that person and consider how much time has passed since the breakup.Most people feel sad, lonely, or hurt/betrayed in the wake of a breakup. This is normal, and these feelings will pass with time.
There is no universal waiting period for getting over a relationship. For some people it can happen in a week or two, while for others it may take months to get over an ex.
If you still feel any kind of longing or resentment towards your ex, not enough time has passed.
Once you can think about your ex and not miss him/her or get angry about the breakup, you may be ready to consider transitioning to a friendship. If this doesn't happen, though, you may need to cut your losses and move on without your ex in your life.

, If the breakup is still fresh, then you should spend a few weeks, or even a few months, without talking to or seeing your ex on a regular basis. This phase is key in learning to separate the relationship from the friendship, and gives both you and your ex enough time to grieve the breakup.

, While you may be eager to see your ex again, be aware that you might still be emotionally dependent on this person. Wait until your feelings for your ex have subsided.


Focus on your hobbies, close friends, and school/work. Though it may be difficult, you will eventually learn to live happily without having constant contact with your ex.

, Once enough time has passed, contact your ex and let him or her know that you would like to maintain a friendship.


Send a friendly email, text, or phone call.

, If your ex is not ready to be friends, he or she is probably still grieving the loss of the relationship. Don't get upset if this is the case. Give your ex the time he or she needs to cope with the residual feelings from the breakup.

, Don't meet late at night, or at a place that you used to frequent as a couple. Instead of going out to a candlelit dinner, for instance, meet for a cup of coffee.

, This will decrease the likelihood of fighting or getting intimate with your ex.

, Avoid bringing up aspects of your old relationship, or talking about the person you are currently dating, if you are seeing someone. Instead, talk about what you have been up to lately, mutual friends, plans for the future, and/or current events in the news or pop culture.

, While you want to be nice to your ex, try not to be overly flirtatious or suggestive.


Dress appropriately. Everybody wants to look good in front of their ex, but dressing too provocatively will send the wrong message.

, This will undoubtedly lead to the question of getting back together, and will sabotage your chance of establishing a platonic friendship.

, While maintaining a friendship with anyone, ex or not, requires occasional contact via phone or computer, don't start texting or calling your ex on a daily basis. This will inevitably create a false hope of getting back together.

, If either you or your ex is getting too attached and old feelings start to arise, then don't force the friendship. This is probably a sign that the breakup is too fresh, and that you need to spend more time apart.

Decide whether you really want to break up.,
Understand the reasons why you want to break up.,
Anticipate how she'll react.,
Make sure it's a proper time for her.",How to Let a Girl Down Easy1," If you break up with or reject someone, there is a strong likelihood that you will never get back together, even if you change your mind at a later point. The damage is almost always irreversible. With this in mind, it's crucial you know for sure that you don't want to have this girl as a romantic part of your life. If you need to take some time to figure out for sure, it's a good idea to wait.


Your decision to break up shouldn't be decided by how much she apparently needs you in her life. That's unfair to the both of you. ;
, Properly wording and navigating a rejection counts on knowing the reasons why you want to go through with it. Offering firm reasons why it won't work out will make you feel more resolute in your choice. Besides that, it will make it easier to word your rejection directly, without falling back on vagueness.


If it helps, try to put your feelings into words. Making a quick list of reasons could make things easier, particularly if you're torn between rejecting her or not.

, Anticipating how a girl will react is the most important part of planning a rejection. Chances are likely you have a good idea what this girl is like, and how she might react if you go through with the break-up. Is she going to respond to it well? How important do you think you are to her? Is she shy and passive, or aggressive and assertive? Before you even get to wording your break-up, you should muster a strong indication what her reaction will be.


Consider the possibility you might be giving yourself too much credit, or underestimating the girl's self-confidence. If you give a girl some credit yourself and assume things will go more smoothly than you're fearing, you'll probably be right in your assumption.
If you know anything about her past break-up experiences (if any), these may be a solid indicator of what you can expect this time.

, Choosing the right time to reject the girl plays into the situation as well. If the girl's family just died in a car accident, letting her know you want to break up (no matter how kindly) is going to add fuel to a big fire. If you're on regular speaking terms with her, you should try to make sure that there's nothing super stressful happening in her life. This includes more routine stressors like midterm examinations or a new job.


If you're anyway unsure how she's feeling, you can always ask ""How have you been doing lately?""
Don't confuse major stressors with truly routine stuff. No one's life is free from problems, and if you wait too long for the perfect moment, you'll probably be waiting a very, very long time."
"
Have your lines prepared in advance.,
Ask to meet in person.,
Be compassionate.,
Cut to the chase.Once you've met up with the girl, there is no point in beating around the bush.,
State a reason that doesn't criticize her.This is arguably the most important part of letting someone down easily.,
Let her respond.,
Keep it brief.",How to Let a Girl Down Easy2," Like most stressful conversations, it's a good idea to have some lines prepared in advance. Make a point of knowing how to open up the conversation, as well as how to break the rejection and end the conversation. Keep in mind that prepared lines only serve as a general guideline. The best way to let a girl down easily is to roll with the flow of the conversation.


You might, for instance, open the conversation by saying ""I don't think this is going to work. I'm sure about that now, and it's important for you to know that has nothing to do with who you are as a person.""
At the same time, you won't do yourself any favours by planning too much. No interaction will ever go the exact way you expect it to, and if you leave yourself little room for improvisation, you'll fall and stumble the first time things don't go according to plan.

, If you want to let a girl down easily, you need to show her she is still worth your time and respect. Dropping her a line over text message or social media is impersonal, and just about everyone is worth more than that. Keep short on any details when you call her to meet up. No one will willingly meet someone purely for the sake of being broken up with. Breaking up in person is, however, a much better choice for the long run.


For example: ""Hey. I think it's a good idea for us to meet. Would you be free to meet at the park tomorrow morning?""
Choose the place to meet based on what you anticipate her reaction will be. If she's prone to anger or even violence, meet up somewhere in public. That way, she will be less likely to make a scene. If the girl is shy and prone to crying however, it's better to do it someplace private, like her home. This will keep her from feeling embarrassed in public.

, As tough as it may be to balance the break up with tenderness, its a necessary thing if you want to make it as painless as possible for the girl. Though you don't want to condescend or give her the impression that the decision isn't absolute, it's important you word things in such a way that makes it sound like you still care about her, even if the feelings are not romantic.For example, follow up the break-up declaration with a positive affirmation: ""Even though I know we can't be together, that doesn't mean I don't care about you or want you as a part of my life. You're a really cool person, and I really mean that.""
Don't expect this to remove the pain or spectacle from her reaction. Even the nicest way of wording a break up is going to provoke feelings of heartbreak.

, Making things go further than they need to will only confuse the girl. You should break the news right after saying hello. Remind yourself what the purpose of the meeting is. It's not to 'hang out'; if you are more interesting in spending time together than breaking up, it's probably a sign you should not be breaking up in the first place.


Be simple and leave no room for interpretation. At the same time, don't be mean or rude. This can be a tricky thing to balance, but you should break the news with something like this: ""I don't think this is going to work out. I'm absolutely sure about it. I don't want you to think that this because of you. It's about where I am in life.""

, You can be as to-the-point as you like, but only offering the news of the break up and leaving will seem cold. The girl is going to want some answers. One way you can word it delicately is by offering a reason or two why the relationship can't work out between you two. It is crucial that these reasons don't paint her in a negative light. External reasons, like school, work, family and other priorities can factor in. This will ease the blow to the girl's self-confidence.


Let her know that you don't have time for a relationship: ""There are lots of reasons I don't feel I'm ready for a relationship right now. I'm very focused on school and don't feel like being with someone would match my priorities.""
It is definitely preferable that you are honest with the reasons. Even if you don't find the girl attractive, there may still be reasons why a relationship would be less than optimal. No matter how close you are with the girl, or what your relationship history has been, she probably deserves your total honesty.

, In virtually every case, the girl is going to have something to say in response. You may even ask her for her feelings on your decision.She may be angry, or she may be desperate and try to get you back with some quick words. She might even be relieved. If you took the time to realistically consider how she might react towards letting her down, you should have an idea of what to expect. All the same, give her some time to thrown in her two cents.


She may be upset, but it's very important you remain calm. Two upset people is a perfect recipe for argument and disaster.
Allowing her to respond and say her piece is an important part of healing. Venting is healthy, but it's good to keep a limit on it. If an interaction goes on for too long, it invites chaos.

, Brevity is your friend when it comes to letting a girl down easily. The longer your conversation goes on for, the more likely it is for fuel to be added to the fire. If you want to make sure the damage is minimized, try to put a cap on the amount of time the conversation lasts for. Ten to fifteen minutes is a reasonable amount, taking her time to respond in consideration. Say goodbye, and don't be afraid to leave even if she's trying to push the conversation on indefinitely.

"
"
Give her space.,
Talk again once some time has passed.,
Offer some consolation.,
Accept her own decisions.,
Be firm with the choice you made.",How to Let a Girl Down Easy3," Once the conversation is over and you've gone your separate ways, it is always healthy to give time apart for the both of you to recover. This stands, no matter what plans you have for your future relationship, be it as friends or remaining as casual acquaintances. The time it will take to heal varies wildly depending on the person, the extent of the relationship, and the time it lasted for. Giving space is often the thing that can save the relationship, albeit in another form.Giving space for at least a week tends to be a good standard time, although more may be needed depending on the situation.
'Giving space' can involve ignoring the girl when the situation requires it. If you stop returning her calls for instance, it will limit the amount of possibilities there will be for further arguments.There's more use in waiting until she's more or less over you to talk things out as needed.

, Opening up communication doesn't have to happen, and it does run the risk of opening wounds again. All the same, if you cared for this person enough and want her as a friend, there are things you can do at this point to help her along the break up process. Send a message to her. It's recommended that you do so via text message or social media. This gives her the option and time to respond to you properly without putting her on the spot.


For example, you might say: ""Hey. I just wanted to say hi and make sure you're feeling alright. Would it be okay if we talked sometime? I still care about you in a different way and want you to be happy.""

, It is most likely that the girl's confidence will have been tarnished by the break up. Consolation is a more expanded form of the distant compassion you'll have given during the break up itself. By this point, it's hopeful that the girl has resigned herself to the fact that there's no romantic future between the two of you. It then becomes safer to discuss things in further detail, all the while acting as a friend to boost her confidence.At this point, you can give her hope for other romantic prospects without it being so much about mixed messages: ""You know, I think you're a great person, and I know guys that would die to be with a girl like you. Just because things didn't work out with us doesn't mean you're not a catch.""
It's important to make sure the feelings have largely subsided before you offer consolations. If you console her too early on, she may get the impression that there's a chance of the two of you getting back together. This will backfire and make the situation far more complicated for the both of you.

, If you were friends before this, there's a good possibility that the rejection will ruin your friendship. If it comes to pass that the girl no longer wants to have you around as a friend, it's important to respect her decision. Friendship cannot be forced on anyone, and if you try to press it, you'll give a lot of mixed messages and cause undue harm to the both of you. If worst comes to worst, accept the fact you have lost someone completely in your life and move forward with things. Meditation can help with the healing process.Time doesn't heal all wounds, but it helps most of them. If you're feeling hurt yourself, try to distract yourself with other things. There are other friends, and even other romantic prospects out there to find solace in., There is sometimes a yearning for people to backtrack and get someone back they tried to reject. If you are at the point where you've broken up with or rejected someone, it's up to you to live with that decision. Running back and reopening the situation isn't healthy for either of you, and you're much better off being firm with the decision you made. Letting a girl down is a hard thing to go through for both people involved, and it's best to remind yourself why you did it if you ever find yourself second-guessing the choice you made.

Don't try to force Virgos to do anything they hate.,
If a Virgo likes you, he or she will let you know.",How to Treat a Virgo," Virgos view mind games and manipulation as dishonest, sneaky and beneath them, and will spot such pettiness a mile away. They won’t trust or respect you if you try this.;
, What's going on inside a Virgo's mind is often a mystery to those around them, as they are capable of disguising their feelings well. When they are brought to the point of expressing their displeasure with a person or situation, it is often to the surprise of those around them. Virgo is patient and kind, but only has so much patience and kindness, and when it's gone, it's gone! They can sometimes bottle their feelings up out of politeness and later explode, or worse, simply drop you.

, Virgos are perfectionists, and are usually well-groomed. Pay attention to your nails, scent, hair. Make yourself look nice. Your Virgo friend may comment if they think you need a little help, but they are rarely malicious or mean when doing this.

, Not only are Virgos passionate about what they believe, they have typically put much thought and research into it, and are unlikely to back down from any argument. Virgos are extremely observant - nothing escapes this sign - and can run circles around their opponents in a debate.

, Virgos are fiercely loyal, dedicated and give 100 percent to their loved ones, but they won't be used or abused. Once Virgos make up their minds that they've been egregiously wronged, they will promptly show you the door with little drama. If they suspect they are in a one-sided relationship or friendship, you will get a one-way ticket out of their lives. Virgos may seem cruel in their ability to quickly disengage emotionally, but their logical side will not allow them to mope for long. It is next to impossible to win a Virgo back once he or she has moved on.

, Compliments like ""You look beautiful today"" or ""You're my best friend"" are definitely appreciated and will go a long way. Virgos make an effort in all areas, due to being such perfectionists, so a compliment makes them feel their efforts haven't gone unnoticed. They will usually compliment you back sincerely, and a Virgo lover will reward you enthusiastically.

, When they are unable to look or act their best, for example due to illness, they will be extremely agitated by the situation. Never, ever insult your Virgo or embarrass him or her in public!

Loyal, unselfish Virgo loves nothing more than supporting their friends, and will cheerfully put their loved ones' needs first.

, They are good listeners themselves and find it rude when ignored or interrupted.

, Self-sufficient Virgo cannot stand people who act spoiled rotten and feel a sense of entitlement, as if the world ""owes"" them something. And while Virgos are typically well-educated and cultured, they do not tolerate pretentious people.

, They will do whatever is best for them. For example, if they ask you, ""Should I pick the red one or the black one?"" and you say, ""I like the red one,"" they will consider it, but then they will choose the black one. Don't get insulted. They considered your idea, but went with theirs.

, If you pick a fight with a Virgo just because they look gentle and defenseless, think twice - they have a spine of steel and a tongue to match!

, Volunteering very personal or intimate things can make Virgos feel a little uncomfortable, and put on the spot to reciprocate. It takes time to build enough trust for a Virgo to confide in you in return.

, If you said something bad last year, they will still remember that and use it against you.

, Their perfectionism is an asset in the kitchen, and they are not shy about painting a room or staining furniture. They will keep a beautiful home and raise happy, well-mannered children. Be generous with the compliments on a Virgo's cooking, immaculate home and other household accomplishments, as she takes great pride in her domestic abilities.

, Control your temper around Virgos, as they see quick anger as a weakness.

, Virgos love interesting conversations, due to Mercury in their sign or having a unique character. Otherwise, Virgos will not waste their wit and charm on someone they feel is inferior. This is why some people regard Virgos as boring. It is not necessarily the fault of the Virgo, but more likely the Virgo in question wasn't enamored enough with the person to care about making a lasting impression. They know they have many positive attributes and can win over a crowd if they didn't hate being the center of attention so much, but they reserve their charm for possible mates and new friends.

, Also, if you're a female, never flirt with a Virgo's man. Virgos in long-term relationships guard it with their lives and will react with hostility to anyone who threatens that relationship.

, However, negative criticism meant to be hurtful will not be taken too kindly and the response will be very ugly. Never, ever insult your Virgo.

, If the truth hurts, then they will expect you to use their tact and diplomatic talents. They don't like people who are fake or dishonest.

, However, kind-hearted Virgo is capable of looking for the best in people, and may give you one chance if you have only a few poor qualities among good core qualities, so long as you show a desire for self-improvement.

, If you're looking to date one, you must be interesting, deep and a little bit mysterious, but not so aloof to the point where they feel they are not needed. They will see through it and lose interest.

,, Virgos are typically introverts and extremely picky when selecting a lover, but they place great importance on sex and sexual compatibility. Your Virgo may seem shy at first but being patient and establishing trust will lead to a deeply intense, passionate and exciting sex life. Virgos are unselfish and creative in bed and take pride in keeping their lovers satisfied and fulfilling their every desire.

, When Virgos find their true love, they will devote themselves completely and unselfishly, but they expect the same loyalty in return. You will not get a second chance if you are unfaithful.

, If you think a Virgo is keeping something from you, express your concerns with honesty, but don't invade their privacy.

, Virgos are fiercely independent and will not tolerate people with controlling personalities, as they have an insatiable desire for success on their OWN terms. If they feel like you are trying to force your own views on them, they will be turned off.

, They try so hard to find their true love and will not play games.

Look at yourself.,
Look at the issues.",How to Stop Arguing with a Spouse," We have all heard the old saying ""It takes two to fight"". Well it is true, while your spouse may have some fault elements and argumentative personality traits these can only go so far if you don't contribute to the argument. Look at your own behaviour in each argument and try to identify at what points you had the option of ending the argument but due to your emotions either added or prolonged the argument. Identifying these behaviours of your own will make it easier in the future to identify them and to commence work on stopping them from occurring.;
, Determine if you can figure out the cause. Some of them might be:


Unmet core needs. A lot of arguments when rationally looked at can be deduced that one party in the relationship is not having a core need met or is in fear of a need. An example is an argument of a spouse's communications with a co-worker of the opposite sex being too flirty or too excessive. While on the service this looks like an argument of fidelity and trust this argument is being driven by a fear of rejection and abandonment. Recognizing these core needs can help you look at a situation more objectively.
Communication. This is probably the most important step but not one that can occur until some deep reflection is done to yourself and your own behaviour. Talk to your spouse about the arguments of the past and try to work out a constructive way to better resolve future issues. Talk to your spouse about your fears and insecurities in your marriage. It is possible they don't know or don't see things the way you do. Having an open, mature and constructive conversation about your relationship will form the foundations for successfully resolving future issues.
Time Out. As much as everyone wants to no-one can avoid contentious issues in a marriage forever and live in a perfect castle with our happy ever afters. When an issue comes up that an argument would normally or in the past has come up. Walk away from the situation and take some time out. This will help you reframe your emotions and thoughts and allow some breathing space to calm down for both of you.
Fair Fighting. When the time comes to have a discussion after your time out and about a contentious issue speak with your partner respectfully. Do not call each other derogatory names or bring up past failures. These do little constructive work to an argument and just ensure that your spouse is hurt or angry when you're trying to resolve an issue. Stick to the issue at hand and talk out your feelings using ""I"" statements. Don't blame your spouse ""You do this all the time"" ""This is your fault"". Reframe your thoughts and speak about yourself ""I feel hurt that you have done this"" ""I feel disappointed in your choices about this"".
Review. When a discussion or even argument is done. Look back at it and look for opportunities you could have done better or could have stopped the fighting sooner. Most people when an argument is done want to distance themselves from the memory of it as quickly as possible because it is uncomfortable. Taking the time to be uncomfortable for a short period of time will be extremely useful in limiting future uncomfortable feelings.

Hear what your child’s other parent thinks.,
Draw attention to the conflict.,
Express yourself without blaming.,
Avoid generalizations.",How to Solve Parenting Conflicts1," By listening to your child’s other parent, you can begin to understand the source of the conflict and work toward a solution.Listening requires an open mind. Do not go into a conversation about a parenting conflict with your child’s other parent without giving them a fair hearing. Pay attention to what they have to say.Empathize with the other parent. Try to see things from their point of view. Imagine yourself in their place and ask yourself how you might feel.For example, if your child’s other parent says, “I think that our child would benefit from a trip to the beach” but your child is scared of sharks, you might be opposed to the idea. But after hearing them out, you might think to yourself, “My child’s other parent is only trying to show our child that they do not have any real reason to be afraid of sharks, since shark attacks are exceedingly rare, and the joy of swimming in the ocean will certainly outweigh any fear they might have.”
If your child’s other parent has remarried, you should speak to both of them to understand their position regarding the conflict. After hearing what your child’s other parent thinks, find out what their spouse think. Turn to them and ask, “So, how do you feel?”;
, If you and your child’s other parent disagree about a certain policy or punishment regarding your child, they might not realize it. For instance, if you do not allow your child to drink soda on a school night because it keeps them up too late, your child’s other parent might not know your rule or your reasoning. If you find that they are allowing your child to drink soda on school nights, say, ""I've noticed that our child doesn't sleep as well when they drink soda at night.“Inform the child’s other parent of your rule. In the above case, you might say, “For this reason, I do not allow our child to drink soda on school nights.”
Suggest that they conform to the rule. In the above case, you might say, “Can I count on you to also keep our child from consuming soda during school nights?”
If your child’s other parent has remarried, you should also address their spouse when describing the conflict and making your request. If they cannot be present when you draw attention to the conflict, connect with them later to address attention to the conflict, or ask your child’s other parent to do so. Remember that you are all parenting together, and hopefully you can grow into making decisions together.

, Avoid accusatory language in the form of, “You are a bad parent,” or, “You are not a good person.” Instead, focus on “I” statements like, “I feel frustrated about how different our rules are for our child,” or, “I am disappointed that our child did not complete their homework when they were staying with you over the weekend.”If your child’s other parent is your spouse, you might say, “Dear, I am worried that our child consumed too many sweets and candies while I was away on a business trip.”
This will help you express your perspective while being respectful of the other person. Accusatory language and blaming will only lead to embarrassment or frustration on the part of the other parent.
Focus on the differences between you and your child’s other parent, rather than on the fact that your way is right and their way is wrong.
Do not look at the discussion about your parenting conflict as a contest to be won.Look at it instead as an opportunity for you and your child’s other parent — or parents, if you and/or your child’s other parents have divorced and remarried — to solve a problem.
These discussions can be loaded with a lot of emotions, and should be handled delicately. Remain respectful and try to work together with your child's wellbeing in mind, putting aside any resentments or hurt feelings you may have. There may be a lot of disagreements early on, but be open to growing into making decisions together — all three (or four) of you. The better you communicate, the easier it will be.

, Using words like “always” and “never” or phrases like “all the time” or “every time” tend to cause you to express technically false information. Instead, use actual examples of occasions in which the cause of the conflict was manifest.For instance, you might say, “Last Wednesday, Sally did not do her homework while in your care. She also didn’t do her homework over the weekend. I am concerned this is becoming a problem. What can we do to ensure she gets her homework done in a timely manner?”
Do not blame your child’s other parent if the conflict really lies with the spouse of your child’s other parent. For instance, if you are unhappy about the fact that the spouse of your child’s other parent was responsible for taking them out to a movie with excessive violence, talk to your child’s other parent about the issue, but do not say, “You took our child to see a movie with excessive violence.” Instead, say, “I heard our child went to see a very violent movie with your spouse on Friday.”

Select the right companion.,
Conduct adoption research.,
Compare the advantage of a having a pet versus a significant other.,
Plan activities and spend time with your pet.",How to Love Your Pet in Lieu of a Significant Other," Selecting the right kind of pet is key to finding a new “family member.” Before deciding on a particular animal, take several factors into consideration when choosing your new BFF.


Consider your lifestyle. Are you a homebody and someone who likes to spend time gardening in your backyard or lounging on the porch reading or are you hardly at home and tend to travel a lot? Dogs require more care and attention than other pets, such as a cat, reptile or bird so take a close look at how much time you will be able to spend with your pet.
Evaluate your living space. Not only is your time important, but also your space. Do you live in a 600 square foot walk up in the middle of a metropolitan city or is your home set on an acre of land? Obviously smaller animals will do well in smaller spaces, however certain large breeds of dogs may also thrive in small apartments with the right attention and availability to exercise.
Make sure you aren’t allergic. Unfortunately some people are highly allergic to certain types of pets. If you aren’t sure whether you may have pet allergies, visit your physician for a quick and easy allergy test before you set your heart on a specific type of animal.;
, Once you know which type of animal you think would be the best type of companion, do you research to pinpoint the exact breed and place to adopt the pet.


Animal rescue. One of the most rewarding ways to adopt an animal is through a rescue organization. In addition to the Humane Society, numerous animal advocacy organizations throughout the world are dedicated to placing a variety of animals with loving homes.
Private breeder. Some folks prefer to work through a private breeder. Keep in mind that a private breeder may be more expensive and it is important to do your research before settling on a specific breeder. In some cases animals may be in-bred to achieve a certain type of disposition or intelligence level, however in-breeding can present certain health problems--which may present financial challenges.
Adoption through a friend. In some cases a friend or a friend of a friend who can no longer care for an animal may be looking for a loving home. Check online for message boards or classifieds for pet owners looking to place their beloved animal.

, One of the best ways to realize the advantages of having a pet versus a significant other is to analyze the benefits.


Unconditional love. Animals are full of unconditional love and adoration--no matter what. Unlike coming home to a possibly grumpy girlfriend or boyfriend, a pet is almost always in great mood, thrilled to see you come through the door every evening.
Total acceptance for who you are. Your pet isn’t going to care that you’ve put on a few pounds or have a gigantic zit--your pet loves you…blemishes and all.
No pressure to “change” to accommodate another person’s standards of a boyfriend/girlfriend. Sometimes a girlfriend or boyfriend may demand a few changes in their significant other’s life. From spending less time with pals to dressing differently, human companions may not be able to help themselves, whereas your pet loves you for who you are.
Never moody or brings drama home. A pet won’t come home and take the stress from work out on you or fly into a depression because his/her best friend stabbed him/her in the back. Pets are no drama, which makes loving them even easier.

, Plan plenty of bonding opportunities with your pet by spending time together.


Meet other people who appreciate your type of pet for social interaction. Search for clubs that support your pet appreciation or if you are a dog owner, visit a dog park or check events through your local pet store. If you plan to bring your pet to interact with other pets, check the environment out first and be sure your animal is up-to-date with vaccinations. If you are planning to go to a dog park, make sure it’s clear of dogs that appear to be aggressive. Also, consider a park that has small and large dog sections.
Make sure your “best friend” is always with you whether you are in bed reading or on the couch watching T.V. Have a pet bed or blanket next to your favorite relaxation spot at home. Make sure your best friend is by your side while you relax.
Take a class with your pet for further training. Spend more time with your pet by taking an obedience training class or a course that will help you learn more about the species. Investigate classes through your local vet or pet stores.

Stay in control of your emotions.,
Be honest about your emotions.,
Pay attention to the feelings of your child’s other parent.,
Use and understand nonverbal communication.,
Manage your stress.",How to Solve Parenting Conflicts2," If you lash out in an emotional way, you will startle or anger your child’s other parent, making it more difficult to resolve the parenting conflict in a rational way. Do not curse at your child’s other parent, use foul language, or intimidate them verbally or physically.Keep unkind opinions and feelings to yourself, or find a way to express them in a constructive way.
Do not make snide comments to the spouse of your child’s other parent (if they have remarried), or to your own spouse if they are not your child’s biological parent about the appropriateness of contributing to the solution of a parenting conflict. For instance, avoid saying, “You’re not my child’s real father.” This could be hurtful and will make it harder to solve the parenting conflict.
Unkind words to your child’s other parent are also not helpful. Avoid saying things like, “You don’t care about our child.”
When you give respect, you can get respect.

, If you feel frustrated by your child’s other parent and their apparent unwillingness to cooperate with you in order to solve parenting conflicts, you should express that feeling in a polite and constructive way. For instance, if you and your spouse are having a parenting conflict, you might say, “I am frustrated that we're clashing over this. I hope we can resolve it soon for the good of our child.”Other feelings you might experience during a parental conflict include disappointment, embarrassment, shame, anger, and hatred.
Remember, if you are a parent of a child who is not your biological child, your opinion and feelings matter, too. Both of the child’s biological parents should be open to hearing what you have to say regarding any parenting conflicts.

, When there is a parenting conflict, your child’s other parent might have feelings about it. It is important to recognize and acknowledge these feelings in order for the problem to be fully resolved.Do not simply pay attention to the conflict as described and neglect the feelings that the conflict inspired.
For example, if your child’s other parent says, “I feel really frustrated that Junior’s bedtime at your house is different than bedtime at my house,” do not simply say, “Let’s work on finding a bedtime we can both agree on.”
Instead, start by acknowledging how your child’s other parent feels. You might say, “I hear that you're frustrated. Let’s talk about it more and find an amicable solution.”
If you and your spouse are having a parenting conflict, but they are not the biological parent of the child you share custody of, their opinion matters, too. Do not make them feel that their feelings are unimportant when solving parenting conflicts. This may be difficult at first, and their involvement may be somewhat limited. But as you get to know them and work together, the involvement of the non-biological parent should grow (with your support).

, When solving parenting conflicts, it is important to make your meaning clear through nonverbal as well as verbal communication. Additionally, it is important that you pay proper attention to the facial expressions and gestures that your child’s other parent might display.For instance, you can use a reassuring tone of voice or knit your brow in concern when explaining your side of the parenting conflict.
If appropriate given the state of your relationship with your child’s other parent, you might choose to gently squeeze their arm when solving your parenting conflicts. This shows them that you understand and care about their concerns.
When your child’s other parent speaks, you might find that you keep your hands at your sides rather than crossed in front of you (which could be read as a defensive posture).
Look directly at your child’s other parent, making eye contact. Nod encouragingly as they explain the conflict as they see it. Use encouraging words and sounds like “Yeah,” or “Mm-hmm” as they explain themselves.

, Solving parenting conflicts can be stressful. Managing that stress while solving parenting conflicts is an important way to ensure that the conflict ends in a healthy and positive way. There are many ways to manage your stress. For instance:Try yoga. Yoga is an ancient art that originated in India. It involves moving the body to various positions for a predetermined amount of time and places great emphasis on breathing.
Get some exercise. Exercises like running, walking, weight-lifting, or swimming are great for helping you relax and manage stress. Try to get at least 2.5 hours of stress-relieving exercise each week.
Try breathing techniques. Breathe in for three seconds through the nose, then out for five seconds through the mouth. Repeat three to five times or until you are comfortable and relaxed.

Stay focused on the issue.,
Negotiate a solution.,
Forgive your child’s other parent.,
Define rules with the other parent as a proactive way to address conflicting approaches.,
Choose your conflicts carefully.",How to Solve Parenting Conflicts3," If you and your child’s other parent are discussing a parenting conflict regarding when your child ought to be picked up from school, it does no good to start talking about a conflict you perceive regarding the vacation you know your child’s other parent is planning for your child. Instead, stick to the topic of when your child should be picked up from school.If you have multiple parenting issues to address with your child’s other parent, wait until you’ve solved one in a satisfactory way, then address another. This will prevent you from stockpiling complaints and potential sources of conflict.
Likewise, don’t allow your child’s other parent to rope you into a conversation about how late your child stays up if the topic at hand is when your child should be picked up from school. To avoid such a situation, say, “I believe that what you’re saying is a valid concern, but I’d like to focus on the topic at hand for now.”
Do not bring up past parenting conflicts, either. This will not allow the present conflict to move toward a resolution process. Instead, it will only dredge up feelings of hurt and loss from an earlier period.

, Solving parenting conflicts always requires some form of negotiation so that your expectations and needs as a parent and those of your child’s other parent are met. This will require both of you to put your heads together and find a compromise — a solution that is not ideal to either of you, yet acceptable for both of you. This might take time, or it might be relatively simple.For instance, imagine that you allow your child to ride their bike in driveway only, but your partner wants to allow your child to ride their bike around the block. You might be able to meet in the middle by allowing your child to ride down the block but remaining within eyesight of the house, thereby extending the range of your child’s bike-riding activities.
Alternately, either you or your partner can accede to the standards set by the other. For instance, when listening to your partner’s reasoning about why your child should be allowed to ride their bike around the block, you might come to see their logic. You might say, “Yes, I see your point and I agree that our child has outgrown my rule. We will change the rule and allow our child to ride their bike around the block.”

, When solving parenting conflicts, remember that both you and they want what is best for your child. You just have two different perspectives. Do not hold a grudge against your child’s other parent or bring the conflict up long after it was resolved.Remember, forgiveness doesn’t mean you forget about the parenting conflict or pretend it never happened.Instead, forgiveness after a parenting conflict means that you have chosen not to remain angry or frustrated by the fact that you and your child’s other parent did not see eye to eye on a particular issue.
Remember that both you and — hopefully — all other stakeholders (including your child’s other parent, the spouse of your child's other parent, and/or your own spouse if they are not your child's birth parent) learned something. For instance, perhaps you realized through the conflict that you and certain other stakeholders in the parenting conflict have different parenting style and you won’t always agree.
If you wish, you could tell your child’s other parent that you forgive them. For instance, you might say, “Since we’ve come to a reasonable solution regarding our parenting conflict, I forgive you for all that happened.” If you feel you deserve some of the blame for the conflict, you might add, “I hope you can forgive me, too.”

, If you and your child’s other parent differ significantly in the way you wish to raise your child, you will have conflicts. One way to solve (and avoid) conflicts in parenting is to share a common set of rules, expectations, and punishments.For instance, if you allow your child to eat many sweets before bed but your child’s other parent does not allow your child to eat sweets before bed, your child might get confused or even come to resent the other parent.
To prevent this, share your own perspective and expectations regarding your child’s behavior with your child’s other parent. Be honest about the sort of rules you think are best for your child. Work to convince your child’s other parent of the rightness of your own position using rational, persuasive arguments.
Of course, if your child’s other parent remains unmoved, you might have to accept that the two of you may simply not be able to have completely identical parenting rules and strategies, especially if you are divorced. Communicate openly and honestly with your child’s other parent and try to keep your rules as closely aligned as possible.
In order to achieve greater consistency in your parenting strategy, let your child’s other parent know of your rules and parenting strategies as you make them. This will help the two of you avoid future conflicts.

, Don’t make every difference between you and your child’s other parent a source of conflict. For instance, if you and your child’s other parent have two different bedtimes but they differ by only 10 minutes, the difference is not terribly significant. Your energy would be better focused on more important parental issues like the fact that your child’s other parent allows your child to watch TV for an unlimited amount of time and does not require your child to dedicate any time towards homework.Taking your child’s other parent to task for every imperfection or difference will not lay the foundation for a positive relationship or enhance your ability to solve parenting conflicts.

Be thankful: ""Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."",
Keep a gratitude journal.,
Learn to rejoice in all things: ""A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones."",
Learn to be content with your life.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Retrain your thought life.,
Be humble.,
Lower your expectations.,
Distance yourself from whatever is bothering you.,
Speak words of faith.,
Ask for help.",How to Stop Complaining (Christianity)," (1 Thessalonians 5). Also consider, ""Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good. His love endures forever."" (Psalm 136). As a Christian we have a lot of things to be thankful for; being forgiven, the hope of being in Heaven one day, being a child of God, etc. Besides that some say that, if you have a place to live and a car, you are richer than a large percentage of people in the world.;
, If you have a tendency to forget all the blessings in your life, try writing them down every day. Write out 10 things every day that you are thankful for. This will most likely greatly improve your mood and your ability to see more things to be thankful for.

, (Proverbs 17:22). Paul wrote, ""Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!"" (Philippians 4:4). Paul wrote this when he was in prison. So, if he could tell himself to rejoice in such awful conditions, you can tell yourself to, as well, no matter what your current condition is.


Happiness and joy are a choice. You can choose to be happy about your life, or you can choose not to. Also remember the verse, ""The joy of the Lord is your strength."" If you want to have strength for your life, choose to have a subdued joy and contentment no matter what.

, No one is perfectly happy with their life. All humans know by instinct almost that life is not as it should be. Part of us knows that we were created for the Garden of Eden, but our current world is nothing like the Garden of Eden was. However, learning to be content is still possible.


Paul said, ""I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want."" Even Paul had to learn how to be content. No one is born innately knowing how to always be content, but we can learn how.
Another great verse is ""godliness with contentment is great gain."" If you can learn to praise God for your life as it is now, rather than always wishing that it were different, you will be much less likely to complain about things.

, The world always looks a little more grey when you are tired. If you are feeling down, try taking a nice long nap. Most people feel much better after a good sleep. Trust the Lord, ""In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat—for He (God) grants sleep to those He loves."" (Psalm 127). God would want you to get 8 or 9 hours of sleep every night. Don't let yourself get sleep deprived. You would be much less likely to complain, if you are always well rested.

, Try to think about what you are thinking about more often. Our words are dictated by our thoughts. You can force yourself to think more positive thoughts. You can force yourself to think about good things rather than negative things. Control your thoughts rather than letting your thoughts control you.


Consider, ""Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things."" (Philippians 4:8). If you think only about what is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent and praiseworthy, you will have no room in your thoughts to think about what is false, wrong, impure, ugly, or not admirable.

, Often times complaining comes from our own ego and pride. We think things should be a certain way, or we think we deserve more than we are getting, so we complain about things not being up to our high standards. But, ""Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you."" (Romans 12:3). Don't think of yourself as being more than you are. It would be good to stop thinking that you deserve special treatment or lavish things.


See the humble reality of who you are rather than thinking you are someone greater than you are. Humbly say, ""You do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes."" (James 4:14). The reality is that our lives are very fragile and finite. We really can't even expect for sure to be alive tomorrow, let alone that tomorrow will be our best day ever.

, You might have too high of expectations about how things should go in your life. But, instead of expecting a lot, be happy, if you get anything good in life. As a Christian, it helps to remember that we deserved to die for our sins, but God showed His grace in sending His son to die for us. The fact that we get anything great in life is us getting much more than we deserve. Do all you can, but expect less than you had hoped, and you will probably be happier. Expect too much, and you will probably be miserable. Then you will be much more likely to complain, which will not help, but can cause more dissatisfaction.

, If it's a person that is causing you to complain, take a healthy time out from them, if you can. If it's your job that causes you to complain more, consider changing jobs. If you can change whatever it is that is bothering you, then change it. If not, then learn to echo the Serenity prayer: ""God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."" Amen.

, Rather than expecting and speaking about the worst case scenario, think of what might happen instead. Think about the possibilities. Have hope, ""Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear."" (Ephesians 4:29). Instead of saying, ""I just know today is going to be a horrible day,"", or ""Today is a horrible day,"" say ""Thank you God that today is going to be a great day for all of us."" Build up yourself and others in what you say. Speak words of faith and hope instead.

, Ask people in your life to call you out when you are starting to complain about things. Ask people you know to remind you to stay positive. If you have an addiction to complaining, in a sense, you will need help from others to break that bad habit.

Look for reduced communication.,
Watch out for shorter conversations.,
Notice when his tone of voice towards you changes.,
Listen to what he says.",How to Tell When a Guy is No Longer Interested in You1," This can be one of the first signs that a guy is losing interest. Usually, you can safely assume that a guy will contact you if they want to talk to you. When a guy that usually calls and texts you frequently stops doing so, you should take note.


More isolation and less verbal contact can be a sign of declining interest. But, it might also signal changes in his personal life – maybe he’s very busy or has issues to deal with at home.
It’s always best to reach out and ask directly rather than just assume he’s lost interest.;
, This goes hand in hand with reduced communication. If you start to notice that when you do talk, it’s only for very short periods of time you should be aware of that.


For example, if you go from talking on the phone for hours at a time to only speaking for ten minutes at a time, this can be a sign that he’s losing interest. He may try to shorten your conversations by ignoring your texts or calls for long periods of time before returning them, or saying that he has to stop talking but doesn't offer a clear reason why.

, This is a strong tell that he's not interested anymore. Many men will speak to people that they’re interested in with a softer and more flirtatious tone than they would use with others. When his feelings change, his tone of voice becomes less affectionate and starts to sound like his normal tone.He may even speak unkindly towards you, or say unfriendly things. This is a clear sign that he is not interested in you. You do not deserve to be around someone who treats you poorly or says harsh or unfriendly things to you. If he ever starts to say disparaging things about your looks, the things you do, or how you act, you should end the conversation immediately.

, When you two are talking, does he ask you about meaningful things in your life or does he focus on himself? A guy that is interested in you will try to have deeper conversations and try to get to know the real you. When he speaks, notice when he tries to keep the conversation superficial or tries to cut it short.He may be trying to subtly hint to you whether he is interested or not. You should pay close attention to the things that he saying, as well as the way that he is saying things to you.
Does he joke with you as much? A lack of humor might mean he’s feeling low – maybe depressed – or just a loss of interest in general.
Also note whether he talks about trivial things or goes into deeper subjects. Avoiding topics of substance or talking about his feelings may mean he’s not interested.
If he starts to talk about his relationships with other people, especially in a romantic way, he is letting you know that he sees you only as a friend.

"
"
Notice when he breaks plans.,
Watch his behavior with others.,
Look at his body language.,
Notice if he stops all physical contact.,
See whether he pays attention.",How to Tell When a Guy is No Longer Interested in You2," When he consistently breaks plans that you two had made without rescheduling, you should take this as a sign that he doesn’t want to hang out. He may also stop asking you to hang out, which is a major red flag.


If you notice that you are the only one suggesting things to do and making plans, you should hold back and see if he will start to try to make plans. He will make plans and try to hang out with you if he’s still interested.
He may offer generic excuses to break plans, like that he has other things to do, without offering you specifics. You should be aware if he never gives you a clear answer about why he can’t hang out. He may try to be evasive about breaking plans. He could say things like, ""I have plans with someone else"" or ""I can't make it tonight"" without offering a clear reason why he is breaking plans.

, You may be having trouble distinguishing whether he’s treating you differently or if he treats you the same way that he treats his friends. Watch how he interacts with people you know are his platonic friends and ask yourself whether he treats you in the same way.If he is treating you like he would any other friend, he is probably just being friendly to you and is not interested romantically. If he’s interested in you, he’ll treat you differently than he does his friends.
Some men have more flirtatious personalities, while others reserve their flirting for people that they do care about, so try to differentiate whether he is the former or the latter.

, Body language offers clues about how someone is feeling. When someone is disinterested in or uncomfortable in a situation, they will try to subtly move away from you and avoid physical interactions. Look out for body language cues that signal that he is uncomfortable or disinterested in your interactions.He may try to move away from you, cross his arms in front of him, or turn away from you while you are talking. He may also try to avoid physical contact, like a hug or you touching his arm, he is not interested.
If his eye contact is short and he breaks eye contact during conversations consistently, he may not be interested in what you’re saying. However, some men are shy – this might just signal nervousness or shyness and not a lack of interest.
Some body language cues that he is disinterested are: pointing his feet and body away from you, rubbing his neck, crossing his arms, looking at the floor, or angling his body away from yours., Touch builds attraction and emphasizes physical closeness in any relationship. Look for any changes in the frequency of your physical contact and in the type of contact that you have together.For example, the two of you may normally hug whenever you see each other. If he is no longer interested in you, he may stop hugging you, or move away whenever you try to hug him.
Even if you two do still have physical contact, the type of contact can change when he loses interest. He may tap you on the arm instead of hugging you, which is a non-romantic gesture that most men use with friends.

, When guys are interested in someone, they will make an effort to remember important things about that person like their interests, their schedule, or facts about them. Guys will stop paying attention and remembering these things when they aren’t interested anymore.For example, if he forgets your birthday even after you’ve been talking about it for a few weeks, he probably isn’t interested anymore.
If he consistently forgets things that you tell him, like that you have an interview coming up or that your family is coming in to town, he may no longer be interested in the things that are important in your life.He might also stop making surprising and meaningful gestures as he did in the past, such as surprising you with flowers or a random gift.

"
Let him contact you first.,
Ask for advice.,
Ask him.,
Take care of yourself.,
Keep your dignity.",How to Tell When a Guy is No Longer Interested in You3," If you’ve started to notice that he isn’t communicating with you as much as he once was, you should take a step back from reaching out to him. When you’re the only one who texts, calls, or tries to make plans without any reciprocity, it’s clear that he isn’t interested in seeing you.Try this for a week to see whether he begins to change. Do not contact him first and see whether he initiates conversations with you. He will either notice that the conversations have stopped and reach out, or he will not reach out and that will tell you that he isn’t interested.

, You may have mutual friends with the guy that you like. If you are able to, ask his friends if they know if he is interested in anyone or whether he is still interested in you.


Vice versa, notice if he asks you for advice about his romantic relationships with other people. This is a clear sign that he is interested in someone else and that he sees you only as a friend. If he starts to ask things like, ""How can I get this girl to notice me?"" or ""What kind of date should I plan for her?"" it's clear that he has no interest in you romantically.

, This is the single best way to know whether he is interested in you still. Speculation about his communication, his behavior, or his attitude can help you gain a good idea about how he is feeling, but you never know until you have a conversation with him.


This can be scary and nerve wracking. No one wants to feel rejected and this is a vulnerable position to put yourself in. However, you may be reading his signals incorrectly or you may be missing signals that he thinks are clear.You can broach the subject indirectly or directly. You can ask him, “Are you still interested in hanging out together, or would you rather just be friends?” This gets to the heart of the issue and gives him the opportunity to share what he is feeling.

, This is very important since losing a guy that you’re interested in can be an emotional time. Whether this guy who has lost interest is your boyfriend, a crush, or an ex you need to take care of yourself and be kind to yourself.Do things that make you happy. You can hang out with friends, cook your favorite meal, go for a walk outside, paint a picture, or watch a new movie.

, Accept that he may not be interested you anymore with dignity and grace. Keep your distance from him and try not to vent your frustrations or anger to mutual friends.It’s natural to grieve the loss of this relationship and your idea of what your future might be together. After you’re done grieving, move on from the situation by focusing on the other positive parts of your life.
Keep the big picture in mind. It is hard for you, for sure, but there are many wonderful guys out there looking for relationships.

Pinpoint why you need space in your relationship.,
Decide what you would ultimately like to do about your relationship.,
Plan a time and place to meet and talk.,
Manage the conversation.,
Set clear guidelines.,
Give a timeline.,
Make sure to calmly acknowledge his feelings and concerns.,
Diffuse an angry outburst.,
Accept that your boyfriend may not agree with your choice.,
Try out your plan, and ask yourself questions to help you fine-tune and adjust as needed:”Do I feel like I received the space I needed?”
”Did the space help me?”
”Is there anything I would like to change?”

,
Decide on clear and concrete changes together.,
Give each other positive feedback to show that you support and care for each other.”I am grateful for your support.”
”I appreciate that we are working on this together.”
”I am really glad you are trying this with me.”

",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Need Some Space," Take some time to really think about the reasons why you feel how you do. You may want to write down these reasons for you to reflect upon later. This will help you form answers to your boyfriend’s questions about your decision.


Some common reasons for wanting space in a relationship are needing some alone time to decompress after a busy week, wanting to focus on a project, or taking care of private family matters.;
, Your boyfriend will most likely want to know what taking some space apart means for your relationship. If you determine that you want to break up with your boyfriend, it is best to do so now.


Togetherness and separateness are balanced in healthy relationships. In healthy relationships, you also feel like your own person and have friendships outside of the relationship., A good time would be when you are both relaxed, calm, and able to focus on listening to one another.A public place that is quiet where you can still talk may help you avoid a scene, like a park or coffee shop, would be a good location.

, Make sure you stay on topic and do not get distracted. Use “I” statements to focus on what you need and want. “I” statements show that you’re accepting responsibility for your decision. This will also help your boyfriend to feel less attacked or blamed.Some examples of “I” statements are:


”I am unhappy.”
”I am feeling a lot of pressure.”
”I don’t have enough time to pursue my hobbies.”

, Figure out how much contact you will have with each other, including talking, texting, and seeing each other in person.


Contact may occur in some form once every a few days, once every other week, or once a month.
Scheduling a specific time for contact may help add stability. Perhaps your mother has doctor's appointment in the morning, so afternoons would be better or maybe you volunteer regularly on the weekends and weekdays would work best.

, It’s important to let your boyfriend know how long he should expect to give you your space. This can be as specific as a week or a month. It is important to manage his expectations. After this initial period has elapsed, the time needed for more space can be evaluated by both parties.


An indefinite period of time may not be the best option as it is ambiguous and leaves the other person feeling powerless.

, You could say something like:“I see you look upset.”
”I can tell I've hurt your feelings.""
”Is there anything else I can share with you?”

, Try to focus on listening to him, and eventually he should calm down. If emotions continue to overheat, do not storm out. Let your boyfriend know that you would like to briefly pause your discussion and that you will continue your talk when you have both calmed down., He may not want space, and may want to end your relationship. If this is the case, allow him to do so to avoid more emotional pain.

,, You may decide to keep communication as is. Perhaps you and your boyfriend will decide that you can increase communication by texting and talking, but continue to see each other infrequently.Or you may choose to cease all forms of communication all together.

Decide if your partner is supportive and understanding.,
Decide what to share.,
Prepare for any reaction.,
Think about your needs.",How to Tell Your Partner About Your Eating Disorder1," Admitting that you have an eating disorder and deciding to tell your partner can be an extremely difficult process. You may feel embarrassed, guilty, or ashamed of your actions and your condition. As you make the choice to tell your partner, decide if you trust them and if they will support you and understand your struggle.You need someone who will be there for you when you have difficulties, who can offer a shoulder to cry on or a listening ear, and who will not trigger you by obsessively talking about food or constantly ridiculing you.;
, You may not want to tell your partner everything about your eating disorder right away. You may want to just tell them the basics, like the type of eating disorder that you have and what your treatment is. Decide what you feel comfortable sharing.


For example, you may not want to share all of your unhealthy habits or your health problems just yet. You may decide to share some health problems but keep some of your feelings and anxieties to yourself.

, Your partner will react to this new knowledge when you tell them. They may have a lot of different reactions. Your partner may be shocked, upset, concerned, sad, angry, or relieved. The news may be distressing to hear. You should prepare for your partner to have a range of emotions, including negative ones.Just because your partner has a negative reaction at the beginning doesn’t mean that they won’t be supportive or understanding. This news may be a lot for them to take in, so give them time to process and come to terms with your condition.
For example, your partner may say, ""I don't understand. You look great! I don't think you have an eating disorder"" or ""But you're working on losing weight and you're almost to your goal. That's not an eating disorder.""

, Telling your partner about your eating disorder will probably be very stressful for you. You may feel a lot of emotions afterwards, even if the reaction is a positive one. Remember that regardless of your partner’s response, you have to stay focused on you and your recovery. Continue to take care of yourself, follow your treatment plan, and focus on healing.If your partner is unable to accept the news, makes you feel bad about yourself, or treats you negatively because of your eating disorder, talk to them about that. You may even go to counseling to try to work out the issues.
Say, ""I understand your feelings. However, your negative comments about my body and my condition hurts me and is not good for my recovery. Can we talk about resolving this so we can communicate in a healthier way?""
If your partner is unwilling to accept your condition, uses unhealthy or abusive language, or treats you in an unhealthy way, you may need to reconsider the relationship. Your health and recovery comes first.

Plan a relaxing activity for after you tell your partner.,
Write down what you want to say.,
Choose the right time and place.,
Detail your triggers.,
Provide information about eating disorders.,
Explain your treatment.,
Assure them they don’t need to fix you.",How to Tell Your Partner About Your Eating Disorder2," Telling your partner about your eating disorder may be stressful for you, so it is important to have a destressing activity planned for after. Try planning something that is not food related, such as going to see a movie with a friend, going for a massage or pedicure, or doing some yoga or meditation.

, Before you tell your partner, you may want to write down some thoughts. This can help you organize what you want to say and take some of the pressure off when you finally tell them. You may want to write out a speech, jot down bullet points of things you want to say, or make a list of keywords so you won’t forget.If you don’t think you can tell them in person, you may want to write them a letter.
Consider asking a friend or family member who knows about your condition for help coming up with what to say. You may also want to consult your therapist for help in how to tell your partner.

, When you tell your partner about your eating disorder, make sure to choose a good time and place to do it. Pick a time when both of you are not distracted and have time to have a long conversation. Do it in a quiet, private place instead of a public place.You want to make sure cell phones are put away, television is off, and any other distractions are not going to interrupt you.
Make sure you have plenty of time to talk because your partner may have a lot of questions.
Tell your partner, ""I have something very important to discuss with you. When do you have time to talk?""
You may also want to prepare your partner for an empathetic, accepting response. Try saying something like, ""I'm nervous about telling you this and I'm fearful of being judged. I trust you and want to share this with you.""

, You should tell your partner about your triggers. If you are going to spending the majority of your time with them, they need to know how not to cause you to feel bad, get upset, or relapse. Be as detailed and honest about your triggers as you can, no matter how nervous, embarrassed, or guilty it makes you feel.For example, tell your partner not to discuss diets, calories, or losing weight around you. You can say, ""Focusing on the calories in food is a trigger for me. Can we not talk about calories and instead work on eating?""
Point out any trigger foods or trigger situations. You may not be able to keep cookies in the house, or you may not be able to go to buffets or eat in social settings.

, When you tell your partner about your eating disorder, you should have information ready for them to look over. They may not know that there are different types of eating disorders or that it is a mental illness. They may only have seen eating disorders in the media. Gather books, websites, and materials from your doctor about your eating disorder so your partner can educate themselves.You may want to start with The National Eating Disorders Association, The National Eating Disorder Information Centre, and Eating Disorder Hope.

, When you tell your partner about your eating disorder, you should also tell them about your treatment and recovery. Tell them if you have been to rehab or if you are on medication. Explain any therapy that you are in and what your doctor, therapist, nutritionist, or other health professionals are doing to help you.If you are not in treatment yet, tell them what you plan on doing to start the recovery process.
Tell your partner, ""I am undergoing treatment for my eating disorder. These are the steps I have taken to get to where I am, and this is how I manage it.""

, One of the things you may want to communicate to your partner is that it is not their responsibility to fix you. You are not telling them so they can cure you or be responsible for your recovery. You only need their support and their understanding.For example, you may say, “I know you want to help me get better. You can’t cure me. The way you can help is to be there for me, understand my condition, and meet my needs.”

Build intimacy.,
Explain that advice and compliments won’t help.,
Ask your partner not to be dismissive.,
Tell your partner not to police your food habits.,
Ask your partner not to focus on your body.,
Suggest counseling.",How to Tell Your Partner About Your Eating Disorder3," Eating disorders can have a negative impact on your sexual intimacy. Eating disorders can reduce sex hormones, and your negative relationship with your body may make it difficult to enjoy intimate activities. Tell your partner you want to build the intimacy in your relationship. Let them know your boundaries and what they can do to help make you feel comfortable as you work through it.For example, you may explain that you don’t feel comfortable being touched or being naked with another person. Instead, you can tell them that you want to start with hand-holding, cuddling, and kissing. Tell them which parts of your body you feel comfortable with them touching and move forward from there.

, Your partner may think that they can help you feel better about yourself by either offering advice or complimenting you. Your partner means well, but you should explain that advice and compliments won’t help you. It’s not that you feel bad about yourself, but a serious mental illness.For example, you should tell your partner that saying things like “Why are you having trouble eating? I think you look amazing” doesn’t erase the fear or impulse.
Also explain that trying to help you by giving advice or trying to help you realize that eating food isn’t a big deal doesn’t help you. Tell them not to say things like, “Come on, it’s just a cookie. It’s not going to kill you.”

, Though most mental illnesses are taken seriously, some people think eating disorders are only people wanting attention, people who want to be thin, or people who should just learn to portion control. However, eating disorders are serious mental illnesses. Ask your partner to take your eating disorder seriously and not to treat it lightly.Let your partner know you feel bad when they are dismissive of your feelings and struggles because it is a big deal to you.
For example, tell your partner not to say things like, “It’s just food. What’s the big deal?” or “I can’t believe you get this upset over a small cookie!”

, Your partner may think that to help you, they should watch what you eat closely. This means keeping tabs on how much food is in the house and watching how much food you consume in a meal. However, this hurts more than helps because it leads to feelings of guilt and shame, which can lead to destructive behavior.Ask your partner not to comment about your eating habits. It may trigger you into unhealthy behavior.
Tell your partner to let you know if they see serious or harming behavior, and to help you get help from your doctor if that is the case.
Say, “I know you may want to help me with my eating by encouraging me to eat/not binge, but that only makes me feel guilty, ashamed, and like I’m not good enough.”

, Focusing on your body can be harmful for you, and comments about your body, good or bad, may be triggering. Ask your partner not to put the focus on your body or physical appearance. Instead, ask your partner to accept you for who you are at this moment, regardless of how your body looks.You may want to suggest that your partner be mindful of objecting other people’s bodies as well.
Tell your partner never to tell you to lose weight or make negative remarks about your body. This could be very damaging for you.
Suggest that your partner accept their body. If they are dieting, starting a new workout plan, or unhappy with the way they look, ask them to limit that kind of talk about you.
Tell your partner, “It triggers me whenever I hear you talk about my body/your body, even if it’s a positive thing. Can we focus on other characteristics instead of the physical?”

, If your partner is struggling coming to terms with your condition, you may suggest that the two of you go to couples counseling. You may ask your partner to consider going to counseling to learn more about eating disorders, how to support someone with an eating disorder, and learn more about the disorder and coping process.There are support groups for people with eating disorders, such as Overeaters Anonymous or Anorexia and Bulimia Anonymous. There also may be groups for the families of people with eating disorders in your area. Talk to your doctor, therapist, or local hospital about what’s available in your area.

Take some time to think.,
Sort out your emotions.,
Decide what is negotiable and non-negotiable.,
Don't wait too long.,
Pick a good time.,
Start on a positive note.,
Be direct.,
Describe your feelings using ""I."",
Listen as much as you talk.,
Skip uncalled for statements.,
Realize that you may be in the wrong, too.,
Stop for a little while.,
Show appreciation.,
Discuss how you can move forward.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend Something He Doesn't Want to Hear," Before starting the conversation, think about what you hope to achieve. If you're not sure, you may not want to start the conversation yet.For instance, maybe you want his behavior to change. Maybe you want him to consider your feelings more. Whatever it is, you need to be clear about that before you begin.Don't just look at your surface purposes. For instance, you may think you want to help your boyfriend by bringing up a topic, but you may be wanting to punish him for a mistake instead.;
, You don't want to go into a conversation angry. If you're angry, he'll get angry. Try to figure out what you're feeling and why, and take some time to calm down before you start., A relationship is always give-and-take. If you're wanting something from your boyfriend, you need to know what you're willing to give. However, you don't want to give up on something that's really important to you or genuinely hurts your feelings. Stand your ground on what you need to, but be willing to bend on other points.For instance, you may be upset when your boyfriend tunes out when you want to talk. It hurts your feelings. You can ask him to drop things when you use a certain phrase or code word, but you can agree to take what he's doing at the time into consideration and not try to catch him at a bad time., Yes, you need to take a moment to cool down, but you don't want to wait too long. If you wait too long, you'll likely just move on with life and just avoid having the conversation at all, which isn't healthy for your relationship., Don't start a conversation when you're going to bed. Don't start a conversation when one of you is busy doing something else. Pick a time you can both focus, when you don't have to be anywhere else.In addition, don't start a difficult conversation in front of someone else. Pick a time when you're in a private space with no audience., If you start out saying something positive, it will help you ease into the not as positive part of the conversation. For instance, you could say something you value about him or why you like being with him.As an example, you could say, ""I'm so grateful to have you in my life. You're such a strong person.""

, Make sure your partner knows soon what the conversation is about. Also, be clear about the fact that you need to make your feelings known. Sometimes, it's hard for you to talk about what you need to do without your partner being receptive; letting him know upfront will help clear the way for you.It's easy to slip into passive aggressive behavior when communicating with loved ones. That is, you slip into a style of communication where you mask your true feelings and anger by trying to covertly manipulate the person. However, being honest and direct is better for building a healthy relationship.For instance, a passive aggressive statement might be ""I can see why you like video games. Playing video games can help kids develop hand-eye coordination,"" which is a stab disguised as a compliment, as it implies that what he does is for kids only. Instead, you could say something such as, ""I know you enjoy playing video games, but I sometimes feel left out when you want to play all the time,"" which is a more direct statement of your feelings., Instead of making a ""you"" statement, which can feel like you're trying to blame the other person, use an ""I"" statement. That is, instead of saying something such as ""You never get home on time,"" you can say, ""I get upset when you don't get home at the same time most days because I worry about your safety, and I like to sit down to dinner with you."", If you are trying to build a relationship, that means you need to consider your boyfriend's feelings, as well. Therefore, when you're talking, make sure that you take time to listen, too. That means actually hearing what the other person is saying and considering it, not just trying to make an argument against it. If you're just trying to figure out what to say, you aren't really hearing what the other person is telling you.Try restating what you're boyfriend is saying back to him. That shows you are actually listening, and you make sure that you understand what he is saying., You know how to push your boyfriend's buttons, and you can make some statements that really hurt if you wanted to. However, if you want to be respectful of your boyfriend, try to skip those in difficult discussions and arguments. They will only make both of you upset and distract from the topic at hand., You probably think you are right in what you are bringing up; like most people, you might have some trouble seeing someone else's point of view. When opening up a discussion, you have to be willing to consider what the other person is saying may be right.However, that doesn't mean that he shouldn't take your feelings into consideration, whichever way.

, If you find that you are both getting upset, it may be best to take a breather from the conversation. You can start it up again when you have both calmed down, either in a few hours or another day., Tell your boyfriend that you're grateful he listened to you. Tell him that you are glad you are in a relationship where you can be open with each other., Of course, if you're upset, something needs to change in the relationship. Decide how you can move forward by talking about what both of you need in the relationship. Remember that you both need to give a little, as you must in any relationship. Be positive, and work towards a solution you both can live with."

Arrange an appropriate time and place to talk.,
Share your feelings.,
Be prepared to respond.",How to Tell Someone They're Moving Too Fast1," You might feel nervous or apprehensive about having this conversation with your partner, so choose a time and place that will make you most comfortable. Consider meeting your partner for coffee or lunch at a place where you will have enough privacy to talk.


Try and avoid having the conversation in a place that is very intimate, like your home or your favorite romantic spot. Choosing a place that is comfortable but not too intimate can help the conversation feel less awkward.;
, Being open with your partner is crucial in establishing a strong foundation in a relationship. Clearly communicate to your partner how you are feeling about the current pacing in your relationship. Besides, if you are woman, you might be doing yourself a favor; women tend to have a better view of their relationship quality the longer sex is delayed while dating.You could tell a partner who seems unhappy about your decision, ""I really like you, but we're moving too fast for me."" Say, ""Doing things like the things you're pressuring me to do is a big commitment for me, so I need more time.”

, Your partner might not share your perspective and think the relationship is progressing just fine. On the other hand, he or she might accept and be respectful towards your feelings. Either way, you need to be prepared to respond appropriately.


If your partner says things like, ""If you really care about me, you'd have sex with me,"" you could respond with, ""I do care about you. That's why I don't want either of us to get hurt by rushing things,"" or ""If you love and care about me, I need for you to show me that you do by being understanding and respectful of my feelings.”
An empathetic partner might say, “I really messed up by trying to move things along faster than you are comfortable with.” You could offer a response such as, “I know that you care for me and naturally want to be intimate to express how you feel. I want the same thing. I just need more time.”

Understand that communication is filtered through your own perceptions.,
Do not blame your partner.,
Avoid praising your partner.,
Listen without being defensive.,
Make connecting with your partner your goal.",How to Use Respeak in Your Relationship1," When you are having a conversation, it is important to understand that everything you hear is filtered through your own perceptions. This means that what you actually hear is your perception of their words. For example, you may think, “My partner rudely asked me to calm down.” If you use respeak you would think, “My partner asked me to calm down and I perceived it as rude.”When you make this adjustment in your thoughts, you realize that what you perceive may be different from what your partner intended. This can help to solve many miscommunications that happen in relationships.;
, When you are communicating with your partner using respeak, recenter yourself in the experience. Doing this stops you from blaming your partner. For example, if your partner is late coming home you may feel angry. Instead of saying, “You made me angry by being late,” you can say, “I angered myself when you were late.”This relies on the concept that individuals control and take action over their own feelings and experiences.
By doing this, conversations that would traditionally lead to blame become more compassionate.

, Another aspect of respeak is to avoid outwardly praising your partner. Instead, you want your partner to come to their own conclusions about their successes, rather than relying solely on your praise or approval. For example, if your partner gets a promotion at work you could say, “I am proud of you.” This way you are focusing on how you feel.You can also say things like, “I feel comfortable and safe when you are around.” This focuses on how you feel rather than praising their actions, and feels more genuine.

, When you incorporate respeak into your relationship, you can learn to listen without being defensive. This happens when you realize and understand that your partner can only speak about their own experiences. For example, if your partner blames you for something, they are actually just communicating the feelings that they have created within themselves. This will allow you to be more compassionate towards your partner and less defensive., It is important to make connecting with your partner the goal of communication. Many couples develop poor communication skills because they place a lot of importance on being right or winning an argument. You need to let go of the desire to always be right.For example, if your partner is late coming home and was also late last week, only focus on the present. Do not bring up the fact that they were late last week. This makes it seem like you are trying to find a pattern and win an ongoing argument.
By only focusing on the present, you are demonstrating that you are actively trying to connect with your partner.
Respeak works best if both parties are invested in changing the way they communicate and are engaged in learning the principals of respeak.

"
Vocalize when you need for previous intimate behavior to cease.,
Engage in a compassionate and honest conversation.,
Discuss the appropriate level of intimacy.,
Discuss your intimacy desires in other areas.,
Define your relationship and dating status.",How to Tell Someone They're Moving Too Fast2," You and your partner may have already engaged in significantly intimate behavior. However, you now no longer desire to continue intimate engagement at that level. Recognize that you have the right to have a change of heart; past intimacy does not give your partner the right to expect or demand that you continue doing so.


If your partner tries to pressure you into continuing to be physically intimate because of his or her needs, remember the importance of not to putting someone else’s needs over your own. Doing so only benefits your partner and not you., Your partner is likely to be disappointed to learn that the two of you won’t be physically intimate. Provide your partner the opportunity to share how they feel. Try to listen with compassion to demonstrate that their feelings are valid. However, be sure you are honest about your needs and the reasons of what led to your decision.


For example, perhaps you’ve now decided that you want to hold off on having sex until you are engaged. You could say, “I’ve done some thinking about our relationship, and even though I’ve enjoyed having sex with you, I recognize that it no longer feels like the right thing for me to do until we’re in a more serious relationship.”

, Sexual intimacy has a broad definition and extends beyond just sexual intercourse. What you and someone else considers to be acceptable and unacceptable levels of sexual intimacy can be very different.Make sure you are clear with your partner on the type of intimacy you are currently comfortable with.


Are you comfortable with just kissing and hugging, or are you willing to engage in even more intimate behavior without going all the way? Communicate this openly with your partner. For example, you might say, “I really enjoy cuddling with you when we are on the couch. I want us to continue doing that.”

, Intimacy in a relationship isn’t just sexual. Relationships are also made up of emotional, experiential, and intellectual intimacy. Be sure to communicate your intimacy desires in these areas as well.Let your partner know how important it is for the two of you to share your innermost thoughts and feelings. Tell him or her how often you would like to enjoy various dating experiences together like bike riding, going to the movies, etc. Assure your partner that you enjoy when the two of you discuss your ideas and values about life and other topics of interest., Over the past three or four decades, the term “Defining the Relationship” or DTR has grown popular.Oftentimes when someone slows down a relationship, it can create confusion about the relationship status. You can clear up any potential confusion for you and your partner by clearly defining your relationship.


Ask your partner, “Are we just friends, or are we something more? Are we dating exclusively, or are we free to see others? How committed are we to each other?”"
"
Avoid never-ending irritation and frustration.,
Recognize when you’ve reached a dead end.,
Don’t second-guess yourself.",How to Tell Someone They're Moving Too Fast3," Sometimes a partner can have a difficult time accepting that a relationship is slowing down. As a result, his or her dissatisfaction with your decision causes them to exhibit less than acceptable behavior, such as pressuring you to move things forward more quickly. When this behavior becomes more than you are comfortable dealing with, it might be best to end the relationship.


If this happens, tell your partner, “I know my decision to slow things down has been hard for you. I was hoping that you would give me the time that I needed, but unfortunately you can’t. I think it’s best that we end things.”

, If your decision to slow things down in your relationship has left you feeling like the two of you can’t possibly move forward, then it’s time to end it. If the excitement and energy in your relationship is gone now, there’s a good chance that it won’t return. The sooner you can end a relationship that is head in the wrong direction, the quicker the two of you can move on., You have to remain true to yourself. Accept that it’s okay to slow things down. Don’t allow the other person to prematurely convince you to speed things up before you’re ready. It is unhealthy to second-guess yourself when it goes against your sound reasoning and judgement."
"
Pay attention to red flags.,
Recognize the potential blamer.,
Keep an eye out for feelings of entitlement.,
Avoid partner with inflated egos.,
Lessen the chances of becoming a victim of sexual assault.",How to Tell Someone They're Moving Too Fast4," People tend to show you the very best of themselves during the early stages of a relationship. Chances are that your new partner isn’t going exhibit behavior towards you that reveals his or her tendency to blame others, to have a sense of entitlement, or view themselves as superior. However, you’ll have a better chance of observing the individual exhibit or communicate this type of behavior with others.Pay attention because if you don’t, you’ll probably be next.

, The blaming partner makes it appear that others are at fault for the negative feelings and misfortune. You’ll find yourself thinking that you are awesome compared to the other folks they’ve dated in the past.For example, your partner might say, “My last boyfriend was such a downer. We could never have an enjoyable outing. I’m so glad you’re not like them.”

, A partner with a sense of entitlement might make a statement such as, “With all that money I spent on my ex girlfriend on all those expensive dates, I deserved to have sex any time that I wanted it!”


Be aware that you will likely suffer emotional abuse from an entitled individual because they view their needs and desires to be more important than yours.

, A partner with a sense of superiority has the potential of being an emotionally abusive partner. They gain their feelings of superiority by making others appear to be inferior.For example, to show their superiority over a coworker, they might say, “He doesn’t deserve that promotion. He only attended some little university that know one ever even heard of. I graduated from an ivy league college, for goodness sakes.”

, Date rape occurs when the assailant and victim are familiar with each other in some way. There’s a very small number of men who commit the majority of date rapes. Typically, these men target women when they are most vulnerable, such as under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or when they are alone.When you are on a date, avoid drinking to the point of intoxication or being under the influence of drugs. It is best to never leave your drinks unattended to prevent your drink from being spiked with roofies, commonly referred to as date rape drugs.
Trust your instincts. Your instincts are there to protect you, so don’t ignore them. If you are uncomfortable about the place your partner is taking you or the way your partner is acting or behaving, get out of the situation. If you are in a secluded area, try and move to a place with other people, or call someone who can come and pick you up."
"
Avoid focusing on events from the past.,
Talk about what is happening now.,
Understand that you are active not passive.",How to Use Respeak in Your Relationship2," A major aspect of respeak is to always be present and live in the moment. Try and avoid discussing past events with your partner as a way to prove a point. Instead, focus solely on what is happening in the present because you are actually able to control and influence the present.For example, if your partner forgot to empty the dishwasher last week do not bring this up when you are discussing that they forgot to empty the dishwasher again this week. The event that took place in the past can not be changed.

, Even when you do think or speak about the past or future, understand that the emotions that you are experiencing are happening in the present and influence the way you feel in the present. For example, you may think, ""Tomorrow is going to be an exciting day.” Using respeak you would change that thought to, “I excite myself thinking about tomorrow.”Alternatively you may say, “I have a troubled past.” This can be changed to, “I trouble myself with thoughts of the past.” By changing the wording you are refocusing your thoughts on the present.
This strategy can be very effective if you are having trouble ruminating on the past.

, People often use language that portrays themselves as passive victims. This happens all of the time in relationships. For example, you may say, “My partner frustrates me.” In this case, you are passive and your partner is acting upon you. Instead, you should say, “I frustrate myself with my partner.” By making this adjustment you become an active participant in your own experiences.Once you begin to think this way, you realize that you can modify your own actions, either by changing them or stopping them all together. You cannot change anyone but yourself, so it's important to focus on your own behaviors in a relationship and not your partner's.

, When you tell your partner about your addiction, she may not have the best reaction. Before you tell your partner, prepare yourself for both positive and negative reactions. Your addictive disorder will affect you both, so be compassionate about any reaction your partner may have.


Prepare yourself for the possibility that your partner may not want to work with your at first. Be strong in your devotion to your recovery and be ready to discuss these efforts with your partner."
"
Pick the right time and place.,
Explain exactly what your addictive disorder entails.,
Avoid blaming your partner.,
Let your partner talk.,
Apologize for any harm you've caused.,
Explain your treatment plan.",How to Tell Your Partner About Your Addictive Disorder2," Telling your partner about your addictive disorder is not going to be an easy process. To make this process run smoother, you need to make sure that you tell your partner at the right time and place. Don't choose a public place where you can be interrupted. It will likely not be comfortable talking about such a serious topic in public.


You want to make sure you tell your partner when you both have time to discuss it. Don't tell your partner when either of you need to be somewhere, go to work, or are busy. You want to make sure you have plenty of time to devote to your talk., Depending on what addictive disorder your have, you will have different symptoms, needs, triggers, and recovery plans. When you tell your partner, you should explain what you are addicted to, what that means for your life, and how it affects both your lives.


Make sure you are honest with your partner about your addictive disorder and everything that you are dealing with. You want to start the recovery and healing process with all the information.For example, tell your partner, ""I am addicted to gambling. This means that I have a problem stopping myself from betting and other gambling related behaviors.""

, When you disclose your addictive disorder to your partner, don't throw around blame. You don't want to start your recovery process with resentment and anger, so don't blame your partner for your problems. You are telling your partner about your addictive disorder so you can move forward, so let any past resentments go and more forward from where you are.


Even if you feel part of what made you turn to addiction is your relationship, this is not the time to play the blame game. You need to start building a new stage in your relationship post-addiction.Tell your partner, ""I am addicted to porn. This does not mean that you have done something wrong or that I don't feel attracted to you. It is not your fault that I have this problem.""

, When you tell your partner, he will likely have a lot of questions and concerns about what it all means. Listen to your partner's fears, concerns, and questions. Take in what your partner is saying and truly try to understand where he is coming from.


Answer the questions and concerns that you can and work with your partner to figure out a plan for the rest., When you have an addictive disorder, it is likely that you have hurt those around you at some point because of it. Talk to your partner about how your addiction may have harmed her and apologize for the hurt and distrust it has caused.


Don't shy away from things you have done just because it is uncomfortable. Getting it all out in the open early in your recovery process will help you and your partner heal.
This will be hard, but it will help let your partner and you move forward with your relationship.Tell your partner, ""I am sorry for the harm my addiction has caused you. If anything I have done in pursuit of my addiction has hurt you, I am sorry for those actions and will strive not to do anything else to hurt you in the future.""

, When you tell your partner about your addictive disorder, explain what steps you are taking for treatment. You want your partner to know what you are doing to get better and move past your addiction into a health life.


This will likely be a combination of therapy, lifestyle changes, and support groups; however, depending on your particular kind of addiction, you may also be on medication for your addictive disorder.
Tell your partner, ""I have looked into a recovery plan and am seeing a therapist. I am not longer taking part in my addiction and have devoted myself to my recovery.""

Offer to seek professional help with your partner.,
Explain your triggers.,
Ask if you can use her for help.,
Suggest your partner finds a support group.",How to Tell Your Partner About Your Addictive Disorder3," The road to recovery may require you to go to some couples therapy to help your relationship. There will likely be some unresolved issues that you and your partner need to work out. If you can't work them out on your own, seek a professional counselor or therapist to help with your relationship.


This will show your partner that you are willing to do everything you can to repair your relationship., There may be certain situations, places, or substances that trigger your addiction. This will vary from person to person, but these are the things that may cause you to relapse into your addiction. Talk to your partner about what these triggers are, how you've taken efforts to get triggers out of your life, and how he can help you avoid them.


Explain why these things are your triggers. If your partner understands why these things trigger you, he may be more willing to help you avoid them.
For example, if you have a substance abuse problem, having alcohol in the house may be a problem. You may also need to avoid bars or clubs.Tell your partner, ""I know you like to have wine with dinner, but this isn't an option for me right now. I cannot have these things in the house because they will tempt me to relapse.""

, When you are working through addictive disorders, you will need as much help as you can get to avoid a relapse, especially at first. Ask your partner if you can rely on her to be someone you can call when you need help avoiding relapse.


You may have a sponsor that will help you with this, but it is nice to have someone you love and trust to help you as well. The more help you have, the greater chance of beating your addiction.
Since your partner will be with you more often than other people, she will be a constant person for support.
Having someone you are accountable to that you love and respect can also make fighting your addiction easier.Ask your partner, ""If I find myself on the edge of a relapse or in the need of extra support, can I call, text, or come find you to talk me through it?""

, There are many support groups specifically for families and partners of those with addiction. Tell your partner about these groups so he can seek support from people who are going through the same thing.


These organizations will also help your loved one learn about what it is like to have an addictive disorder and how he can help you cope and recover. It will also help your partner take care of himself and his needs while helping you, too.
There may be local organizations in your area for your partner. You can also look for a local chapter of SMART Recovery for family and friends of those with addictive disorders.

Be aware of your moods.,
Keep a journal.,
Evaluate your energy levels.,
Think about whether your habits have changed.,
Notice whether certain situations bring you down more than others.,
Pay attention to your daydreams.",How to Tell if Your Relationship Makes You Depressed1," Notice how you feel throughout the day. Do some situations make you feel cheerful and energetic, or do you feel down much of the time?Depression can creep up on you slowly, so it’s important to be aware of whether your overall mood has changed over time.
Know that depression doesn’t necessarily involve feeling sad. Many people with depression feel empty, guilty, or irritable.;
, Explore your thoughts and emotions by writing in a journal on a regular basis. Pay attention to any topics or feelings that you find yourself returning to frequently.Keeping a journal can help you notice how your moods are related to the events in your life.

, Ask yourself whether you have a hard time getting up in the morning or if you just can’t seem to focus on work or school anymore. For many people, a constant feeling of physical or mental fatigue is one of the defining characteristics of depression.If you feel tired all the time, visit a doctor to rule out any physical causes.

, Ask yourself if anything has changed in your personal life or social life lately. Big shake-ups in your everyday routine, your social habits, or your health habits could signal that depression is affecting you.For instance, if you’ve stopped exercising and seeing your friends, it may be a red flag for depression.
Of course, there are many reasons why aspects of your life might change over time. If there’s no obvious reason for the change, though, a mood disorder might be involved.

, Pay attention if you dread going to a certain place or if your mood takes a nosedive whenever you’re with a certain person. Even if you don’t know why a situation makes you feel negative, your intuition is trying to warn you about it.For instance, if you feel fine at work but dislike going back home to your partner, your relationship is probably unhealthy in some way.

, The subconscious mind often communicates through daydreams, so if you find yourself thinking about a certain scenario frequently, ask yourself what it means. If you frequently fantasize about escaping to a different life, it’s a sure sign that something in your real life needs to change. For instance, if you often think about what life would be like if you weren’t with your partner, you might subconsciously want to break up.

Consider whether you're still sneaking looks at your ex's social media account.,
Talk to someone you trust.,
Write in your journal or in a notebook.,
See your ex again.,
Give it time.",How to Work Out if You Still Love Your Ex," If so, is this because you're curious what he or she is up to or you're longing for a sight of his or her face again? If it's just because you want to feel superior, that's not love but if it's because you still wish to see the person again, it's possible that you still feel some love for your ex.

You might also be wanting to see whether your ex makes any mention of you on the account. However, this can lead to you feeling more confused, and is not a good reason to be checking your ex's social media accounts.;
, This might be a parent, a friend or even a counselor. Explain how you are still feeling about your ex and ask for their opinion on whether or not these feelings seem like love or something else, such as confusion, despair or an unwillingness to let go. It can help to have someone else as a sounding board, as your own emotions are probably very mixed up., Write out all the feelings that you have. Continue writing about this in the coming week, each day teasing apart your feelings and letting the writing take you to conclusions that you feel sum up what you're truly feeling. By the end of the week, you may find that the writing exercise has helped to clarify your feelings and will help you to determine whether or not you are still experiencing love towards your ex., This is risky because you might feel a range of emotions, and not just love. You could feel angry, confused, disappointed and vexed to see your ex again. However, if you have spent some time apart from one another, it might also help you to clarify whether or not you still feel love, or whether it's truly over and done with., Best of all is to not over-question your feelings but to let things unfold as they will. Time heals and gives a good sense of perspective. It is important to give yourself the space to heal, regather your senses and really be able to get a handle on what has happened, rather than assuming that you're still in love."
"
Ask yourself why you want to talk to your ex.,
Avoid contacting your ex just to complain.,
Be honest.,
Do not send the wrong message.,
Avoid using your ex as an emotional crutch.,
Remember why you broke up.",How to Talk to Ex1," There may be a number of reasons why you feel you want or need to talk your ex. And there are multiple perspectives to consider. Are you trying to talk to your ex because up until now you haven’t remained in touch? Or have you tried to remain friends, and now you want to talk to them about getting more distance? Do you have to talk to your ex because children are involved? Think about your reasons for a little while to ensure it is truly what you want to do., While the relationship may have ended, there must have been something good about it at some point. Continuing to bring up wounds and complaints will not help solve problems, and it does not help the relationship between you if you’re trying to remain friends.If you have children with your ex, consider the effect of complaining on them, as well. You don’t want to make your children feel like their parent is a terrible person by constantly complaining.

, Don’t beat around the bush. If there is something important you want or need to say to your ex, try not to be too subtle about it. Don’t use hints or passive remarks, be clear and honest. Explain any potential boundaries you need (e.g., texting/no texting, emails/no emails, etc.)., Are you possibly looking for a casual relationship only involving sex? While your ex could potentially be a good candidate, there is also a possibility that they still harbor romantic feelings for you. Attempting to start a new type of relationship with your ex, without setting up very clear expectations, may only lead to additional heartbreak., It’s easy to rely on the familiar when you’re having a moment of loneliness or despair. You may think your ex might be the best way to make you feel better. However, you must be careful to avoid relying on your ex as an emotional crutch. Reach out to other friends and sources of support too., Regardless of what your decision ends up being (to talk to, or not to talk to, your ex) remember there was a reason you broke up in the first place. If you’re thinking there might be a way to make things work, be realistic. One more date isn’t suddenly going to make your ex a new person. And promises from either side to change are most likely empty."

Watch for friendly and consistent communication.,
Watch for inconsistent or disrespectful communication.,
Notice body language.,
Assess the frequency of your “run-ins” or times you hang out.,
Consider any gifts that have been given.,
Pay attention to their social media.,
Ask your mutual friends.,
Pay attention to signs of flirting.",How to Tell if Your Ex Still Cares1," After a breakup, friendly communication means that your relationship is still positive. This means that there is a chance that they still hold a flame for you and want to remain involved in your life. Some signs of their possible interest are:


Frequent “hello's” and “hi’s” even if you’ve already seen them once that day. These little greetings can mean that they still want to talk to you, but are too nervous and unsure to take further steps.
Reaching out to check in via phone or text often.
Commenting or liking your social media posts regularly.
Sending you pictures of themselves having fun, looking attractive, or doing something you would enjoy.;
, In comparison to communication that is positive, watch out for exes who stalk, manipulate, or frighten you. If you ex refuses to take no for an answer, then the feelings they have are not ones of love, but of obsession and control. Watch out and stay away from exes who don’t respect your space.


Also, if you have an ex who only contacts you once every few months or only after they’ve ended a relationship, then they likely do not care for you and are only seeking attention.

, An ex who wants to get back together will often try to be close to you when they do see you. They might hug you, kiss your check or display other types of physical affection to show that they care. If they are still very emotional about the breakup, they might also look down, avoid eye contact or even cry.Their feelings may show in their actions. They might laugh louder, smile a bit too much, or their voice might be higher pitched. These are signs, sometimes called micro-expressions, that they may still have feelings that they now can't control or are trying to hold back., If your ex tries to schedule get-togethers or makes an effort to frequent the places you frequent, they are trying to spend time with you. Maybe they’re trying to get your attention or perhaps they just enjoy and miss your presence. Run-ins may mean that they're looking for a chance to ask you about your feelings.Make particular note of the places you find them at that they never went to or enjoyed before you two dated.

, Your ex might continue to go out of their way to do nice things for you like sending you birthday gifts, Christmas cards, or gifts on special occasions. This is a sign that they still appreciate you and want to make you happy. For some, gifts are a way of showing love and affection. Your ex may be trying to show those feelings for you.

, If they post statuses about moving on, it may mean that they're trying to get over you, or convince themselves to do so. If they're posting more direct things like, ""missing my ex,"" this probably means that they really do miss you! Perhaps they wanted you to read that post so you would know their true feelings.


See if they have deleted all photos of the two of you. Getting rid of your shared memories is often a major indicator that they really do want to move on.

, Though you should not try to put your friends in the middle, you can ask them casually how your ex is doing lately, especially if you have not heard from them. They may tell you if your ex cares. However, if your friends don’t want to share, don’t force them.


Say something like “I was at the library the other day and I remembered the time that Dave and I went. How is he doing lately?”
If you are very close to them, then you can be blunt. Say “Do you think Dave still has feelings for me?”

, Your ex might be hinting at the fact that they still care very coyly or they might be very direct with you. Notice signs that your ex is flirting include touching you often, complimenting you, winking, or using pickup lines. If they display these actions and are communicating with you regularly and being kind to you, then they might still have feelings.If your ex is not particularly flirtatious, this could be an even bigger sign that they still care.

Consider how often you and your partner do something new together.,
Look to the future.,
Check your libido.,
Talk to your partner about any concerns you have.,
Recognize the signs of an unhealthy relationship.,
Attend couples counseling.,
Know when it's time to end the relationship.",How to Tell if Your Relationship Makes You Depressed2," If your partner criticizes or belittles you frequently, you might suffer from lowered self-esteem and depression. In a healthy relationship, both partners encourage one another and respect each other’s feelings.For instance, if your girlfriend makes fun of your job and never talks to you before making decisions that affect both of you, you’re likely to become depressed in your relationship.

, Ask yourself whether your partner loves and accepts you the way you are, or if you have to pretend to be someone you’re not around them. A relationship that robs you of your identity can contribute to the development of depression.If your partner expects you to watch the same shows, listen to the same music, and share the same opinions as them, it may be time to re-evaluate whether your relationship is good for you.

, Do you and your partner go new places, try new things, and make new memories on a regular basis? A stagnating relationship with no room for growth can make you miserable.One sign of a stagnant relationship is that you and your partner no longer have anything to talk about.

, Compare your goals for the future with your partner’s and consider whether your plans are compatible. If they’re not, or if you and your partner never get around to talking about the future at all, your relationship might be negatively impacting your happiness.For instance, if you want to move in together and your partner doesn’t, you might become depressed about the relationship.

, Look back over the last few months and assess whether or not your or your partner's interest in sex has decreased. Loss of libido is a sign of depression and can have a major effect on your relationship. In addition, some depression medications can cause you to lose interest in sex.If something is up with your sex life (loss of interest in sex, loss of pleasure, or taking longer to climax), it may be a sign of depression.


On top of that, sexual difficulties within the relationship may cause you to feel depressed — if your partner is depressed and not interested in sex, for instance, you may feel as though they no longer desire you. This can put a serious strain on the relationship and your emotional wellbeing.

, If you’re worried about an aspect of your relationship, bring it up with your partner. Explain your feelings and ask if they’re willing to help you resolve the issue. An honest discussion may put your mind at ease — or it may make you realize that you’d be happier if you moved on.Avoid making accusations or putting your partner on the defensive. Keep in mind that they might not perceive the problem the same way you do, or even realize you’re unhappy.
Adopt a constructive attitude. Focus on working together to find solutions, instead of just presenting your partner with a rundown of relationship problems.

, If your relationship is marked by codependency and/or abuse, it can be making you depressed without you being aware. It's important to know the signs of codependency or emotional abuse in relationships and get help.



Codependency basically describes one-sided relationships in which one partner constantly gives at the expense of self in order to fulfill the other partner. This may be marked by clinginess, emotional manipulation, the absence of boundaries, and poor self-esteem.Abuse in relationships doesn't have to involve physical assault. Emotional abuse is an often overlooked problem in relationships. It can be spotted by one partner persistently criticizing or belittling the other, failing to respect privacy or personal boundaries, being jealous of other relationships like close friendships, blocking productive communication and using guilt trips to get one's way.
If you notice signs of codependency and/or emotional abuse in your relationship, you should see a mental health therapist right away.
If you are in an abusive relationship and fear for your safety, reach out for help from friends and family. You can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or 1-800-787-3224, who will help you find support and a safe place to stay if necessary.

, If you and your partner are both committed to fixing the problems in your relationship, attend a few counseling sessions together. A counselor will help you work through your issues and learn to communicate with each other more effectively., If you are in an unhealthy relationship and there are no signs of things changing, or if you have tried counseling and it has not helped, then it may be time to end the relationship.

Talk to your partner about their mood.,
Look for other sources of stress in your life.,
Consider your family history.,
Notice whether your moods follow any patterns.,
See a therapist.",How to Tell if Your Relationship Makes You Depressed3," If you have determine that the relationship is not the root of your depression, then start thinking about what other aspects of your life might be contributing. Ask your partner how they’ve been feeling lately. If they haven’t been feeling or acting like their usual self, they might be depressed. Moods can sometimes be ""contagious,"" and if your partner is depressed, you could be picking it up from them — even if they try to hide it or don’t realize they have it.If your partner is depressed, encourage them to see a therapist.

, Any source of stress and unhappiness in your life can lead to depression. Rule out other possible causes before you assume your relationship is the problem.Depression can be caused by the death of a loved one, a major life change such as a move, chronic illness, or a personality disorder, among other things.

, There can be a genetic component to depression, meaning you may have inherited genes that predispose you to depression.Think about if you have a parent or sibling who suffers from depression — if you do, it is possible you are at higher risk for depression, even without an external cause. The good news is that your depression can still be treated with a combination of therapy, lifestyle changes, and/or medication. Speak to your doctor or therapist to work out a treatment plan.

, If your moods tend to cycle through regular highs and lows, you may be dealing with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), cyclothymia, or bipolar disorder. Visit your doctor to get a diagnosis and learn about treatment options.Severe PMS can cause depression-like symptoms as well.

, A therapist can help you figure out where your depression is coming from and how to deal with it. If you’re having doubts about your relationship, a therapist can also help you figure out whether breaking up is the right choice for you."

Put out feelers.,
Suggest something to do.,
Do something kind and thoughtful.,
Be clear about your intentions.,
Prepare yourself for a negative reaction.",How to Talk to Ex2," It might have been a long time since you last spoke to your ex. A lot of things may have changed for them, and you. Consider starting small, possibly via social media. Write your ex a direct message or email and mention the positive things that have happened to you since you last spoke. Try not to over do it; keep it small, simple and friendly. Give your ex the opportunity to be friendly back., If your ex answered back and seems interested in talking further, suggest meeting up somewhere you both enjoyed and has positive memories. Provide more than one idea and ask them what they’d prefer.If your ex is unavailable to meet in person, or maybe doesn’t live nearby, arrange to chat on the phone. Ask them what days and times they are available and give them a call. Planning it in advance avoids the possibility of not connecting due to busy schedules.For example, was there a specific coffee shop or restaurant you hung out at a lot with your ex that only has positive memories? Or maybe a park or bakery that has no history with you and your ex? Pick a location like this for a first meeting so that nothing about the location hinders your relationship moving forward.
If you and your ex tend to have a conflictual relationship but need to meet and talk, for example about your children, a public place can help encourage both of you to stay in control of your emotions.
Skype is an excellent way to stay in touch via long distances (or even short distances for that matter) that is inexpensive and easy. As long as both parties have a computer or tablet plus an internet connection, you’ll be able to use Skype. The nice thing about Skype is that you do not have to use the camera if you don’t want to.

, If you want to continue being friends with your ex, a thoughtful gesture can encourage them to think positively of you. Exactly what kind and thoughtful thing you do will be up to you, but it should be based on your personality and what you feel comfortable doing. Don’t go overboard and make your ex uncomfortable, but think of something that they would appreciate and enjoy. One option is to show that you remember something specific thing about them (e.g., a love for a certain chocolate bar only available in one store, a passion for a specific type of tea, etc.) which can show your ex you haven’t forgotten the good times.For example, maybe your ex really liked a specific craft beer only found in a few locations, or maybe they collect something like figurines or snow globes. Something inexpensive, simple, yet thoughtful like this would be a nice gesture to show you still remember many great things about your ex.

, You’ve initiated this contact for a reason. You’ve decided you want to form some type of relationship with your ex. Make sure you understand exactly what it is you want, and make that clear to your ex. If you’re only looking to be friends, make sure that is understood. If you’re looking to get back together, say so. If you do not want to contact your ex except when you have to discuss matters such as your children, let your ex know that too. Chances are your ex is wondering what you want, and may catch you off guard by asking. Be prepared with an answer.The best way to be clear about your own intentions is to have a goal. Determine exactly what it is that you want from your ex, and stick to that. If you want to get back together, be clear about that right up front. If you simply want to be friends, make sure your ex understands that right away. And if your ex asks you to settle for less than what you want, seriously consider walking away.

, Remember that there was a reason you broke up. Your ex may have experienced emotions from your break up that you never knew about or understood. You have to prepare yourself that your ex may react negatively to whatever you’re suggesting, even if you have nothing but good intentions. Don’t turn the rejection into a scene, and don’t do or say something you might regret later. Before you meet or talk to your ex, think about all the possible ways they may react -- both good and bad. Think about the reasons why your ex might have each of those reactions. Prepare your response to these possible reactions (in general) so you’re not taken by surprise when and if they actually happen.

"
Consider your personal communication style.,
Remember to be an active listener.,
Leave the avenues of communication open.,
Speak in the language of ‘I’.,
Do not turn the conversation into an argument.,
Examine the origins of your feelings.,
Be open, honest and respectful.",How to Talk to Ex3," Everyone has a slight different style in the way they communicate. Those styles may affect how your ex will understand what you’re saying. If you have a better understanding of your personal way of communicating, you can gain a better understanding of how you may be interpreted. This could help avoid confusion and conflict, but it might also help you alter your style if you know your ex won’t react well to your typical style.For example, if you are normally someone who comes across as very direct, but you know your ex scares easily, you may want to tone down how direct you are, at least at first.



Affiliative communicators tend to like collaboration. When they need to make a decision, they obtain multiple opinions from different people before coming to a conclusion. This means they are very likely to listen to what their partners suggest and take that opinion into consideration when making their decision.

Competitive communicators like power and dominance. They tend to make decisions on their own without collaboration. They’re likely to be assertive (but not necessarily aggressive), direct and will sometimes challenge others who may disagree with them.

Direct communicators are exactly that - direct. They say it like it is, and don’t beat around the bush. If they want something specific, they’ll tell you. If they don’t like something you’re doing, you’ll know. This directness allows this type of communicator to be understood pretty quickly. There is usually little confusion about what it is that they want. Sometimes direct communicators may come across as forceful or aggressive.

Indirect communicators have trouble telling others what they think, want, or need. They may make implications about things that they hope someone will understand by reading between the lines. There tends to be a lot more confusion and misunderstandings with this type of communication, but it may also seem less aggressive.

, Listening is a vital part of any communication. Being aware of what your ex is telling you (what they are saying AND what they mean) is referred to as active listening. Active listening is even more important when you think about all the distractions you are likely to encounter when you’re having a conversation. Your cell phone, honking cars, TVs, arguing people, etc., all have a way of taking your attention away from your ex and directing that attention elsewhere. There are many specific things you can do to train yourself to be a better active listener.Restate and summarize what you’ve just been told. Feel free to restate it using words that might make the meaning clearer and simpler. By restating and summarizing what you’ve heard, your ex not only knows you were paying attention, they will know whether you actually understood what they were trying to get across.

For example, you could say: “I’m hearing you say that you want to take the children every other weekend, instead of every weekend. Is that right?”


Don’t interrupt. If your ex is trying to get something across, pay attention by looking them in the eye, and nodding your head or saying small things to encourage your ex to continue. Let them get whatever they're trying to say out without forcing them to stop and lose the train of thought. This includes being silent when the other person is thinking or when they are trying to come up with the proper words to use.
Ask questions. If you don’t understand something, or you need clarification, ask. If you feel your ex has only touched on the surface of a specific thought or feeling, ask questions to get them to go into more detail.

Try to keep these questions open-ended, rather than accusative. For example: “How do you see us interacting in the future?”


Validate your ex's emotions. Be empathetic to what they’re saying. If it sounds like a situation they’re talking about was really frustrating, tell them it sounds like they’re really frustrated. Say things that make them feel good about opening up to you. If they’ve just told you something that was obviously very difficult for them to get out, thank them for sharing it with you.

, Be careful that the combination of your communication style and active listening techniques doesn’t undermine what your ex is trying to tell you. This is especially important if one of the reasons you broke up with your ex was due to the lack of, or bad, communication. If the communication styles being used previously didn’t work, you need to try something new this time around or you won’t be able to move forward. There are several things that are helpful to remember not to do when having a conversation with your ex.Don’t ask too many questions that start with why - especially if the question starts like “why didn’t you …” Asking these types of questions tend to simply make people defensive, and you could end up starting an argument.
Don’t diminish your ex’s feelings by saying they shouldn’t worry about something, or that they shouldn’t let something bother them. You’re not the judge of what can or cannot bother or worry another person. They have a right to worry or be bothered about something.
If you start asking clarifying questions or questions to help your ex explain something in more detail, but they seem really hesitant to do so, stop. Don’t push them into saying something they don’t want to. If they want to tell you something, they’ll tell you when they're ready.
Don’t assume you know how your ex feels. This includes telling them a story about your life for every story they tell you about theirs. If they tell you about a time when they were really upset because something happened, don’t turn it into a story about you and a time you were once really upset.

, If you’re trying to explain how you feel (or felt) to you ex, don’t turn it into a blame session where you’re just listing all the things they did that upset you - “You always ignored me,” “You never wanted to spend time with me,” or “You always wanted to spend time with your other friends.” Instead make sure you use ‘I’ in every sentence - “I felt like I was being ignored,” “I was upset when I didn’t get to spend much time with you,” or “I sometimes felt like I was being left out.”The same examples also try not to exaggerate what really happened by using words like “always” or “never.”

, You don’t have to always be right. And your ex doesn’t always have to agree with you, or you with them. The point of this conversation isn’t to have an argument or a debate where someone has to win. It’s to have an intelligent and positive conversation about an important topic you need to speak to your ex about. There are no winners or losers.This doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to have emotions about how your ex feels or what your ex thinks. You can still feel annoyed or frustrated with something they do or say. Try not to act out with those emotions without some thought first. Take a moment to contemplate why your ex did or said something and ask yourself if maybe it was justified.

, You and your ex are human. You both will have emotions at times that are uncomfortable, but it doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to have them. It isn’t wrong to have a thought or emotion, but it is important to try to recognize when you may be projecting your emotions onto others and admit it. You might even have a perfectly reasonable explanation as to why you sometimes have such thoughts or feelings, possibly due to your past experiences.For example, if you’ve dated people who have cheated on you in the past, and one way they lied to you was to say they were working late at the office, you might think irrationally if your partner tells you they have to work late at the office. Take the time to explain this to your partner. Explain where that thinking comes from, and that you realize they’ve done nothing to lose their trust, but you still have these thoughts anyway because of your past experiences.
Sometimes, feelings and thoughts may be irrational. For example, you may be jealous that your ex has a new partner, even though you don’t want to get back into a relationship with them yourself. Your feelings may just be because your ex means a lot to you. It’s okay to have these feelings and thoughts too.

, Since you’re having this conversation because you have a specific goal you need to accomplish with your ex, you need to be as clear, concise and honest as possible, as soon as possible. Explain what it is that you want - from your ex and your relationship. Explain what you’re hoping will come from this conversation. Explain why you feel this way. Accept that you have needs and wishes, and that that is perfectly okay.


Remain understanding and honest even if your ex doesn’t treat you with respect. If they end up treating you badly, or saying something hurtful, remember you prepared for this. You can rise above this and you will be okay. There’s no point in lowering yourself to their level and being disrespectful back. You might end up regretting it later."
"
Make note of times they’ve said “I miss you.” Sometimes, your ex might say things that will directly indicate that they still care.,
Notice if they bring up old memories.,
See if they mention who they’re dating now.,
Make note of how often they ask about your love life.,
Notice their compliments.,
Notice if they apologize often.",How to Tell if Your Ex Still Cares2," If they are telling you that they miss you or miss being around you, this is a clear sign that they still have feelings for you., Exes who are still interested in you or who have feelings will also have a tendency to reminisce. By doing so, they are trying to get you to remember the good times that you had together in hopes that you might want to reconnect.Consider the times that they have brought up trips you went on, inside jokes that you shared, or just fun you had in general.

, An ex that still cares for you might try to make you jealous to see if you care, too. If they regularly talk about their dates or share details about their new significant other, it can be a clear sign that they still have feelings.Notice in particular the times that they bring up who they’re dating completely out of the blue. For instance, if you are talking about homework or your family and they randomly mention their new love interest, then they might be trying to make you jealous.
Remember also how they treated their exes. If they often flirted with and kept open communication with their exes, then perhaps they are just possessive and not really intent on getting back together.

, An ex that still has feelings for you might also try to keep tabs on who you’re dating. If they regularly ask you things like “So, who are you seeing now?” or say “Did you see that movie with someone you’re dating?”, they might still care for you.Make note also if they make jokes about who you date. They might be trying to tarnish that person’s image in your head so that you find them less desirable.
If your ex is shooting dark looks at people who flirt with you or trying to steal you away from spending time with others, this is a sign of possessiveness. They don’t want you to move on without them.

, If your ex compliments you, especially on your looks or on things they previously complimented you on during your relationship, it is possible that they are trying to get on your good side. They might also be trying to make you feel special or renew your shared past.

, An ex that still cares for you might have done a lot of soul searching about your relationship and have come to feel remorse. In order to get back in your good graces, they might be apologizing a lot more now than they did in your relationship. They may feel sorry for what they have done and hope that an apology will help you two reunite."

Be calm, clear, and casual.,
Choose a place where you will both be on comfortable, even ground.,
Be at your best.,
Tell your ex how you feel.,
Listen to their thoughts.,
Make peace with the outcome.",How to Tell if Your Ex Still Cares3," Ask, “Do you have some time to talk? Can we go somewhere private?” This may be a scary step that many people don’t want to take, but the best way to know how someone else feels is to get a straight answer from their mouth. You can find them and talk to them in-person, then and there, but it is probably best to negotiate a future time and place to meet. If you are nervous, use a non-invasive form of communication like a phone call, chat, or text to communicate your feelings.

, Choose to talk in an easy going public place, like a cafe or a park. Your ex may be nervous about sharing their feelings with you and worried that they are unrequited. Make them as comfortable as possible by talking in a quiet and neutral location.


Give yourself and your ex plenty of time to have a long talk. Avoid having the talk when you have a major assignment due or if you have a meeting soon.

, If you want to get your ex back, look your best during this talk. Wear your favorite outfit and style your hair nicely. You can use this time to both attract your ex and make yourself feel good, confident, and worthwhile.

, The more honest you are about your feelings, the more inclined they are to be honest about theirs. Tell them your feelings. Be calm and clear. Maybe say “I still have romantic feelings for you,” or “I still care about you, as more than a friend.”


Tell them if you're regretting the breakup and want to get back together again. Provide specific reasons like “I miss you because we had so much fun together” or “I really enjoyed being together. You made me feel such peace.”

, You may have a lot of pent up emotions that you want to let out, but remember that they might, too. Allow them to tell you how they feel. This will allow you to know definitively whether or not they still care or want to get back together.If they expressly say they want to leave the situation, let them go. Don’t try to control them or force them to talk about things they don’t want to discuss.

, If your ex still cares for you and you both decide to get back together, then move forward and create a stronger, more resilient relationship. Work out your previous issues to prevent them from cropping up again. However, if you determine that they no longer have feelings for you, this is okay, too. Move forward without them by learning to be alone, spending time with friends, and committing yourself to school or work. You can date again when you feel ready.

After you've had some time to process, ask your ex to meet you to talk.Make it clear you just want some closure. Make sure your ex does not feel intimidated or nervous about meeting up with you. Be courteous when you contact him.
For example, you could say something like, ""I'm just not dealing the best with the breakup. If you have time, I think talking things over would help. I could use some closure.""
If he refuses to talk about it with you, say something like, ""Okay, I understand that it might be hard for you to talk about this. Thank you for taking my call. I wish you the best."";
, This is important as the situation will be emotional. A neutral location will allow you to better keep your composure as you talk over the breakup.You should pick a place that's somewhat private. However, you don't want a location where either of you would feel uncomfortable. Having your ex over to your place may be weird, but a crowded restaurant would make conversation difficult. A quiet coffee shop would be a good in-between option.
Pick a location without any emotional attachment. Do not, for example, choose to meet in the coffee shop where the two of you had your first date.

, You do not want to go into this conversation with false hope. Even if you're missing your ex, remember that this is not a means to get back together.You may want your ex back for a variety of reasons. Seeing him may trigger certain feelings. You may think there's a slim chance the two of you will reconcile if you spend time together again.
Put these feelings out of your mind. Remind yourself that you're just gaining closure and perspective. You should also keep in mind this conversation will not cure all bad feelings. You will still experience sadness for the loss. You just may have a better understanding of why it happened.

, This will help set the tone for a positive conversation. Start off by expressing gratitude for the time you have had with your ex. You do not want to go into the conversation seeming combative or angry.You can start off by talking about your ex's positive qualities or your best memories of the relationship. Bring up what you valued and gained from the romance.
For example, ""I really appreciate the time we spent together. You were always very kind and loving to me, and I will always know how I deserve to be treated in the future.""

, Once the two of you have shared good memories, you can ask about the breakup. Try not to sound angry or resentful. Just politely ask your ex to give you an explanation.Do not start off with something like, ""What did I do wrong?"" or ""What's wrong with me?"" Instead, phrase things in a calm and mature fashion.
For example, you can say something like, ""I'm just having a hard time dealing. I was wondering if you could tell me what could have been better about our relationship. Knowing why things ended would help me move forward.""

, You do not want to end things in an awkward place, especially if you want to remain friends with your ex. After the talk, try to leave the situation in a manner that allows you both to feel positive.Thank your ex for taking the time to talk to you. Leave the door open for future communication. Say something like, ""If you ever want to get together again, let me know.""
If you feel comfortable, try giving your ex a quick hug goodbye.

, Choose an empathetic friend who is a good listener. Say you need to vent about the breakup. Have this friend listen as you reflect on the breakup.Make sure you select a friend who is a good listener. A friend who tends to interrupt, or give advice, is not the best option.
Self-reflection can help you understand the loss. As you go over the relationship with a friend, you may begin to see what went wrong. You can process the information out loud, which can allow you to see something you missed before.
Let your friend know exactly what you need from them. Whether it's a shoulder to cry on, someone to bring you out for a good time, or a fellow person to be angry with, your friend should know what you want from them.
For example, you could say, ""Thanks for listening to me, Jen. I know I've talked a lot about this breakup with you, and I really appreciate that you're taking the time to listen. I need to talk this through again to help me understand what happened.""

, As with talking, writing is a great form of self reflection. Try writing down your thoughts in a journal. You can also write a letter to your ex you do not intend to send. Here, you can talk about your confusion and sadness over the breakup.You can express anything you wanted to say to your ex but could not. Talk about what you loved about the relationship, but also what was frustrating. Do not censor yourself. Just let your thoughts unfold.
You may gain some insight through writing. As you write about the relationship, you may have a realization about why it ended. You may, for example, start to see you and your ex were very different as you write things down.

, This can help you gain insight. During a period of self reflection, ask yourself hard questions about the relationship. The answers to these questions may help you understand why things ended.Were you and your ex really right for one another? Think about whether you were compatible long term. Did you have different interests and goals? Were you personalities always compatible?
Were the two of you really in love? Love does fade over time. It's possible the passion had drained from the relationship.
Were there any differences you missed before? Some differences and disagreements are hard to reconcile.

, It's not always possible to understand why a relationship ended. Human beings are complicated. You may not get an understandable answer, even if you were able to speak to your ex.Try to come to terms with the fact there will always be confusion surrounding a breakup. Even if your ex were to explain, there's a chance you would not understand or accept his explanation.
Remember, you can heal from the breakup without closure. While it can be helpful to know why things ended, it is not necessary to move forward.
Ask yourself if knowing why it ended will make it hurt any less.

, If a relationship ended, there's a good chance something just wasn't working. Go back through the course of your relationship and think about the signs of trouble.Did you two fight frequently? If so, you may just have not been compatible. While fighting is a normal part of any relationship, when you're fighting more than you have fun, that's a sign something is wrong.
Did any of your feelings change during the relationship? Feelings may have faded. Even if you wanted to stay in the relationship, you may have been aware feelings were waning. This is a sign the relationship was coming to an end.

, Go over your biggest arguments. What were you disagreeing about? Sometimes, there are differences that just cannot be reconciled. Unfortunately, sometimes a relationship cannot be saved.Trust issues often tank a relationship. Was there infidelity at any point or even flirtation outside of the relationship?
Maybe you two were just different people. Maybe you were more social than your boyfriend. He wanted to stay home a lot, while you wanted to go out with your friends on weekends.

, Some people get anxiety over committing to a relationship. A person with a phobia of commitment may be unable to differentiate between feelings of excitement at the beginning of a relationship and discomfort or anxiety.People who fear commitment long for the connection of a romantic relationship. However, when they begin to feel close and comfortable with someone, they get nervous. They may end things just as they begin to get serious.
Look at your boyfriend's past. Has he had a lot of other girlfriends? How long did these relationships last? If your boyfriend has a habit of getting involved fast and then breaking things off, this is a sign he has commitment issues.

, Not everyone is mature enough for a romantic relationship. This is especially true if you and your boyfriend are very young. Think about whether your boyfriend actually seemed ready for a romance.When you're young, dating is about learning about yourself and exploring new experiences. If you and your boyfriend are still in middle school or high school, it's possible he wasn't ready for a long term commitment. Maybe your ex-boyfriend values you as a person, but he simply wants to explore other things.

, In the aftermath of a breakup, you may feel inclined to hide your feelings. No one likes dealing with feelings of sadness, but it's best to allow yourself to grieve.Acknowledge your emotions. It's okay to feel angry, resentful, sad, or confused. Even if you don't like what you're feeling, embrace it.
You may want to find ways to let your emotions out. You could watch a sad movie or read a sad book. You could also vent to a friend or family member about what you're feeling.

, You cannot expect you're going to get over the breakup in a matter of days. It's okay to feel sad, confused, and angry. Time and distance are vital to healing.Cut yourself some slack. Do not feel like you should be over it by now, or that there's something wrong with you for not bouncing back quickly. Breakups are hard, and it's okay to take your time.
There is no set timeline for you to feel better. Everyone grieves at their own pace. Don't feel like you have to be over it by a specific deadline.

, This can help keep you busy and allow you to better cope with your emotions. You could try taking up an old hobby or start up something new.If there's any form of physical activity you enjoy, try getting active. Exercise can help regulate your mood.

, You may be tempted to feel bitter, especially if your ex broke up with you. However, fostering feelings of resentment is unlikely to help you heal. Instead, try to practice gratitude.Do not sit around thinking negative thoughts about your ex. Do not pick at his flaws or wish him bad things.
Instead, appreciate the time you had. Most romantic relationships do not work out in the long run, but they're an important learning experience. Even if this romance did not work out, there will more in the future.

If you suddenly feel deeply, let it out—you will feel better after. However, it is important to remember not to let these emotions dictate your life. If you feel sad, dive into that emotion, let it out, and then move on. Trying to numb yourself to the pain or holding your emotions in can cause your heartbreak to remain with you for much longer—and can cause unnecessary levels of stress.This also goes for crying. If you are overcome with the urge to cry, do not try to bottle it up. Of course, there are certain times when crying might make a situation pretty uncomfortable (like when you’re at work, in class, in line at the grocery store, etc.) During those situations, its always good to to keep some tricks up your sleeve to keep yourself from crying outright.
;
, When you experience a breakup, you may feel like everyone is out to hurt you or that the world is a dark, unfriendly place. Its important to remember that its not--there are many people who love you and many beautiful things to experience in the world. To rid yourself of negative thoughts, focus on things you love and surround yourself with people and things that make you happy. Meditation can be an excellent way to dispel negative thoughts.


If you begin to feel yourself falling into a negative headspace, divert yourself by doing something distracting and calming. Go for a walk a get some fresh air, call up your best friend to find out how her day is going, or plan out a project you want to take on.

, It can really help to put your feelings into words. Talk to a family member, friend, or therapist about what you are going through. Chances are, an outside observer will be able to help you sort out your feelings and come up with a game plan for how to face this broken heart head on.

, When someone you trust, like your ex, suddenly hurts you it can make you begin to question your worth. Don’t let yourself go down this path--you are worth a whole lot. Remind yourself of your strengths and things that you are good at or take pleasure it. Focus your energy into things that make you feel good about yourself. Finish that mixed media piece you’ve been working on, read a great book, or start training for a marathon. These things will help you to remember that though you have experienced being hurt, you are strong enough to overcome your broken heart., Dwelling on the past is generally best to avoid--particularly after a breakup. This means you should keep yourself from doing things that bring up your past relationship and make you feel bad. Create a list of things that remind you of your relationship and try your best to avoid them. For example, stalking your ex’s Facebook page and Instagram probably makes you feel pretty crappy--put it on the ‘bad’ list.


Other things you may want to avoid include listening to ‘your’ song, looking at pictures of you and your ex, visiting spots that were special to your relationship, etc.

, Despite the fact that you might just feel like sleeping all day, you really do need to keep up your health. Remember to eat and try to get a little exercise every once in a while--exercising actually boosts your serotonin levels which in turn will make you feel happier. Eat what you can manage and boost your incentive to eat by treating yourself to something you love at least once (ice cream, a smoothie, chocolate, a really awesome kale salad--whatever you love).


Keep in mind that if your treat is a cold beer, wine, or a fabulous cocktail, avoid getting drunk. While getting drunk and a little wild might seem like the perfect antidote to your broken heart, feeling out of control is the last thing you need right now. On top of that, getting drunk can lead to many, many drunken tears and a wicked hangover that will lay you lower than you already feel.

, While the person you thought loved you might be out of your life, you have plenty of other people who will drop everything to come give you some love. Plan a weekend home with your family after a breakup--they will give you the hugs you need. Schedule a girls or guys night out with your friends, go to the movies with your siblings--the list of possibilities is endless. Let yourself relax, laugh, and feel the love.


Having a broken heart can definitely lead to a feeling of just wanting to be alone. While it is definitely important to have your alone time to reflect and let your emotions out, you should also definitely make an effort to get out of the house and see people who can help you through what you are experiencing.

, Don’t get frustrated with yourself if you think you are doing better and then one day, feel like the break up happened all over again just that morning. Some days are bound to be harder than others. Don’t give yourself a hard time if you feel sad while you are recovering. A broken heart is a strange thing that won’t repair in a day--on those days when you do feel sad, angry or lost, let yourself feel that way--and then move on.

, There is no question about it--you two broke up. Regardless of whatever sugar coating you might have been fed--like the dreaded “its not you, its me” or “you’re just too good for me”--the message is the same: your lover does not want to be in a relationship with you. Do not waste your time by trying to play games to get him or her back. Trying to make her jealous, or continually calling him to talk your breakup through is a waste of your valuable time--put your energy towards moving on and starting over.

, While you might not be able to avoid your ex entirely (like if you go to school with him or have the same friend group as her), you can--and should--minimize the amount of time you spend in contact with him or her. Don’t send your ex passive aggressive texts or call you ex crying. Absolutely do not drunk dial your ex one night. Doing these things will just make you feel worse. Instead, try to avoid seeing or contacting your ex as best you can.If you do have to see your ex, such as if you are in the same class, don’t give into your desire to run up to him and slap him in the face, beg her to come back to you, or simply scream “why?????” Instead, collect yourself and either ignore your ex, or give them a quick greeting without any further interaction. Do not let your ex see that they are putting you in any sort of turmoil.

, Be it in real life or on social media sites, its time to ‘block’ your ex. Ask your friends not to tell you if they saw your ex or heard something about him/her. Remove your ex from your Facebook news feed (or unfriend him/her entirely). While this may be hard to do, ultimately it will be for the best.


If you share a friend group with your ex, try to avoid hanging out with him/her as much as possible. Hang out with your friends in smaller groups, or suggest a strictly girls or guys day. However, do not ask your friends to stop being friends with your ex. Giving them an ultimatum will almost always result in a battle not worth having.

, As the saying “out with the old, in with the new” goes, one of the best ways to move forward is by trying something new. Its time to create a bright, vibrant future for yourself. Have you always wanted to try scuba diving? Lacrosse? Sculpting? Do it! Join a sports team or enroll in an after school or work class. Not only will you get to experience something new, you’ll also meet new people who enjoy the same thing that you do (and have never even heard of your ex).

, Now is definitely not the time to watch The Notebook for the first time or develop a taste for romantic ballads. Listen to music that will pump you up and motivate you, rather than that list of sad songs you put together in the first days of your breakup. While this may sound strange, creating a blacklist of songs that remind you of your ex will help you to move on, rather than dwell on the sadness you feel.This goes for really any form of entertainment-- romantic movies, books, plays--really anything that revolves around a romance or doomed love affair should probably put on the blacklist for now.

, One of the best ways to move on is by putting your situation into perspective. Instead of dwelling on your own problems, help others with theirs. Start volunteering at a local charity, call up a friend who has been having a rough time, or even just help your mom rearrange her furniture--doing something for someone else will help you to realize that while you have suffered a broken heart, your life really is pretty sweet., Working out really is one of the best ways to reduce stress and sadness. When you work up a sweat, you are also working up your serotonin levels which in turn will make you feel happier and more relaxed. Set up an exercise routine or join that Zumba class you’ve been wanting to try for ages., One of the biggest steps you can take to moving on with your life is simply wishing your ex well. You don’t have to do this to his/her face--instead just think to yourself, “I hope ___ is doing well”. You do not need to forgive your ex for breaking your heart, nor should you forget what you have gone through because of that heart break. However, letting go of the anger and sadness your ex caused is a healthy and positive step forward.If you feel like it is important that you remain friends with your ex, you must be absolutely sure you are not harboring any remaining feelings of romantic love for him or her. If you still feel flutters in your belly when you see your ex, or find yourself fantasizing about getting back together, it is best that you don’t try to be friends yet. When you do become friends, know that you will most likely never be able to hang out with your ex without recalling your relationship--thats ok, just put those affection feelings towards your friendship (and nothing more).

, This does not mean you should rush into a new relationship immediately--particularly if it is just a rebound relationship that doesn’t mean much to you but does have the potential to hurt the other person. Instead, take things slowly when you do meet someone you think could be a new love interest.

Discuss how you can make your relationship better the second time around.",How to Win Your Ex Back," Once your partner tells you the relationship is over, avoid begging for another chance or calling your partner over and over again. Take a step back and respect your partner’s desire for space and distance. Use this time apart to focus on your issues and what went wrong in the relationship, rather than try to talk to your partner directly.Limiting your contact may mean avoiding any messaging via text or social media. If you really feel you need more distance and space, you might want to consider unfriending your partner from Facebook and removing their number from your phone. This will prevent you from being tempted to drop in your partner’s life while you are apart and can help you re focus on your issues and needs away from your partner.;
, You can do this in an active way by keeping a journal and writing down your thoughts and feelings around the break up. Think about factors that may have lead to the break up, such as infidelity, a lack of trust, or a lack of sexual desire. Make a list of these factors and consider if you are responsible for any of these reasons.This can help you take ownership of the part you played in the break up and help you focus on issues that you may need to work through on your own. In the event your ex-partner does give you a second chance, you want to be sure you can step up and be a good partner. Part of this is acknowledging your shortcomings in the relationship and being willing to work on your shortcomings.

, Break ups can be very difficult emotionally and mentally, so it is important that you reach out and lean on your support systems. Contact your family and close friends, and explain the situation to them. Try to find someone close to you that you can talk to and that you know is a good listener. Often, it is helpful to verbalize your feelings of anger, pain, hurt, or shame to a sympathetic listener.Depending on how close you are to your family or your friends, they may have seen you and your ex-partner together or they may have known you both well when you were together. They may be able to give you some insight and perspective on some of the possible issues in your relationship and ways that you can work on these issues. Be willing to listen to their advice, but remember that ultimately you will need to figure out how to work through your issues on your own.

, If you are struggling with the break up with your ex-partner and are not sure how to unpack your issues, you may want to look for a therapist or a counselor you can talk to. A therapist can guide you through any anger, pain, or guilt you are experiencing as a result of the break up and help you work on addressing your personal issues.


Working on your issues with a good therapist will also show your ex-partner that you are willing to acknowledge any mistakes you made in the relationship and that you are focusing on cleaning up your act. This is particularly important if the relationship ended due to infidelity, boredom, sexual issues, mental health issues, or even communication issues.

, Rather than aggressively call or text your partner several times soon after the break up, take some time to think about the relationship and to recover from any high emotions you may be experiencing. When you feel you might be ready to reach out to your ex-partner, do so with one call or one text. Explain that you hope your ex-partner is well and that you have taken this time apart to work on your issues with the help of a therapist.Avoid acting bitterly towards your ex-partner if they tell you they are seeing someone else and try to respond with generosity. You do not want to be a source of negativity for your ex-partner and you do not want to turn them off in your attempts to reconnect with them.

, Once you make the first contact with your ex-partner, do not try to push the dialogue further or put pressure on your ex-partner to talk to you. Instead, remain casual about keeping the lines of communication open and try to space out your conversations via text message, email, or phone. It may take time for your ex-partner to feel comfortable enough to spend time in person with you or to have longer conversations with you. Be patient and do not bully or nag your ex-partner as you try to re establish a connection with them.


Every relationship is unique, so it may take several weeks for you and your ex-partner to reconnect or it may take several months. Gauge your ex-partner's comfort level by gently suggesting meeting up in person for a coffee or a drink after a period of talking back and forth via text, email, or phone. Choose a place that you know will be comfortable for your ex-partner, preferably a public place, and be accommodating to your ex-partner's schedule when choosing the meeting time. It's important that your ex-partner feel that you are willing to meet them on their terms, as this will demonstrate respect and care for their needs.

, As the communication between you and your ex-partner re opens, avoid jumping right into a discussion of whether or not your ex-partner would want to get back together with you. Instead, pay attention to your ex-partner's body language and tone of voice. If they appear distracted, bored, or disinterested, it may be a sign that it is not the time to ask them if they would like to get back together with you. If they make a lot of eye contact with you, appear engaged, and even flirt with you, these are all good signs it may be the right time to broach the subject of getting back together.


You should also listen to your ex-partner as they speak as a way to tell if they are interested in getting back together. If they use terms like ""we"" or ""us"", they may be open to entering back into the relationship. Your ex-partner may also discuss how they feel, using ""I"" statements, and be willing to discuss your issues without judgement and with honesty.

, If your ex-partner agrees to meet with you in person, you should start the conversation by owning up to your issues. It’s important that you focus on being generous, open, and honest with your ex-partner when you reconnect. You may decide to bring a list of your issues and details on how you are going to work on dealing with them, or you may explain how you have been working on your issues while you and your ex-partner have been apart.During this conversation, try not to criticize your ex-partner. Your focus should be on what you can do to change or shift your old habits so your ex-partner will consider getting back together with you.

, After spending some time together talking in person, you may feel it is an appropriate time to tell your ex-partner that you would like to renew your romantic relationship. Do so in a direct, clear way and use ""I"" statements.


For example: ""Now that we are talking and reconnecting, I feel like I should be honest with you and tell you I would like to get back together."" It's important that you follow this statement with a discussion of how you will approach the relationship this time around and how you are willing to shift or change your habits so the relationship is stronger. ""I know I made mistakes in the past and I am working on my own issues outside of our relationship. But if you are willing, I would like for us to try to be together again.""

, Once you feel you and your ex-partner have a good dialogue going about possibly building a new future together, you should ask your ex-partner what they feel you can do to make the relationship stronger the second time around. Be willing to listen to your ex-partner’s suggestions and discuss possible ways you can both make the relationship more sustainable.You and your ex-partner may decide to go to therapy together to work on your issues with a professional. Often, couples therapy works best if both parties are invested in the future of the relationship and want to try to work on issues together. With some honest conversations, time spent together in therapy, and a commitment to change, you may end up winning back your ex-partner.

Give yourself some space.,
Think about what went wrong.,
Change your ways.",How to Win Your Man Back1," If you're constantly around your former flame, you won't be able to step back and actually get some perspective on what went wrong. Though you don't have to ignore him, you shouldn't call him, go out of your way to talk to him, or even Facebook him right after your relationship ends. It's time to be alone for a while, even if that means not going to a party if you'll know he'll be there at first.


Once you're away from the guy, you'll have a less biased perspective about how you really feel and what you loved so much about the relationship.
If you're away from him, he'll start thinking about where you are. You'll already make him want you more just by pulling away.;
, Before you can try to make things right, you need to be honest about what went wrong in the relationship. Take some time to do some soul-searching and ask yourself what ended the relationship. Where you too moody, too distant, or too flirtatious with others? Think about what you can do to change the dynamic.


You should only try to win him back if you think you can make things different next time. If you ultimately broke up because you were incompatible and just couldn't make things work, then it'll be harder to win your man back than if it was just because you didn't make enough time for him.
Make a list of all the things that went wrong, and highlight the things you can control.
Ask if you were just going through a difficult time in your life or dealing with a major change. You may be more ready for a relationship if you feel more stable and positive.

, Once you've figured out what you may have done wrong in the relationship, resist the urge to call the ex and show off your new found self-realization. Actions speak louder than words. Just be the new improved self, and word will spread.


If the relationship ended because you were too clingy, work on not being so attached to him. Play it cool and he'll see that you're a new person.
If the relationship ended because you didn't give him enough attention, start making him feel special. Tell him he looks nice and that you're happy to see him.
If the relationship ended because you spent too much time flirting with other guys, don't let him see you with other guys too much or he'll be reminded of why things didn't work out.

Remind yourself that you broke up for a reason.,
Allow yourself to feel.,
Have faith in yourself.,
Ask for help.,
Learn from what happened.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Talk to Ex4," Breaking up with someone, especially someone you had very strong feelings about, can make you feel like the world is crumbling down around you. It’s important to remind yourself that there is usually a very good reason for relationships to end. There probably was an excellent reason why you and your ex broke up, even if you can’t remember it during your darkest moments. Try to avoid pursuing a relationship that would not but functional., Realize it’s okay to feel the grief and sadness. Don’t force yourself to do things you don’t want to do. It’s okay to give into the compulsion to lie in bed all day and call in sick. Don’t worry if you eat too much chocolate. One of the important things is to try to prevent yourself from giving into your urge to contact your ex in order to feel better. You can do it!, You are stronger than you think. You will make it through this, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. You may find yourself reliving certain events and dwelling on the reasons why it didn’t work out. The problem is, you may never really know. There might not be a good reason. But you don’t have to understand why the breakup happened to get over it. You just need to get through the hour, day, week - one step at a time., Don’t try to fight your way through your grief by yourself. Reach out to friends, family and professionals for help. Talk about how you’re feeling and allow yourself to grieve. It’s important for people to know you’re struggling, you might find yourself just relieved that you’re not the only one who knows how you feel. If talking is too difficult, try writing your thoughts and feelings in a journal, and just use your friends and family for companionship., After you’ve moved yourself through the days of being unable to think clearly and do anything productive, you can start thinking about how this whole experience will make you stronger. You’ll also start to realize that as bad as you feel, you do actually feel better than you did a short time ago. You’ve improved. You’ve been able to heal a little bit. More healing is inevitable., Once you feel yourself on your road to recovery, get yourself back into a regular routine. Include relaxing activities where you can just enjoy yourself (e.g. go for a walk, read a book, have a bubble bath, etc.). Say “no” when you need to. Go out or stay in as you desire. Get enough sleep and eat properly."
"
Look and feel your best.,
Stop caring about what other people think.,
Stay busy doing the things you love.,
Develop and express your individuality.",How to Win Your Man Back2," Get your nails and hair done. Take a nice warm bubble bath, and pick out a nice outfit. Once you look your best, you will begin to feel your best. You don't need to get a complete makeover if you want to change. You just need to pay extra attention to grooming and hygiene, and the rest will follow.


Spend an extra 10-15 minutes getting ready in the morning, and you'll start to feel better. Maybe you were too busy or stressed out to care about your appearance before.
Get a fun hair cut. Nothing makes you feel like getting a fresh start like a fresh cut.

, If you're so insecure that you spend all of your time thinking about how others perceive you, then you'll never be able to work on yourself enough to catch your former man's eye again. It doesn't matter if people think you're funny, cute, or charming -- it's all about thinking positive things about yourself.


If you don't care what other people think about you, then you'll exude confidence and your former guy will be impressed that you finally know how to do your own thing.
Don't worry about his friends. Maybe his friends didn't think you were right for your former man or just didn't get along with you. You should be nice and get in their good graces, but don't bend over backwards trying to charm them or you'll lose sight of your target.

, If you're busy with schoolwork, friends, and pursuing your interests, you will be able to grow as a person and to continue improving yourself instead of pining after your guy. Plus, if he sees that you're obviously occupied instead of sitting around staring up at the sky, then he'll see that you have a lot to contribute and that you're person with an active and engaging life.


Let your former guy see you doing the things you love, whether it's immersing yourself in your studies or going out for a nice run.
Spend lots of time with your friends. They'll be able to keep you positive and will lend you a fresh perspective.
Don't use a rebound relationship as a means of staying busy. This will only distract and confuse you even more.

, As you continue to pursue your interests and get some space away from the guy, you'll start getting a better sense of yourself as an individual, not just a hurt ex-girlfriend. Take this time to really be your true self and to let the world know who you are.


Dress to impress. Wear clothes that really make you stand out as an individual. You don't have to wear anything garish to get attention -- just be brave and wear a ""fun"" outfit you were too timid to wear before.
Express your individuality by being creative. Write a story, pick up an acting class, or sign a song at an open mic. Let your former man see you being comfortable with expressing your individuality.

"
"
Develop confidence.,
Be more classy.,
Let him see you having a great time.,
Avoid desperate behavior like the plague.",How to Win Your Man Back3," Assertiveness and self-confidence are naturally attractive to most people. Showing your guy you're capable of being happy is appealing and brings a natural desire. If he sees that you're happy with who you are and what you do, he'll want you even more. Here's how to develop confidence:



Become a more positive thinker.If you learn to see the good in the world instead of the bad, you'll give off an irresistible positive energy, and your guy will want to be around you again.
Be happy with your appearance. Think of at least three things you love about yourself, and dress to show off your best assets. Make sure to get regular exercise to stay mentally and physically strong.
Be assertive. Speak in a clear and effective manner instead of mumbling or talking softly. Command attention with your voice, and everyone will see that you're confident about what you have to say.

, It's fun to be in a party and dance a lot, but that's not always classy behavior. If you're at a party, the classy behavior is to socialize, but speak calmly, not monopolizing all the attention. You can still get a little crazy as long as you don't get sloppy and he'll like you even more for it. No one wants a girl who is falling down drunk or fighting for all of the attention in the room.


Being classy is a form of being mature. Every guy wants a girl who is mature and in control of her emotions instead of a hot mess in public.
Dress elegantly. You have to look classy as well as be classy. You can show some cleavage, but don't wear anything so scandalous or tight that it looks like you're desperate or just trashy. If you look cute but classy, your former flame will naturally notice you.

, Have a big smile on your face and let him see you really enjoying yourself and bringing pleasure to the world and the people around you. You shouldn't have to fake it. If you really want him to want you, then you should actually be having a great time, and be comfortable enough to be happy without him.


Laugh -- a lot. Let him see you laughing and giggling with friends and really having the time of your life.
Be engaged. Be fully engaged in whatever conversation you're having. Let him see you being animated, gesturing, and making great points.
Let him see you engaging in fun activities. If he sees you laughing it up at trivia night, having a great time running with a girlfriend, or hitting up the dance floor, he'll want to spend more time with you.

, If you're desperate to get his attention, make him see how much fun you're having, or to look so hot that he falls over, then he'll be able to tell right away. Just work on being your best self and hope he catches you in the process. Don't overdo it, or you'll only make things worse.


Don't try too hard to look like you're having fun when you're around him. Let it be natural.
Don't try too hard to look good around him, either. Dress appropriately for the occasion and don't wear much more makeup than usual or incredibly high heels just to catch his eye. He will notice you this way -- but not in a good way.
Don't cling to him. Let him come to you. If you're at a party, let him come up to say hi first.

"
"
Tell him how you feel.,
Keep him this time.,
Know when to walk away.",How to Win Your Man Back4," Once you've reflected on what went wrong, improved yourself, and caught his attention, there's nothing left to do but to tell him how you feel. This part will be hard, but you'll have to swallow your pride and get over the nervousness in your gut if you want results. Opening up and letting him know that you want to try again won't be easy, but it will be worth it. Here's how to do it:


Pick the right place and time. Try to get him alone at a time when he's in a good mood and when there isn't a chance his friends will be lurking in the background.
Swallow your pride. If you've made any mistakes, apologize for the past, and be as specific as possible to show that you're self-aware.
Be honest. Tell him that you really miss having him in your life, and that you made a big mistake and want him back.
Say that you want to make it up to him and to show him how much you've changed.

, If your former guy is receptive, then you'll start spending more time with him, whether he asks you out on a date or just spends more time with you in the company of others. You have to make the most of the time you have with him to make sure that you don't lose him again. Here's what you should do:


Don't repeat your mistakes. Remind yourself of what went wrong and vow not to do the same thing this time. Remember how hard you've tried to improve yourself.
Don't put too much pressure on yourself. If you're constantly worried about not messing up again, you won't be able to focus on the present.
Start fresh. Think of this as starting a brand-new relationship while having a bank of information to work with. Don't dwell on the past or rehash old arguments.
Be yourself. Though you're an improved version of yourself, you're still you at the end of the day, so remember to be the girl he fell for in the beginning. If you try too hard to prove how different you've become, you'll lose sight of who you are.

, If you've tried everything and then some, but your former man still won't give you the time of day, then too much damage has been done for you to pursue the relationship further. If he's ignoring you, resisting your advances, or just downright being mean to you, then it's time to walk away before you get even more hurt.


Remember that not very relationship can be salvaged. You've done your best and can applaud yourself for trying.
Walk away with your head high. Don't be embarrassed about opening up and sharing your true feelings.

When you call in, make sure you clearly describe where you are and what is happening. If possible, remain as calm as you can, and try to explain the kind of help you need. The more details you can give, the more quickly the dispatcher will be able to send help. Do not hang up until the dispatcher tells you to.;
, Your first step to stopping a stalker is to accept that you are being stalked. Stalking is not a minor problem or a small irritant. It can be dangerous, and should not be tolerated. Stalkers can be either men or women, and anyone can be a victim. If you are at all concerned about your ex and what he or she might do, it is not a sign of weakness to accept that. Only when doing that will you be able to stop it.
Don’t worry about overreacting. If you feel scared, worried, or angered about someone else’s behavior, you don’t need to tolerate it. If you are concerned, act quickly., Recognizing his behavior will only confirm his belief that it is working, and will encourage further stalking behavior. This means ignoring gifts, calls, and any attempts he makes to contact you. Do not return them or respond in any way.You cannot reason with a stalker. This person has already decided that he will follow you, no matter what you say. This kind of reaction will only encourage him to continue trying, or to try even harder, to stay in touch with you.

, If you think you are being stalked, let others know. Tell your friends, family members, or other people you trust. That way, they can help keep an eye out for your stalker, and call the police if they think something is wrong.When you tell others, be careful not to demonize your stalker. You only need to let others know about him, not tell them how terrible he is. Unless something dangerous has already happened, demonizing him can only help to escalate the situation with others.
In addition to your circle of friends, consider talking to a group like HAVEN, which can provide support, encouragement, and legal advice for someone facing a stalker or other abusive relationship., Note exactly what happened, along with when and where it took place. Keep a record of every phone call, including the ones you don’t answer, every text, every email, and every confrontation you have. If the situation escalates, and you need to take legal action, this will be important evidence to have available.


If you are concerned that your ex has access to your computer, or other means of manipulating an online list, consider writing these events down in a journal. This can be more permanent, and less susceptible to outside tampering.Texts, emails, and phone calls are not evidence of stalking by themselves. While you can prove that the email came from your ex’s address, that doesn’t mean that he sent it. You should still hold on to these, as they can be helpful evidence when building a case for a restraining order., A restraining order is a court order that prevents a stalker or other abuser from coming into contact with you. Go to your local courthouse and fill out a petition for a restraining order.You will need to include an affidavit that explains what your stalker has been doing. This is where your record of his actions can be helpful.
Since this is a legal document, you may want to consult a lawyer when filing the order. Of course, lawyers can be expensive, so you can also reach out to a domestic violence hotline, or other staff members in the courthouse about your options.
Of course, a restraining order is only a legal document, and not a guarantee. It can make it easier to arrest and prosecute, but won’t actually stop him from stalking you. You will still need to be alert and prepared to defend yourself.

, You never know if or when your stalker will put you in physical danger, so you need to be prepared. Self-defense involves keeping yourself alert and out of dangerous situations, but also being prepared to fight back if there is trouble.Some self-defense techniques are as simple as staying alert when you walk around, or having your car keys out and ready so you aren’t searching for them in the parking lot. Don't let your inattention be an opening for someone else.
Look for self-defense classes offered in your area. You can probably find them through police departments or local schools. In addition, basic training in some form of martial arts can give you the skills and confidence to defend yourself, at least long enough to escape to a safer place.
If you haven’t learned new techniques, or aren’t comfortable using them, having something like pepper spray on you is a good back-up plan.

, Because she knows you so well, your ex will probably be able to keep track of you by visiting the same locations you do. While this is certainly annoying, you should consider modifying your favorite places and usual routes to prevent her from easily following you.Look for things you can easily change, like places you shop and eat, or things like the gym you go to. Try to find different ways to get to your important locations, so your stalker can’t track you along the way.
While you probably can’t change your school and work hours, it can never hurt to ask, especially if you are concerned for your safety.
If you do need to make drastic changes to your schedule, keep paper records of the financial effect this has on you. This can be good evidence for legal proceedings, and can even be the basis for financial reimbursement if the changes are serious enough., Your ex probably knows a few of your passwords to things like social media accounts and email, as well as even more sensitive information like your bank account. Don’t give her the chance to mess with these items, or use them to track your activity.Make sure your new password is secure. The traditional advice is to make your password a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Keep your passwords in a secure place, and only enter them on secure websites.Another way you can create a strong password is to take the first letter of each word, plus numbers and symbols, in two simple sentences. For example, the phrase ""My first pet was a dog named Fido. Got him in 1993."" would become the password ""MfpwadnF.Ghi1993."" It is long, and has a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Since it doesn't read as any word that would appear in a dictionary, it is harder for someone else to figure out. Plus, since it can refer to a sentence only you know, it should be easier for you to remember., There are a number of good products out there that will keep your computer secure. Make sure your computer always has an up-to-date security system. If it gives you the option to update automatically, take it. If your ex is particularly tech-savvy, he may try to use a virus or Trojan horse application to track your movements and computer activity without getting on your actual computer. Use the anti-virus software to keep your computer clean, and get rid of anything that might be used to follow your activity.

, Online social networks like Facebook are a good resource for tracking someone. Make sure you clear out your social media accounts to prevent your ex from having was to keep tabs on you.Update your privacy settings so that only your friends are allowed to see your posts.
After your break-up, unfriend your ex so that he cannot track you through the network. Make sure to ignore all friend requests from him. Be very careful about adding new friends, especially people who know your ex, and would let him keep an eye on you through their activities.
Don’t be afraid to unfriend other mutual friends, especially if you are concerned that your ex will use them to track you. It may feel mean, but that is not important. Your safety is what comes first, and you cannot overreact to a stalker.
Don't make posts that clearly show your whereabouts, or anything that would let your ex find you quickly. This means avoiding obvious landmarks like your workplace, school, street signs, or anything else that would let someone who knows you figure out where you are.

, This means things like your personal calendar, which would allow a stalker to follow you and know where you are planning to be. Check privacy settings on any websites you frequent to make sure nothing is accessible to anyone you wouldn’t want to see it.Run your name through a search engine to see what is connected to you. If you find information about yourself that you would not like publically available, get rid of it. That may mean asking your friends to remove social media posts that tag you.

, Stalking is about control. If your partner has been trying to control you, he is more likely to continue doing so after you have broken up. Some of these signs include:Regularly belittling you, putting you down, or discouraging your dreams and personal growth.
Trying to cut you off from your friends and family. Instead, he always tries to keep you near him.
Getting jealous when you do something without him, especially with others.
Constantly checking up on you, wondering where you are and what you are up to.This certainly isn’t a guarantee that you will be stalked, but it can be a warning sign that your ex might try after the break-up.

, There should be no doubt in your mind that you have ended the relationship with this person. The important thing is that there can be no confusion that you do not want to see this person anymore.


While you may be tempted to let your ex down easily, you need to be firm and clear that you want to end the relationship. A potential stalker will use any potential opening as an excuse to continue following you, so don’t give one.If you are fearful of the other person’s reaction, make sure to break up in a public place. While this generally isn’t a nice idea, you shouldn’t be alone if you are concerned for your safety. Your security comes first., This means phone calls, emails, texts, and any other forms of communication. Aside from cutting your ex off and not giving her a way to track you, it will also help you get past the relationship.


This includes social media. Delete pictures or other items of the two of you together and block your ex. This will help prevent her from stalking you, and make it easier to move on by removing the means to stalk her in response., You and your significant other probably shared keys and other items as a way to stay close. Now that you have broken up, get your keys back. You don’t want to give her any access to you or your things.


If you aren’t going to be able to get your keys back, it is a good idea to change your locks. You shouldn’t allow such easy access into your home to someone you don’t want to see anymore."

You may even begin to dream about your ex if you don't allow yourself to experience your thoughts and emotions.Cry if you want. It feels better when you let all that out, instead of keeping it bottled up inside you forever.;

Even if you cannot understand why it happened, talking about it can help you accept that the relationship is over.If you don't feel comfortable talking to a loved one about the breakup, consider seeing a therapist or joining an online support group.

No matter how angry you are, it's important to stop ruminating on these negative thoughts.When dealing with recurring thoughts, it's helpful to confront them head-on. Think about why you are having the thought, how the thought may be distorted or untrue, and what kind of negative effect the thought is having on you in the moment. The more you acknowledge your ruminations, the easier it will be to let go of them., After a breakup, people are often dishonest with themselves about the quality of the relationship or the reasons why it ended.

This will allow you to move past idealizing what might not have been a great relationship in the first place.It will also help to ask yourself what your role was in causing the breakup, as this might help you let go of some anger.

, A breakup can have seriously negative effects on your mental and physical well-being, especially if you find that you're still dwelling on it months later.

You can try wearing a rubber band around your wrist and snapping it each time you think about your ex.
You can write down the thoughts you are having about your ex on a piece of paper and then throw it away.
You can try a visualization exercise, which requires you to visualize a specific scene whenever a thought of your ex occurs to you. For example, you could think of a stop sign in order to remind yourself that you need to stop what you are doing. If you do this consistently, the association should become automatic.

, Even if you think you want to be friends with your ex, it's important to give yourself some time away from him or her. You must fully heal before you can begin spending time with your ex again.If you don't allow for any healing time, you may continue to think of your ex as your partner because your bond as a couple will not have been broken.
Take a moment to think about why you want to be friends. If it's because you're scared about living your life without your ex, you may be using it as a way to avoid dealing with the grief of the breakup.
Most people do not end up being friends with their exes. Don't feel bad if it just doesn't feel right, even after you've had your time to grieve.

Create a new routine all your own. Instead of making your signature Saturday breakfast, try taking a walk and trying out a new cafe.

, Surrounding yourself with friends and loved ones will help keep your mind on all of the positive aspects of your life, and off of your ex. It's also important to commit yourself to the hobbies and activities that you most enjoy, especially if your ex kept you from pursuing them.If your social life revolved around your ex, it's important to get out there and make new friends. Try joining clubs or participating in volunteer activities to meet new people.
If you relied on your ex for emotional support, try relying on someone other than a romantic partner for this kind of support, like a best friend or a sibling. You might be surprised to discover just how much support you really have!Staying busy really will help you move on faster. If you find yourself thinking obsessively about your ex when you are at home alone, come up with something to do, whether it's having dinner with a friend, visiting a museum by yourself, or going for a walk., You may have planned a future with your ex, and if you did, it's understandable that everything might feel uncertain now. Try to focus on the positives by reminding yourself of all of the great things you can and will accomplish in the future without your ex.Try to enjoy your present-day life as well. Even though you may want to be in a relationship, there are lots of benefits to being single too, so try to enjoy it while it lasts.

, In order to boost your mood, it's important to practice healthy habits. Make sure you exercise regularly and get plenty of sleep. Committing yourself to a healthy lifestyle will not only make you feel good, but it may just offer you the escape you need from thoughts about your ex.Meditating might help you regain your positivity and let go of the stress associated with your breakup.

, There's no golden rule for when you should start dating again after a breakup, so do whatever you feel is right for you. Avoid jumping into a new relationship just because you don't want to be alone, but don't be afraid to put yourself out there either!Some people struggle with continuing to think about their exes even though they are in new, healthy relationships. If this is the case for you, it will do no good to simply try to suppress those thoughts. Instead, actively replace the thought with a memory of a time when you felt a lot of love for your current partner. Love is a strong emotion that can help you resist the temptation to contact your ex."

Learn to trust her before digging into her past and personal life.,
Accept that you can never know what other people are thinking.,
Let her handle her emotions, and you handle yours.,
Investigate further if you have reasons to be suspicious, but still want the relationship to work.",How to Tell if Your Girlfriend Likes Someone Else1," Relationships are based on trust. This doesn't mean that you never feel jealous or suspicious; it means you can put those feelings aside and believe in your girlfriend. If you can't trust your girlfriend, maybe you shouldn't be with her. Suspicion and jealous behaviors pushes people away, especially if you start rooting around her stuff without a good reason.


If she's pushing you away, seems distant, or spends all of her time away from you, then you can feel comfortable asking some questions.
Your girlfriend will have other male friends -- that doesn't mean she's giving you up. Try not to feel so threatened by other men.;
, If she's told someone else she likes them or she's made a move, that's one thing. But trying to figure out every single crush and passing infatuation is a fool's errand. Think about it -- how often have you had fleeting feelings for someone else? How often have you actually acted upon them?


Small crushes are perfectly normal, even in rock-solid relationships. If you try to uncover every one of them you won't be dating her for long.
If you look hard at your life, you'll realize that you appear to like other girls when you're just being friendly. A jealous mind invents stories where there are none.

, If she likes someone else, that's on her. It is her job to break up with you and move on, or to realize that her crush doesn't mean that much. At the end of the day it's her actions, not her thoughts, that matter. Paradoxically, this confidence in yourself, knowing that she's your girl and that's that, will make you much more attractive. Possessive, needy boys end up alone.


She is with you already. She's your girlfriend! Unless she's cheating on you, it doesn't matter if she like someone else temporarily as long as she still loves you.

, You need both parts. If you don't have a reason to be suspicious (hidden text messages, distant behavior, catching her in lies, etc.), then investigating her is rude and insensitive. If you don't want the relationship to work, or have a deep distrust you can't shake, then end the relationship. Who cares if she likes other boys at that point? You have deeper problems in this relationship.


Ask yourself seriously why you care if she likes someone else. If you're terrified of losing her, then you should talk to her. If you're blindly enraged at the thought then you need to take a step back.
If you can't find a way to trust her, either because of past issues or because you can't shake the idea that she's into other guys, just break up.

Take some time for yourself.,
Recognize when your thoughts are getting the best of you.,
Consciously stop yourself.,
Ask yourself why you feel this way.,
Find a distraction.,
Talk to your partner about it.",How to Stop Over Thinking in a Relationship," Too much thought about another person can lead to an 'unhealthy' obsession and that is not a good thing, right? Falling into this trap can be easy causing over-dependence, jealousy, and eventually depression. All of the latter states lead to a loss of your 'personal' power and can cause a relationship to deteriorate quickly which kind of defeats the purpose of the whole thing. Therefore it's critical when things reach an uncomfortable level in relation to you concentrating too much on your partner (or anything outside of your self for that matter) that you turn your concentration back onto 'yourself' and what makes you happy and feel satisfied (outside of your relationship).


There is a difference between the sometimes 'false' sense of security gained from another person's company/attention simply because we can't handle spending time on our own, and the 'security' of knowing within ourselves that we can comfortably spend some time alone. Spending some time alone (and this also means not concentrating on your loved one 24/7) is not only beneficial to your personal growth and development, but it's healthy for your relationship as well, as it gives things the space to grow. Alternatively it can give you a more balanced perspective to judge whether the 'other person' is the 'right' one for you.;
, It may take a huge amount of effort but the first step is always the most critical. If you're stopping yourself for the first time, you might not even realise it when you are thinking too much because it has become so natural for you. Here are some indications for you when you start to think too much-


You start feeling sad and depressed. Your thoughts wonder to stuff like ""how long is this relationship going to last?"" and ""I think he/she is going to break up with me.""
When you find yourself clinging on to your phone waiting for the person to text you while thinking ""Why haven't they texted me yet.... it's been 2 minutes already!!!""
You see that your personal blog is full of negative thoughts and fears about the relationship.

, The first step when you get that disturbing compulsive feeling of not being able to stop concentrating on someone else is to -STOP!- and if you are in the position to do so sit down, close your eyes, and take some deep breaths, letting the air slowly roll out of your mouth. The simple act of shutting down one of your five physical senses, i.e. closing your eyes will cause your intuition to rise by about 15 to 20% higher (think of how a visually impaired person can move more confidently than you around a dark room). Breath control (deep breathing) will release the build-up of stress caused by all that emotion bouncy around inside of you. Remember you are dealing with an 'addiction' of sorts.

, Has your other half given you cause to feel this way? Have they had a history of cheating or are they being different suddenly. Try to think from a third person's point of view, whether your thoughts are ranging from unfounded to psychotic. If the other party has given you no cause to feel this way then such anxiety and over-thinking is really your problem and you've got to nip it in the bud. Stop yourself, as mentioned earlier and change.


Take the time to analyze yourself. Begin by asking yourself questions like ""Who am I?"", ""What am I?"" and ""Why am I here?"". You might at times ask, ""What is my major weakness?"" and counter that with ""What is my major strength?"". You might ask yourself ""What can I do to make myself feel good?"" or ""What can I do to take my mind of this?"" The subconscious mind is a marvelous and greatly underestimated place and if you give it the time of day, you might be surprised what answers you get back from yourself. Remember this is your 'personal' time with yourself (so if you know who's face comes into your mind 'bounce them out).

This technique is called 'self-analysis', and by practicing this technique as much as possible. Even if only for a minute or two on the hour throughout your day (even a couple of times a day) can build a 'familiarity' and 'sense' of self, ultimately leading to a respect for who you are inside and what makes you tick.
If you are in a bad place with your relationship, or find yourself over your head in addiction to that your partner this technique is the first step in making your journey back to yourself and this is the place where you will eventually be able to make assertive decisions about your life, instead of being dragged along by another person's journey all of the time, where potentially you may get kicked to the curb anyway.



, Yes when you are thinking too much about something, the best thing you can do is find something to distract you from your own thoughts. Try not to be alone or somewhere quiet. Get your boys and girls to head to town with you for a movie or some Frisbee. Go to the gym and go crazy on the new workout program you found on the internet. Bake a cake for a potluck with your girls or start up your computer for some Warcraft with your buddies.

, It would be nice for you to let your partner know. It would be especially helpful if they were the ones who have given you cause to feel this way. If you think they are cheating on you, ask them. Do it nicely of course, there is no need for you to blow your top at them only to realize that the person they were seen with was actually an aunt who just came to town for a holiday. Communication is key here.

See whether she shuns physical intimacy.,
Check whether she hides her phone from you.,
Take notice if her schedule suddenly becomes busy.,
Look for whether she avoids eye contact.,
Look for a change in her habits.,
See whether she starts to dress very differently.,
Know if she's ignoring you.,
Don't tolerate obvious signs of infidelity.",How to Tell if Your Girlfriend Likes Someone Else2," One of the most obvious, fundamental signs that something is wrong in a relationship is if one partner becomes uncomfortable being physically close to another. Whether it's holding hands, cuddling, making out, or having sex, being physically intimate requires a great deal of trust from both partners. If one partner knows that the trust has been betrayed, physical intimacy can suddenly start to seem quite awkward and unnatural, even when it was easy before. If your girlfriend all of a sudden seems to recoil at the thought of touching you, something's up — even if it's not infidelity.


To be clear, what you're looking for here is a sudden, unexplained reluctance to be physically intimate in ways that you previously were. If you previously were having sex and it doesn't seem to happen any more, this is a sign of a problem. However, if you've only kissed your girlfriend on the cheek, her unwillingness to have sex with you doesn't mean she's having feelings for someone else. People can take time to progress through the stages of physical intimacy — in fact, progressing too quickly to sex is one of the most comment complaints women have about he physical side of their relationship., In the modern age, our cell phones and personal electronic devices have become the way in which we keep in touch with our significant other. However, if your girlfriend has been fooling around with someone else, there's a good chance that her phone was also used to stay up-to-speed with him. Pay attention to the way your girlfriend handles her phone — does she keep it close to herself when she's texting? Has she recently added a password? Does she refuse to let you use it? Does she seem reluctant to let it out of her sight? If so, she may have something to hide.


This advice isn't just for cell phones — it's also for other types of electronic gadgets people can use to communicate with each other. For instance, if your girlfriend keeps shutting her laptop or logging out of her social media profile every time you walk into the room, this can be cause for concern if it's happening alongside some of the other warning signs in this article.

, Girlfriends and boyfriends with busy, active lives will occasionally have trouble making time for each other in their schedules. This is perfectly natural and something that most couples have to deal with. However, if your girlfriend suddenly becomes too busy to hang out with you for long periods of time and her explanation doesn't seem to make sense, this can mean that she's spending her free time with someone else. If your girlfriend has recently had trouble finding the time to hang out with you and her explanations don't seem to hold water, you definitely have reason to be concerned.


To help differentiate between normal schedule conflicts and ""troublesome"" ones, try this trick. When your girlfriend says that she won't be able to hang out with you, try suggesting a different time. If she still says she can't make it, wait for her to suggest an alternative. Usually, when people want to hang out with each other but they have a schedule conflict, they'll volunteer a different time for hanging out. If your girlfriend seems content to let the matter go unresolved, however, this can be a sign that she doesn't really want to hang out with you at all.

, Being able to look someone in the eye is widely-regarded as a sign of sincerity and honesty. When people know they're or hiding something from someone who's close to them, it can become difficult or almost even painful to look the other person in the eye. If your girlfriend suddenly can't seem to meet your gaze, something may be very wrong.


Obviously, this doesn't mean that if your girlfriend can look you in the eyes, she's telling the truth. Skilled (or particularly remorseless) liars can look their significant other in the eye without any problem.
It also bears mentioning that some people who are shy or socially awkward can naturally have a hard time looking other people in the eye.In addition, certain types of social disorders may cause this behavior.

, When you've been dating someone for a while, their routine and daily habits should become fairly well-known to you simply through spending time with them. Seeing a sudden shift in the way your girlfriend spends her time should automatically feel strange and cause you concern, but if you see it along with some of the other warning signs in this article, you may have reason to be alarmed. This is especially true if your girlfriend's new routine has her doing things she actively avoided doing with you. People are generally more willing to participate in social activities they don't care for at the beginning of a new relationship when doing so may please their new partner.


For instance, let's say that your girlfriend hated going to the beach with her boyfriend in the past, but now has spent the past two weekends with ""some friends"" at one of their beach houses. As her boyfriend, it's reasonable for you to question this, especially if she meets pretends that she has always liked the beach.

, For both sexes, a sudden, drastic change in the way someone dresses can be a sign that some other aspect of their life has changed. For instance, it can be a sign that someone has recently become single, has recently lost someone and is grieving, or has recently gotten a new job. However, within the confines of a committed relationship, if someone adopts a drastically different ""look"" without warning and has no explanation or just unconvincing excuses, it can be a sign that she is trying to impress a third party.


It's an especially worrisome sign if your girlfriend's new look seems to be designed to be attention-seeking or provocative. For instance, someone known for her conservative style of dress is less likely to spontaneously start wearing bare midriffs and low-cut tops than someone without such a reputation.

, The thought of getting the ""cold shoulder"" is enough to make any concerned boyfriend shiver. If you're suspicious of your girlfriend's true intentions, pay attention to the way she treats you when you hang out — does she seem indifferent or disinterested in what you have to say? Does she belittle your opinions or ignore them entirely? Does it feel like your presence is making no difference at all in the way she behaves? Is she completely unavailable via phone or social media? If you're beginning to feel like you're invisible around your own girlfriend, your relationship has problems.


If you think you're being ignored, be sure to stay calm. Texting your girlfriend 100 times to get a response isn't likely to go over well whether or not she's spending her time with another guy. Remember that constantly trying to clamber for someone's attention can make you appear unattractively desperate.

, All of the warning signs in this article assume that it's difficult to tell whether your girlfriend likes someone else simply by observing her. However, if your girlfriend is brazen enough to be open about her preference for another person, you won't need to wait to look for any of the other signs. In these cases, your relationship needs a serious re-evaluation. Below are just a few obvious actions you absolutely shouldn't to tolerate:


Showing open affection for someone else in a way that goes beyond friendly fake-flirting or harmless banter (e.g., kissing, intimate dancing, etc.)
Ditching you to exclusively hang out with someone else in social situations.
Showing contempt or making fun of you in a way that goes beyond good-natured teasing, especially when only around certain people.
Openly attempting to entice or arouse another person with innuendos or come-ons in a way that's not intended as sarcastic or ironic.

Pay attention to how often you talk.,
Listen for minor lies and slip-ups.,
See whether she is vague about her personal life.,
Take note if she is unwilling to share details about new friends.,
Listen for an unwillingness to acknowledge your relationship.",How to Tell if Your Girlfriend Likes Someone Else3," Even the closest couples forget the importance of good communication from time to time. However, a long-term lack of communication can be a sign that a relationship is ""on the rocks"". If you've been getting bad vibes from your girlfriend, start to keep a tally of how frequently you talk to each other (this includes non-face to face communication like talking on the phone, texting, and so on). If you notice a sudden drop or your numbers seem suspiciously low, you may have reason to worry.


This advice applies especially to you if you're in a long-distance relationship. In an LDR, you don't have the luxury of physical contact, so frequent communication is key to keeping your relationship healthy. Many relationship experts recommend trying to communicate in some minor way every day if you're in an LDR., In the words of Mark Twain, ""If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.""Even the most skillful liars occasionally get their stories mixed up, so, if you're beginning to have suspicions about your girlfriend, try to look for logical holes or contradictions in the things she says. People who are lying about where they've been, what they've done, and who they've been with will almost always make mistakes in their stories eventually — you just have to be listening to be able to catch them.

, Rather than lying, some people who something to hide will avoid talking about how they are spending their time entirely. If your girlfriend was once perfectly willing to talk about her life, her friends, and her hobbies, but now she's suddenly become much less willing to volunteer this information, this may be her way of minimizing the guilt that may come from lying to you. Keep an ear out for the following vague, noncommittal phrases when you ask her about what she's been doing — if she won't give you any more information than one of these phrases, there may be something she's trying to hide.:


""Nothing.""
""Why do you want to know?""
""I've just been really busy.""
""I don't want to talk about it.""

, Usually, making new friends is a good thing. However, if your girlfriend seems uncomfortable talking about certain new friends she's made, something's not right (especially if she's always been willing to talk about her friends before). Even if this isn't a sign that she likes someone else, it can be a sign that she's ashamed of the people she's been hanging out with or the things she's been doing with them and is afraid of how you'll react to this knowledge. Openness and trust is important in any relationship — if your girlfriend isn't being forthcoming about the people she's been hanging out with, it's a sign of some sort of problem, even if it's not infidelity.

, If one partner in a relationship knows that she's betrayed her boyfriend's trust, it can become painful for her to even bring up her relationship in casual conversation. Talking about her relationship may make her feel guilty by bringing up thoughts of her betrayal or may annoy her by reminding her that she isn't out of her current relationship yet. Try asking your girlfriend a few of the following questions to get an idea of how comfortable she is talking about your relationship. If she seems uncharacteristically cagey, annoyed, embarrassed, or reluctant to answer, this may be a sign of a problem:


""How do you think we're doing as a couple?""
""Is there anything fun you'd like to do in the next couple of months?""
""What sort of things do you think we can do to improve our relationship?""
""What's your favorite memory of us together?""
""Where do you see us in a year?""

"
"
Feel for emotional distance.,
Look for extreme defensiveness.,
Watch out for sudden aggression.,
See whether she's uncomfortable receiving your kindness.,
Watch out for unprompted affection.",How to Tell if Your Girlfriend Likes Someone Else4," Often, when something is wrong in a relationship, one or both partners can just ""feel"" that they are growing distant emotionally. Where two people once felt close and connected, they now feel like they hardly know each other. Where it was once easy to share emotions, cuddle, and talk about nothing, such interactions now feel forced and ""cold"". This sort of emotional distance can be a sign of a host of relationship problems, including infidelity. If your girlfriend seems cold and distant, press the issue with her — immediately talking with her to learn the root cause is better than languishing in unhappiness.


Note, however, that prolonged emotional distance can be a sign of many relationship problems besides infidelity. The National Healthy Marriage Resource Center pinpoints family and cultural differences, situational conflict, and stress as just a few of many alternate causes., Sometimes, people who know they're doing something wrong can become super-sensitive to any sort of criticism or accusation. Because their misdeeds are fresh in their memory, any sort of innocent teasing or nit-picking can seem like a personal attack. If your girlfriend has surprised you recently with unnecessarily hostile responses to seemingly innocent questions, you may have a serious. Below are a few innocent sample questions that can spell trouble if they're met with anger or frustration:


""Hey, who was that you were talking to on the phone?""
""So, what did you do last weekend?
""What are your plans for next Friday?""
""How are your friends?""
""Who have you seen recently?""

, In one of the absolute worst-case scenarios for any relationship, one partner may become so enamored with someone else that she actively tries to sabotage the relationship she's already in. This can take the form of aggression, rudeness, frustration, insults, and more. In this case, your girlfriend is most likely trying to get you to break up with her so that she can pursue her new relationship free from guilt.


If your relationship gets to this point, sadly, it may be best to give your girlfriend what she wants. The pain of a quick breakup is usually much less than the pain of staying in an unhappy relationship with someone who actively wants to ruin it.

, Normally, random acts of kindness can provide a spontaneous ""spark"" for a relationship. However, if one partner has been having serious thoughts about someone else, this sort of kindness may simply make her guilty. Almost no one likes receiving appreciation from someone they know they've wronged, so if your girlfriend seems unhappy to receive a gift or some other sort of show of kindness from you, be on the lookout for other warning signs. Below are a few of the sorts of things that normally go over well, but may not if your girlfriend is seriously thinking about someone else:


Gifts for any occasion (especially ""just because"")
Fancy nights out
Gourmet meals
Surprise appearances at work
Clearing your schedule ""just for her""

, Paradoxically, while having feelings for another guy can cause your girlfriend to be unusually defensive or aggressive, it can sometimes cause her to be extremely ""nice"" or affectionate. If your girlfriend is worried that you may discover her secret, she may temporarily try to woo you by showering you with kisses, hugs, compliments, cuddling, and more. A girlfriend who suddenly seems intent on keeping you dizzy with constant positive attention for no discernible reason may be up to no good, so be wary — especially if the affection seems to increase whenever you question her activities or whereabouts.


Of course, affection is usually a good thing within the context of a relationship, so don't be suspicious of ordinary, reasonable affection. Getting lots of kisses and a fancy dinner after getting graduating or getting promoted is fantastic, but receiving the same outcome after asking where your girlfriend has been for the past week should be troubling.

Realize that the conversation will be uncomfortable.,
Initiate the conversation.,
Offer your support.,
Follow your loved one’s lead.",How to Support a Loved One Who Has Been Laid Off1," There isn’t any way to avoid the conversation being a little bit uncomfortable. What is most important is that you have the conversation with your loved one. Keep in mind that your loved one is affected more substantially by being the person who was laid off, and thus is more sensitive to the topic. Even if it is your spouse that was laid off and the financial burden now falls on you, keep in mind that your spouse already knows that. They also took a hard hit to their self-esteem by being laid off.;
, Since your loved one is the one most affected by the layoff, it will often be harder for them to face the situation. Initiate the conversation by asking them a question or offering your help and support. This gives your loved one the opening they need to discuss the layoff.You might say something to your loved one like “I’m sorry to hear about the layoff. If you need anything at all, please let me know. I would like to help you.”
Consider writing a note. This will allow your loved one to write or call you back on their own time, so don’t expect an immediate response., The goal of talking to your loved one about their layoff is to understand their situation and to find out how you can help. Ask what kind of support would be most helpful to your loved one. Be sure that you are being sensitive about what you ask and how you word it.Do not assume that your loved one wants help finding a job. You may be wrong, and this mistake can often be offensive.
Instead of asking about work with things like “Do you have a backup plan?” you can ask things like, “Is there anything I can do to help?”

, You should give your loved one space to think about what they need and how they want to discuss the layoff. Avoid calling or texting your loved one about the layoff if they aren’t responding or if they seem to avoid the topic. They will need time to process the changes in their life and make a plan before being comfortable enough to share the details.If your loved one is reaching out or responding heavily to your efforts, you should continue to discuss the layoff and offer them support.

Create a process.",How to Talk to Your Boyfriend Who Has Alexithymia," In a relationship, honesty, openness and mutual trust are imperative before entering into a dialogue. You could ask your partner if they have a medical diagnosis, and if they are aware of any difficulties on the subject of emotions. Alexithymia is known to overlap with a number of other autism spectrum disorders. Don't judge, just make sure you are both talking about the same thing.
, Before you start talking about it, think of what outcome you are trying to achieve. Do you want your partner to acknowledge the problem? Do you want to find common ground? Or do you need to find a process you can both follow to satisfy your emotional needs?, If the issue of not being emotionally satisfied by your partner is important enough for you to talk about it, then it is also important enough for your partner. They are your partner after all. The fact that they are with you, shows that they care.

Do not start the conversation in passing, as a side note or in an unaccommodating setting. The supermarket, a restaurant or the car are less than ideal places to have this conversation.
Don't start the conversation just as your partner is leaving for work or if you know they have something planned later in the evening.
Avoid announcing the conversation in advance. Things like ""Next Thursday we will talk about "" might create anxiety and stress leading to a refusal to talk about anything.
On the other hand, if your partner needs time to think about their response, you can continue the conversation at a later time.

, Sooner or later, you will have to open your mouth and start talking about it. Consider immediately stating what's on your mind and what you think the two of you might do to remedy this.

Example:""Honey, I think you sometimes don't know what I'm feeling and it bothers me. I think if we agree to do or , we could solve this together. What do you think?""

, If something has made you sad and you need your partner to hug you and tell you things will be alright, consider telling them exactly that, in words.""Honey, I had a difficult day at work today. That makes me sad and gives me stress. Can you hug me and hold me and convince me that things will be better tomorrow?"", If you want to know what your partner is feeling, ask them. Avoid doing this abruptly or angrily, as this may lead to them shutting off. Instead, be supportive and understanding. Use open questions such as ""How does this make you feel?"" rather than ""Do you feel angry?""., It is important to let your partner know what you are thinking. If you need more emotional support than you are receiving, they should be aware of this.

Once you have expressed the way you feel, make sure to end on a positive note. Consider saying, ""Thanks for understanding, that was what I needed."" This will indicate that the things they've done have had a positive effect on the topic you brought up.

, Consider implementing more readily understandable cues. If you've had a bad day and are not getting the support you need, consider that a sad expression on your face may not be enough of a cue to your partner.

You could use code words or phrases such as ""I need a brown umbrella"" and agree that if either of you says that, the other should give you a hug and ask what's wrong. Or agree that vacuuming means a need for emotional support, except on Tuesdays, the normal vacuuming day.

Let him make decisions too. If you're the one who's making all the decisions, he will eventually get bored and it won't take long before he begins to wonder why he never gets to have a say over what you both do. In his mind, he may even consider you to be a control freak. Back down a little and let him take control of the situation for some of the time too. Let him decide where you'll go, what you'll do, and what to choose, at least half of the time. In this way, he knows he has a part in the relationship and that both of you are partners.;
, Be yourself around him. Don't let others tell you how to act. If some of your bossiness is coming from friends telling you how to treat your boyfriend, it's time to ask what their agendas are and why they think they know so much about your relationship. Thank them for their suggestions but gently remind them that it's your relationship. Don't take their advice so seriously that your boyfriend suffers for it.

, If you want sex but your boyfriend doesn't, then wait. It's not that he's not ready; he wants to take things slowly. If you're bored waiting, then find other ways to be affectionate and be appreciative that he is respectful of you.

Calm down, listen to some music, read a book, draw, or do something to take your mind off feeling moody about whatever triggered your bad emotions. If you take out your moodiness on your boyfriend, then you're not treating him fairly––he doesn't deserve to be on the receiving end of constant moodiness. It's perfectly fine to let him know when you feel down but it's quite something else to carry on every time you're with him, expecting him to alleviate your unhappiness or bad feelings. He isn't a stand-in personal therapist.


If you have problems dealing with mood swings, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor or psychologist for advice.

, You and your boyfriend have decided to be together but if you're taking control, it's time to stop. Remind yourself that it's his life, not yours. He's not telling you what to do and who you can hang around with, so why should you?


If you don't like the way he is doing things, the people he hangs with or the way that he is, then ask yourself if he's the right boyfriend for you. If so many things bother you that you can only see yourself happy by changing him, then it's likely that he's not the right guy for you.

, Trust is a huge thing in relationship; without it there isn't a very strong relationship. If you are having trust problems with him, it's important to get to the bottom of what is causing this. Telling him how to behave and what to do won't mend broken trust issues.

, Then have a two day break. This proves you won't get bored with each other. Moreover, you will have a lot to talk about. If you see your boyfriend every day, you will be tempted to start taking control over him, just by dint of being around together too often. If this happens, he'll hate it. Take a few steps backwards and treat him like you would want to be  treated.

Give your full attention.,
Show that you are listening.,
Ask questions.,
Avoid making judgments or suggestions.",How to Support a Loved One Who Has Been Laid Off2," Remove any potential distractions before your loved one starts talking about what happened. Shut down your lap top, put away your cell phone, and turn off the TV to avoid becoming distracted by these things.You may also want to plan a quiet time and place to meet with your loved one. Choose a time when you will be able to devote your full attention to your loved one, such as after your children are in bed or on a weekend morning when you are not in a rush to get anywhere.
Try meeting somewhere quiet, such as in your home or in the corner of a café.

, Showing your loved one that you are listening can help him or her to feel heard. You can show that you are listening by doing things like nodding, making eye contact, and facing your loved one.


Neutral phrases can also help your loved one to feel heard. You can say things like, “uh-huh,” “yes,” “go on,” and “I see” to help your loved one feel heard., Asking questions is another important part of being a good listener. You can ask your loved one questions to clarify what he or she just said or to encourage your loved one to expand on something he or she said.To clarify something your loved one just said, try saying something like, “It sounds like you were laid off due to budget cuts. Is that right?”
You can also ask leading questions to get your loved on to expand on something he or she said. For example, you might say, “You said your boss said something odd to you a few days ago. What did he say?”
Other leading questions you can ask include, “What happened next?” “What are you going to do now?” and “How are you feeling about what happened?”

, While you may feel like you are being helpful, telling your loved one what you think he or she should do is likely to cause stress and anxiety for him or her. Focus on just listening to what your loved one has to say about the situation and do not offer advice unless he or she requests it.


If your loved one does ask you for advice, use “I” statements to express your advice.For example, you might say, “I think it might be a good idea to apply at some of the other local construction companies, since you have such great experience working in construction.”

"
"
Allow your loved one to bounce ideas off of you.,
Encourage your loved one to consider their talents.,
Suggest way to think outside the box about their job experience.,
Keep your eye on the goal, not the details.",How to Support a Loved One Who Has Been Laid Off3," This will give them a chance to think through their plans with a little bit of feedback. Sometimes, they will need your help with ideas, but other times, they will just be glad that someone is talking through the plan with them. Either way, your loved one will need support when it comes to formulating the next steps that they need to take.Try asking your loved one something like, “So what are you going to do?” or “Do you have any ideas about your next move?”

, Many people have talents that lie outside of their career. If your loved one has been laid off, this is a perfect time to put those talents to use. This could be for part-time money in between jobs, or a change of career entirely.For example, your loved one might be passionate about working with youth, but was formerly employed at a bank. This can be a good time to redirect their career to include their passions.

, Just because you learned your skills in one job doesn’t mean they are applicable somewhere else. Help your loved one think of new ways to apply their skill set. This is also a good time to expand their skill set with training or conferences.If your loved one worked in a bank and has a sound grasp of financial concepts, they might consider applying to companies in need of financial planners or other monetary guidance.

, The goal is for your loved one to make it through the layoff and adjust to a new life. The details are for them to work out. If you advocate too strongly for a specific way of doing things, you can make your loved one feel like they are failing if they do things another way.For example, if your loved one is thinking about going back to school, but is not sure what he or she wants to study, don’t try to steer him or her towards anything. Just asking something like, “What are you interested in studying?”

"
"
Keep the connection going.,
Provide your loved one with the help they need.,
Stay positive and give your loved one encouragement.",How to Support a Loved One Who Has Been Laid Off4," It is common for several friends and family members to offer help and support immediately after a layoff. Unfortunately, many of them go back to their routines quickly after and their support falls by the wayside. Be sure that you continue to be connected to your loved one and open to helping them if they need it.Having a weekly coffee date or phone call is a great way to keep in touch well after the layoff has happened.

, If your loved one reaches out for help, you should provide the help that you can. If you are unable to provide what your loved one needs, offer to do what you can to help them through. You should be sure that your efforts to help are something that the other person needs and not just generic efforts that help you feel better.For example, if your loved one has been recently laid off and needs a house sitter for a week long conference, you could offer to stop by every other day to check up on things. This can be very helpful even if you can’t spend a week in their house.
Your loved one may not ask for help directly. In this case, you can offer things like mowing the lawn, cooking them dinner, washing their car, etc., or just ask them again what you can do to help.

, Being laid off can make a person feel as if they are not valued by their former employer. Give them encouragement and compliment the things that they do well so that your loved one knows that they are appreciated. This confidence will pull them out of limbo and into a new happy career or lifestyle.Try saying something like, “I know that your employer valued your talents. They just couldn’t afford to keep you on and that is not your fault.”

Be aware, though, that arguments are often about something below the surface, such as resentment and disappointment. The things we argue about can be simply an excuse to vent our deeper frustrations.;
, These include alcohol, physical or emotional fatigue, and stress from work or school. Dealing with these may significantly improve things.

, While you may feel that your boyfriend is to blame for everything, step back and ask whether you've contributed to your arguments. In some cases, admitting that you did something wrong to your partner may dramatically reduce the intensity of the argument., You may or may not know how you would like the problem to be resolved. Take time to think about what your ideal outcome is, and then ask yourself what other possible outcomes you could accept.This will help put the argument in the larger context of your needs and the relationship as a whole.


If it helps, write down the things you want to say to your boyfriend.

, It may help him to know in advance, rather than to spring the subject on him unawares. This gives him a little time to think about his own position, too.

, A new or favorite activity will help remind both of you why you're in the relationship to begin with., Allowing 20-30 minutes for the conversation should be adequate. This ensures that the talk (or argument) won't go on indefinitely., Invite him to give his side of things, and listen to him as he speaks. Resist the urge to interrupt him, even if what he says bothers you. If you need clarification, ask questions in a neutral tone.

, Non-verbal communication is very important. Sit or stand with your shoulders and knees facing your boyfriend to let him know you're listening to him. Avoid arm-crossing, toe-tapping, and eye-rolling.Touch your boyfriend. Maintaining contact will help keep you grounded in each other despite your differences of opinion. Sometimes it's even best to stop talking for a bit and simply hold each other., We all have emotional needs, and perhaps his are not being met. He may not say this outright, or even consciously realize it himself. Consider how you can better meet these needs in your relationship.


Emotional needs include: security, love, fun, friendship, physical intimacy, control over one's environment, inclusion, self-esteem, status, a sense of achievement, meaning and purpose., Repeating in your own words what you've heard from him helps both of you be sure that you understand his perspective.

, Speak as openly, calmly, and specifically as you can about what's bothering you. If your boyfriend interrupts, gently remind him that you let him speak freely for as long as he needed, and now it's your turn.

, This will almost certainly involve compromise on both parts, but try to find enjoyment in giving something for the benefit of your relationship.

, Make sure each of you understands your part of the plan going forward, how you can non-argumentatively remind each other of your agreement, and what the consequences are if you do not uphold your end of things. Set a date for when you can re-evaluate how well things are going., Some arguments continue in spite of your best efforts. If your boyfriend is saying hurtful things, misinterpreting you, acting arrogant or judgmental, his ego has been hurt and he is behaving this way out of self-protection. Although you may think that by saying or doing the right thing you can bring him around, he's actually not in a state where he's truly receptive to your words and actions., While you cannot change what's happening with the other person, you can take care of yourself. Realizing this helps avoid damaging confrontations. It's okay to walk away from your boyfriend; remember, though, that this is not a punishment to him. Stay receptive and loving, and when he decides to open up, be there to listen.Sometimes a 30-minute break can help both of you calm down. Take a walk, call a friend, or do something else entirely for a good half an hour before returning to your boyfriend., If you can't walk away for whatever reason, disengage from the argument by keeping silent. Listen to your inner feelings instead of fanning the flames with more words."

Recognize that too much complaining isn't productive.,
Complain less, and ask for advice more.,
Catch yourself when you start ranting.,
Work on listening more.",How to Stop Complaining About Your Relationship and Fix Things Instead1," Acquaintances and coworkers generally aren't good audiences. Your loved ones are usually happy to hear about what's going on with you, as long as every conversation doesn't get sucked into the realm of your issues. Remember, they also have their own lives and struggles.


Constant complaining about your problems can cause you to come off as immature and whiny.;
, Venting can help you feel better, but going on constant rants hinders your ability to move forwards.

, Moaning about your relationship may make you feel better, but it only is useful in small doses. Focus on turning your talk into something more productive: explain the problem as calmly as you can, and ask your loved one how to respond to the situation well. Listen closely to their response.


""Jake and I are having some issues with our schedules. Is now a good time to talk about it? I could really use some advice.""
""I feel really frustrated and confused. How do you think I should handle this?""

, If you notice that you've been going on for a while, without letting your conversation partner get in many words, stop. Take a deep breath and give the other person a chance to speak. They may welcome a shift in conversation, or they may ask you to keep going (in which case you're in the clear).


""I'm sorry, I'm going on and on about my relationship problems, aren't I?""
""I realize I've been doing most of the talking since we met up. What's going on with you?""

Nature of dependency.,
Don't always accept help from them.,
Step out of your comfort zone.,
Analyze.,
Try.,
If the situation is financial, use the money wisely and to effect.,
Dependent on a certain person's company?,
Don't belittle them.",How to Stop Being Dependent on Someone Else," Are you aware about the kind of dependency you have with the other person? If not then you could figure that out to help yourself in that area.


Is the dependency financial?
Is it emotional?
Is it an overall dependency? Some people depend on a sibling or a friend. Any news or new thing is taken to them to get their opinion. Do you like their opinion on any and everything? This form of dependency could also mean that you think of them as smarter or more experienced than you. While it is this other person's responsibility to guide you to be independent if they are closer to you or are more matured or elder than you, you could try to follow your path and start your work on your own as far as you are comfortable. Let this dependency go away with time and practice.;
, If it's something extremely taxing and impossible for you to do, don't hesitate to ask for assistance from a variety of people who are available. If it's something you know you could do, don't rely on them to do the task for you.

, Be bold enough to present yourself as your own persona, not simply an addition of this person. You are an individual, not a dual part of someone else, however close you may be.

, Analyze what led you to be dependent on anyone. Was it that you felt that you could not do something?


Did he or she told you things that made you feel that you need them?
Is someone always critical of what you do?
Do you think that you are lesser able to tackle things?

, Believe in yourself and try to remember of any incident when you managed to work something out on your own. Make a list of the qualities that you like about yourself. No one is free from making mistakes. Each one makes mistakes and learns for the next times, what not to do and how better to work on it. Give yourself the time and consideration regardless of what someone or probably everyone thinks. You are free to try to be self-dependent and get stronger with time.

, Always return any borrowed money as you could to ensure that you are seen as responsible and trustworthy, as well as allowing for others to loan money to you again in the future.

, Mixing with others will help boost your social awareness, and is a chance to develop relations with those around you. Dragging that person with you around every social gathering will not only make them feel uncomfortable, but also trapped.

, They have been asked for help till now so your sudden change may confuse them or even disturb them. Be pleasant if they seem confused. If they are not supportive of you being independent, be calm at first and be vocal about your choice thoughtfully. They deserve a good treatment for being there for you so long as they are nice to you.

Help yourself—only you are in a position to do this.,
Meditate.,
Choose a time when you are calm and thoughtful.,
Create a love-hate list about your relationship.,
Use your love-hate list to help you decide what's more important.",How to Stop Complaining About Your Relationship and Fix Things Instead2," Especially when it comes to relationships, you are at the steering wheel of your own choices. It is important to use good judgment, think it through, and make thoughtful decisions when coping with relationship troubles.


While getting advice can be helpful, remember that you are the one who understands the situation best, because you're the one experiencing it. You know your relationship best, so at the end of the day, it's important to use your own judgment.

, Go to a quiet and empty room, and make yourself as comfortable as possible. When you are overwhelmed with millions of thoughts, you need space and time to think. Meditating helps at this point.


Light up some candles and close your eyes.
Relax and clear your mind. If clearing your mind is too difficult, focus on one thought or one word and keep repeating that thought (make sure it's a positive one).
After five minutes, you'll notice your breathing getting slower and slower, which is a good thing.
Meditate for five more minutes and then slowly, open your eyes. Feeling still? Feeling peaceful? You bet.

, When reflecting on your relationship, you want to be examining it from a distance, when your emotions are under control. This will help you make the best decisions.

, Once you're feeling peaceful, grab a notebook and write a list of the things that are troubling you in your relationship. On the next page, write the things that you love about your relationship. Let it all out on paper. Seeing and reading your feelings can help you understand them better.


Keep this notebook. You can use it to vent in writing instead of constantly running off to other people.

, Look at both of the pages and decide. Depending on the situation in your relationship, think. What is more important to you? How can your life be better? Is your relationship worth the work, or should you just end it? Make sure your decision is wise and final.


If the hate list is too big, it's okay to end things. Staying in a bad relationship won't help your happiness, and breaking up is rough, but you'll be happier in the end. Congratulate yourself for making a thoughtful choice.
If the love list wins, then this isn't an easy choice either. You'll go through hard times with your partner and life won't always be rainbows and butterflies. But in the end, you'll look at them, recognize how much you love each other, and know that it's worth it.

"
"
Remind yourself why you love them so much.,
Tell your partner about how you feel.,
Listen closely to your partner's feelings.,
Give yourself a ""time out"" if you're getting too upset.,
Make up after an argument.,
Be silly together.,
Experience new things as a couple.,
Remember that love is more than a feeling—it is an action.",How to Stop Complaining About Your Relationship and Fix Things Instead3," Think about the wonderful things they've done for you, the things about their personality that you adore, ""your"" song, and how you felt when you first got together. How did it feel to be newly in love? You can still have that spark.

, Expressing your emotions is important, and your partner needs to know about your feelings! Work on being clear in the moment, so that your partner understands your emotions and ideas. This will help your relationship in the long run.


Try the script ""When ______, I feel ______."" For example, ""When you stay late at the office without calling to let me know, I feel worried and unimportant.""

, Just as your feelings are important for your partner to understand, you need to understand how your partner feels. Let them speak uninterrupted, and make sure that you are listening to them, not just waiting for your turn to talk.

, Disagreements happen, and you may find your temper on the rise. Rather than saying something you'll regret, suggest a fifteen-minute break. Use this time to calm down and remember that even though you disagree, you still love your partner and don't want to fight.

, Call over your partner when you're both in a better mood, hold their hand, look into their eyes, and smile. This eases the atmosphere and lets them know that everything can be fine.


Apologize for your part of the argument, and take time to listen to and validate how they feel. If they see you nodding and listening, they'll be more open to working together to fix the problem.

, Pull your partner off the couch to dance to your song, cook them something, watch a movie and make popcorn, laugh together, and have fun.

, If you ever worry that your relationship is falling into a rut, it's time to go out and do something. Visit the beach, mall, aquarium, library, national park, or any place the two of you could have fun together. Go to a new restaurant or museum. See new places: other countries, other cities, or just a grassy hill where you can have a picnic. These are experiences the two of you will treasure all your lives.

, Perform acts of love on a daily basis, whether it's as small as doing the dishes or as large as planning a surprise getaway. Show your partner how much you love them, so there is never any doubt in their eyes. This is how a relationship will last.

Talk about what time you need to yourself.,
Be straightforward about your needs.,
Let them know what you won’t put up with.,
Move at your own pace.,
Talk about your physical boundaries.,
Communicate any consequences.",How to Set Boundaries with People1," It’s common to want to spend a lot of time with your partner, particularly if the relationship is new. However, everyone needs time to themselves. Talk to your partner about how much time you need alone and if they are preventing that in some ways. Similarly, listen to and respect what your partner needs. You may become suffocating if you only want them to spend time with you.


For instance, you could say, “I really enjoy spending time with you. However, I also need time to myself and to spend with others outside of you, like my friends and family. It’s nothing against you. I just also want to see them, as well.” You may want to reconsider the relationship if they can’t accept what you need.;
, Fights often ensue because of miscommunication. Your partner may not know what you need if you aren’t direct about it. They may do something else because they think that’s what you want, but only end up upsetting you as a result.


For example, you could say, “I really need you to respect that I want to be left alone for the first hour I’m awake. I’m not a morning person and I’ll be in a much better mood if I have that alone time as soon as I wake up.”, Some partners attempt to control the relationship, as well as their significant others. Tell your partner as soon as they display this behavior if you aren’t willing to tolerate their actions. Stay strong with your decision or else they may resort back to acting this way again.


Trying saying, “I enjoy being in a relationship with you, but I’m not willing to allow you to tell me what I can and cannot do. I respect you enough not to treat you that way, and I expect you to do the same.” They may initially become upset, but if they want to make the relationship work, they will respect your boundaries.Make sure to give them the benefit of the doubt. It is not fair to hold something against your partner if you have never before expressed your needs in that area.

, Tell your partner what you are comfortable with emotionally. Also talk about what you need. You may require hearing lots of affirmations, or you may not feel comfortable hearing them at all. It’s important to discuss these boundaries with your partner so that you don’t feel pushed.


For instance, you may feel pressure from your partner to say “I love you” even if you aren’t ready. Tell them how you feel about them and that you haven’t reached that point yet. Let them know you don’t want to hurt their feelings, but you also don’t want to lie to them. You shouldn’t have to say anything you don’t want to in order to make a relationship work., It’s important to let your partner know about any physical boundaries you have from the start, or at least when the subject is brought up. Sometimes this may occur to you in the heat of the moment while other boundaries may be clear to you upfront. Just communicate what you need clearly and politely.


Be clear and direct about what you are and aren’t willing to do. For example, you might find a certain way of cuddling uncomfortable on your back, or there might be some sexual expressions you don't feel comfortable with. It may be time to move on if your partner can’t respect these boundaries., It can seem harsh, but an important part of boundary-setting is setting consequences for violations. Your boundaries hold absolutely no weight if you speak them but never enforce any consequences when they are crossed.As you discuss your boundaries with your partner, provide some reasonable repercussions for when they break them. This might sound like ""If you invade my privacy, I will be less likely to share things with you in the future"" or ""If you are disrespectful to me, I wil cease communication with you.""
Some consequences might be presented as final outcomes while others are communicated through warnings. Just be sure to actually follow through and enforce your consequences.

Make it clear what your responsibilities are.,
Let your family know that guilt will not work.,
Explain what behaviors you won't accept.",How to Set Boundaries with People2," Families often have that one person who holds everyone together. If you want to be that person, great. If not, you’ll need to let everyone know. Otherwise, you’ll be the person who is expected to set up get-togethers, resolve conflicts, keep in touch with everyone, and so on.


For example, if you have a relative who always expects you to have Thanksgiving dinner at your home, you could say, “I really like that you feel comfortable in my home and like to celebrate Thanksgiving here. Unfortunately, it’s a lot of work and I don’t think I’ll be able to do it this year. However, I’d love to help you if you want to host it at your place.”
Saying this sets up a clear boundary, but also won’t ruffle too many feathers as you are volunteering to help out., You know your family loves you, but you also know that some members resort to guilt in order to get what they want. Your mom may talk about how much her sister’s kids do for her, and people ask her why you don’t do the same. Let them know you do what you can, and you won’t bend because of a guilt trip.


When a relative is thickly laying on the guilt, try saying, “I understand where you are coming from. However, I don’t appreciate you trying to guilt me into doing something I don’t want to do. I am only willing to help as much as I feel comfortable with. If you continue, I won’t help at all.”
While you are being stern, you are also staying respectful. You are also letting them know that you expect the same kind of respect., Going from raising a child to only seeing them every so often is difficult for some parents. They may still want to have dinner with you every night like they did when you were growing up, but you may only want to share a meal once a week. Let them know what will work for you, and what won’t.


For instance, you could tell them you would like them to call before they stop by. You could also tell them that some parts of your life, such as your personal life, are off limits.
Also let them know that you won’t tolerate any negative comments about your choices in life, who you are dating, your appearance, or anything else. Setting these clear boundaries may cause some backlash, but it will likely be worth it in the end."
"
Offer alternatives to what they want.,
Tell your friend you’ll help, but you expect help, too.,
Give a warning.,
Say ""goodbye"" to friends who continually cross boundaries.",How to Set Boundaries with People3," You may have a friend who wants to come over and stay all day. Or you may have a buddy who would like to cry to you for hours each day about their ex-lover. Being a good friend doesn’t mean doing everything they want you to do. You have every right to decide what you feel comfortable with. You don’t have to cut them off completely, however, you can offer alternatives.


For instance, you can say, “You can come over, but only for a few hours because I have things I need to do.” Or, you can tell your friend, “We can talk about your ex for 15 minutes. After that, I would like to talk to you about what’s going on in my life.” You’re still there for them, but you’re also not subjecting yourself to only what they want., You may be that friend who consistently makes themselves available to help out. But you may also find that you are always asked for help but never receive any in return. Let your friends know that you expect the same amount of help that you give.


For example, if your friend always bums a ride, you could say, “I don’t mind taking you places, but I’ll need some gas money if this is going to continue.”
Or, if you have a pal who always asks you to babysit their kids but never wants to watch yours, say, “Sure, I’ll babysit, if you watch my kids next weekend.” You’re still helping, but you’re creating a clear boundary that shows you would like some help, too., Let them know you’ll be there for them, with conditions. Some “friends” want to use up all you’ve got, but never offer anything in return. They may continually break promises, constantly borrow things from you but refuse to return the favor, and so on. These are “friends” you don’t need, and you’ll need to let them know now.


Offer a warning about boundary violations to let your friend know when they occur. You might say, ""Hey, you stood me up last night and that wasn't cool. I'll stop making plans with you if this happens again.""

, In the course of establishing your boundaries, you might learn that some friends simply do not align with the values you uphold in life. These friends may push your limits continuously, and just aren't worth the hassle. Be clear that you can no longer maintain such a friendship.


You could say, “I feel like our relationship is one-sided. I won’t be able to continue putting all I have into our friendship if you don’t do the same for me.” Be prepared to give examples of what you’re talking about, and to possibly lose that “friend.” Chances are they weren’t worth your time in the first place."

Don't try to save a relationship that's toxic or abusive.",How to Save a Relationship," If you are at a critical juncture, you can probably figure out when things started going off the rails, even just a little bit. Think about when the problem started, so you can figure out how to approach the discussion with your partner.


You may easily pinpoint one major reason, such as you or your loved one was unfaithful, and that changed the dynamic of the relationship.
More often, you may not be able to find one major reason, but rather, a series of reasons for why things aren't working out. A lot of little things can start to add up. For example, maybe he's spending too much time with his friends, or you never make time for each other. Alternatively, maybe you're both stressing at work.
Maybe you're growing incompatible. If you've been together for a long time, it's possible that you've become different people over the course of the relationship.
If you're unsure where to begin, consider taking a relationship quiz that can help you assess how healthy your relationship is.;
, Sometimes, a relationship can't be saved, especially if the other person isn't willing to put in any work. If only one of you wants to save it, that's not going to work out. Also, if your relationship is abusive in any way, either physically or emotionally, then you probably shouldn't try to save it.

, You should pick a time when you have few distractions. Also, it should be in a private space, so that you won't be overheard.In addition, try to choose time when you both aren't overly emotional. You should try to have a calm, rational discussion, putting emotion to the side., If your marriage or relationship is need of saving, it's likely that your partner already knows a problem exists. However, if you haven't talked about it, you need to start the discussion. It's best to do so when you are calm and level-headed, so that you can actually discuss rather than shout at each other.It's important to not just talk, but to listen and hear what your partner has to say about what's going on in your relationship.You can show you're listening by summarizing what your partner has to say to show you've understood what he or she has said. You can also ask questions that show you've heard what the person has said and that you want to know more.
When you're bringing up the problem, focus on ""I"" statements rather than ""you"" statements. For example, you could say, ""I'd really like to discuss what's been going on with our relationship,"" rather than ""You're making our relationship a mess."", While discussing your relationship, work on a list together. Figure out what you both think the problems are in your relationship, and discuss how it started. It may be hard to have an open discussion, but it's important to get both of your points of view on where the relationship went wrong. In addition, you can use help from educational websites to help identify what's healthy about your relationship and what's not.For instance, a healthy relationship is one where you are both your own, independent people and you respect each other's personalities and boundaries. You are interested in what the other person is doing, and you encourage one another.Unhealthy relationships, on the other hand, are where one or both of you is not happy with who the other person is, and you are pressured to change the person. You may also feel controlled or manipulated, or you may be the one doing the manipulating., Rather than blaming each other, consider how patterns from each of you has led to problems. For instance, maybe you consistently forget to call home when you're going to be late, and your partner then gets upset when you don't show up. Consequently, you punish him or her the next time by not calling home, which is a cyclical pattern. When you bring it up, focus on how to solve the problem, such as ""I will try to be better about calling home, if maybe you can forgive me the few times that I forget. Or maybe you can send me a text near the end of the day, so I will be more aware of what time it is."", If you are at the point where you are trying to save your relationship, it's a good idea to call in professional help. A counselor can help you decipher what problems you have, especially if you can hardly stand to be in the same room together anymore.

, Being honest is a kind of vulnerability, and by being honest with your partner, you show that you trust him or her. Try opening up about what you're thinking and feeling. When you're vulnerable, you're inviting your partner in and asking him or her to be equally as honest. However, it's important to continue using ""I"" statements to tell how you feel instead of blaming the other person.For example, when you're talking to your partner, you shouldn't say, ""You never put me first."" Rather, you should say, ""I sometimes feel neglected in the relationship."" That way, you're telling how you feel rather than pointing fingers., Instead of each taking one side of an argument, it's important to work together. You should work together in your relationship, treating each other as teammates rather than enemies. However, you also need to work together when trying to solve problems. That means first agreeing on what the problem is.Once you agree on what the problem is, you also need to talk about what both you are concerned about underneath the surface. That is, you may both have an idea in mind of what winning looks like, but if you are both set on winning, no one will win in the end. Instead, discuss why you want the solution you do.You should also look for common ground in the problem and the solution. That is, if you're disagreeing about who should do what housework, at least you agree that the house needs more attention. That's a starting place., This step may be the hardest part, coming up with solutions you both can live with. That means agreeing on what you think the main problems are in the marriage and coming up with ways you can both work to make it better. Basically, you need to compromise. Blaming each other isn't going to help, as you've both contributed to the situation you're in.Compromising means you need to talk about what you both need and want in the relationship. This step is important, because then you can decide where you can both stand your ground and where you can both give a little.Compromising means giving in where you feel you can.
It helps if these solutions are concrete. For instance, maybe you've decided one of your main problems is that you don't spend enough time connecting. The solution could be that you agree to go on one date a week, plus you will try to spend lunchtime together at least three times a week.
Maybe you're problems are partially financial. Sit down and agree on a budget moving forward, one that compromises on what you both value. For instance, if you're a saver and want to penny pinch every dime while your partner enjoys extravagant vacations, compromise by going on a more modest vacation every year that is within your budget.
Portion out the household chores. One small thing that can become huge is if one person feels he or she is doing all the work at home. Have an open discussion about a fair division of the work, and try making a schedule to determine who will do what when.

, If you're going to move forward, you're going to have to forgive each other for the hurts you've caused. That doesn't mean completely forgetting what happened or even saying what happened was okay. It does mean that you need to acknowledge the hurt it caused you. You need to realize that the other person makes mistakes, and both of you learned from that mistake. Finally, you need to accept that it happened and move on.Most mistakes stem from needs that a person wants to be met. Realizing that can help you learn from what happened., Once you've identified the problems and solutions, you need to both formally commit to the solutions. The solutions need to be concrete and ones you can both live with.If you find your solutions aren't working after a certain period of time, it's fine to revisit them and try something new., Once you've made a plan about how to move forward, don't forget that you also need to set boundaries. Yes, you forgive each other for what's happened, but you can still put boundaries in place to keep the same mistakes from happening again.For instance, if one of you cheated after going to a certain club, it seems reasonable that that person should not return to that club. You could bring it up by saying, ""Because of what's happened in the past, I don't feel comfortable with you going to the club. If you insist on going, that may be a deal breaker for me.""

, When you're in a dire situation where your relationship is failing, you may have forgotten why you got together in the the first place. Spend some time reflecting on what you liked about him or her in the first place.Maybe she could always make you laugh, or he made sure to call to see if you got home safely. Think about all the little things that you used to love about the other person. One way you can think about the past together is to look at old photos together., If your primary goal is to protect yourself in the relationship from hurt and anger, you aren't open to change. Instead, you'll likely want to control your partner to enforce that protection, making your relationship negative and stagnant. On the other hand, if you're both willing to learn and grow together, your relationship can develop over time into something better. If only one of you is willing to change, it may not work., Think about what you love about your partner. In fact, take some time each day to write down five things you love about your partner or are grateful for in your partner. Try to put those thoughts into words and actions by expressing gratitude towards your partner., Everyone experiences love differently. Gary Chapman breaks this idea down into the five ways people experience love or the five love languages. If you've never taken the time to figure out each other's love languages, now is the time to do it. You can take quizzes online to figure out what your love language is.The first love language is words of affirmation, which means that you feel loved when you hear words that value you.The second love language involves service, meaning that you feel loved when someone gives of his or her time to help you out or to do chores around the house.The third love language is gifts. That means that you feel loved when you receive small (or large) tokens of appreciation from people who are close to you.The fourth love language is time. With this love language, you feel loved if a person spends time with you.The final love language is touch. In other words, you feel loved if a person is affectionate with you by kissing you, holding your hand, cuddling with you, or hugging you, for instance., That is, in your interactions with each other, try to use the other person's love language to show that you care. If your partner's love language is service, try doing little things around the house to show you care or try taking his or her car to the wash. If your partner's love language is time, make sure to figure out ways to spend more time with the person on a regular basis., Just like when you first got together, you need to spend time together, just the two of you. You may think you know everything about your partner, but people can still surprise you even years later. Take time each day to talk to your partner and ask about his or her life, thoughts, and feelings.One way to learn something new about your partner is to try taking a class together, such as a cooking or dance class. You'll experience something new together and rekindle some of the old spark.

, Though tastes may change, you should make time to do something you used to love doing together. If you used to love cooking Chinese food together, try it again. If you once trained for a half marathon but are now feeling too out of shape, commit to the challenge. By committing to something you enjoyed doing before, you'll rekindle some of the old passion you felt. However, it doesn't just have to be something you used to enjoy together. You can also try something new., That is, you need to remember to connect to each other through touch, not just sex. When you're together, hold each other hands, cuddle, or hug. Touch her arm while she's talking. Rub his knee while you're sitting next to each other. Touch is important in maintaining intimacy, and it can be lost to the daily grind over the years., Once you've started on this path, you may think you'll be able to fix your problems just by sitting down together once and talking about it. However, maintaining a relationship means constantly checking in with each other and talking about what's going on and how you're feeling.Communication is especially important when you feel yourself getting angry at your partner and wanting to be short with him or her. Instead of getting angry, take a moment to breathe. Once you've calmed down, take a moment to talk about why you are getting upset and what can be done about it.

, There was a reason you got together to begin with, a seed of love that kept you going this long. If you still feel that love, it's worth working to find a way to communicate and get in sync with each other again. Many loving relationships get off track from time to time. It will take work to restore it, but it's worth the attempt if you know in your heart that you care about this person.

, Maybe you're the one who is on the verge of giving up on the relationship, but your partner wants to keep trying. If you've been together for a long time, it might be worth giving it your all to try to save it. It might be possible to see your partner's love for you and have faith that even though you're going through a rough time right now, things can get better. Weigh the options and see if it's worth it to you to try for the sake of your partner.

, No matter how good things used to be, or how much one party wants the relationship to keep going, sometimes it's clear that it has to end. If you've already put in effort trying to save the relationship, and you no longer feel love or the will to try to reignite it, it's OK not to force yourself to keep trying. Don't spend months or years dragging it out and criticizing yourself for not being able to make it work. It's OK to choose happiness over self-sacrifice. When one person stops participating in the relationship, it's better for both people if it ends.

, There's really no way to work on a relationship that's based on toxic patterns or abuse. No amount of working on communication techniques or trying to reignite the romance is going to make things better long-term. You may feel that you're getting something out of the relationship, but you have a lot more to gain by being free.

Make dedicated appointments to discuss your relationship openly.,

Seek and give forgiveness together.,

Practice Rogerian arguments when you disagree about something.Carl Rogers was a therapist whose practices have become widely accepted as model for conflict resolution.,
Create a list of desired behaviors together.,
Use “I-statements” during difficult conversations.,
Keep your reactions proportional.,
Stay in the present moment.Your partner may have betrayed your trust in the past, but for the relationship to thrive, you have to acknowledge the past while accepting the present and looking forward to the future.,
Participate in relationship counseling as a couple.Seek a licensed therapist — possibly one certified by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy if you can find one.Ask your physician for a referral if you’re having trouble finding a therapist you trust, or seek the counsel of a spiritual advisor if you belong to a faith community.",How to Resolve Trust Issues in a Relationship1," If you and your partner are having trust issues, you must make honest communication a priority if you want the relationship to survive. However, it can be hard to bring up serious issues in casual conversation, and problems might go unaddressed until they explode in argument.


Set aside dedicated time to discuss your relationship one-on-one. The frequency of these conversations can vary depending on the needs of your specific relationship.
If your relationship is very rocky, you might set aside an hour every week to have an honest exchange of feelings.
Alternately, make a promise to one another than whenever one partner feels tension building in the relationship, they will voice their desire for a serious conversation.
Give yourselves time to prepare for the conversation. This will both keep the discussion from turning into an emotional, spur-of-the-moment argument, and allow each of you to think about everything you need to say, so you don’t overlook major issues.
Choose a time for the conversation that is free of distractions, and make a commitment to focus your attention on your partner without diverting your attention.Be a good listener — let your partner speak without interruption.;
, This includes both the behaviors that raise your alarms, and those which make you feel secure in the relationship. Be as explicit about action and reactions as possible. Some examples might include:


“I felt so relieved the other day when you told me honestly that your ex called, but that you only talked about work.”
“I’m uneasy about how you have to see him/her every day at work, but I’m so glad you’re not hiding your interactions from me. Please keep telling me about your interactions, so I don’t let my imagination run wild.”
""I felt ignored and unimportant earlier when you took an unimportant phone call right in the middle of my story about how hard work was today.""
“I'm scared of you right now because you're raising your voice and getting in my face.”

, Once trust has been broken, a relationship cannot be rebuilt without forgiveness; however, in many relationships, the betraying partner is too afraid to ask for forgiveness, and the betrayed is too angry to give it. Evidence suggests that a couple’s ability to ask for and provide forgiveness is a key indicator of the stability of a relationship. You may find it difficult to forgive because forgiveness is a difficult concept to define. Keep in mind that forgiveness does not imply approval of or consent toward untrustworthy behavior in a relationship; it is merely the letting go of negative, unproductive feelings for your partner’s past behavior that will allow you to move forward. It is an act of kindness in a relationship, and nothing more.
If you are the betraying partner, understand that when asking for forgiveness, you cannot expect your partner to forget past indiscretions. Forgiveness is not the same as trust. You still have to prove your trustworthiness every day.

, Until it has been broken, trust isn't something most people have to think about explicitly; only after someone has proven untrustworthy does it become a conscious choice you have to make on a day-to-day basis. Consider this metaphor as a way to help you choose trust every day:You drive to work every day without worrying too much about dying because you've never been in a bad accident. However, one day, a dangerous driver on the road causes an accident that lands you in the hospital, and you almost die. The next time you have to drive, you will likely be far more anxious about trusting the other drivers on the road than you were before. However, you have to drive again, so you choose to drive cautiously, perhaps being overly vigilant about other drivers. As time goes by and you continue driving without incident, you'll find your anxiety decreases and you can drive as normal again.
However, if another car cuts you off one day and almost causes another wreck, your anxiety will likely return ten-fold, making you mistrustful once again.
So one partner must choose every day to trust in the behavior of their partner, while the other partner must choose every day to act in a trustworthy manner.

, Rogerian argumentation posits that:


You should not begin to state your case until you can thoughtfully, empathetically state your partner’s case from their point of view. Before voicing your feelings, show your partner that you fully understand where they’re coming from.
For example, “I think that you probably feel like I’m trying to control you.”
You should point out the contexts in which your partner is right. For example “You’re right that last night, when I got upset that you didn’t text me back because you’d fallen asleep early, I overreacted and had unreasonable expectations of you.”
You should only state your case when you have validated your partner’s feelings: “I still feel like I’m putting more effort into this relationship than you are. Here are some examples of things you’ve done that have made me feel insecure.”
Instead of trying to “win” the argument, a Rogerian discussion should lead toward compromise that works to the benefit of both people in the relationship: “If I promise that I will stop overreacting to non-problems and you promise to set aside more time for us, we’ll both be able to trust each other again.”

, Perhaps one person in the relationship has been unfaithful or otherwise untruthful; perhaps you both have. In either case, work together to create an explicit list of things each partner can do to improve the relationship and rebuild trust. Some examples might include:


Both of you must call if you’re going to be home late, so your partner doesn’t wonder or worry.
Answer calls and texts from your partner immediately whenever possible rather than making them wait for a reply.
Eat dinner together every evening, and use the time to actually talk instead of eating silently in front of the TV.
Respect each other’s privacy by not snooping through emails and call logs.
When one of you feels like they're going to lose their temper, the conversation ends immediately — no questions asked. If someone needs to step away and decompress, the other does not follow them and continue arguing.
Be reasonable — unrealistic, overly demanding requests will only sow the seeds of resentment in the relationship.For example, it’s not reasonable to expect your partner to pick up the phone immediately if you call in the middle of the workday; they may be in a meeting.

, During highly charged emotional conversations, we often lapse into the second person: “you’re so inconsiderate,” or “you were ogling him/her!” However, beginning your sentences with “you” can make the other person feel attacked and defensive, and that rarely results in productive conversation. Instead, make statements that begin with “I” that focus on how you feel in a particular situation. This draws attention to how the offending behavior hurts you, rather than to how the other person is to blame. Be as specific as possible and try to avoid implying blame. Some examples of “I-statements” include:


“I was worried and anxious when you didn’t answer my calls all day, and I had trouble concentrating at work” instead of “you didn’t answer my calls all day and ruined my mood.”
“I couldn’t help but imagine the worst when I saw you talking to your ex” instead of “why were you talking to your ex?”
“I want to do something special, just the two of us, this weekend” instead of “you never make time for us.”

, If you and your partner have committed to openness and honesty, you may find yourself learning things that would otherwise have been kept hidden from you, or feeling compelled to share things you otherwise would have fibbed about. You might find it difficult to honor your promise to be accepting and appreciative of the truth.While it’s perfectly fine to feel a natural reaction to the truth, both members of the relationship must work to keep your reactions proportional.


For example, if your partner has cheated in the past, you might find it difficult to accept that they have any kind of attraction to anyone who isn’t you.
If you catch them looking at someone, or if they admit finding someone attractive, you’re allowed to feel uncertain — but not upset.
Be rational: acknowledge that everyone has attractions to good-looking people, but that attraction is not equivalent to infidelity.

, Don’t live in the past unless your partner does something that specifically calls for a discussion of it.


For example, don’t bring up how your partner has lied about their whereabouts in the past unless you find that they have lied about it anew.
Don’t go in search of lies. If your partner has promised to make a fresh start, demonstrate your trust in them, even if it’s hard. Hunting out lies may result in your partner resenting you if they are making a good-faith effort to hold up their end of the deal.

,


You must each make a commitment to the therapy, and embrace the experience openly.
Do the homework your therapist assigns; it’s designed to guide you through difficult conversations in a structured manner that decreases the chance for arguments.
Even if your partner refuses to attend sessions, seeking professional advice on your own can help you implement changes that will rebuild trust and strengthen your relationship.

Dress inconspicuously.,
Stare out of the window.,
Work on your unfriendly face.,
Keep busy.,
Behave in an unapproachable way.,
Wear a wedding ring or band.,
Stop the conversation.,
Don't to be shy to stop any attempt to ask you on a date.",How to Look Unapproachable to Men," Wear duller colors, such as blacks and navy blues. Dress conservatively if you are commuting to work daily, this should be quite easy. Dress to blend in with the crowd. Note the main colors that everyone else wears. If you stand out, someone may want to strike up a long, dull conversation about your boots. People are naturally attracted to bright cheery colors, like yellows and oranges. Wear your blazer on the bus to cover up any colorful garb.


You may also try another method of dressing to intimidate. An overly stylish trendy look can put a dampener on anyone's advances because you look inaccessible. Make sure you are covered up, as a slice of skin may give out the signal that you are okay with attention.;
, Look as if you have somewhere else to be. If it is summer, you can get away with wearing dark sunglasses that hide your eyes and give you privacy.

, Everyone has one, so find yours. Set your lips in a straight line and look past everyone on the subway car. Avoid eye contact as much as possible. Look as if you are tired, moody and have something else to do later.


Do not make eye contact in public places for a prolonged amount of time, people may think you want to speak.
Victoria Beckham developed a very stern face and it's one she is well known for. Follow her example.

, Take advantage of looking preoccupied with something else. You can use your phone, a Kindle or other digital device as a useful barrier to demonstrate your desire to be left well alone.


Hunch over your phone and push the earbuds in to play music. Most polite people will not try to get you to remove your earphones, it's considered rude or too much like hard work. If a person tries to speak to you while you are listening to music, they are impolite and inconsiderate. If this happens, it is perfectly okay for you not to remove your headphones to aid their needs unless it is an emergency. The person is impolite for not respecting your time and valuing their needs over yours. Wave them away or simply ignore them.
Keep your eyes fixed on your phone and play a few games.
Set your purse or bag on your lap––it creates a physical barrier between you and anyone familiar with good social behavior.
Some people are very rude and do not consider phones to be a ""leave me be"" sign. Bring an actual book and read it. Or simply refuse to engage.

, Look out the window. If someone sits besides you, avoid eye contact and turn your attention out the window. If someone speaks to you, do not smile, as a smile is mistaken for openness to pursue or carry on with the conversation. Keep your words short and to the point. A simple yes or no will suffice. Make your pauses longer than normal. Refuse to be drawn on saying anything further. Try a grimace, to demonstrate that any attempt to talk is irritating to you.

, In some countries, it can help to wear a wedding ring on the correct ring finger, as it's a good signal for you to be left alone. A thin band in gold plate or silver will keep certain men from striking up conversations with you. Rings can cost anywhere from 99 cents and beyond on major auction sites. Check out a thrift store for a ring that looks nice.


Make sure that the ring is not a burglar target or draws attention––if it's too sparkly, a man may want to converse about your ring for the purpose of getting it!

, A simple ""I had a long day, I am not in the mood for conversation"" will stop usually the most chatty person in their tracks. Do not be afraid to tell someone you are not interested, you do not owe anyone a date, time or conversation if you do not feel like it and they should respect that. Imagine how that character is going to be in a relationship where they do not respect your smallest opinion or personal space.


Tell the person you are too busy.
Say that you are not in the mood to carry on a conversation.
If your number is asked for, calmly state that you never hand your number out to strangers.
State that you are simply not interested.
If it's the morning, say that you have facts and figures to go over before getting to work and that you're too busy to talk.

, You do not owe anyone the time of day because they feel you should give them a chance to date you, no matter what society says. If the persistent stranger keeps flirting with you and asks for your number, be simple and blunt. Do not smile as you turn down his advances, he may try to persist if you smile. It is okay to not want to talk on the transit or hand your number over to a stranger after a long day at work.


Tell him you are busy and not looking for a relationship.
Tell him you are with someone else. Tell him your husband will be annoyed when you relate this attempt to flirt with him when you get home tonight
Mention that you are tired, that you've had a long day and that you're not in the mood to talk.
If he asks for your number, tell him you do not hand numbers over to complete strangers. Do not hand out a fake number, some men will try to phone you on the spot to make sure the number is real.
Say you are not interested. And then say absolutely nothing else and get back to what you were doing.

Seek professional counseling.,
Confront past traumas that may be affecting your relationship now.,
Be open with your partner about past traumas.,
Take ownership of the problems your issues might cause in the relationship.This will be difficult to do, as nobody wants to hurt their relationship.,
Admit that you’re not always right.The need to be right or to feel superior is a natural human inclination — everyone wants to be right.,
Practice mindfulness in your relationship.",How to Resolve Trust Issues in a Relationship2," Psychotherapy, also called “talk therapy,” is the best way to begin the process of overcoming your reluctance or inability to enter into trusting relationships. Whether you suspect otherwise trustworthy partners of betraying you or consistently choose partners who prove to be untrustworthy individuals, the first step toward healthy relationships is to work through underlying personal issues that may be influencing your behavior.Psychotherapy sessions are typically held once a week, and last for 50 minutes.
Sessions are goal-oriented, and your therapist will equip you with techniques you can implement in your day-to-day life to manage both the symptoms and causes of your underlying trust issues.
Depending on your therapist’s evaluation, you may be prescribed medication that will help control your overall anxiety, including that directed toward relationships.

, The problems you face trusting your partner today may well have deep-seated roots that extend into your current relationship. Traumas such as childhood abuse — verbal, physical, and sexual — are common causes of trust issues in adults; severe traumas should be addressed under the guided direction of a medical professional.


Trauma need not be dramatic or severe to have lasting repercussions, though.
For example, the separation of one’s parents is a trauma often overlooked because so many people experience it, but don’t seem to suffer lasting negative consequences.
Don’t compare the severity of your experiences to that of other people. Whatever pain you feel is valid, and needs to be addressed.
If you cannot see a therapist, keep a journal about your traumatic experience. Force yourself to write about the memories that bring you pain.

, Though you will have to do much of the work in overcoming your trust issues on your own, you must include your partner in the process if you want to improve your relationship. When you find that you are deep enough into a relationship to want a future with someone, you have to make a conscious decision to share your past, your fears, and your insecurities with them.


Make clear both to your partner and to yourself that you don’t expect them to solve your problems.
All your partner can or should do is listen and be supportive, but that will go a long way toward building a strong relationship of trust with them.

, However, if your inability to trust affects your partner in a negative manner, be willing to face them and admit that you have hurt them: “I’m sorry that I accused you of not loving me. Every day, you do something to prove me wrong, and I know that it doesn’t feel good to be accused of something like that.”


This will both show your partner that you recognize and appreciate them, and hold you accountable to yourself about the ways in which you externalize or take out your problems on your partner.

, However, the inability to acknowledge that you might be acting irrationally in withholding trust from your partner suggests an underlying problem that needs to be addressed.


Accept that you are wrong about any number of things in your daily life; simply because you believe something to be true does not mean that it is in fact true.
Generalize this acceptance to your perception of your partner’s trustworthiness. Your beliefs and the reality of the situation may not align as neatly as you want to believe.

, Mindfulness, in a therapeutic context, means being consciously present in a given moment of crisis or anxiety in order to experience and work through it openly. Although its roots are in Eastern meditative tradition, it's become increasingly popular in western therapy. Studies suggest that the practice of mindfulness results in a demonstrative reduction in anxiety, depression, and stress, and improves both a person’s ability to recall specific memories from the past that might otherwise be painful or blurry, and their overall quality of life.Accept that there is no “right” or “wrong” way to feel in a given situation; simply allow yourself to feel what you are feeling in the present moment.Don’t focus on past experiences that might cloud your experience of the present moment. For example, the fact that your parents divorced has no bearing on your current relationship.
Don’t worry about the future either; focus only on what’s happening right now.
To focus your attention on the present moment, concentrate on your breathing; feel the air enter your body, experience the feeling of holding it in your lungs for a long beat, then concentrate on exhaling slowly and steadily.
Pay close attention to the sensory detail around you: what are you hearing, smelling, feeling, tasting, and seeing around you? Absorb the details of the present moment.

Proceed with optimism.",How to Resolve Problems with Your Boyfriend," Some disagreements are important. Others, however, are fairly minor. If you disagree with your boyfriend o something, decide how much it bothers. Minor differences can sometimes be let go of, but major disagreements should be discussed.Sometimes, it can help to try to let an issue go for a few days and then see how you feel. For example, you get upset because your boyfriend went to a movie with his friends without asking you to join.
Instead of immediately talking things through, wait a few days. If you find your anger fades, this may be a minor issue for you. You may be better off letting it go. However, if you still feel stung and rejected after a few days have passed, talk things out.;
, If an issue keeps bothering you, there is probably more than meets the eye. Oftentimes, it's not just what your boyfriend did but how it made you feel. Small disagreements can point to problems in the dynamic of the relationship, so think about why something bothered you on a deeper level.For example, think about why you were upset your boyfriend went out without you. Is there anything missing in your relationship that made you take this slight very personally?
Oftentimes, minor disagreements are the result of not feeling valued. You may sometimes feel taken for granted by your boyfriend, which is why you became so upset over a movie. You may want to talk about how and why your emotional needs are not being met.

, If you decide you want to discuss something with your boyfriend, do not go into the conversation not knowing what you want. Spend some time thinking about what you want your boyfriend to understand before attempting to talk things out.What main points do you want your boyfriend to take away? Think about what you're trying to communicate. For example, you want your boyfriend to appreciate you more. You should also think about how to best deliver that message. Spend some time planning what you're going to say.
Think about what you want to get out of the conversation. Do you want your boyfriend to change some specific aspect of his personality? Do you want him to understand your perspective more? Know this before moving forward with the conversation.

, It's always a good idea to plan your talk ahead of time. You should let your boyfriend know you would like to discuss something. The two of you should plan a time that works for you both.You want to pick a time when you will both be relaxed and willing to listen. Do not choose to talk just after work or school, when you're likely to be stressed, or a time when you have outside commitments.
Pick a time to talk when you both have a good deal of free time and will be relaxed and willing to listen. For example, talk on a Saturday afternoon when your boyfriend does not have work and you're both relaxed.

, You do not want to launch into a confrontation sounding accusatory or angry. It's always better to start off with a soft approach. This way, your boyfriend will be more willing to listen.For example, do not begin with something like, ""I don't like that you went to see that movie without even inviting me, even though you knew I wanted to see it.""
Instead, start by saying something nice. For example, ""I'm glad you have such a strong friends group. I think that's important and it's nice to see you have fun. I want you to enjoy yourself."" Then, introduce the issue by saying something like, ""But I just wish I felt more included sometimes, and I was hurt that you went to see that movie without inviting me.""

, Remember, you want to resolve this issue and not just argue about it. Using statements that begin with ""I"" and use language like ""I feel"" reduces blame. You are not blaming your boyfriend or judging his behavior. You are simply stating how that behavior made you feel.Say something like, ""I feel left out sometimes when you spend more time with your friends than me."" This sounds less harsh than, ""You spend too much time with your friends so I'm left out all the time.""

, Conflicts always involve two people. Your boyfriend likely had reasons for behaving and acting the way he did. After you have stated your case, listen to your boyfriend without interrupting. Make sure he feels heard as well.Do not try to discuss solution while your boyfriend is talking. You should listen to his perspective and attempt to understand it before you try to correct the situation.
It can help to repeat what he's saying to make sure you understand. For example, ""So, you feel like you want time just with your friends on occasion. Is that what you're saying?""

, Relationships are about compromise and mutual understanding. While your boyfriend should value your feelings and make necessary changes, you also need to make sure your expectations are reasonable. Be willing to compromise when discussing potential solutions.For example, people often squabble about how much time they should spend together. You cannot expect your boyfriend to spend all his time with you and should not ask him to do as much.
However, there are reasonable requests you can make of your boyfriend. Maybe if the time you spent together was more meaningful, you would feel more valued and need less time together. You could ask him to be more present when you hang out by, say, putting away his phone and focusing on you.

, After a disagreement, try to end things on a positive note. State the things you appreciate about your boyfriend so you both leave feeling valued. End things by saying something like, ""Thank you for listening. I really love you and love spending time with you, which is why I brought it up. I don't want anything to cause resentment."", It's normal to feel awkward or uncomfortable after a disagreement. It is not possible to feel comfortable, happy, and resentment free all the time. Allow yourself to feel what you're feeling, even if it's negative, after a disagreement.It's healthier to process your emotions than push them down and ignore them. Even if you feel good about the discussion, you may still need time to let go of any angry feelings you had during your argument.

, You and your boyfriend can resolve disputes by identifying your goals for the relationship. What do you both want and how can you pursue that?Think about what you both want. You should find goals you both share. For example, you both may want to work on valuing one another more.
Consider how to achieve this. You could, for example, spend more time together, turn your phones off during dates, and find other ways to make one another feel valued.

, It can feel rough and uncomfortable to have a dispute. However, look at the bright side. You have taken the initiative to work things out. You have both expressed yourselves and your opinions. While things may be stressful now, your relationship may be stronger in the future."

Be honest and upfront when saying no.,
Cushion the “no” between compliments about that person.,
Say “no” in person or over the telephone whenever possible.,
Apologize for not being available.,
Announce that you’d like other people to join you on your “date.” This is an indirect way to say no, since it shows that you enjoy spending time with that person, but are not interested in spending time one-on-one.,
Consider whether you have any single friends that would be an ideal match for that person.,
Explain that you want to become good friends with a person before dating them.,
Be mindful of tone and delivery regardless of how you say no to a date.,
Use “I” statements when explaining your reason for saying no.",How to Say No to a Date," Your “no” can be accompanied with your true reason for not dating that person, or you can simply say “I’m not interested, but thank you for asking.” Making up lies or excuses about why you’re saying no can backfire and look obvious, and make you seem dishonest and hurtful.;
, This reveals that you care about the person, even though you’re saying no. For example, tell the person you enjoy spending time with them, followed by “no” or “I’m not interested,” then end the statement saying you value your friendship and don’t want to risk it through dating.

, This shows you have integrity, and that you’re courteous and mindful enough about the other person’s feelings to say no in person. For example, if a person asks you out via text message, email, or through a friend, go out of your way to deliver the news in person or via the telephone.

, This helps soften the blow when you don’t feel comfortable with a direct “no,” and can make the other person feel as though they met you at the wrong time in your life. For example, say “I’m sorry, but I’m already dating someone right now.”

, For example, if an interested coworker asks you out for drinks after work, say you think it would be exciting and fun if everyone from your team at work also came along., This shows that you like the person enough to set them up with a friend who may be a more compatible match. For example, say no, then admit that you know someone who might be a better match.

, This response is most effective when you’re unsure about whether to date someone, or want to get to know someone better before going on an official date.Don’t say you want to be friends with someone before dating them if you don’t really mean it. This can backfire, and result in the person asking you out again in the future after you’ve become friends, which can make the situation awkward.

, Even kind words can sound mean and hurtful when you deliver them in a short, abrupt tone. When saying no, be calm and gentle to avoid hurting the other person’s feelings or making them feel too uncomfortable.

, This holds you accountable for your decision, and prevents you from sounding rude, condescending, or insensitive. For example, say “I don’t feel a connection with you,” instead of saying “You just aren’t compatible for me.”"

Consider how much fun you have with your lover.,
Notice how much confrontation you're experiencing.,
Consider whether your lover is being genuine around you.,
Be wary if your lover only makes you feel sad and bad about yourself all the time.,
Consider how much you communicate together.",How to Know when You Have Stopped Loving Someone," If you no longer have fun or laugh at each other's jokes, this is very telling. Laughter and being part of doing something silly together is usually a great way to have fun when you are in love. If you are no longer experiencing such feelings, it's time to sit down and have a serious talk with yourself. Figure out if this is the kind of relationship still working for––be honest with yourself on this one, as you cannot lie to your own heart and your own feelings, and most of all, you can never lie to yourself.
, Do you fight more often than ever before? When you fight more than having fun these days with each other, it is time to ask yourself the serious question - ""Is this really worth it?"" Is fighting all the time really what you want out of a relationship than having a good time? No, so why should you keep up with it any longer?, When your lover starts pretending to be something they are not, it is time to think long and very hard if this is the kind of thing you want for the rest of your life. If it seems to you that this person is longer being themselves around you, chances are they might be cheating; it's quite possible that they have someone else in their lives already and they do not feel the need to interact with you in the form of who they once were towards you anymore., Why do you need to be sad all the time when you could be laughing and having fun? If you find yourself in the position where you only cry more than you laugh and the other person makes you feel that way most of the time, it is indeed time to move on. Moving on might not be the easiest thing to do, but in the end it will be better for you, as nothing could be worse than ending up with a broken heart., If you no longer have anything at all to say to one another, it is officially time to move on!"

Check for codependency.,
Identify power struggles.,
Question if your partner is open-minded.,
Notice commitment issues.,
Look for a lack of empathy.",How to Know if Your Relationship Is Holding You Back1," A codependent relationship describes an unbalanced partnership in which one partner sacrifices themselves in the name of helping or “rescuing” the other. Such dysfunctional relationships can hinder personal growth in various ways, depending on who’s doing the enabling.


If you are the enabler, constantly accommodating your partner’s unhealthy or irresponsible behavior may require so much of your energy that there is little left over for your own individual growth. On the contrary, if your partner is enabling you, staying in this relationship could be building an attitude of learned helplessness within you.There may be more subtle forms of codependency at play as well. Consider if you are hesitant to push yourself out of your comfort zone — if you relationship is based mostly on feeling comfortable, with little growth happening.
If you notice signs of codependency in your relationship, you should seek professional counseling right away. Signs may include lack of personal boundaries, people-pleasing, and excessive control.;
, Feeling powerless in life or in the relationship can lead to one partner exerting undue power over the other. To prove their power, your partner may place unrealistic demands on you. Insecurity, fear of abandonment or concern about their own lack of accomplishment can show up as lack of support or even jealousy.For instance, if you come home with a great idea or good news, does your partner ask, “Why would you want that? Why can’t you be happy with how thing are?” This could be a sign of your partner using guilt-trips or control to keep you stagnant.

, Do you feel like you have to conform to your partner’s expectations or preferences? Narrow-minded people can be terribly difficult to deal with in general, but a narrow-minded partner can feel suffocating. When one partner is narrow-minded, it can feel like you are being held back from exploring new aspects of life.


For example, you share a dream of traveling the world, and your partner is outraged. “We can’t afford that! It’s too dangerous to travel now-a-days!” Their response makes you less likely to explore and share your interests and dreams.
A healthy relationship features two partners who have both mutual and separate interests. If you find yourself having to give up passions because they differ from your partner’s, you could be being held back., Consider whether you are ready for a deeper commitment but your partner is not. Sometimes, being held back means one person wants to move forward in the relationship while the other person is happy where they are.


If you and your partner have been together for some time, yet they refuse to advance the relationship to the next level, this could translate into you being held back from getting the fulfillment you desire in a partnership., Perhaps you are held back in the way that your partner isn’t able to provide the emotional support you need. You keep waiting around for them to build you up or support you, but it never happens.


If your partner is emotionally detached or immature, you could be missing out on the opportunity to be with someone who can be vulnerable and empathetic with you."
"
Determine if you have a clear sense of self.,
Ask yourself whether you are going after your dreams.,
Check for hopelessness.,
Make sure you have actually been communicating your needs.,
Be honest with yourself.",How to Know if Your Relationship Is Holding You Back2," Do you feel defined by your partner or the relationship? Everyone changes during the course of a relationship; however, if you feel like your relationship stole your sense of identity, it’s common to feel held back.


This can be an easy fix. You can develop separate interests and pursue new friendships to regain a sense of self in the relationship; however, if your partner stands in the way of this, this could indicate a bigger problem.Pursue your individual hobbies and make sure you both have friends outside of the relationship. You may want to plan an evening each week in which you each hang out with your own group of friends (sometimes this is in the form of a ""girls night"" or a ""poker night"").

, Has being in a relationship caused you to think small? Did you once have wild dreams that have now disappeared? During the course of a relationship, it’s normal to modify your dreams and goals to run parallel with your partner’s. But, if you have given up your personal aspirations for the sake of the relationship, you could be being held back from reaching greater heights.Or, ask yourself if you have put aside your own aspirations to support your partner's dreams. Do you want to write a novel, but you spend all your free time going to your partner's shows to support their musical career?

, A clear sign that your relationship is holding you back is letting go of dreams and no longer trying to progress in certain areas of your life. If you feel hopeless that things will get better, or you have to convince yourself of the light at the end of the tunnel, your relationship could be a detriment to both your personal growth and your mental health.


A healthy partnership should enrich your life, not make you question “Is this all there is?” Hopelessness can be a sign of depression. If you believe your relationship is making you depressed, talk to your doctor as soon as possible., Losing your identity, giving up on your dreams and feeling hopeless can all make you feel stuck, but these obstacles can be overcome. If you haven’t been communicating your dissatisfaction with your partner, then you can’t justly blame your relationship for your unhappiness.


Have you sat down and clearly communicated your thoughts and feelings to your partner? If you haven’t, then you need to pencil in a time to talk. Your partner may be willing to work with you to make the relationship more satisfying.
If you have talked to your partner about your feelings and there was no change, it may be time to move on from this relationship in order to find greater fulfillment., See if you are confusing being held back with your own complacency or fear. In some cases, you can fall prey to the notion that “the grass is always greener on the other side.” You believe your relationship is holding you back when, in fact, you’re immobilized because you’re comfortable where you are or you’re afraid to try something new.


Assess your expectations. Have you been blaming your partner for a lack of progress in your own life? Are you placing the key to your happiness in your partner’s hands? Keep in mind that you are the only one who can make you happy.You may want to take a solo day or weekend trip to gain some perspective. Ask if you are taking responsibility for your own happiness and fulfillment. A solo getaway provides you with the time and space to self-reflect without the influence of your partner.

Talk to a friend.,
Decide what you want to do.,
Communicate with your partner.,
See a couples therapist.",How to Know if Your Relationship Is Holding You Back3," A little perspective can help you get to the bottom of your relationship quandary. Reach out to a close friend or family member who knows you well. Ask this person what they think.


You might say, “Hey, Don, I’m concerned that my relationship with Toni is holding me back. I don’t feel like she supports me or encourages me to push towards my goals. What’s your opinion?”
Your friend may shed some insight that you didn’t notice. For instance, they may respond, “Well, I obviously don’t know what’s going on behind closed doors, but I am concerned that she doesn’t want you to hang out with friends. She seems very controlling.”, After you have considered the aspects of your relationship that make you unhappy and sought advice from a friend, you have to make a decision. Will you express your feelings to your partner? Will you come up with ways of growing while maintaining your current relationship? Or do you want to end the relationship?, Whichever route you choose, you will need to have a forthright conversation with your partner about your feelings. Pull your partner aside and let them know that you want to talk. Schedule a time when you both can dedicate your full attention to the discussion. Turn off your phones and remove any distractions.


If this is your first time bringing this up, you might say, “I feel like I am not being supported by this relationship. I feel held back. I wanted to share my feelings so we can brainstorm options to improve the relationship.”If you are choosing to end the relationship, you might say, “I have put a lot of thought into this, and I think we should break it off. We have completely different goals for our futures. By staying together, we are sacrificing our goals for the relationship. I want us both to achieve our dreams, so I think it’s best if we break up.”

, If you both want to work on the relationship and find ways to make it mutually satisfying, you should consult with a couples therapist. A therapist can help you identify roadblocks that are hindering your growth (individually or together) and help you overcome these barriers.

Be respectful.,
Keep the PDA to a minimum.,
Follow up your meeting.,
Find out his interests.,
Open up to him.",How to Impress Your Girlfriend's Father," When your girlfriend’s father opens the door, the first thing he will notice is how you are dressed. You don’t want to turn up in a sloppy sweatshirt and torn jeans. Even if it is a casual event, you need to look presentable. Ensure that your clothes are clean and well-ironed. If you are wearing shoes, ensure they are polished.Avoid t-shirts with bold graphics of your favorite band or offensive slogans.;
, Part of making a good first impression involves your demeanor during the first greeting. You want your girlfriend’s father to feel like you are a warm person who is easy to get along with after he meets you for the first time. Remember to make eye contact with your girlfriend’s father and smile.
You should also include a more formal aspect of calling him by his last name (for example, Mr. Jones) until he tells you to call him by his first name.

, Most men appreciate a strong handshake. And your girlfriend’s father is probably hoping for a sign of strong character when he meets you so he knows you can take care of his daughter. That may seem like a lot to read into a simple handshake, but it is often the truth.


Take his hand firmly in yours and grip tightly – but not too tightly.
A limp or weak handshake will probably not make the best first impression.

, Find out what your girlfriend’s father likes. The safest bet is to bring food or a drink, especially something that goes well with dinner. You can also opt to bring flowers, or a gift for your girlfriend's mother. Bringing a gift to your girlfriend's mother shows your girlfriend's father an example of how you might treat his daughter.

, It is normal to be nervous, but you need to control it. It’s only when you feel great that you give out positive vibes. It is even good to appear nervous at first and then relax later. It makes her father know that you are taking this meeting seriously.


There are many ways to treat your nervousness. Consider some mild relaxation exercises, like yoga and deep breathing. You could also try meditation.
Some people feel better after a short mental distraction, like watching a comedy show on TV or listening to some soothing music.

, Smile a lot and speak with confidence. Shake hands firmly with your girlfriend’s father. Prepare a few sentences about yourself and your career or aspirations. Avoid talking too much about yourself. Rather, ask questions about your girlfriend’s father and show interest in what he has achieved.For example, you could say, ""I'm a software engineer at a small company, and ultimately I'm looking to move to a management role. I visit my parents down south every couple of weekends, and I also love to windsurf.""
You could also say something like, ""I'm not sure what I want to do exactly with my career, but I definitely want to do something creative in the New York theater world. Right now I'm working on a play with a friend that I'm hoping to get published soon.""

, People enjoy conversing with others who seem interested in what they have to say. Listen intently when others speak and add thoughtful comments to the conversation. Ask follow-up questions when they seem appropriate and avoid controversial topics when possible.Tell a funny anecdote about yourself so your girlfriend’s father feels like he’s getting to know you a little bit.

, Checking your phone constantly is considered rude during most social engagements, or at the very least a sign of disinterest. If you want to impress her father, stay off your phone while you’re hanging out with the family.People from older generations can be especially critical of this kind of compulsive phone checking. So her father might interpret this behavior as very rude.

, A lot of people try being humorous or witty. While these are amazing qualities to have, they can often backfire. However, being respectful does not have drawbacks. This does not mean you need to pay a lot of compliments. There are many ways to show respect. Avoid laid back postures. Mind your Ps and Qs.If your girlfriend's parents offer you food, make sure that you say ""please,"" ""thank you,"" or, if applicable, ""no, thank you."" Good manners are always impressive.
Use your manners and call your girlfriend's dad ""Sir"" or ""Mister.""

, Nothing will turn a father off more than seeing you fondling, kissing, and groping his daughter. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t put your arm around her occasionally or hold her hand – just keep the public displays of affection to a minimum around her father.


The only kiss you should give your girlfriend in front of her father is a quick hello or goodbye peck.

, After your first meeting, do not behave as if your girlfriend’s father does not exist. Follow up your meeting with a phone call. If you feel apprehensive about calling, you can send him a thank you card or gift for inviting you over and treating you well. You could find out what he likes and buy an appropriate gift.For instance, if he is fond of poker, you can get him a new deck of playing cards, or some poker-themed glasses.
You could also give him a nice bottle of bourbon or a nice cigar as a thank you.

, Learning about another person gives you more topics to talk about. You may even discover some common ground you didn’t know existed. Try to find out some things about your girlfriend’s dad so that you can initiate conversations in the future about these topics.


Or you can learn about his interests so that the two of you could do something together. For example, you could invite her dad to go golfing with you if you discover he enjoys golfing.

, Part of being accepted by your girlfriend’s father depends on letting him feel like he is really getting to know you, and not just on a surface level. Be open with him about your opinions and beliefs. Tell him stories about your family. Help him get to know the real you.Make sure you choose appropriate stories that cast you in a good light, especially at first.
And be able to back up your opinions if you venture into a political discussion.

Don’t accept abuse.,
Seek understanding without justifying their hurtfulness.",How to Ignore People Who Don't Care About You1," People who have hurt you by betraying your trust or being overly critical can and often should be ignored. People who have actually hurt you physically or emotionally do not deserve to be let off so easy.


Yes, you should absolutely cut off contact with someone who has physically or emotionally abused you. But do not hesitate to contact the proper authorities if you feel unsafe or believe this is a pattern of behavior likely to be repeated.;
, There is a fine line to walk here. You should never feel like you deserve to be mistreated, but you can consider what role you may have played in another’s lack of concern or care.


For instance, you shouldn’t blame yourself for your boyfriend cheating on you, but you can examine how your jealousy, lack of attention, or some other factor may have given him an excuse to justify his hurtfulness.
People seek out the type of relationships they had in their childhood, even if they weren't productive relationships. This process is mostly subconscious. See if you're pursuing relationships with people who remind you of your past relationships."

Seek counseling, if necessary.",How to Ignore Your Husband," If your husband is angry or in a bad mood, sometimes it's better to disengage. Angry people are often difficult to reason with. In this situation, it's appropriate and even healthy to simply ignore your husband until he calms down.


Oftentimes, a bad mood leaves someone looking for a fight. If your husband had a bad day at work, for example, he may overreact to a small indiscretion on your part. If you know your husband is in a bad mood, do not take it personally if he snaps at you.If your husband is angry and trying to cause an argument, the best response is to tune him out. Ignoring provocation may feel like defeat. However, it's actually more productive. An angry person is not going to listen to logic or reason and will not relent even when you try to apologize or defend yourself. If your husband tries to bait you into an argument, simply respond with short phrases, like ""Yes"" or ""Okay"" until he gives up and leaves you alone.This is not a longterm solution. In the immediate moment, ignoring your husband's anger can be a good means of coping but it's not something you should regularly have to do. On occasion, everyone slips up and lashes out at a loved one due to a bad day or bad mood. However, when it's a regular occurrence it can become a real problem. If your husband is temperamental by nature, you should have a sit down talk with him about this behavior.;
, If you and your husband are arguing late into the night, sometimes it's better just to go to bed. Try to ignore any bad feelings you're having towards your husband and get some sleep. If you're still upset in the morning, you can talk when you've both calmed down.


If it's late and you and your husband are arguing, tell him you're going to bed. Try to ignore whatever he did to upset or frustrate you. You can try relaxation techniques, like flexing your toe muscles, deep breathing, and counting exercises. These will help you ignore the situation and fall asleep faster.
If you're arguing late at night, you're more likely to say something you don't mean. Your brain deteriorates when you're tired, making it difficult to explain your frustrations to your partner. You'll also be more irritable later at night. By morning, you'll have a more positive outlook and be better equipped to work through the problem and make up., Everyone has bad habits. Oftentimes, people are not even consciously aware of a behavior that may be annoying to others. If your husband has a habit or tendency that grates on you, it may be better to ignore it than try and change it.


Unfortunately, some bad habits simply do not change. Your husband may consistently forget to throw out the orange juice container when it's empty even when you remind him multiple times. In this case, it might be best to just resign yourself to doing this task on your own. Accepting your husband's bad habits can make them easier to ignore.You can also settle for a partial victory in some situations. Your husband might never remember to put his dirty towel in the hamper after a shower, for example, but maybe he'll stop leaving it on the floor of your bedroom.Detach yourself from your behaviors that annoy you. Don't take it personally. A bad habit, like leaving the lights on in an empty room, is simply his own bad habit. It has nothing to do with how much he values or respects you.

, If you're having trouble ignoring your husband, get busy. The best way to cope is sometimes through distraction. Read a book, go for a bike ride, take up a new hobby, clean the house. There are many things you can do to take your mind off your husband for a few hours. This can help you ignore him and, when you're ready, talk out the problem or situation., If you feel the need to ignore your husband for a bit, you don't have to be caustic about it. There are ways to ignore someone politely. This is a more adult way to handle marital tensions.


When your husband is in the room, acknowledge his present in somewhat formal ways. While you may normally be more casual at home, when ignoring your husband try to act as if you're being polite to someone at a party you're attending. Nod when he speaks, smile when appropriate, but don't engage him in small talk or other conversation.You can also try to avoid being in the same room as your husband. For example, you could move to the bedroom if he's in the living room. You can let him know by excusing yourself in a brief, formal manner. For example, say something like, ""If you don't mind, I think I'm going to go upstairs.""

, If you're not in the mood to speak to your husband, try indirect communication. The silent treatment can be incredibly cruel and is generally ineffective at resolving disputes.If you're upset with your husband and feel the need to ignore him, find a way to communicate so he's not left baffled. You can text him or leave him notes, for example, without actually speaking to him.


You should let your husband know upfront if you're upset about something and need space for a few days. If you're too angry to talk about it, write him a letter or send him an e-mail explaining yourself. Do not simply ignore him without warning.

, This is another great way to ignore someone without fully resorting to the silent treatment. You can ignore your husband by giving him curt responses. You can respond to him with things like, ""Mmmhmm"" and ""Okay."" Such short forms of communication leave little opportunity for true conversation. This can help convey to your husband you're not in the mood to engage with him at the moment., If you feel inclined to ignore husband, it's important that you examine that inclination. In a relationship, it's very rare that one person is entirely to blame for a negative situation. It's possible you're inadvertently taking out your own bad mood or unhappiness on your husband. Spend some time considering what is bothering you.


Is there anything you could be doing differently in your marriage? Are you not as present as you used to be? Do you sometimes take your husband for granted? Are there ways you could engage with annoying behaviors in good humor?Is there a deeper issue that's bothering you? If you're stressed or unhappy about something, even if it's unrelated to your marriage, this can come out in subtle ways. For example, if you're unhappy at work you may be more irritable. You may find yourself wanting to tune out your husband's anecdote about his trip to the gym. If there's something in your life that's bothering you, talk to your husband about your concerns. Then, make an effort to change your circumstances so you're a happier person overall.

, However, it may not simply be an issue on your end. If you consistently find yourself wanting to ignore your husband, your marriage may be in danger.Your husband may talk to you in a way you dislike. You may feel like the two of you don't have time for one another anymore. You may be unsatisfied sexually in some capacity. If you find there's an issue the two of you should mutually work through, it needs to be addressed. Ignoring your husband is not a viable solution longterm.

, It can be stressful to talk about a major issue in your marriage. You can work on eliminating some of this stress by planning when and where you're going to talk.


Choose a place free of distractions. Don't talk about your marriage in a crowded restaurant, for example. Instead, agree to sit down in the living room with the television set off.
Avoid external time constraints. For example, if you have a PTA meeting at 7 o'clock don't plan to talk about your marriage at 6 o'clock. Pick a weekday or weekend night when neither of you have plans or external commitments.

, When discussing what's bothering you, it's important to use ""I"" statements. These are statements constructed in a way to emphasize feeling while minimizing objective judgement or blame.


An ""I"" statement should focus primarily on how you feel about a situation. You want to take responsibility for your own feelings. This minimizes judgement. You're not stating an objective fact about your marriage. You're merely expressing your feelings about a situation.An ""I"" statement has 3 parts. You start with ""I feel,"" then state your emotion, and then explain why you feel that way.When discussing your marriage, do not say something like, ""It's inconsiderate when you lash out at me after a bad day at work."" Instead, phrase this using an ""I"" statement. Say something like, ""I feel hurt when you take out a lousy workday on me because I don't want to be in a relationship where getting yelled at is the norm."", Sometimes, you may need a few days to cool down after a disagreement. You may find yourself ignoring your husband in a verbal sense as the two of you talk less. However, you should make up for the lack of communication by using non-verbal forms of reassurance. Be more physically affectionate with your husband. Hug and kiss him goodbye. Hold his hand or put your hand on his knee when you're sitting together. Work to make him feel secure in the relationship even when the two of you are frustrated with each other., If you feel the need to ignore your husband, this is a sign of trouble in a relationship. While it's healthy to ignore or overlook certain flaws, there are some negative aspects of a relationship that need to be addressed.


If your husband has an anger problem, this warrants discussion. As stated, it can be healthy to ignore anger in the moment. However, if your husband habitually lashes out at you when he's mad you need to have a sit down talk.Addiction is toxic to a relationship. If your husband has a problem with drugs or alcohol, you should talk to him about seeking treatment. Do not just ignore the problem.Unless you have an open marriage, affairs should not be ignored. If you suspect infidelity, confront your husband., Taking your partner for granted can cause serious damage to a relationship.Even if you're frustrated with your husband, try to appreciate the good he does.


Even minor things, like going grocery shopping or taking out the garbage, deserve a ""thank you"" and a kiss. Most people get a buzz of happiness when someone expresses gratitude or affection.
You often forget to appreciate someone if you've been together for a long time. Try to periodically remind yourself how you would react if your husband was a stranger. You wouldn't hesitate to say ""Thank you"" if a stranger opened a door for you or offered your a seat on the bus. Do not forget to thank your husband., The silent treatment involves simply ignoring someone who upset you as a form of punishment. It's toxic to a healthy marriage. It's a passive-aggressive means of coping with a problem that only leads to miscommunication and confusion. You should never use the silent treatment on your husband as it's a form of manipulation. If you need some space for a few days, let your husband know why you are mad and why you may be more quiet than usual., Remember, ignoring someone is incredibly hurtful. Many people find being ignored worse than being yelled at or confronted. If you need your space for a set period of time, that's fine. It's also okay to ignore a specific behavior or habit. However, ignoring your husband altogether will leave him hurt and confused. Do not stop communicating with your husband for more than a few days. Also, let him know ahead of time if you need a break or space. This will lessen the blow., Ignoring your spouse can be a sign of marital trouble. If you frequently find yourself wanting to ignore your husband, talk to him about seeing a qualified marriage counselor. A good counselor can provide the two of you with tips and tricks to get your marriage back on track. You can find a marriage counselor by getting a list of in-network therapist from your insurance. You can also ask a current therapist or doctor for a referral.

Work on your other relationships.,
Find your outlet(s).,
Take comfort in those who do care.,
Focus on what you can control.",How to Ignore People Who Don't Care About You2," If you stop focusing on the people who don't care about you, you can focus instead on establishing healthy relationships with people who do care about you very much.


If you need to meet people, see if you can go outside your present social circle at the moment.
If you're in high school, look for activities you can join that you will enjoy and that will give you an opportunity to meet people.

, Once you determine that you must cease contact with someone who has hurt you, you may need to find ways to take your mind off them, or activities to help fill the void left by their absence (if it was a close relationship, for instance).


Almost as if you are quitting smoking or another vice, think of this as a chance to start a healthy habit in place of a bad relationship. For instance, if you like art, you can try joining a pottery or a painting class. Or, you can try something you've always wanted to do, like rock climbing. Jogging, cycling, or yoga can be good for the body and mind. A gourmet cooking class or family history project can be an enlightening distraction.
Another classic saying is appropriate here: life is short. Consider this an opportunity to pursue your passion, freed perhaps from someone who was holding you back or shutting down your dreams. Take your shot at becoming an actor or sculptor; go back to school for that degree you never finished; see the Great Wall of China., Many, if not most, people notice and hold onto negatives more than positives, so it can be easy to let one hurtful relationship cloud all the caring relationships in your life. Let removing the bad be an opportunity to cherish the good.It is easy to say you’re not going to care what anyone thinks of you anymore, but in reality we all desire at least some amount of validation from others. Be selective in whose opinions should really matter to you.Take the time to thank a good friend for always being there for you, or your sister for standing by your side in difficult times. Use the time you gain by ignoring a hurtful person to spend more with those who truly care.

, As much as we like to think it so, we cannot change other people, only ourselves. You can’t make someone care about you if they don’t want to. The most you can do in situations where you are dealing with people who don't care about you is to find out why it bugs you so much. It's an opportunity for you to grow from it.


Examine how you feel about the uncaring person’s lack of concern. This will provide insights into your needs, and what adaptations you may be able to make to move past feeling a need for acceptance from that person.It’s a simple and old axiom, but it is still as true as ever: you can’t please everyone. Some people aren’t going to like you no matter what, so focus on caring about yourself by being true to yourself."
"
Consider their motives and reasons.,
Try to remedy the situation.,
Choose not to care — without being uncaring.,
Live your life for you.",How to Ignore People Who Don't Care About You3," Sometimes it is more difficult to deal with someone who doesn’t even seem to know or care you exist, as opposed to someone who seems directly interested in being hurtful. Take time to think about possible reasons for their seeming indifference toward you.


Modern technology has brought us the dreaded “person-who-never-texts-me-back,” and this version of being ignored can be quite frustrating to some. Consider, however, whether this thoughtless person may just in fact be very busy with work, family, or something else, or simply not a gung-ho texter like you.Sometimes, what appears to be indifference is really just the result of a misunderstanding. Maybe your grandmother doesn’t seem to care about your acting on your dream to become an internet entrepreneur because she has no idea what it is you are doing (and thus how important it is to you), even though you explained it to her., Before turning a blind eye to someone who seems to be doing the same to you, think about ways to resolve the situation favorably for both parties.


Raise your concerns tactfully. Don’t accuse or blame the person (“You’re a phony,” or “You’re self-centered and inconsiderate”). Instead, let them know how you feel.
For instance, say “I feel unimportant to/ignored by you” or “I’m sad you’re not interested in friendship with me.” If necessary, however, establish your limits: “I’m going to stop initiating contact with you.”The other person may not respond favorably even to a tactful approach; if so, remain calm and reiterate your view, then let things end at that. Feel secure that you have done what you can.

, Not caring what someone else thinks (or doesn’t think) about you requires a conscious decision and ongoing effort on your part. Not caring, however, is not the same thing as being uncaring.You can stop being concerned about someone’s actions or views without losing your compassion for their well-being as a fellow person. You’re doing what you need to for the benefit of your own health and well-being, not to harm or punish them.
Ignoring some people is going to be more difficult than others, of course. You may not be able to dissociate from a co-worker or relative. Instead, you’ll have to emotionally detach; in other words, practice a “cognitive reframing” whereby you interact superficially without letting the other person impact you., As mentioned before, no one can be universally liked, and life is too short to be overly concerned about how others feel about you.


Being ignored hurts, and choosing to ignore someone in return, even when done as kindly as possible, may hurt both of you. In the end, however, you have a responsibility to do what is best for you.Living life for you doesn’t mean you can’t let others in, or be caring, compassionate, or loving. It does mean you should live without fear or regret.
As mentioned previously, take the opportunity to try something new, or do something you’ve always wanted.
Whether others care about you or not, you should always care about you. This is all you can control.

Wait to text him back.,
Don’t initiate conversation.,
Flirt with other people.,
Let him know that you’re busy.,
Give him space.",How to Ignore a Guy That You Like1," When you get a text from a guy you like, it is very exciting. You will want to write him back right away. But not so fast! If you make him wait, he’s more likely to chase you.Wait anywhere from one hour (if it is a direct and specific question) to one day (if it just a casual ""hello"") before responding to a text.
You may want to set a timer or a reminder for yourself.;
, When you’re thinking about a special guy, anything can remind you of him. You may be compelled to reach out to him, to mention a song you heard or invite him to do something fun. But instead of initiating conversation with him, wait for him to contact you.You may want to write down things that you want to say to him.
This way, when he initiates conversation, you have a few interesting comments to use.

, If you are out at a party with a guy that you like, go ahead and flirt with other people. Let the guy you like see you dance with another guy, or put your hand on someone’s shoulder. Let him see you laughing and having fun. This will make him want you more.Go up to a friend at a party and say something funny.
Find extra reasons to stand close to someone, or find reasons to touch them.

, You will seem more attractive to him if he sees that you don’t need him to stay busy. Find fun ways to spend your time, such as making plans with friends or joining a club, and keep your schedule full. Make him work around your schedule if he wants to spend time with you.If he calls you and wants to go out on Friday night, say “I’d love to, but I have plans that day. Can we do Saturday instead?”

, When your guy would rather play basketball with his friends than go see a movie with you, don’t let it bother you one bit. Just shrug it off and do something with your friends instead. When he notices that you are giving him plenty of space, he will be drawn to you.If he makes plans with someone else and you feel upset, choose one person to talk about it with (someone who you trust) and then let it go.
Make sure he is not blowing you off or ditching you. If you had plans together first and he changes them (and if this happens more than once), it may be time to ignore him for good.

Check if your relationship is equitable.,
Consider the stress.,
Take a hard look at what their addiction has cost you.,
Notice if you are compensating for the person.,
Watch for isolation.,
Notice if the person is pressuring you to use.,
Think about your kids.",How to Know if You Should Leave Your Addicted Partner1," In a relationship, both of you should be giving and receiving. Addicts can be notoriously selfish. They may be completely focused on getting the next fix (whatever it is), and that fix often comes before other people in their lives. That means that your emotional needs may fall to the wayside, even as you try to support your partner. Begin by looking at your everyday life. If you're doing most of the work around the house, that's not fair to you. Your partner has to pull their weight, too, and they likely are not if they have a serious addiction.;
, When you have an addict as a partner, particularly one addicted to drugs or alcohol, you will always be worrying about getting that call at 2 am, that your partner has been in an accident and is in jail with a DUI, or worse. Living with that fear and stress can take a toll on your health and emotional well-being.In other addiction cases, such as a gambling or porn addiction, your partner may lose their job or drain your joint finances in pursuit of their addiction.

, Often, it's hard to admit your partner is an addict. That's the first step. However, it's also important to look at what it's done to your relationship. Think back to what the relationship was like before your partner was addicted (if there was a time), and compare it to how your relationship is now. How has it changed? You may notice it's significantly worse.If your partner has always been an addict, think about how your partner has enriched or deteriorated your quality of living. Having a partner should make your life better, not worse.

, Often, when a person is in a relationship with an addict, they may find themselves trying to make excuses for that person. For instance, you may find yourself lying for the person or making excuses to your friends and family. If you constantly find yourself apologizing for your partner, that's not a good sign., Sometimes, an addiction can cause you and your partner to pull away from other relationships because you are trying to hide the addiction. If you've noticed you've started backing out of social engagements with others that include your partner, take a moment to consider why. If it's because of the addiction, you need to evaluate your relationship.You may also notice that your partner doesn't want to attend any social gatherings, and they do anything they can to get themselves (and you) out of them.

, Your addicted partner might try to get you to join them in the addictive activity. They might tell you it will bring you closer, or they might withhold affection if you refuse. Even if you stay strong at first, your partner may wear you down with repeated requests to join them. Your partner should respect your decision not to engage in their addiction, and if they cannot accept this, it may be wise to leave before you are drawn into addiction as well.Notice if one or both of you need to be inebriated to feel close, show affection, or discuss the relationship. This can be a sign that your partner is influencing you to use.
Your partner likely knows that a healthy partner is unlikely to tolerate their behavior. They may think that getting you to use with them is a way to keep you from leaving the relationship.

, You may think that staying together no matter what is best for the kids. However, if your relationship has become so unbearable that you and your partner can barely stand each other, your kids are going to notice. High tension in your household will affect your kids, so think about whether they might be better off if you left your partner."

Wait a few days to respond to a request.,
Make him work around your schedule.,
Make him jealous.,
Drop hints that you might want out of the relationship.",How to Ignore a Guy That You Like2," If you want to make your attempts to ignore your guy a little subtler, one great option is to wait a few days to agree to hang out. If he wants to go meet up outside of school, you can let him know that you are interested, but that you need to figure out when you're available.


When he asks you to hang out, let him know that you have to get back to him.
Wait anywhere from one to three days to confirm.

, If the guy you like wants to spend time with you, make him work around your schedule. Don’t change your life to accommodate him. This is an excellent way to play hard to get and ignore your guy in a subtle way.In order for this to work, you've got to stay busy.
Fill your time with regular activities, such as a weekly date to do your nails with your friends or weekly trips to the bookstore to look at new books.

, Another effective way to ignore your guy is to pay some attention to somebody else. Making your guy a little bit jealous can be an excellent way to remind him how much he values you, and push him to give you the attention you deserve.You can make him jealous by texting or writing notes to someone else.
Another method is just to let him see you talking and having fun with others.
Be careful not to take this too far. You only want to make him a little bit jealous, not drive him away.

, If you are already going out with this guy, but he isn’t treating you the way you would like, you may want to drop some hints that you’re looking for the door. If he really cares about you, he will step up and make sure you stay.Talk about your plans for the summer (as if they do not include him).
Perhaps you are thinking about going away to a summer camp, or on a long road trip with family.
When you talk about the future (like where you will attend high school or college), try dropping a line like, “Well, we don’t really know what is going to happen with us.”

Let him know that it's over.,
Delete him from your phone.,
Ignore him on social media.,
Do not try to fix things.,
Do not wish him well on holidays.,
Keep yourself busy.,
Take some space from mutual friends.",How to Ignore a Guy That You Like3," If you have decided that this relationship is over for good, make sure that he knows it too. Speak to him in person (not over the phone) and be as clear as you can. Don't make him think you are just taking a break, or that he should wait for you.


You may say, ""We are not working out. I am moving on.""
You may say, ""This relationship has run its course. I am ready to try something new.""

, If you are trying to get over a guy (even if you still have feelings for him), you simply must ignore him. Begin by deleting him from your phone. If you cannot call or text him with the push of a button, you are less likely to reach out.If you want to write his number down somewhere, then go ahead.
But if you reach for your phone and want to call or text him, you will have to find the number and enter it in manually.
This extra step should be enough to stop the cycle and get you to set the phone down.

, If you want to get over a guy, you need to avoid seeing him, and this includes seeing him through the internet. You will need to completely ignore him on social media. If you do not want to ""unfriend"" him, then at the very least, you must ""hide"" or ""unfollow"" him. This will allow you the space you need to heal.

, When you are heartbroken, you are likely to imagine all the ways you could have done things differently. Chances are, you’ll be tempted to phone your ex and sort everything out. But if you’ve already decided to ignore this guy, don’t worry about fixing what has been done. Remember that it is not your job to fix things or make him feel better. Your only job is to take care of you.If you really need to sort things out, do it by writing things down.
You may also want to talk things over with a close friend.

, On his birthday, Christmas, the New Year, or any other holiday, you may be tempted to text him to wish him well. Don’t do this. You will just be opening a door that is better left shut.Text somebody else to wish them a happy holiday and then set the phone down.

, The best way to ignore your ex is to keep yourself busy. Maybe this means going on a date with somebody else, maybe this means spending quality time with your friends, or maybe this means staying home and watching movies with a pizza. Whatever you do, just stay busy and ignoring your ex will be a snap., If you and your ex shared a lot of mutual friends, you may need to take some time away from the whole group. Perhaps there are some new people at school you could spend some time with instead. By taking time away from your group of friends, you avoid running into your ex and make it easier to ignore him.


This may mean missing out on parties or other fun events, but it is only temporary, and it will be worth it.
This may even open you up to new friendship opportunities.

Look for signs of willingness to change.,
Encourage your partner to enter detox and/or rehab.,
Ask about counseling.,
Determine if you want to wait.,
Think about a separation.,
Consider how leaving may help your partner.",How to Know if You Should Leave Your Addicted Partner2," Some addicts can become sober if they work hard to change. Of course, the saying is an addict is always an addict, but if your partner is willing to do the work and stay vigilant, it may be worth staying.If your partner says they want to change, see if they follow through. If it's just words that they never back up with action, they may not be ready to get sober.
Other signs that your partner isn't willing to do the work include your partner constantly quitting recovery programs or relapsing all the time.

, If your partner is addicted to drugs or alcohol, they may need medical supervision to detox without serious side effects. Entering a rehabilitation program will provide your partner with the safety and support they need to overcome their addiction, such as therapy, coping mechanisms, exploring the underlying causes of their addictive behavior, and much more.

If your partner does not want to enter into treatment, contact a treatment center for advice. They can help you motivate your partner to seek help and enter treatment.

, One step that you may ask your partner to take is to see a counselor with you. Try to pick a counselor who specializes in addiction and couples counseling, if possible. That way, you'll have professional help in assessing the situation., Recovery is not an easy process, and it can take some people years. It takes an emotional toll on anybody else around the addict. You have a life to live, too, and you may not want to spend a chunk of your life helping someone become sober. On the other hand, you may decide it's worth the effort because of the commitment you've made to the person., If you're married, a legal separation may be a good way to wake your partner up to the issue. A separation is a way of saying (in a legal way) that you need time apart to work out whether you should stay together, but it's not a divorce. If you're not married, you could still ask to take some time away from your partner. It gives your partner time to work on recovery, and you time to figure out what you want your life to look like.If you're interested in this option, contact a divorce lawyer to discuss the legal side of things. If you're not married, sit down and have a discussion with your partner about the possibility.

, When your partner is still with you, they have you to fall back on. They can maintain their addiction because they have your support. That's not to say you're to blame for their addiction. Rather, it's important to note because if you withdraw your support, by leaving the person or (if married) getting a divorce, that can cause some addicts to hit rock bottom. In turn, they may finally get the help they need."

Leave if your partner is physically abusive.,
Look for signs of emotional abuse.,
Notice if your partner is controlling you.,
Pay attention to how your partner treats sex.",How to Know if You Should Leave Your Addicted Partner3," People who were caring can become mean and even abusive when they are under the influence of an addiction. If your partner physically harms you, perhaps hitting you, shoving you, or grabbing you hard enough to leave bruises, you need to leave the relationship.If your partner is violent towards others you care about, you are also being abused.
Make safety a priority. Find a safe place you (and your children and pets) can stay. If you feel that it is unsafe for your partner to know where you are, be especially conscious of where you go and who you tell.
Contact the National Domestic Violence hotline at 1−800−799−7233 for assistance in creating a safety plan to leave your partner.

, Abuse isn't always physical. Your partner may not hit or shove you, but they may neglect you altogether. Alternatively, they may belittle you, calling you stupid or saying that no one else will want you. If your partner is often mean and belittling to you, that's a sign of emotional abuse, and you should get out of the relationship.Your partner may also try to manipulate you. For instance, your partner may make you feel responsible for anything that goes wrong, or they may try to make you responsible for their feelings, such as saying things like, ""If you'd done it right, I wouldn't be so mad.""
When your partner uses, they may have extreme emotions that they take out on you. Your partner may get very angry while on a substance and direct that anger at you., Another sign of abuse is when someone tries to control you. For instance, your partner may limit your access to friends, try to control your medication, or watch what you're doing all the time. They may not like you to go out on your own. If your partner is always trying to push you to stay within certain unreasonable boundaries, that is a sign of abuse., Sex should always be an act where both parties enthusiastically consent. If your partner forces sex on you, that's obviously illegal. It gets a bit murkier when your partner manipulates you into having sex even when you don't want to. You may ""agree"" but not really want to do it, which is also abuse.For example, your partner may say, ""Your dinner was awful. You have to make up for it by having sex with me.""
Watch for signs of abuse in your children. If your partner has created an environment that's abusive for your children, you need to get you and your children out immediately.They may become more withdrawn, have behavioral problems or changes, or appear more depressed overall, just to name a few."

Identify deal breakers for a long term romance.",How to Handle Doubts About Your Whirlwind Romance and Marriage," Insecurities are a normal part of any relationship and may be more intense if your relationship unfolded quickly. Things like attraction to other people, worrying about getting along with family members, and feeling like you're settling may be normal. Try to accept insecurities as they come and remind yourself every romantic relationship comes with uncertainty.Doubt is to be expected in a relationship. You may occasionally be attracted to other people. Things may be awkward sometimes at family events. You may wonder if made the right choice marrying. It's normal to wonder ""What if?"" at times, and to recognize flaws and imperfections. No relationship is conflict free.
If fears and insecurities only creep in on occasion, they're probably normal. If, for example, once in awhile you wonder if your partner is right for you, that's fine. However, if it's a thought that occupies the majority of your emotional energy, it may be worth investigating on a deeper level. You may want to see a therapist to talk things over.;
, It can help to figure out the root of insecurities to address them head on. In a whirlwind romance, many insecurities are the result of the speed of the relationship. You may also have past baggage that is hampering your current worldview. Try to spend some time thinking about the root cause of your insecurities.Think about your early relationship models. These can often drive your perception of relationships later in life. Look at your parents relationship and your early relationships.
Try to identify any patterns that could drive insecurity in the present. For example, was your first major romantic relationship a whirlwind romance? Did it end poorly? A quick relationship is not always a bad thing. Many whirlwind romances are successful and positive, but if you had a bad experience with one in the past you may have your guard up.

, If you're feeling insecure in a relationship, you may find yourself looking for red flags everywhere. While it's important to be aware of your feelings in a relationship, do not let this spiral out of control. Avoid overthinking tiny interactions or gestures. Accept your partner is a separate person with a separate mind. There may be differences between the two of you that you have to accept.For example, your partner may phrase things slightly differently than you. While you may ask specific questions about your partner's day (""Did you have fun at work? How did that project turn out?""), your partner may ask more general questions (""How was your day?""). This does not mean your partner does not care about you. They may simply want to give you the option of what you want to discuss during conversation.
If things feel unbalanced in some way, it's okay to talk it out. If small things continue to bother you, there may be something bigger at play. However, if you choose to address small things, consider your partner's perspective first and keep this in mind when bringing it up. For example, ""I think we might communicate differently and I just want to clarify some things with you. Can we talk?""

, Seeking constant reassurance in a relationship can lead to a bad pattern. You may need more and more reassurance to feel safe and secure in a relationship, and rely on your partner's perception over your own self-esteem. Try to build yourself up when you feel insecure rather than constantly ask your partner for compliments and reassurances.For example, maybe you're worried your partner is not attracted to you. Examine whether there is any basis for this. Is your partner less interested in sex? Does your partner not see physically affectionate? If not, the insecurity may be in your head.
Take steps to make yourself feel more attractive rather than leaning on your partner for reassurance. For example, try working out more, eating healthier, or buying new clothing. You may find you're able to feel better about yourself on your own.

, Studies suggest that practicing self-love and self-compassion improves your overall well-being and happiness. This can subsequently improve your relationships with others. People who practice self-compassion and self-love are more confident and comfortable asserting their needs and opinions without having to rely on their partner's opinion for constant reassurance.

The more you practice kindness and compassion for yourself, the more able you will be to pass that kindness and compassion on to your partner.
Practice self-love by learning to set limits in your life, such as saying no to pressures that could harm you emotionally or physically. Learn to forgive yourself, and practice good self-care to help you better learn to love yourself., Relationships take work. A whirlwind romance may feel like it has a shelf life, but if you're married you should try to invest in the relationship. Throw yourself into the romance and prioritize working on moving forward with your spouse.Your fear may keep you from investing in a relationship. You may not want to get hurt again, especially if you were hurt in the past. However, your insecurity will only grow if you hold back.
Remind yourself relationships are about learning and changing. Things may not always work out the way you envisioned, and that's okay. It's worth taking the chance to make things work, even if it's scary.

, Strengthening your relationship can make you feel less insecure. After the whirlwind romance passes by, you may find the relationship isn't as exciting as it once was. However, small, everyday things in a relationship can be as meaningful as big, romantic interactions. Invest time in your partner to strengthen your bond after the initial excitement passes.Remember, relationships take work. Be willing to invest time in your relationship. Truly committing to your partner will make you feel more secure, as you'll get to know them on a more significant level.
For example, make a point of spending time together every day. If you, say, eat dinner together every night, you will learn more about each other through talking. The closer you feel, the more insecurities will pass.

, Be willing to talk to your partner. In a whirlwind romance, you may not notice your partner's flaws initially. After the honeymoon phase ends, you may become frustrated or angry at your partner at times. Communicate such things right away to avoid having resentment build up. Remember, even the strongest couples fight at times. You should also communicate positive things. Letting your partner know you value them can help keep your relationship strong.Let your partner know if you want them to do something differently. You may have overlooked their tendency to put off things like paying bills during the early stages of a whirlwind romance. However, if it's becoming a problem, mention it. Say something like, ""Can we talk about being more stringent about getting bills paid on time?""
You should also communicate the good. The spark can fade in any relationship, but you may feel it more intensely in a whirlwind romance. You can keep your relationship strong by learning to express positive feelings regularly. For example, ""I love it when you take the garbage out in the morning, even though you know it's supposed to be my job. It's so kind of you.""

, You can often let past insecurities damage how you interact with your partner. This can make your bond less strong, leading to more insecurities. Try to stay in the present. Remember every relationship is different and negative patterns will not necessarily repeat.Be conscious of when you're pulling away due to past hurts. For example, maybe your old partner used to put you down a lot over your career ambitions. Your new partner suggests you try a different route in regards to your work load.
If you begin to feel angry about this, pause and take a deep breath. Are you bringing past resentments in? Try to think about how your new relationship differs from your past one. Just because your previous partner was critical does not mean your current partner will be. They may simply be trying to help you.

, During a whirlwind romance, you may forget the outside world early on. You may find you and your partner spend all your time together. After this phase passes, it's important you maintain outside interests. In healthy relationships, both parties maintain their individuality.No one person can meet all your emotional needs. You should be able to maintain relationships with friends and family members. If certain relationships fell to the wayside during the early phases of your whirlwind romance, rekindle them.
You should also have your own hobbies and interests. Do not be afraid to take an afternoon to yourself now and again to do something you enjoy.

, Conflict is a natural part of a relationship. Conflict may be rare in early stages of a whirlwind romance, so it can be frustrating and stressful when it occurs later. Try to look at conflict in a positive light. Conflict can help show you where the relationship needs improvement. You can figure out how to interact effectively and get along better.When conflicts come up, try to have an open mind. Do not be on the defense. Your partner's perception of a situation or an event may differ from yours. Keep this in mind and see this as a chance to learn what your partner values and how they communicate.
For example, maybe you don't care for public displays of affection and this hurts your partner's feelings. Try to listen to their side. Maybe they feel more secure in a relationship where there is a lot of touch and physical contact.

, Doubt will creep in over time in any relationship. In the long term, be aware of your feelings. Keep in mind feelings are not always based on facts. If you're feeling a certain way, it may help to try to see the situation more objectively.During conflicts, certain things may trigger negative feelings. For example, when your partner gets frustrated you went out without them, you may get very angry. Pause and ask yourself where this anger comes from.
Maybe in a past relationship you had a very controlling partner who wouldn't let you go out. Maybe that's influencing how you're seeing the present situation.
Ask yourself whether your current partner is really being control or if they simply want to spend time with you. If it is the latter, this can help you feel more secure that your relationship is happy and healthy. You simply bring past hurt into the situation on occasion, which you can work on.

, Learn to see your partner without judgment. This will help you get close to them, and remain close long term. This will help prevent insecurity.In conflicts and day-to-day situations, stop and think about how your partner may be feeling. Do they see a given situation the same way you do? Why or why not?
Think about what you can do if you suspect your partner is feeling something negative. What kind of reassurance makes your partner feel most valued? How can you provide the reassurance?

, Unfortunately, sometimes insecurities exist for a reason. In a whirlwind romance, you may find you're not really compatible with someone long term. Passion may not translate to a sustainable romance. If you identify any major deal breakers, you may want to rethink the relationship.Do you see eye-to-eye on major issues, such as finances and children? Do you see similar futures? No one is 100% on the same page all the time, but if your views completely differ this can be an issue.
Oftentimes, a whirlwind romance started for the wrong reason. Consider whether one or both of you was going through something major, like a big loss or a major breakup. If so, the relationship may have been a rebound without you realizing it.
If you feel you're not compatible long term, the two of you may need to see a couples counselor together. This can help you decide whether staying together is the right thing. A therapist cannot tell you whether to dissolve your partnership, but they can help you each better express your need, thoughts, and emotions, as well as help you to better listen to your partner.

Have a direct conversation about it.,
Urge the person to grow and mature.,
Be patient.This may be the most difficult part.,
Boost the person's self-esteem.,
Accept that the person may never change.The most difficult part about any interpersonal relationship is when you realize that you have almost zero power to change someone else.People can change, but that change has to come mainly from them.",How to Have a Romantic Relationship With an Egotistic Person1," This is important and has a direct effect on your happiness, their happiness, and the success of the relationship. Don't waste time and energy trying indirect ways to “make her change.”It will just come across as manipulative and potentially cause resentment from your partner. Instead have a real, honest, and direct conversation about it.


Start by letting her know you need to talk. ”Alice, I think we really need to talk. There's been something that has really be bothering me.”
Explain what the issue is for you; specific to your relationship. For example, if your partner is selfish or egotistical in conversations and making it about her, you could say, “I feel like when we talk, it isn't really equal. I love hearing about your day, but I'd really like for you to hear about my day too. When we talk, it feels really unevenly focused.”
Ask for her input: “What do you think?”;
, One of the great things you get to do in a relationship is to build each other up and watch each other grow. Help your partner grow by growing with him. Instead of focusing just on the person, try shift the focus to the relationship or the both of you working on the same thing.


You can try tasks like taking a relationship selfishness checklist test to increase your partner and your awareness of any selfishness in your relationship. Humans are social creatures and tend to unconsciously adopt the goals of those close to us.Just like couples who learn a sport, how to cook, or a new language together, you can learn how to be less selfish and opinionated together.
Make sure to celebrate and praise each other for positive changes you are making. The better you both feel about it, the more likely you are to continue to work towards the goal.

, If you are with an egotistic person, you may realize that changing these parts of yourself can take time. Much like breaking a bad habit, you may have to be patient with your partner as she works on changing. Additionally, expect some backsliding into previous bad behaviors during this transition time and try not to be too hard on her.


One way you can address this is to have a funny thing you do or say if you notice your partner slipping back into her selfish habits. Agree to an action or a phrase during your conversation. If you make it something you both find funny, it can take the pressure off of pointing it out.

The ""Cut it out"" hand motion Uncle Joey used in Full House.
Playing a funny song such as Toby Keith's ""I wanna talk about me.""
Saying, ""Hold on, I haven't had enough coffee for this conversation yet.""
Pick something that is funny to you and your partner, like an inside joke that only you share.



, This may seem like a strange suggestion for an egotist, but often inflated egos and selfishness are rooted in low self-esteem or shame.Think of it as overcompensation. Your partner may have low self esteem causing him to exaggerate and inflate his outward display of what he thinks about himself. It turns out that he may be trying to convince himself of his greatness along with everyone else. Help him boost his self-esteem.


Avoid complaining about him or harshly criticizing him as it will only make him feel more threatened.When you are talking to him focus on his strengths and try to draw on the potential of those strengths.
Compliment him not just for his looks, but for how he acts and what he does., They have to want it. So if you are intent on a relationship with an egotistic person, your first step is to be real with yourself about the likelihood of the other person changing and begin to accept the selfish parts of her personality that you may not agree with.While you cannot change other people, you can help them to change. You can also control how you react to their egotism and the effect you let it have on your life."

Make a plan to stay out of the relationship.",How to Identify if You're in a Bad Relationship," Everyone has areas they need to improve upon. You may have bad habits that annoy your partner. However, there's a difference between expressing irritation and being outright critical. An overly critical, even mean, partner is a sign you're not in a good relationship.Does your partner frequently put you down? Are you mocked for your intelligence, personality, or physical appearance? Do you feel like you can't do anything right?
Your partner may, for example, say something like, ""God, I knew you'd screw that up. You're so bad at these things"" when you get directions wrong. You may hear these comments a lot throughout the day.;
, In a healthy relationship, you should be able to feel like you can lean on the other person for emotional support. In an unhealthy relationship, however, the other person may be cold or uncaring to your needs. When you've had a bad day, think about who you would call.You may feel comfortable going to your partner first. He or she may always know what to say or do to make you feel better.
However, your first inclination may be to reach out to someone else. You may, for example, find yourself leaning more frequently on a friend or family member. Your partner may be dismissive of your problems, or treat you like a burden.
If you're hesitant to ask your partner for emotional support, you may be in a bad relationship.

, Do you feel like you can trust your partner? If not, the relationship may be bad. Has your partner struggled in the past with something like infidelity? Did your partner cross other boundaries, like borrowing money and not returning it? If you don't feel like you can trust your partner, you may be in a bad relationship.For example, you may not trust your partner to handle expenses. If they borrow money from you, you may distrust whether you'll ever get the money back.
You may also not trust your partner's loyalty. You may be suspicious of whether or not they will be faithful. They may have had issues with fidelity in the past.

, In a healthy relationship, your partner will want you to have your own life and independent interests. In a bad relationship, your partner will constantly seek control. Be honest with yourself. Do you feel like your partner attempts to control you?Control can come in many forms. Your partner may dictate how you dress and act or may try to control how you spend your time. Your partner may dislike it when you spend time engaging in hobbies or going out with friends. A controlling partner will want you all to themselves.
If you spend an evening reading, for example, your partner may berate you later. He or she may say something like, ""You know, you worked all day and then you just read all night. I'm not sure why you need to read when you could have spent some time with me.""

, Do you feel like your partner is excited for your successes? Do they seem indifferent, or even hostile, when good things happen to you? In a negative relationship, your partner will be threatened by your success instead of happy for you. They will see your dreams, goals, and aspirations as competition for their attention.Your partner may put down your attempts to grow and change. Instead of encouraging you, your partner has only negative things to say about you taking steps towards a more successful future.
For example, say you're an aspiring writer. You join a book club to meet more writers in your area. Your partner says something like, ""You know, it's really petty of you to try and impress other writers. You should rely on the quality of your work and not what important friends you have.""

, If you are in a bad relationship, then there may be some manipulation going on. This is when someone does things to try to get you to do what they want or vice versa. Some common manipulative behaviors include:Giving you the silent treatment or pretending not to know what you are talking about.
Trying to overwhelm you with facts and statistics.
Yelling or screaming at you or talking over you.
Pressuring you to make decisions without letting you think about them.
Ridiculing you or belittling you.
Judging you or criticizing you.
Blaming you for their unhappiness or for other problems.

, In a healthy relationship, you and your partner have separate identities. You may have different friends groups and different interests. You should be able to retain your own relationships, hobbies, and interests in a healthy relationship.In a bad relationship, your partner will be threatened or angered by this. They may insist on doing hobbies with you, even hobbies you would rather do alone. They may discourage you from seeing friends they don't like, or talking too much to your family.
If you're beginning to feel your identity is entirely wrapped up in your partner, this is a problem. In a bad relationship, you end up losing your sense of self.

, How do you feel when you spend time with your partner? Does their drama tend to affect you personally? Do you leave their place feeling drained rather than energized? In a healthy relationship, you and your partner should bring one another up. You should feel happy and energetic around your partner. If the reverse is true, you may be in a bad relationship., In a bad relationship, you'll be made to feel guilty frequently. You may feel like your partner's unhappiness or outbursts are your fault. Be honest with yourself. How often do you feel guilty in this relationship?Do you feel you need to stay due to guilt? Does your partner rely on you to the point you feel you're taking care of them?
If guilt is a major emotion in your relationship, it may be a bad sign. If you're staying because your partner makes you feel guilty for not being around, this is probably a bad relationship.

, Can you really see a future with this person? Some relationships are not made to last. It's okay if you're casually dating someone you don't want a serious future with. However, if this is a serious relationship, you want to consider the future.Do you think this person would be a good parent? If you want kids, and you worry about this person's competency as a mother or father, you may be in a bad relationship.
Think long and hard about the type of life you want. Is this person compatible with that life? If not, this may not be a good relationship to pursue.

, In a bad relationship, you may not enjoy the good times. Even when things are going well, and you should be having fun, you're on edge. This is often because your partner is easy to set off, and you're worried they will start drama at any moment.For example, you go out to brunch with friends. Your partner complains about the menu for a moment, starts to get hostile, but calms down. The rest of brunch is fine and everyone seems to be having fun.
Even though everything is fine, you're worried. You keep thinking about the issue with the menu. You can't enjoy the good time, because there's part of you that's worried the issue will resurface later.

, Allowing yourself to be vulnerable with your partner is an important part of a good relationship. If you do not trust your partner enough to share your personal thoughts and feelings with them, then it might not be a good relationship.For example, if you withhold information about your hopes, fears, and dreams because you do not trust your partner to be kind and understanding, then you might be in a bad relationship.

, You do not want to end a bad relationship ambiguously. If you make the decision to end things, do so face-to-face. Tell your partner you want out of the relationship, leaving no room for confusion.Say something direct like, ""I don't think we should see each other romantically anymore."" Then, let your partner know what boundaries you need. For example, can you remain friends? If so, will you need space initially?
Make it clear how much contact you want. Can you stay friends on social media? Can you still text on occasion? These are all things you need to decide moving forward.

, If you have had bad relationship before, this is particularly important. For you, are there any perks to bad relationships? Is there a reason you're habitually drawn to the wrong people?A bad relationship may fill a void in your life. For example, maybe your mother was distant. You unconsciously seek out people like your mother, but find they are just as distant and difficult.
Try to identify any underlying needs that are being fulfilled by bad relationship. Work on getting away from these kinds of romances in the future.

, When ending a bad relationship, you'll be left vulnerable. Seek the support of loved ones. Reach out to friends and family members. Let them know you're going through a rough patch and would appreciate some support.Call friends when you're having a bad day. You can also send out text messages asking for support. People who care about you will be willing to help you cope with your emotions.
It can be hard to ask for support, but just start with a simple request. For example, ""Hey, I'm really struggling with this breakup. Mind if I vent to you?""

, Many people often go back to bad relationships. You may feel a sense of comfort and safety from a relationship, even a bad one.Have an action plan in place. If you feel tempted to, say, call or text your ex, think of something to do instead. You could call a friend, watch television, go for a walk, or engage in a hobby.
Figure out many ways to keep busy. Fill your life with distractions from a bad relationship so you won't be tempted to go back.

Avoid telling them their love life isn’t that bad.,
Validate their feelings.,
Practice empathy.,
Ask questions.,
Change the subject.",How to Handle Constant Complaints About Someone's Love Life1," Even if you have good intentions for saying someone’s love life isn’t actually that bad, it may make them feel worse. By telling someone that their feelings are not valid, they may feel even more upset and it could affect your relationship with them.Keep in mind that you don’t have to agree with the person. Just be willing to listen to them and avoid casting judgment on what they say or on their love life in general.;
, When someone constantly complains about their romantic partner, their relationship, or being single, they are looking for validation for their feelings and sympathy for their situation, or just need someone to listen to them for a while. Be willing to listen and avoid trying to discover their intentions. Genuinely provide emotional validation and, if appropriate, sympathy.Try saying, “Jeff, I’m really sorry to hear that your husband isn’t emotionally supportive. That must be really hard to deal with.”
You could also say, “Amy, I can understand why you feel undervalued by your husband if he doesn’t appreciate all the time you spend cleaning and cooking despite having a full time job.”

, Empathy is your ability to identify with what another person is feeling and thinking. When someone complains about their love life, put yourself in their shoes before you respond. React to their complaints with empathy and appropriate emotion.Don’t say, “Well at least you have a husband!” Instead try saying, “I know what it feels like when your partner doesn’t listen. I’m sorry this is happening to you.”
Don’t say, “You shouldn’t complain about your boyfriend’s cleaning. I’d love it if my wife cleaned!” Instead try saying, “I’m sorry you’re so frustrated about Jim’s vacuuming. I know what it feels like when your partner doesn’t live up to your expectations.”

, If someone you know regularly complains about their love life, you can respond by asking questions. Rather than giving them solutions to the issue, ask questions that might help them solve the problems on their own. This can help stop a steady stream of complaining and focus the conversation on more positive possibilities.You can ask, “Why do you think your wife’s behavior makes you feel this way?”
Try asking, “What is it about this situation that is truly upsetting you?”

, One way to maintain control of the conversation is to change the subject when someone begins complaining about their love life. Respectfully listen to their complaint for a while, but then change the subject to something that is mutually interesting to both parties.Don’t change the subject too abruptly or at a sensitive point in their story. Give the person a chance to share and then when they seem to have finished their story or finished venting, find a natural way to change the subject.
For example, after the person has finished telling you a story about a bad date, you could say something like, “Oh, that reminds me. The weirdest thing happened at work yesterday! I can’t wait to tell you this story!”

Congratulate your ex-spouse when he or she tells you the news.,
Consider sending a card or buying a small gift.,
Avoid making negative comments to your ex.Rather than badmouthing the new marriage or new spouse, focus your attention on more positive things in your life.It is healthy and right that your ex should find love and remarry.,

Focus on you.",How to Handle the Remarriage of an Ex Spouse," The announcement of your ex's plans to remarry is likely as uncomfortable and fraught with mixed feelings for your ex as it is for you.


While the news may come as a surprise, do not make negative comments or ask intrusive questions. Thank your ex-spouse for letting you know and leave it at that.
Remember, the two of you are no longer in a relationship and, unless you have kids, your ex is not obligated to keep you informed about his or her personal life.It is a sign of healthy trust between you that your ex has told you the news. Be sure that you don't make a comment (or even a surprised or confused facial expression) that could compromise the relationship you have built.;
, It is customary to celebrate the news of a friend or family member's engagement, so why should it be different because it is your ex-spouse?


If you have an amicable relationship, or especially if you have children together, it might help to get the new marriage relationship off on the right foot if you pick out a simple card of congratulations, and simply write ""Wishing you all the best!"" Or consider a small gift, like a bottle of wine or a gift basket for their new home. Heartfelt congratulations means a lot.
If you do not have a good relationship with your ex, or if you think the new spouse is the type who would become jealous, you might skip a card or gift.

, Even if you have not yet moved on, your spouse has a right to move forward with life.
You should also avoid making negative comments about your ex in front of your children, if you have them. Research shows that children who have positive, healthy relationships with both parents after a divorce have higher wellbeing than kids whose parents don’t get along., Sometimes relationships with exes are not healthy, and one person may try to use situations like this to emotionally manipulate the other. It is not unheard of for exes to make comments about how much better the new spouse is at fulfilling his or her needs, or how much better the new spouse looks, or cooks, or listens, etc.


If you find yourself feeling as if your ex-spouse is purposely rubbing the new marriage in your face or reveling in how miserable he or she thinks the new marriage makes you feel, remind yourself of how childish that is of him or her. In fact, it is a sign of immaturity and an inability on your spouse's part to let go of past hurts between the two of you.
Be the bigger person by wishing your ex the best and doing your best to not revisit the topic. If your ex insists on discussing the new marriage or making comparisons, ask politely that he or she stop, and if nothing changes, you may have to reconsider future contact with this person. In situations where you must communicate for the sake of children you share with your ex, counseling may be the only option.
If you find yourself getting flustered, take a break and give yourself a little pep talk. Try using some reassurance statements, such as “This is upsetting, but I know how to deal with it” or “I don’t need to get into an argument about this.” You can also try some “relaxation reminders,” such as telling yourself “Remember to take a deep breath and relax” or “I can stay calm through this.”, Focus on your own life, not your ex-spouse and his new spouse.


There are few relationships more intimate than the marriage relationship, so it is natural that you would have ambivalent feelings about the new marriage and spouse. Do not make little issues into bigger ones just because of your ill feelings about your ex-spouse's new wife or husband.There are so many wonderful things you can think about and do rather than focus on negative feelings about your ex-spouse's new marriage.

, Because of the intimacy that you once shared with your ex, it can be hard to feel anything but jealousy or resentment for the new spouse, simply because he or she is the new husband or wife.


Automatically judging the new spouse is unfair, and could prevent you from building a friendship. After all, you both fell in love with the same person, so you probably have many things in common. Try to get to know him or her better if you can. This will only help make the situation easier for everyone involved.

, If you do not like the new spouse, be honest with yourself about why. Is it just jealousy on your part, anger, resentment, or do you have a legitimate reason?


If you have a history of not getting along, what part did you play in the conflict between the two of you? If you find your dislike of the new spouse is due to your own insecurities or shortcomings, do whatever you can to overcome those feelings.
Of course, it is possible that you have a legitimate reason for disliking this new spouse, for example, if this person is responsible for the dissolution of your marriage because of an affair. In that case, it’s important to recognize that others make their own choices, and you are not responsible for what this person has done.
Reading books on the subject, talking things out with family or friends, or attending counseling are all positive ways to overcome your negative feelings. The key is to stop the vicious cycle and work on positive change.

, Be polite and cordial if you ever find yourself face to face with them. There is no need to say anything else or to partake in superficial chit chat. The key is to be polite and not rude, even if you're feeling absolutely miserable inside.


The new spouse is probably feeling the same feelings about you that you are feeling about him or her: a little jealousy, a little uncertainty, and a lot of eagerness to impress. Remember, he or she knows that you once had a very intimate relationship with the person that they now love. If the new spouse is insecure at all, it can be very hard for them to see you as anything but a threat to their relationship.

, Ignore any attempts made by the new spouse to communicate with you if it is hostile in any way. Always remember that you cannot control the behavior of others, but you can control your own behavior.


In many relationships, there is no reason for you to force a friendship between yourself and the new spouse. However, if you have children together and you and your ex are committed to co-parenting, you may wish to consider how to integrate the new spouse into your co-parenting philosophy.

, Questioning your children or badmouthing the new spouse in their presence can be very harmful. Your children are just innocent bystanders.The number one trait of positive parenting in a situation of divorce is putting your children first. You may need to bite your tongue if you feel like saying bad things about your ex or his or her new spouse. Making negative comments or interrogating the children will only make you look jealous or petty and cause your children to feel uncomfortable and confused.
If you do or say things that cause your children to believe that you dislike or distrust the new spouse, they also may be inclined to resist establishing a relationship with their new stepparent or lie to you about their interactions with him or her. This would not be fair to your children.

, Assuming that the new stepparent is a sincere person who means well and cares for your children, do what you can to encourage and support their relationship.This will help alleviate any feelings of guilt or betrayal your children may experience when they spend time with or have fun with their new stepparent.


Some ideas for practical ways to build a relationship involve inviting the new stepparent to family functions and holidays, buying thoughtful and personal gifts on birthdays or Christmas, and encouraging your child to find shared interests to explore with the new stepparent(for instance, if they both love art, they could take a sculpting class together, or if they both love fashion, the new stepparent could help with back to school shopping).

, Although your ex’s new spouse may be labeled as a “stepparent,” this does not mean they are taking over your role as a mother or a father.


The bond you have with your children can never be broken, no matter how close your children are with the new stepparent.
Instead, try to see their relationship with their stepparent as a chance to amplify the amount of love and support they receive in their lives as they grow. The more adults love and care for a child, the better off the child will be.

, This change in family dynamics will undoubtedly cause mixed emotions, many of which they are too young to understand. They need you to be understanding, nonjudgmental, and reliable through this time of change.Accept their feelings as valid, whether they feel joy, anger, worry, jealousy, or a combination of these and other feelings. All of these feelings are normal and ok.
You can accept their feelings as valid and still try to help them balance any negative feelings they may have about this change or about the new spouse by pointing out positive aspects. Let them know that the situation is just as awkward for the new stepparent as it is for them and everyone needs time to adjust. If children see that you are calm and okay with everything, this will help them to feel at ease and better able to adjust to the new situation.

, Rather than confronting the stepparent about parenting concerns, it is best to let your ex deal with the situation if possible.


If necessary, call a family meeting with your ex-spouse and your children so that everyone can give their input and discuss the problem and possible solutions. Sometimes children will say negative things about the new stepparent to you but not to the other parent. Having the children discuss things out in the open with both parents together may reveal that the children have been telling you one story and an entirely different story to the other parent. This is quite common among children of divorce.
Encourage your children to always be respectful of their new stepparent and to discuss any problems they have directly with the other parent so that he or she can address the issue with their new spouse.

, Just like your children, you are likely to feel a range of emotions at the news of your ex's remarriage. Feelings from anger, to relief, to jealousy, to happiness are all normal.

Allow yourself to feel your emotions fully. In some ways, the new marriage symbolizes the last nail in the coffin of your relationship with your spouse, and the myriad emotions you are feeling reflect the similarity between your ex's remarriage and the experience of grieving a death of a loved one. Let yourself mourn.
Vent in private, in a journal or to a friend, but keep your emotions in check when you're with your ex or the new spouse. It is not necessary to burden them or to create awkwardness in your relationship, and exploding in anger or sadness will not have any positive consequences.

, The remarriage of an ex can be a long, emotionally taxing road, and you may find that you need someone to talk to. Research suggests that people who have a strong support network are better able to handle the stresses of divorce and remarriage.

Ask a trusted friend or mentor. Someone who is a good listener, who is rational and gives great advice, and who won't judge you or tell you ex things you have said is a good choice. It also helps if the friend has been through a similar situation, so that they know what you are feeling.
Sometimes you may find that you need to talk to someone, but have no one in your life that fits the description of a trusted confidant. Consider professional counseling. Many insurance plans will pay for visits with a licensed therapist or psychologist. Ask your friends or acquaintances for referrals, or read reviews online to find a good one. Alternatively, if you are a member of a church or faith based group, many have counselors on staff.

, Now that your ex has fully and completely moved on from your relationship with one another, it is time for you to do the same. Even if you have remarried, use this time to focus on your own life rather than the lost relationship with your ex. Embracing change and opportunity can help you fully move on.

Set new goals for things you'd like to accomplish in the coming year. Perhaps try a new sport, or pick up a new craft or art form. Maybe you'd like to try ballroom dancing, or rock climbing, or modeling. By enlarging your own life and goals, you can take your focus off of your ex's life and put it squarely on your own, which is right where it belongs.

Make time to talk about you.,
Share your feelings.",How to Have a Romantic Relationship With an Egotistic Person2," Your egotist may tend to talk about themselves frequently and at great lengths. If you feel like your partner does not give you enough space to talk about you, address it.You deserve to have this relationship and this partner be as much of a sounding board as he expects you to be for him. Try addressing it directly, or making it more of a new pattern in your conversations.


""John, I really need to talk to you about something that is bothering me. I know you have things you want to say as well, but I really need someone to listen. Would you be willing to focus on just this problem and help me?”
Bring up topics more regularly that you are interested it. You may have gotten into the habit of just listening to your partner and letting him control the conversations. Start a new pattern of conversation by interjecting with topics you are interested in or thoughts you are having.

, There is a solid chance that your egotistic partner is going to do or say something that makes you angry or sad at some point, because what you are doing is difficult and can be frustrating.Communication is key in any relationship, especially when you are working through some things.If you are really bothered by a particular action of your partner or by something she said, tell her. Try to add a compliment or a praise in and then tell her what upsets you, carefully and tactfully.


""Jane, I love it when you teach me how to cook. You are really good at it, and I want to learn. It just really hurts me when you tell it to me like I'm a nine year old kid.""
”I understand you have a very strong opinion about this. Maybe you know more about it than I do, too. I would just really like for you to respect my opinion even if it is different than yours and not laugh at me for sharing it with you.”

Be true to yourself.,
Enjoy other interests.,
Acknowledge your feelings.,
Find a support system.,
Consider leaving the relationship if it is not making you happy.",How to Have a Romantic Relationship With an Egotistic Person3," Be careful not to change who you are in your relationship with an egotist. A selfish person will bring out the giver or the care-taker in you; which could be potentially harmful.Don't feel like you have to change yourself to accommodate him.Resist the urge to stifle who you are or even what you are good at out of fear of how your partner will react.


Just as you may have to accept that your partner is selfish, he have to accept that you are going to be just who you are as well. That should just be one more thing he loves about you.

, If you find you are the giver in the relationship and you feel that your partner is always taking, then invest some of your energy into other interests to protect yourself from the relationship imbalance.Make sure you are giving yourself and your interests the attention and care you deserve.Take classes or carve out time in your schedule to do things that you enjoy, focusing on self-care and your own needs.
You can always put your giving energy into volunteering as well. Try organizations such as Volunteer Match or Volunteer Finder.

, Even if your partner is trying to change, there are potential pitfalls that come from being in a relationship with an egotist. You may be helping her change, being patient while she works through some things, and trying to boost her self-esteem. Make sure, during this time, you are staying aware of how you feel. There may be some ups and down, and it is important you remain aware of how it is affecting you.


Keep track of how happy you are in the relationship and how your day-to-day life is being affected.
Notice how drained or exhausted you are feeling and make sure to give yourself the time and attention needed to recover.
Try not to let this relationship become all-consuming for your life. Spend time with friends, or work on a hobby or interest that is important to you.

Set firm boundaries if she tries to push your buttons or engage you in a fight. You can say something like, ""I'm not going to respond when you're yelling at me like this. I'm going to go in the other room and we can talk again in an hour when we've calmed down.""

, While you are navigating this change together, it is important that you both have support systems you can use as a resource.Use your existing support system or create one for yourself. Focus on people that help you and make you feel good about yourself. They should be people that you trust and feel comfortable with. They may include:


Friends
Family
Religious Community
Counselors or therapists

, It is not always a healthy idea to stay with an egotist. He may not be able or willing to change in the way you need him to.If he is not willing to work on the relationship then this may continue to make you feel emotionally drained and unappreciated. It may be better for you to leave the relationship and move onto something that's healthier for you.

Limit your interactions with the person.,
Set boundaries.,
Spend time in groups of people.,
Encourage the person to seek help.",How to Handle Constant Complaints About Someone's Love Life2," Dealing with someone’s constant complaints about their love life can be emotionally draining. If you think this person is having a negative influence on your life, consider limiting the amount of time you spend with them.For example, if your friend uses your weekly happy hour to complain about her husband, consider canceling this regular interaction.

, Sometimes you cannot or may not want to distance yourself from someone who constantly complains about their love life. You can, however, set clear boundaries about what you can offer the person and how long you can listen to their complaints. By setting boundaries, you can let the person know that you believe they are capable of handling at least a little frustration on their own.Try saying, “Jenny, it sounds like the situation with your girlfriend is really bothering you, and I am sorry but I am unable to give you my full attention right now. Perhaps we can talk about this at a later time.”
You could say, “John and I get really uncomfortable when you talk about your wife's sexual problems, and would appreciate not being involved in this type of conversation.”
Try saying, “Kendra, I’m really sorry you’re so unhappy being single. I know that must be hard, but I don’t know if the office is the best place to talk about it.”

, It’s easier to be the unwilling recipient of chronic complaints about someone’s love life if you spend a lot of one on one time together. One way to dispel some of the complaining is by spending time together in a group. Many people will not feel as comfortable complaining about their love life if they are socializing with a group of people.


For example, if you have a co-worker who complains about his boyfriend at lunch, try eating lunch with a group of co-workers.
If your friend spends your Friday lunch date pontificating about the perils of her marriage, ask her if you can invite a mutual friend to join you.

, Most people who constantly complain about their love life are unhappy in their current relationship, with their partner, or about being single. Urge them to seek professional help to deal with their romantic problems. This is especially important if the person is in an emotionally or physically abusive relationship.Try saying, “Brent, I’m really concerned that your husband hurt you. I can help you access some local domestic violence resources if you’re open to it.”
You can say, “Nadean, I can tell that being single is really affecting your happiness. Have you thought about talking to a counselor?”
You might also say, “Amanda, it sounds like the arguments with your husband are pretty serious. Have the two of you talked about marriage counseling?”

"
"
Work on reducing your stress levels.,
Maintain positivity.,
Take time for yourself.,
Focus on positive relationships.",How to Handle Constant Complaints About Someone's Love Life3," Managing your own stress will make it easier to deal with someone who is constantly complaining about their love life. Take time to exercise, eat well, and get at least eight hours of sleep each night. Being nourished and well rested will make it easier to positively manage someone’s complaints about their love life.

, Maintaining a positive attitude is important for your mental health. This can be especially crucial if you are on the receiving end of someone’s nonstop complaints about their love life. Since listening to chronic complaints can negatively influence how you see your own life, make an effort to think positively about yourself and your life.


When you are with the complainer, try thinking to yourself, “I am grateful for my love life, which seems great in comparison to Aunt Zelda’s.”

, If you are constantly listening to someone talk about their problems, it is important that you take time to do things that are important to you. This is especially important if the person complaining plays a regular role in your everyday life.


For example, you can take a long walk on a local nature trail a couple of times each week.
Try taking time to read a novel or watch your favorite television show.

, Dedicate time to relationships that are mutually supportive, where both people are invested in supporting one another. Each person should both take time to support the other, whether that means being an active listener or helping the other person through a tough time."

Discuss your career and family goals with each other.,
Choose your priorities.,
Accept your partner’s priorities.,
Decide how and when your individual careers take priority.",How to Handle Divergent Career Paths in a Relationship1," Try to be honest and realistic with each other about how you want to live your lives. If you’re just starting out with each other, talk about whether or not you want kids, if you see yourself buying a home, and how you envision your career taking shape in the future.Getting to know each other’s priorities as early as possible will help you decide if your goals and career ambitions are compatible with those of your partner. For instance, if your career path will always involve spending 75% of your time traveling, it might not be best to settle down with someone who doesn’t believe long distance relationships work under any circumstances.
Do your best to make sure you and your partner are able to make compromises. If you both are unwilling to compromise about your differing career paths and incompatible goals, it’s better to end a relationship sooner rather than later.;
, Remember that your relationship with yourself should come first, and then your relationship with your partner. Decide what’s negotiable and what’s non-negotiable. Try to prioritize your career and family goals and decide which compromises you’re willing to make.Ask yourself, “Am I willing to put my partner’s career goals ahead of my own? Which compromises can I make without disappointing myself or creating internal conflicts? Is having a long-term relationship and a family more important to me than professional advancement?”

, You and your partner won’t see eye to eye on everything. If you have different visions for your career paths, try not to be dismissive or to devalue your partner’s values. Embrace your differences and decide if you share enough priorities to make a life together.For example, suppose you have a well-paying office job with a set 9 to 5 schedule and always envisioned settling down with someone similar. However, you fell for an artist who prioritizes creative expression over financial success and consistent work hours. If you want to maintain a healthy relationship, you’ll have to work together to keep your individual priorities on equal footing by balancing your need for financial stability with their creative needs.

, Work together to address specific events that call for one partner to make sacrifices in order to allow the other to shine. Do your best to take turns making compromises that benefit each other’s careers. Try to evaluate opportunities based on practical considerations, but avoid letting practicality completely outweigh happiness.For example, suppose your partner has a once in a lifetime professional opportunity that will require you to relocate to another country. You’d need to move far away from your family and friends, quit your own job, and learn a new language and culture. Work with your partner to weigh the pros and cons. There are no universal solutions, but it’s essential that you discuss how the decision will affect both of your personal and professional lives.
Evaluate the situation by asking each other, “Will their income be enough to support you both if you’re unable to work due to language and cultural barriers? Are there possibilities for you to pursue your own interests? Will putting your career on hold create lasting professional disadvantages from which you’ll never recover? How can your partner make future sacrifices that will prioritize your career?”

Respond to the the statement.,
Tell them there's no specific time allotted for grief.,
End the conversation.,
Define a boundary.,
Take a second to consider where the thought comes from.,
Realize that anger is a natural reaction.",How to Handle People Who Think You Should Grieve Longer1," If the person is someone you're close to who keeps bringing up the fact that you haven't grieved long enough, you may want to take some time to respond to what they're saying. Just telling them what you're feeling and why can help put it in perspective for them.For instance, you could ask to have a conversation with the person. Once you start, you could say, ""I know you think I haven't grieved long enough, but I have come to terms with the loss. Every time you say that, it makes me feel guilty. I would appreciate it if you would quit bringing it up."";
, That is, every person is different. You have the right to deal with grief in the amount of time it takes you. If the time you take is shorter than others, than that's how it is. Besides, many factors can affect grief, including your relationship with the person you lost and how the death came about.For instance, maybe you knew for a long time that the person was dying, so you had time before the death to get the majority of your grieving over with.
In addition, you might remind the person that grief is not something unilateral, with a start and end point. Coming to terms with the loss does not mean you will never think of the person again, or never feel sad about it again.

, Another way to avoid the question is to bring the conversation to an abrupt halt. You may want to come up with an excuse, but it is better and more direct to say something like, ""I'm not going to discuss this any further,"" and then leave the conversation as quickly as possible. This tactic tends to work best on the phone, but you can use it in person, too.Making excuses or avoiding the topic may seem like a good strategy in the moment, but it generally doesn't resolve anything.

, If someone says something about your grieving process, you could let them know that you're not comfortable discussing it with them. You have a right to set boundaries about who you share personal information with, and right now is one of those times.For example, you could say, ""I appreciate your concern, but grief is a very personal issue for me. I'd rather not discuss it.""

, That is, most people have a hard time knowing what to do around a person who's suffered a loss. If they're asking you whether you've grieved long enough, it's out of concern for your emotional well-being. While the question or sentiment may be misguided, it likely comes from a place of caring and knowing that can keep you from lashing out at the person., You may feel a strong desire to lash out at the person, mostly because grief is a personal thing and you have a right to feel how you want. Even if you are over the main part of your grief, you may still be feeling vulnerable, and that vulnerability can cause you to feel angry. If you feel anger rising up, take a moment to calm yourself down before responding.Take a few deep, calming breaths to help release your anger.

Expect younger children to view love less seriously.,
Consider exposure when talking to pre-teens and teens.,
Recognize individual differences between your children.,
Find teachable moments.,
Model active listening skills.",How to Give Relationship Advice to Your Child1," Reflect on your younger child’s knowledge and experience before deciding how to structure a relationship talk. It’s unlikely children at this age have a clear understanding of relationships.


For instance, if your child is in kindergarten through elementary, they may refer to roles like “boyfriend” or “girlfriend” without really understanding what they mean. These roles aren’t rigid. They slip in and out of these roles almost similar to pretend-play. Still, while their understanding is immature, discussing relationships in a positive light can influence their future development.;
, How you approach the topic of relationships with your child varies greatly based on their current stage of development. Peer group, maturity level, media exposure, and language use may all play into an older child’s notion of relationships.


You might prepare yourself for a talk by informally observing what TV shows, movies, and music they watch/listen to in order to understand where their relationship knowledge may have formed. The kinds of media your child is exposed to can affect their development, so it is crucial to ensure that they are being exposed to age appropriate tv shows, movies, video games, and music. Also, keep in mind that it is always important to pay attention to the kinds of media your children are exposed to, not just when you are preparing to talk to them about something.
For instance, if your older child still watches child-appropriate cartoons, they may only have cursory knowledge about relationship themes. However, if your child enjoys teenage TV shows and films, they have probably been introduced to concepts like love and sex., Consider your children’s unique personalities and preferences as you plan a discussion. Don’t assume one thing about a child simply because it is true for a sibling or peer. Keep in mind how your child best interacts with you and the language they tend to use.


Meeting the child where they are helps them feel more comfortable in a potentially intimidating conversation. For instance, if you lie across your shy daughter’s bed while she reads a book and casually chat, this may decrease the pressure.
This principle also ensures that you don’t give your child ideas about anything prematurely. Let’s say, you ask a 6-year-old “Do you have a girlfriend?” and they ask “What is that?” It’s only a matter of time before they are using the term incorrectly or opening other unsuspecting children up to new terms.

, Another helpful rule-of-thumb is to give advice that is relevant and situational. All parents plan, at some point, to have “the talk” with their growing children. However, that talk doesn’t have to happen until your child is ready. Make use of the information they share with you to test their readiness which makes starting the conversation easier for both of you.


For example, if your son tells you about his best friend getting a girlfriend, you might ask “And what do you think about him having a girlfriend?” to gain more insight., A central feature of a healthy relationship is good communication. However, many people often focus on the spoken part of communication. Listening is just as important. Show your child how to be a good listener, and it will positively benefit their relationships for years to come.


Give your full attention when others are speaking, removing distractions whenever possible. Make occasional eye contact. Let the person finish talking before attempting to respond. Before responding, ensure that you received the correct message by asking some clarifying questions like ""Are you saying that you need some time to think about this?"" or ""It sounds like what you're saying is you would like some advice."""
"
Create a dynamic team mentality.,
Strategize together.,
Set clear, flexible roles and duties.,
Identify your shared values.",How to Handle Divergent Career Paths in a Relationship2," Approach all difficulties by acting like a team. Make decisions based not on what will benefit an individual partner, but on what will benefit the team as a whole. Since life is constantly in flux, try to think of the word team as an active, dynamic verb instead of a static noun.This means you should both be adaptable and open to different positions within the team. Encourage each other rather than compete. One partner having a higher income, for instance, should be a source of esteem and value for your relationship instead of a field of competition between the two of you.
For example, if children enter the picture, your roles will change. Try to shift your roles based on what’s best for the family as a whole, like choosing a primary caregiver or stay-at-home parent based on your incomes instead of based on societal expectations, like gender.

, View your resources and obstacles as shared, rather than only belonging to one partner. Designate a regular time, whether once a day or once a week, to build strategies for solving specific problems.Examples could include financial dilemmas, scheduling conflicts, or personal disagreements. During your brainstorm sessions, identify a problem, brief the other about it, and discuss practical solutions.
For example, suppose your company has offered you a travel opportunity and your partner is concerned about the financial and personal strains it will introduce. Give them the opportunity to voice their concerns, then relate to them how the opportunity is vital for your career goals.
Work together to identify ways of addressing the financial issues, like how you can decrease your own cost of living while you’re away, asking your company for a higher relocation allowance, and choosing which non-essentials your partner can cut to decrease the financial strain.
Talk about how to stay in close communication, like video chatting regularly, deciding how often you can talk on the phone, or finding ways to make visiting each other affordable. Finally, discuss ways that you can make comparable future sacrifices that will benefit your partner’s career goals.

, When both partners have their own careers and professional goals, household management can become a source of constant conflict. To avoid disagreements about who does the cleaning or who cooks dinner, designate chores and duties for each partner to complete on specific days. Be open to switching up the schedule if necessary, like if your partner can’t cook dinner on their designated night due to a work event.For example, you cook dinner on alternating days, and whoever doesn’t cook cleans up and does the dishes. Try developing an alternating chore roster elsewhere, like you clean the bathrooms one week and your partner cleans them the next.
Try not to come down too hard on each other if one of you doesn’t puts off a household chore. Try to have realistic expectations of each other and to be empathetic when it comes to household labor instead of being each other’s bosses., Your careers are obviously individual priorities, but do your best to find common principles that deepen your relationship. Examples could include character traits, a genre of art or literature, religious faith, music, or health and fitness. Try to remind yourselves of the things you have in common rather than focus solely on the conflicts your divergent careers generate.Once you’ve identified those values, be sure to take time away from work to pursue them together. If you both value cooking, take a cooking class together. If you both love being outdoors, hike a different trail every Saturday.

Be clear about needs and expectations.,
Offer each other emotional support.,
Spend quality time together away from all responsibilities.,
Consider seeing a couples counselor.",How to Handle Divergent Career Paths in a Relationship3," If you have certain expectations of your partner or relationship, make sure you express them clearly. You can’t hold your partner accountable for failing to meet your expectations if you don’t communicate your needs with each other.Expectations can involve things like daily routines, like spending time or having meals together. For example, perhaps your partner works with lots of people, but you work alone in your home office. They need time to decompress after constantly communicating all day, but you need to someone to talk to after being home alone all day.
Have a conversation about your respective needs and ask your partner, “About how much personal time do you need after your busy day? I know you spend all day talking to people, and I respect that, but I spend most of my time home alone. Does it make sense for you to take an hour for yourself, then for us to have dinner together so we can talk?”

, Making compromises and developing a team mentality often involves giving up something valued or important. Do your best to understand what you have both sacrificed in order to make a compromise. Be sensitive, empathetic, and offer each other emotional support in order to avoid latent conflicts or resentment.Emotional support can involve more than just being empathetic about your individual professional compromises. If you’re both career driven and have challenging occupations, try to come up with emotional strategies that will work best for your relationship.
For example, some partners offer each other emotional support in the form of advice, validation, and critical feedback about difficult decisions at work. Other relationships work best when partners leave work at the office and rely on each other to compartmentalize work and home life. Talk to your partner about what’s best for your particular relationship.

, Try to sync up some vacation time or take a long weekend together. If you have children, consider hiring a sitter or ask a friend or family member to watch them for an overnight period, at the very least. Take some time to enjoy each other’s company away from your responsibilities, whether you take a road trip or just stay home doing nothing.Try to devote a regular block of time to spend together and try to use that time to see each other as more than just a professional being. Stress-free quality time will help you focus on each other as complete human beings instead of letting your diverging careers steal the spotlight.

, Talking to a couple’s counselor can help you gain an objective perspective and develop solutions for your particular difficulties. When choosing a counselor, look for someone who will remain objective and avoids taking sides. If you or your partner feel ganged up on, find another therapist.Go for a counselor or therapist who is future-oriented, suggests practical and fair ways of compromising, and helps you set clear goals in the first session.
Word of mouth is often the best way to find the best counselor, but it might be an uncomfortable subject to bring up with family and friends. If you’re hesitant to ask someone who know personally, you can ask your primary care doctor for a referral. Try calling your insurer and asking for a list of nearby in-network therapists covered by your plan. You can also search online by running a general search for “couples counseling near” your location, or by consulting Psychology Today’s find a therapist tool: https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/.

Look for emotions other than sadness.,
Think about whether you're ignoring your pain.,
Check for muddled thinking.,
Consider if you are feeling numb.,
Bring up this issue with the concerned person.",How to Handle People Who Think You Should Grieve Longer2," Sometimes, people go through a series of emotions associated with grief, often called the five stages of grief. Just because you aren't feeling sadness at the moment doesn't mean you aren't still grieving.While sadness/depression is one part, you may also feel denial or anger. Some people go through a bargaining stage, where they try to make a deal with a higher power. The final stage is acceptance, in which you are able to move forward with your life.
Keep in mind you may experience multiple stages at once, experience them out of order, or experience them repeatedly. You may reach acceptance and move forward with your life, but you may still have periods of feeling sad, angry, or in denial about the loss.

, People often think ignoring the pain of grief will help it go away. Ignoring the pain can make it seem easier, for a time, like you are done with grieving. However, ignoring the problem often makes it worse. You're living under the strain of suppressed emotion, and when you do finally allow yourself to feel, it may be that much worse., Often, grief shows up in the form of a muddled brain. You may have trouble making decisions, for instance, or you may have trouble focusing at work. If you find your thoughts feeling a bit murky, you could still be dealing with grief without realizing it., Some people have what's called complicated grief, which just means they have a more prolonged and difficult reaction to a loss.Complicated grief may seem completely at odds with what you're currently feeling, but one sign of complicated grief is a feeling of emotional numbness. This may make it hard for you to feel sadness, anger, or much of anything.Other signs of complicated grief can include nightmares and memories that intrude upon your daily life. You may want to isolate yourself, and you may notice weight loss or gain. The symptoms are very similar to those of major depression.
If you think you may be suffering from complicated grief, seek the assistance of a grief counselor and consider joining a support group.

, If you do find you are in one of these other states of grief, it may not be obvious to other people that you're still grieving. To help them understand, you could offer them a short explanation of what's going on, if you feel like it's appropriate.


For example, you might say, ""I appreciate your concern. The truth is, I am still grieving, but it may not be apparent to you because I'm going through a stage where my grief is mostly showing up as anger and denial. I'll get through this in my own time.""

Smile but act preoccupied.,
Take time to respond to his/her messages, texts, or phone calls.,
Publicize all your fun new activities and interesting friends on social media.,
Don't show any signs you care.,

Be seen, but be classy.,
Act like you've been there before.,
Go traveling or take a trip if you can.,
Don't lead your ex on and give them false hope if they are still begging you to come back.,
Pick up a new hobby, sport, or pastime.,
Find the real you.",How to Show Your Ex You've Moved On," When you bump into your ex, you want to give him/her the impression that you're happy but busy, even if that's not strictly true. If your ex sees you moping around in the mall, sad and depressed, they're definitely not going to believe that you've moved on.


When you see your ex, smile a few times at him or her, but not in a flirty or longing way. You want them to think that you're happy because your life is good, not because you saw them. Try not to let any of the unhappiness you experienced during and after the breakup ruin your mood.
If your ex asks you about how you're doing, focus on only the good, not the bad. That competition you won last weekend? Tell them. That school you got accepted into? That too. Don't lie, but focus on your accomplishments rather than failures.
Don't make time for him/her. This will make them think twice. Say something like, ""Oh, I'm just about to meet a friend, good talking to you,"" and walk off without looking back. Do this relatively early on.;
, Nothing says ""I'm desperate"" than when you immediately answer your ex's texts or phone calls. Take your time. Take a couple days to respond, pretending that it's really not a big deal.

, The internet is a great way to convince your ex that you've moved on. Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter are all golden opportunities to publicize your newfound freedom.


Take plenty of pictures when you're out with your friends, especially when you're having a blast. Going out to the beach? Take a picture and post a caption with something like ""Tamed two beaches in two days with my two best friends. Beach bod, say hello to summer!""
Stay a little mysterious. Have your ex and their friends wondering what you're actually up to. Post something a little mysterious to your social network that will get your ex thinking about all the cool things that you're doing without him/her.
Master the humblebrag. Humblebragging is when you pretend to be humble but actually brag. It sounds a little something like this:
""Ugh, my hair is sloppy, I have no makeup on, and I'm wearing sweats and Uggs, and still I get honked at walking down the street. SMH.""
""My date this Saturday is way too cute.... I'm already nervous/excited and I don't get nervous around guys.""
""Kinda wish I didn't have VIP tix to Coachella so I be with my besties the whole time. Music thrills but love kills.""



, It's perfectly okay to still have feelings for your ex, but if you want to show them you've moved on, they can't know about those. The following signs are ones to be avoided:


Go to his/her parties or special events. Make up an excuse if you have to.
Pay him/her compliments.
Call your ex ""just to talk."" If you need to talk, have something specific in mind you want to talk about. ie: children, family, finances.
Late night talks. S/he will feel vulnerable and believe you are still interested if you are telling them “Good Night” or reflecting on the past. They may feel you are missing him/her, therefore s/he will hold on to hope.
Get caught staring or looking too long at your ex. Try pretending they're not there.
Opening up with your secrets, dreams, and inner thoughts. Do not reveal your dreams. This falls under future plans and hopes, and your sleeping dreams. If s/he is to move on from you, they do not need to know you still dream of them.

, Letting other people — including your ex — know that you're seeing other people doesn't mean you have to be in their face about it. Be seen going to the movies, going to dances, and flirting, but don't be seen doing anything you'd be embarrassed doing around your parents (i.e. kissing, making out, etc.).
If you are still in contact with your ex and they inquire about your dating, be honest and up front. Tell them. If they are asking, they need to know in order to have closure and to move on from the hurt. If you are still hiding the fact that you are dating, s/he will feel that you are still interested in him/her and you will never have peace..

, Act like you know the program. The signs you show your ex directly are one thing; but the signs you show the rest of the world reinforce what you show your ex, and they help you actually move on, if that's what you want to do.


If someone asks you how you're holding up, say something like: ""You know, any breakup is hard. There were parts about that were great. But after we broke up, I realized the parts about that weren't so great, and now I'm focusing on finding someone who can change that.""

, Nothing says ""I'm not going to let this breakup keep me down"" quite like a good trip will. Some people travel to far-flung places like India or Tahiti after a breakup, but all you really need to do is find a change of scenery, even if that scenery is only an hour away!


When you're out and about, hang out with the locals. There's no better way to forget your sorrows than learning from and partying with the locals.
Remember to publicize your travels on social media! Never pass up the opportunity to brag about where you're going to the rest of the world, especially if it's a darn cool place.
Try different things. Be adventurous. Be curious. Put yourself out there. Very few people regret doing this once they've summoned up the courage to try it. It'll help soothe your soul.

, If you're constantly talking to your ex about past memories or saying each special occasion is bittersweet now that you are no longer an item, chances are, they'll never stop guilting you for leaving them, and that could cause both of you more extensive pain than you have experienced when you first made the decision to move on. When you are able to show them that their words of pleads and guilt no longer affect you (even if it does, don't reveal this to your ex) then and only then will s/he know you have moved on. If one person still feels hope, and they are entertained by their ex's attention to their feelings, they will never let go. They will never feel peace. You will never feel peace. You will never have enough peace within you to love again. You are doing a disservice to your ex if you do not permit them to move on and see a life without you if you shield them from pain. They need closure. And the only way to have closure is to feel the final blow of pain that there is no hope of the relationship reigniting. You cannot protect your ex and expect to move on and protect your next love. You may very well miss out on the love of your life if you are too busy protecting your ex. Allow yourself and your ex to move on and start new. Do not lead people on with the idea that you are easing their pain. You only further the pain and hurt for s/he, yourself and others involved. Be free. Let s/he be free.

, To help keep you preoccupied, and to help keep your mind from wandering, consider taking up a new hobby or really getting back into an old one you gave up.


Sports have the added benefit of giving you a great workout while you have fun. Going to the gym and hitting the treadmill every day can get boring, but playing 3 on 3 half-court is about as fun as it gets.
Try something that will push your limits. Breakups are opportunities to get to know yourself better. Why not learn about yourself by trying something you never would have thought you liked? Glass-blowing, rock climbing, wildlife conservation — whatever it is, keep it fresh!

, In order to move on, you need time to yourself to think like,""Who am I? Is this really me?"" Spending time on yourself will allow you to truly move on and feel detached from your ex. The more confident you feel, the easier dealing with confrontations or meetings with your ex will become.

Acknowledge what you have lived through.,
Validate your emotions.,
Get some distance.,
Have secure boundaries.,
Don’t be a victim.,
Seek support from friends and family.,
Recognise indicators of antisocial personality disorders.,
Know that it is not about you.,
Seek therapy.,
Go slow in new relationships.",How to Recover from a Relationship With a Sociopath," One of the first steps to recovering from a relationship with a sociopath is to fully acknowledge what you have been through. It’s important to try and reflect on your experience to help you understand what happened and how you can move on from it.A relationship with somebody who demonstrates symptoms of antisocial personality disorder can be incredibly difficult, as this person will typically feel little or no guilt about their actions or how they have hurt you.


A sociopath will also feel no empathy towards you, and will blame you for your situation. He may even appear to take satisfaction in your pain and distress.
It’s important to try and recognise these practices and diagnose the behaviour.
Doing this will help you understand that you were not at fault or responsible for his behaviour.;
, Once you have begun to acknowledge the situation you have been in, you can acknowledge the emotions that you may have been suppressing or your former partner may have undermined or invalidated. If you are frustrated, feel regret, and maybe a bit foolish about having been taken advantage of, accept these emotions and recognise that they are an entirely reasonable response.Acknowledging emotions will help you to come to terms with what has happened, and learn to trust your emotional responses.
A sociopath who lacks guilt or empathy can undermine your own emotional awareness and destabilize your sense of self.
Understanding that emotional reactions are normal, and your formers partner’s aren’t can help you to recover from the relationship.

, Getting some real distance between you and your ex is essential. It allows you to recover from the relationship by helping you to extricate yourself and have time to reflect and rebuild. A sociopath may be less likely to make the effort to follow somebody if they move away, so consider getting out of town for a while and staying with a friend or relative.


Going to another place can have a transformative effect, and allow you to see things anew.You might find it helpful to delete all contact information and disconnect yourself from social media.

, A crucial part of recovering from your relationship is having clear and firm boundaries that separate you from your former partner. Your ex may not respect the boundaries that you establish, so create boundaries for yourself that you will not cross. Having a clear understanding of where you won’t go and what you won’t do is essential to maintaining the distance necessary to recover.You could write down things that you will not do, such as answer his calls or contact him in any way.
In part, setting boundaries is about helping you unlearn the dysfunctional patterns of your previous relationship.You might find it useful to imagine a physical boundary between yourself and your ex. Build a wall in your head and see all of his hurtful comments and actions rebound off it., Affirm to yourself that you will not be a victim anymore. The relationship has ended and you are moving on. Embrace that, and repeat it to yourself again and again. Repeating positive statements and affirmations helps you to expose negative reactions or beliefs that may have become normal or dominant, and replace them with positive ones.Spend some time thinking about yourself and who you are. Think about what you want to do, where you want to go, and what you want to achieve.
Your former partner will not have shown any empathy towards you during your relationship, so now show yourself empathy.
Understand the difficulties you have been through, but assign them to the past and create a positive image of your future., Your relationship will have lacked empathy and understanding, so it’s important that you spend time with people who will show you empathy. This will help you to validate your feelings and come to terms with what you have been through. Friends or family may be the best people to talk to. Be sure you are comfortable talking about your relationship, and completely trust who you are talking to.


Try to talk to friends who are not experiencing any relationship problems of their own.
Spend time with friends or family that are positive and will help you think about the future as well as reflecting on the past.Consider seeing a counsellor to get some expert help that will be completely independent of your relationships.

, You can learn from the experience and take these lessons on with you through your life. When you reflect on your experiences in the relationship, try to identify and diagnose behaviour that is indicative of an antisocial personality disorder. Sociopaths are generally unashamed of what they do and how they make you feel, and will sometimes happily admit to hurting people emotionally, physically or financially. They often blame the victim of this abuse, saying that he was just naive. If you can recognise these factors it will help you to spot them in the future.Some of the key signs of a sociopath are:


The person behaves in hurtful ways and expects you to act as if nothing happened.
He manipulates people, directly or indirectly.
He treats you very differently at different times for no reason.
He is comfortable lying to get off the hook.
He externalizes blame, not taking responsibility for his actions and their consequences.
He sometimes seems to enjoy manipulating and hurting people., You will at some point ask yourself what you could have done differently and whether what happened is your fault. The more you learn about antisocial personality disorders the more you will understand that sociopaths are likely to feel no remorse about what they do, and may even take pleasure in manipulating you and hurting you.


Sociopaths can be very skillful manipulators. The way he acts is down to him, not to you.
He may have been very charismatic and effective at faking emotions, such as guilt.
While it may be hard for you to tell what he was doing, sociopaths are generally fully aware of the pain they are causing.
This awareness separates sociopaths from people with other personality disorders. Narcissists, for example, may cause hurt, but they likely do so while trying to protect themselves., Consider getting professional help in overcoming your relationship with a sociopath. Find a therapist who understands sociopathic behaviour. You will want to talk to a counsellor who understands the psychiatric disorder and can help you move on. Before you schedule an appointment, ask the therapist if he or she has a background in, or experience with, people who have been involved with sociopaths.


Look for groups or support among other victims. The best people to understand what you are going through are those who have gone through it as well.
Ask your therapist to refer you to a support group, or check online for forums dedicated to victims.

, If you have been in an abusive relationship with a sociopath, it’s important to give yourself time to heal and truly come to terms with it. Be cautious of jumping into any new relationships too soon, and be aware of any warning signs. Think about how you got involved with your former partner and be aware of any similarities with a newly developing relationship. Some warning signs to keep an eye out for include:


Does he recognise how his actions impact on others, and take responsibility for this?
Does he blame others for their situation?
Can he make a genuine and sincere apology?
Can he admit to making a mistake?"

Remind your child of their self-worth.,
Encourage your child to develop and stay true to their sense of self.,
Inspire your child listen to their gut.,
Talk to your teen about sex.",How to Give Relationship Advice to Your Child2," It can be hard as a parent to see your child bending over backwards to find love or a sense of belonging. Plus, it is all the more devastating to watch your child get hurt. Although relationships leave as many bruises as they often do lessons, you can help your child build the resilience to get through by enhancing their self-worth.Take advantage of every opportunity to compliment or praise your child. After bringing home a positive report card, you might say, “You’re so bright. Great job!” After seeing them comforting a friend, you might remind them “You are such a thoughtful and kind person.”
Giving your child a foundation from which they believe “I am enough” and “I am worthy” can help them bounce back when relationships don’t pan out how they hoped.

, A major grievance of many people in relationships is the idea that they lose themselves within the couple. Help your child thwart this problem by inspiring them to develop strong values and interests.


To single out the values of older children, ask “What do you care about?” focusing mainly on abstract concepts, if possible. They might say things like friendship, kindness, sports or even popularity.
When your child seeks relationship advice you can equip them to solve conflict by returning to those core values. For instance, your child might like someone who isn’t so nice to them. You might gently nudge them with insight, “I remember us talking about kindness being important to you. Isn’t that right?” Reminding your child of their values may help guide them towards making the right decision on their own., Adolescents are faced with an immense amount of pressure to fit in. This emphasis on what other people want can detach your child from their own instincts, resulting in them being rushed into experiences or situations. Help them reconnect to those instincts with gentle guidance.


You might explain, “Relationships should mostly feel good. When something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t. Pay attention to that feeling in your gut. It can help you avoid heartache.”, If your child is old enough to have an understanding of sex or they are exposed to peers or media who discuss similar topics, your open and honest communication can help steer them into making safe decisions. Talking with your children about sex when they are near the age when this is an issue for them will not encourage them to have sex, it will be more likely to discourage them and help them make safe decisions when they are ready to have sex. Being open with your teen will also increase the chances that they will come to you for advice.


Be sure to provide your child with accurate information about contraception, safe sex, and sexually transmitted diseases, and teach your child strategies for how to handle unwanted sexual peer pressure. Let them know that it is okay to say no to sex.
Whether for young men or women, parents want to stress that sex is normal and healthy –within the confines of a healthy relationship. You might say, “Take your time and only do what you and your partner feel ready to do. And, always be safe.” Explain to your child what they can do to be sexually healthy and avoid unwanted pregnancy.Society often shames women restricts the pleasure of sex to young men, but a talk can offer you a chance to empower your daughter. Sex should be enjoyable for her, also."

Maintain a positive bond with your child.,
Be wary of your own history.,
Resist offering unsolicited advice.,
Practice what you preach.",How to Give Relationship Advice to Your Child3," If you have a negative or rocky relationship with your child, it’s going to be quite a challenge to guide them in their own relationships. A major obstacle to talking to your kid about relationships—and them actually being receptive—is the quality of the bond between you.One of the best ways to build a positive bond with your child is by being there for them. Ask your child about what's happening in their life, and really listen to their answers.
If you have several children, make a point to spend quality time with each of them one-on-one to talk or engage in hobbies.

, Parents have the ability to set the tone of their children’s experiences in relationships. Unfortunately, this means that positive experiences often result in positive expectations, and negative experiences are conveyed with a sense of hopelessness or bitterness.Don’t let your own experiences with love darken your child’s relationships. Send the message that relationships can be fulfilling when they consist of two healthy individuals who communicate, respect each other, and make each other feel good about oneself and the relationship., If you’re trying to talk to your children about relationships with no premise or solicitation, prepare for it to possibly be discarded or ignored. Let your child come to you or, at the very least, take advantage of contextual stimuli (i.e. a TV show or a friend’s breakup) before sparking a relationship talk.Children, particularly teens, often view their parents as being out of touch concerning matters of the heart—often because parents minimize kid’s feelings of love simply because it doesn’t match their own.That’s why it’s important to form a positive relationship with your child and set the stage according to their own personalities.

, Your children are watching your behavior, for signs of what to do and not to do. Whether you are single, dating, or married, modeling healthy relationships in your own life is essential to passing on positive relational patterns to your child.Foster healthy communication skills by active listening in all your relationships. Demonstrate trust by respecting your partner’s privacy (physically and on social media) and right to pursue their own interests. Emphasize an equal partnership by making decisions together with your partner. Avoid negative language about partners. And, resist emotional manipulation such as guilt-tripping."

Study their smile.,
Notice any frowns that your ex makes.,
See if they avoid eye contact.,
Check if their eye brows are raised.,
Observe if your ex's arms are crossed, or relaxed.,
Notice if they lean in, or pull back, when you are talking.,
Notice if they are touching their hair, or fidgeting with their hands.,
Note the direction their toes are pointing.,
Check if their legs or feet are restless, and appear to be tapping.,
Notice if their feet and knees are facing you.",How to Read an Ex's Body Language," A genuine smile is a good indicator that they are happy to see you. When there is a ""eye twinkle"" involved, this may be a smile in which the whole face, even their eyes, are engaged with you.On the other hand, a fake smile, such as a plastered, half-grin that lasts more than 5 seconds, likely indicates disinterest., If your ex frowns when you speak, they might not want anything to do with you. A frown is a clear indication that they disagree, possibly with what you are saying or doing. Consider asking for clarification if you are confused about why they are frowning. Otherwise, keep the conversation short.

, While some people may avoid eye contact due to shyness, if this is an ex that you've been dating, or been with for a long time, shyness may be less of a factor, than disinterest. Avoiding eye contact may indicate lack of interest, avoidance, denial, or awkwardness. If you try to have an honest conversation with you ex, but he or she continues to be fidgety and avoiding your gaze, your ex may not be ready to talk with you yet.Conversely, if they are engaged when talking with you, and maintaining good eye contact, then they may be happy to have a conversation, particular if other body parts and their smile are engaged.

, If the eye brows are raised high, this may be a sign of discomfort or disagreement. This would often happen along with a grimace, or a possibly a frown.If one eye brow is raised and the other not, this may be sign of confusion or disagreement. Consider asking if there is something confusing about what was said. But beware, you don't want to just start another argument with your ex, so it's best to not force anything.

, If their arms are crossed while you talk, this is a sign of frustration, anger, or nervousness. They may not yet be open to having a conversation. Consider changing the direction of the conversation if your ex appears to be impatient, and continues to keep their arms crossed. Or, consider talking at a later point.


If your ex's arms appear relaxed, and not stiff, this is a good sign. When their shoulder and arm muscles appear less tense, your ex may see you as a calming presence, rather than as a source of stress.

, If your ex appears to be leaning in, or moving their body closer, this is sign that they are engaged and interested in talking with you. If they are moving in closer than an arm's length from you, they may be wanting to create (or recreate) greater intimacy with you.If they are pulling back, it's the opposite effect. They have disengaged with what you're saying, and are trying to create physical (and emotional) distance. This is a sign to back off, and perhaps talk another time.

, If your ex is touching or putting their hands through their hair repeatedly, this may mean a sign of attraction. Touching hair or body parts that are sensitive to touch, like ears, are signs of attraction. They are thinking about you, even when you're not around. Be aware that sometimes hair touching is just a nervous habit, that may be nothing to do with you, and is a subconscious way to relieve stress.

, If your ex's toes are facing your toes and body, this is a sign of affection. Your ex may be still interested in you, or at least willing to be friendly and open to talking. This is a good sign.

, Restless legs such as shaking, or foot tapping, are generally related to nervousness, impatience, or readiness to move on to something else. Foot tapping shows that your ex is ready to get going, not matter if you two spoke for a brief or long time. They may be nervous about seeing you again, or feel uncomfortable.If your ex's feet appear uneasy, your ex is likely uneasy. Don't force your ex into a conversation, but if there is a way to relieve anxiety and awkwardness by talking about something you both enjoy, feel free to try. See if he or she calms down; otherwise, possibly talk another time.
Conversely, if your ex appears to want touch you feet with their feet, this is a strong sign of attraction, and they are eager to be with you. Think clearly about if this is what you want too.

, If their feet and knees immediately turn away from you, this may mean they don't want to talk with you, even if their face doesn't give anything away. Feet can be more honest than a facial expression about whether you're talking with someone who dislikes you.If their feet are planted strong and solid, they may be showing, or trying to show, confidence.

Don't completely ignore your ex.,
Ease awkwardness with small talk.,
Make small gestures of friendship.,
Do social activities with mutual friends.,
Understand your ex might be unfriendly.",How to Show an Ex You Care1," You might not want him to be your boyfriend, but you probably still care about his happiness. It can be very difficult know how to react when you see your ex around. Maybe you are in classes together or are members of the same sports club. If you do see your ex around quite often and you want to maintain some cordial relations with him and show him that you do care, don't blank or ignore him.


If you never speak, it is likely that any festering resentment between you will continue to grow.
Just making an effort to acknowledge each other and smile when you see each other can demonstrate that you want to be friends.
It can be very difficult to build a friendship with an ex so remain patient and don't expect to develop a good friendship quickly.;
, It can be very awkward when you find yourself in a social situation with your ex and neither or you know quite how to approach it, or react to each other. Avoid any long silences by making neutral small talk about everyday things that are nothing to do with your relationship. If you can get used to just talking about normal things you can try to develop a platonic friendship.


Keeping conversation friendly but brief can help ease you both into the new relationship dynamic.
You could say, ""Hey, did you see the game last night?""
You could ask about mutual friends or work.

, Being generally helpful and attentive will help you to indicate to your ex that you do still care about him. Small gestures can be a good way to show your ex that you still think of him. For example, if your ex used to love eating a particular candy bar and you find you have one left over from lunch, pass it on to him and just say ""I had this left over, and thought you might want it"".


If you just want to show your ex that you still care, not that you want to get back together make sure these gestures do not give the wrong impression.
When you speak to him keep your tone friendly and polite but fairly neutral and unemotional.
If he is still pining after you, a misjudged gesture could make things worse so use your judgement.

, One way to show that you are not avoiding your ex, you are still keen to be friends, and still care about him is to do social activities as part of a larger group of friends. Having more people there will take the pressure off and dilute the situation. You will also have people there for moral support if things become awkward.Your ex is probably less likely to make a scene or misinterpret your actions if you are in a group of friends.
If you don't want to get back together be sure you avoid anything that could be perceived as a group date.
For example, don't go to the cinema with a couple or you risk giving your ex the wrong idea.

, Although you might want to show your ex that you still care about him and would like to be friends, you need to understand that he might not feel the same way. A breakup can be very upsetting and how people deal with it varies enormously. If he doesn't want to talk to you, or see you at all, you should respect that and allow him time to get over you.If your ex is hurting from your breakup, time apart can be the best way to heal.If you are polite and respectful, but he does not want to talk to you, you can't force him.
Tell him in a sincere way that you are there for him if he ever needs to talk, and be sure to listen more than you talk.

Be confident that your ex is the kind of person you want to be friends with, too.Think about what kind of friendship you want with your ex. Do you want to be able to hang out together, just the two of you, or do you want to be able to be friendly with your ex in a group of mutual friends? Or do you just want to feel comfortable saying hello to them and liking their pictures on social media?
Think about how your ex treated their other friends and make sure they are a good friend to others. For example, if you always thought your ex used friends for their own gains, it’s probably not worth it to develop a friendship.
More importantly, think about how your ex treated you. There's a reason you and your ex split. If it was because they didn't treat you well, then it's best to leave them in the past.
You may want to run this idea by friends and family members who know your ex. They may be able to provide some insight and help you decide if it's a good idea to pursue a friendship.;
, When you are preparing to talk to your ex, make sure you think about how you want to clearly communicate your desire for a friendship. You do not want let your ex think you are interested in anything more.For example, think about saying something like, “I have missed being in touch with you and have been remembering how much fun we had together as friends. I hope we could be friends again, though I want to be clear that a friendship is all that I want.”

, If you are nervous about your ex’s reaction, you might feel better about getting in touch with them via email or letter. Writing a letter lets you spend as much time as you need getting your words just the way you want them, and you can also say everything you need to say without worrying about being interrupted or argued with.You could begin your letter, “I am sure you are surprised to be hearing from me. I know we parted on bad terms, and I apologize for that. I have been thinking lately about how much our friendship meant to me, and how much I miss it. I am hoping we can reconnect as friends.”
Keep in mind that you may need to be patient about hearing back from your ex. It may take them a few days to compose a letter in response. They could also decide to call or text you if you indicate they can in your letter.
Your ex may also not respond to you. If they do not, you may need to decide whether or not to let it go, or try to get in touch with them a different way.

, If you still have your ex’s number, it might be easiest to give them a call. Your ex will probably be wondering why you are calling, so you may want to be ready to let them know you are looking to reconnect with them shortly into the conversation.


You might want to spend some time thinking about what you want to say beforehand. For example, you could say, “I have been thinking about you recently, and I really miss our friendship. I was hoping we could get together sometime and catch up, and maybe try to be friends again.”
Your ex may not want to answer your call, so be prepared to leave a voicemail. Practice what you want to say beforehand. You could say something like, “Hi Mina, it’s Heather. I know seeing my phone number was probably unexpected, and I don’t blame you for not picking up. But I was calling to see how you are and was hoping we could talk sometime. I miss having you in my life as a friend, and was hoping you’d be open to being friends again. Please call me back sometime.”
Don’t call when you’ve been drinking. Don’t make them think this is a drunk-dial situation, because they will not take your request for friendship seriously., If you are still friends with your ex on your social media accounts, try private messaging them through the platform they use the most. Keep your conversation friendly and see if they would like to catch up in person.


You could post a message publicly, but keep it short and generic. Don’t rehash your relationship where other people can read your conversation. You could say something like, “Hey Chris! Hope you are doing well!” If your ex responds, you could switch to a private message to continue your conversation.

, Don’t show up at their school or work and ask to be friends out of nowhere, for example. That will scare them off. Reach out through other channels first, to give your ex a chance to think about how they would like to respond.


If you happen to bump into them by chance, you could say, “Wow, it’s good to see you! I would love to catch up sometime if you’re open to it. Could I text you sometime?” Avoid a major conversation before they have the chance to consider if they’d like to have you back in their life.

, If you and your ex parted ways poorly, and you played a role in the bad ending, be sure to apologize early on for your part in the breakup. It may be difficult to have a meaningful friendship without an acknowledgement of your wrongdoing.You could say, “I know we had a really bad ending, and I am so sorry for how we parted ways. I hope we can get past it and eventually be friends again. It would be nice to talk about it in person, if you’re willing.”
Follow up with a more in-depth apology and conversation when you see your ex.

, They may not want to reconnect with you, and they may or may not provide you with reasons why they don’t want to. Accept their choice with understanding and without demanding an explanation.


Keep in mind that they may not respond to any forms of communication.
Your ex may be comfortable talking to you online, for example, but may not be interested in seeing you in person. Accept that and work to rekindle your friendship through the boundaries your ex sets. Keep the door open for a potential face-to-face meeting in the future.
If your ex responds with a message that conveys they are not interested in talking to you, you could say, “I’m sorry to hear that, but I understand. I know how difficult things were for us at the end, and I get it if you still are hurt. I wish you all the best.”

, Get together for coffee or lunch at a casual, non-romantic place. Treat your meeting as just that: a meeting. It's not a date, no matter how much it may feel like one.


If the place you are meeting serves alcohol, don’t drink at all or limit yourself to one drink. Too many drinks could impair your judgment with your ex.Drive separately to your meeting place.
Don’t meet at your house or your ex’s house. Being alone together could lead to more, and you are only interested in friendship., You don’t want to look like you are coming on to your ex. A handshake, a hug, or a peck on the cheek are all appropriate, but don’t take it beyond that. You do not want to indicate to your ex that you are interested in anything more than a friendship.If your ex tries anything that you are not comfortable with, get physical distance between the two of you and let them know you are not interested. You could say, “John, I just wanted to get together so we could catch up, but I’m not interested in rekindling a relationship. I know it’s easy to fall into old habits, but I just don’t want to go down that road again.”

, Ask what your ex has been doing, and if they have anything new to report. Share your own updates as well.



Be a good listener and ask a lot of questions about your ex’s life, family, job, and interests. Don’t monopolize the conversation.
If you run out of things to talk about in your own lives, you can always talk about current events, recent movies you’ve seen, or sports you both follow.Understand that the conversation might be awkward at first. Be patient. The two of you haven’t talked to each other for a while, and it may feel uncomfortable, especially if you parted on a bad note.

, The first time you meet up again, it may not be appropriate to delve too deeply into the past, beyond apologizing for hurting each other. Think about this meeting as taking a step into a new future, and not a rehashing of pain from the past.Don’t bring up old fights. Don’t bring up sentimental memories. There may be a time and place for this later, but not at your first meeting.
You may wish to offer a more formal apology for any pain you caused during your relationship. You could say something like, “I know I said this earlier when we first started texting, but I did want to apologize in person for how our relationship ended. I know I said some mean things, and I hurt you. I hope we can move on and build a friendship.”

, While it may feel easy and comfortable to slip back into old habits of your romantic relationship, avoid going down that road. Don’t call your ex by their old pet names or bring up old inside jokes, or anything else personal from your relationship.Old emotions may unexpectedly surface when you see your ex in person. If you find yourself getting emotional or feeling overwhelmed, excuse yourself to the bathroom and take some deep breaths.
Resist any temptations to be romantic with your ex, whether it is flirtatious or physical. Remember that your goal is only to reconnect with your ex as a friend.

, If your meeting went well and both of you seem interested in seeing each other again as friends, you could suggest you communicate on a more frequent basis. Spend some time discussing what you would like to do going forward.Agree on a level of contact that both of you are comfortable with. For example, you may decide that meeting up in person probably wouldn’t be feasible, but that you both are willing to continue talking over social media.
If both of you are willing to meet up again, plan another time to get together. If you share mutual friends, consider including some of them so it feels less like a date. You could say, “Do you want to get some friends together to go bowling sometime?”

, Don’t jump right back into a friendship. Just because you and your ex are talking again doesn’t mean you should smother them with invitations to get together and contact them all the time. Rely on your usual circle of friends for your social activities.Check in with your ex occasionally and chat, whether it’s online, on the phone, or via text.
Invite them somewhere if the outing seems like a good fit. For example, your mutual friend is coming to town for a visit and you want to get friends together to go out to dinner to celebrate, or you share a mutual love of an artist who is having a gallery opening.

, You may want to let bygones be bygones and move on, or you may find value in debriefing your relationship. Come to an agreement with your ex about whether you want to be open to talking about it or not.If you do decide you want to talk about your relationship, make sure you are in a place where you have some perspective about the relationship and don’t feel emotional when talking about it.If you and your ex have decided you’re comfortable talking about it, you could ask something like, “Why do you think our relationship ended so badly, when we were a pretty good couple otherwise?” or “If you could do it over again, what would you do differently in our relationship? I think I would have shared my feelings with you more. I was pretty closed off.”
This may provide a good opportunity for you to learn from past mistakes and do things differently in your next relationship., If you find yourself becoming attracted to your ex as the two of you are hanging out, be honest. Have a conversation about your feelings before flirting or acting on any of them. Make sure your ex follows the same rules.You could say, “Mark, I have to be honest. I have been feeling really attracted to you lately, just like the beginning of our relationship all over again. I wanted to tell you this because I know we agreed we would just be friends. What do you think?”
If your ex seems like they are behaving flirtatiously with you, consider calling them out on it. You could say, “Melissa, what’s up? I feel like you have had your hands all over me all night!”

Though it may feel almost impossible not to contact her immediately, hold yourself back from doing so.

, Even in a scenario where you were egregiously mistreated, do not do anything motivated by a desire for vengeance. While it goes without saying that you should not do anything dangerous or illegal, you should also avoid saying or doing anything disrespectful.

Don't hesitate to ask for help explicitly. Say something along the lines of, ""Hey, can I tell you about some of the thoughts I've been having? I think it'll help to get them off my chest, and I'd appreciate your advice.""

Talking like this while affirming your position will show that you are acknowledging and validating his feelings.

Start dating someone new.",How to Recover when Your Girlfriend Gets Married to Another Guy2," One of the harder parts of any separation with a romantic partner is letting go. Even when the other person has moved on, you may find yourself imagining a whole slew of “what if” scenarios; however, remind yourself that there are likely also many reasons that it didn’t work out.Reflect on how you felt when you were dating. Often, we look back on past relationships through rose-colored glasses. You may have even been questioning the relationship yourself.
Accept that she has moved on. You may have been holding out hope that things would work out between the two of you and you might have another shot at love with your ex. It may be painful to let go of that dream, but you can take her marriage as a definitive answer to any of your lingering questions: your romantic relationship is over.
Even if you weren’t convinced it was meant to be, it still hurts to be the one who is left behind. Remind yourself, however, that you’re likely feeling drawn to her in part because of her sudden increased distance.

, Everyone always has a list of things they want to spend more time on, try out, or grow more familiar with. Choose one or two activities you want to try or do more frequently. For instance, start hitting the gym three times a week instead of just once. Alternatively, pick up a new hobby altogether.


Try to choose something active and something creative. You can interpret these as broadly as you wish. The point is, staying active will literally help your body and mind feel better, and having a creative outlet can provide a powerful way to express your emotions.
For example, yoga or guided meditation can not only make you feel great, it will also likely lead you to meet new people. Simple, weekly activities can open up door to whole new friend groups and lifestyles!
Maybe you’ve always wanted to play guitar. Here’s your chance! You can probably even find people to learn and practice with by contacting local music stores or searching online.

, The classic example is a vacation. Start and email or group text thread with a group of your friends and pitch some ideas for a weekend trip. Choose somewhere relatively nearby so it will be easier and less expensive for people to commit. Pick a weekend a month or so ahead of time. This ensures you and others can prepare for the trip, and will give you something to look forward to for the next month!


If you can’t escape for a trip, make plans to have friends over next weekend, just to hang out. There’s nothing like a video game marathon to distract you for a while and help you relax.

, Sometimes a rude awakening can be exactly what we need. Use your new found freedom to refocus on your goals. When you catch yourself thinking about her, distract yourself immediately. Choose a goal you want to achieve, and whenever she comes to mind, think of something you can do to help achieve that goal and get to work.


If you’re looking for a new goal, consider meeting someone new. Instead of just waiting to meet someone, start introducing yourself to people you’re attracted to more frequently. This may be especially easy at events that have to do with something you enjoy.

, Some of the scarier aspects of enduring a romantic partner marrying someone else are the different forms of self-doubt that will inevitably arise. You may find yourself questioning your ability to trust someone again, or to maintain a romantic relationship. Nip these doubts in the bud by dating someone else.Take advantage of your new found freedom! This doesn’t mean you have to jump into anything serious. In fact, you shouldn’t. That said, you should definitely introduce yourself to that cute barista you’re always happy to see.
If you are feeling betrayed and find it difficult to trust enough to start dating, take some time to work on coping with your emotions and learning to trust again.

See a mental health professional.",How to Recover when Your Girlfriend Gets Married to Another Guy3," Grief is an entirely natural reaction to loss, especially the loss of someone we care deeply about. Not only companionship, but potentially even shared goals for the future are all suddenly lost. Feeling the pain of these losses in a necessary part of letting go something. Accordingly, the resentment, sadness, relief, fear, and confusion you may feel are actually necessary parts of your recovery.Share how you’re feeling. Whether with friends or a therapist, it will help to talk about what you’re going through.

Keep a journal. Writing your thoughts is an extremely effective way to help release emotions and center yourself.
Know that the pain will subside. Though you may feel deeply saddened, your heart and mind will eventually begin to move on. If you don’t notice your mood and emotions improving after a while, set up a time to meet with someone who is trained to talk with you about your mental health.

, The circumstances of your ex getting married to someone else may leave you feeling shocked and betrayed. You may wonder if you can ever trust anyone again and be reluctant to open yourself up to another relationship. There is work you can do with a therapist or on your own that can help you heal and be willing to trust someone in the future.

Work with a therapist to learn to separate your fears related to this betrayal from future relationships. You can explore what suggests a potential partner is someone you can trust — such as repeatedly following through on their promises and how they react when you allow yourself to be vulnerable.Notice if the person takes responsibility for their mistakes and if they seem invested in understanding your wants, needs, and well-being.Becoming distrustful after a betrayal limits your social connections with others and may cause you to miss out on other potentially fulfilling relationships.

, You may feel some pretty heavy emotions for a while. You may even feel used, shamed, or betrayed. Many people enduring an unexpected separation feel inadequate, or even expendable. You may even start to feel less interesting, or less attractive. You may feel betrayed, shocked, and angry. These negative thoughts are normal under the circumstances — try to avoid stuffing them down and not addressing them. Processing these emotions may be difficult, but working through your feelings will help you move on and start feeling better about yourself.First, allow yourself to sit with your emotions and identify what you're feeling. Instead of distracting yourself from what you're feeling, ask yourself: What feelings or sensations do I have? What thoughts am I having? What am I feeling in my body (tight chest, upset stomach, headache, etc.)? Do I have any judgements toward what I'm feeling? Do I have the urge to fight those feelings?Allow yourself to feel your emotions. Though it might be painful, remember this — your emotions are not going to kill you. Breathe through the feeling and ask yourself: What do I think will happen if I sit with this emotion? Is it really intolerable? How can I make it more tolerable (deep breathing, meditating, relaxing, etc.)?
Address the emotions. Acknowledge that you are likely feeling these emotions as a direct result of your former girlfriend getting married — you may feel unlovable, but it's not because that is true, it's because you are reacting to a painful experience. Teach yourself how to challenge negative thoughts by reframing them and using evidence to refute them.
For instance, maybe you keep thinking you will never meet another woman. Write down all the evidence that shows this isn't true — You met other women you liked and even loved before you met her; going to a coffee shop and looking around, you see dozens of women who look interesting and attractive; there are billions of people on the planet, and chances are pretty good at least one of them is someone you would like to date., Somewhere buried within the moments of emotional distress are occasional whispers of relief. You no longer have to wonder about a relationship that you may have been unsure of yourself. Either way, she’s moved on, and this may enable or motivate you to do so as well.Further, people often don’t recognize unhealthy relationships until they’re no longer in one. Remember that recurring issue you two could never work out? Well, now you don’t have to.

, You’ve been trying to push away all the inadvertent emotions and persistent feelings of loneliness and abandonment. Sometimes, you can distract yourself, or even convince yourself to put a positive spin on everything. But sometimes, the negativity seems to just grab onto your brain and hold it in a vice grip. This is entirely natural — feelings are feelings, and they come up when you least expect it.Even if the scenario wasn’t outrageous, and you and your ex have mostly parted ways on good terms, the fact that she’s potentially happier with someone else won’t stay out of your mind. Understandably, this bums you out. This is natural, and it's okay to feel bummed out about it — in fact, it healthier to allow yourself to feel that instead of pushing it away or pretending everything is fine. Go through the steps of processing the emotion and take an action that will help you feel better, like talk to a friend or shooting some hoops.
Watch out for worsening or recurring negativity. If you’re suffering most of the time, consider meeting with a therapist.

, The pain of separation is in many ways biologically significant. People are programmed to have strong feelings of attachment to those they are romantically involved with. This, in part, explains the potency of love. When an ex publicly declares her love for another, it’s going to hurt. Consider meeting with a therapist if you can’t move on, or if you start to have any thoughts that persistently bother you.


Therapists have talked to all sorts of people about all sorts of relationships, and will know how to help you address certain types of thoughts as they arise.
A therapist can also help you start to conceptualize your life in more healthy, forward-thinking, and happiness-inducing ways.

Take an honest look at the past.,
Assess your motives.,
Be sure that you can overcome the problems.",How to Reconcile With an Ex Lover1," All relationships end for definite reasons, and you should think hard before taking any action. Why did your relationship end? More than that, why do you want to go back to your ex? Some honest reflection will protect you from falling into the same traps and getting hurt again.Ask yourself: if you blame your ex for the breakup, why do you want to get back together? Has she changed the behavior that led to problems? Why would another go-round work when the first did not?
If you blame yourself, have you changed? Consider your contributions to the breakup. Be very careful that you are not crafting a rosy narrative of your role, one that overlooks very real faults in your behavior.;
, There are good reasons and bad reasons to pursue a reunion with an ex—lover. Look into your motives and evaluate them. Are they good or bad? Would you still want to get back together with her if your life was ideal, for example? If not, the wrong reasons may lie behind your desire.Do you really still love her? Do you see a stable future together? Was your break up rash, due to a rough patch in a usually happy relationship? Or was it due to youth and you think you’ve now matured? These might be legitimate reasons.Is she putting pressure on you? Or perhaps you are worried about money, loneliness, or dating again? These are NOT good reasons to pursue a reunion.
Be very careful if you have children together. Children need stability. A clean break or stable relationship is best if you want to make things work for your kids. Casually dating your ex – their mother or father – is confusing and cruel., Were the issues in your relationship chronic or trivial? How many chances have you given your ex? Behaviors are deep and hard to change, and that includes how we interact as couples. Don’t expect to be able to change your behavior or that your ex will easily change her own.Was substance abuse involved? Drug and alcohol abuse are serious mental health issues. You shouldn’t think about reuniting with an ex unless you have had several years of treatment and sobriety. The danger is that your old patterns of behavior will reemerge, and lead you back down the path of addiction.Was cheating part of the problem? If so, you and your ex need to come to terms with your past in counseling. Otherwise, the issue may arise again.

You may want to see who your ex is with and what the person is doing in the hopes that your ex feels as miserable as you. But this can create a bad cycle of using social media for reassurance that ultimately makes you feel worse.Be aware that if you are using social media to find out where your ex is and then find him or her, this is actual stalking and potentially illegal. If you find yourself doing this, you may need to seek professional treatment.;
, The expansive world of social media sites like Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram give people incredible access to the lives of others—including those you may not want to see. Blocking your ex entirely from any of your own social media sites may most extreme way to not stalk your ex, but it is also the most effective.Be prepared to deal with either your ex or mutual friends asking you why you took this action. Your decision may hurt your ex or mutual friends even. However, explain that the pain of your breakup is too much and this was the best decision for you and not meant to hurt anyone.
Realize that another added benefit of blocking someone is that you often need to refriend or refollow the person. The sheer embarrassment of having to ask permission to see so that you can stalk the person may keep you from doing this.

, A less extreme way to not have the temptation of stalking your ex is to unfriend or unfollow the person on social media. This can help prevent you from accessing your ex’s sites, limit how much of the person’s life you see, and also minimize how badly you feel.Prepare yourself to deal with invariable questions just as you may with blocking an ex. You can also use the same explanation, “Honestly, I need a break. Maybe in the future I can follow my ex on social media. For now, I need to just not see or be able to see what Gregory is doing.”

, If you’re concerned that blocking your ex might hurt the person or leave others questioning you, limit what you see on social media. You could simply unsubscribe from your ex’s posts or other features that might alert you to what your ex is doing.Some social media sites like Facebook will even automatically prompt you to limit exposure when you change your relationship status., Depending on your network of friends, your ex may appear in statuses, location updates, and photos on social media sites. These may upset you, especially if you find out your ex is with a new partner or having a ball without you. In order to avoid seeing your ex's name or image, consider un-following the social media feeds of mutual and/ or close friends.Play off anything you may miss if you don’t want the person to know you’re no longer following his or her feeds. If a feed is mentioned, just say “oh, I must have missed that” or “I only got a quick glance because I didn’t notice it until I was at work.”
Consider being honest to mutual friends. You can say, “I’m so sorry, but it’s just too painful to see Gregory in your news feeds. I really value your friendship and know he does, too. For now, I’d love to catch up with what you’re doing in other ways.”

, From time to time, you may be tempted to poke around social media and search engines for your ex. One innocent search or view of a news feed could lead you to a night of questioning about things such as whether or not the person who liked your ex’s recent profile picture is a relative or new love interest. By reminding yourself that it’s better for you to avoid your ex’s social media and web presence altogether, you aid the process of closure. A little self-control in this regard can give you more control over yourself and your emotions., Many smartphones, tablets, and other devices connect phone numbers with social media presences. You can prevent yourself from stalking your ex by removing the person’s contact information from devices. This can not only keep you from looking up your ex in a moment of weakness, but will also remove an ever-present reminder of the person.Write your ex’s contact information on a piece of paper if you may need to contact the person. This keeps you from having the reminder of the person as well as the temptation of looking up his or her sites.that you won’t see every day and store it in a safe place.

, If you find yourself pining to look at your ex’s social media sites, pull out a sheet of paper and write down a list of reasons why your relationship didn't work. This can keep you from jumping to conclusions and missing a bad relationship.

, Relationships can be intense and a partner can be a significant part of your life. It’s natural in relationships to mention your partner and you may be tempted to do this even after you’ve broken up. However, this can remind you of the person and make you want to find out what he or she is doing. Consciously not talking about your ex can distract you from thinking about the person.Remember that it’s normal to mention an ex—especially if it is about a good time—sometimes. Avoiding any mention about the person with friends may feel awkward for everyone involved. If you need to bring up your ex as a way to process your feelings, do so but avoid making it a regular habit.
Ask your friends to avoid mentioning your ex around you. This may remind you of your ex and could make you want to find out further details on social media. There may be situations, especially with mutual friends, where your ex’s name is mentioned or even discussed. If this happens, step away from conversation until there is a new topic.

, You may not be feeling great after a breakup. But this can be a great opportunity to lean on and reconnect with family and friends. They can help distract your and provide support if you need it—even to take your devices away so that you can’t stalk your ex.Be open with your support system about your feelings. You can even let friends and family know that you’ve been following your ex on social media. They can offer you a open ear and advice, or remind you that talking about your ex is hurting you. In addition, your support system can do activities with you to distract you from your feelings and social media.

, It can take a lot of time to get over a relationship. But concentrating on yourself can help distract you from your ex. Do stuff that you couldn’t do with your ex, which can help you realize that you don’t care what he or she is doing or have feelings for the person.Do things like getting a massage or attending a yoga class, both of which can help you focus on you and relax. Spend time reading books that you didn’t get a chance to do with your ex.
Try new activities that your ex doesn’t do. This can distract you from checking social media and reinforcing bad feelings. For example, you may have wanted to learn how to cook but your ex hated the idea. Taking a class and mastering different dishes can take up a lot of time that you may have otherwise been stalking your ex on social media.

, Give yourself a chance to distract yourself from your ex and any mutual friends by meeting new people. In fact, you may even have a better time with new friends and acquaintances and entirely forget about stalking your ex on social media.Meet new people at new activities or by joining a group of something in which you’re interested. For example, join a running club or go to a different happy hour in a new place. Group activities are a great chance to meet new people and divert your mind from your ex.

Move on if you're not feeling the love.You cannot obsess another person into loving you more.",How to Overcome Obsession in a Relationship," Obsession also prevents your personal growth and individuation. It isn't possible to get all that you need in life from another human being and trying to do so will smother the other person and will leave you feeling dependent and helpless. These are all negative outcomes for both you and the person you're in the relationship with., You love a person because of who you are, not because of who they are. This person cannot fulfill the things that lack within you; only you can do that. Being in love is a choice, not something that is visited upon you as some sort of salvation. Love isn't an excuse or a distraction from the challenges you're facing in life. Love isn't a way to hide from the hard task of growing up, maturing and finding your own pathway in life., While you are obsessing over one person, it is possible that you are failing to see the limitations of the relationship and its use-by date. Meanwhile, the person who would actually be more compatible with you might walk right on by while you're enslaved to an obsessive, one-sided relationship. By not obsessing over any person in your life, you free yourself to know that the relationships you are in are right for you, and if not, to start extricating yourself and looking for healthier connections.

, The person you're with may have priorities in his or her life that you just don't understand. Becoming obsessed and hoping like crazy that your mere existence will be enough to change these priorities reveals a lack of understanding and suggests that you're in need of a reality check. People who change plans because of someone pushing them tend to end up really resenting that person. It may not show now but it will surface eventually, and it often happens when you're so deeply embedded that losing this person is like losing a part of yourself.It is better to be wise to the possibilities from the start rather than to fantasize, cajole and pressure this person into loving you.

, If you think this is the right person for you, remind yourself that they may not be in the same stage of the relationship as you are. Relax and be yourself instead of trying to make things happen faster. Adjust your pace. Not everyone falls in love at the same rate and if you turn the heat down a little, you will feel better and they just may miss you enough to make a deeper commitment.

, That way, you can give yourself some space so you can work through it. Until you admit you have a problem, you will have a hard time overcoming it.

, Self-love is about respecting your own dignity and supporting it, recognizing and nourishing your own talents and caring for your own needs and wants. Having a sense of purpose that matches who you are is handy too, although it may take some people longer than others to truly work out who they are.


In contrast, self-absorption is about placing your own needs and desires before anyone else's. Self-absorbed people may be desperate for others' approval and not have a great opinion about themselves., The more confused about who you are, the more you owe it to other people to not obsess over them and to draw clear lines in any relationship about how you are still ""finding yourself"".This isn't the same as not wanting to commit; that too is a form of hiding from reality. This is about telling the other person that you're still finding your way in life, that you sometimes feel confused and to let you know if you ever start trying to blur the boundaries by over-relying on the support, love and attention from this person instead of standing on your own two feet. Honesty will help both of you steer through the challenges ahead with open eyes.

, One of the signs of an obsessed partner is that he or she drops everything and only does what the partner does, only loves what the partner loves and only focuses on what the partner focuses on.A little of this is to be expected when first falling in love but not to such an extent that you replace your interests with those of your partner's. Find a good balance between taking part in your partner's interests out of curiosity, love or simply being affable, while still maintaining the things you love to do in life.


Keep your usual hobbies and sports going. Ask your partner along sometime to see what you do but don't expect a ""forever commitment"" to your interests by your partner either.
Start new interests as you continue to grow. Do not stifle your maturation because you fear that your partner won't like you changing or learning new things. A partner who feels this way is unhealthy to be around; all human beings grow and change over time, this is to be expected.Stay active with your passions. Your relationship is but one passion, not a complete replacement for the range of joys in life.

, While the first few giddy months of a new relationship often contain an element of complete immersion in one another, it isn't good for this to continue for a long time. Make a dedicated effort to get back in touch with friends and family you've lost touch with, and get back into doing your community-spirited activities too. Even better, don't lose touch with anyone even at the beginning stages of the relationship; a good partner will see your commitment to others as part and parcel of who you are and respect it.


If you have a partner who demands that you don't see others and that you do nothing else but spend time together, be very wary. This is a sign of a controlling person who may well be manipulating you into obsessing about him or her and not letting anybody else into your lives. You may even end up convincing yourself that you made this choice, when you were actually manipulated into it., Obsession squeezes the fun out of a relationship and turns everything into hard work, causing you to worry about every word and action, to feel jealous about anything and anyone that removes your partner from you.This person may, or may not be, your one true love. Realize that a ""one true love"" is an ideal and it sets you up for obsession through wanting it to be so. If you both work out, it'll be because you've enjoyed one another's company, found it really easy to spend time together and have not fallen apart when apart. If it doesn't work out, then no amount of obsessing would ever have glued back together an incompatible pairing.

, Avoid hogging their time, wall or scrolling feed. In particular, do not leave snarky or snivelling remarks about their whereabouts, about people they're engaging with online or about your hurt feelings. Everything you type in and save is there for good and the more you obsess in the online environment, the faster it becomes clear to more than just your partner that you have a boundary problem that just isn't healthy. Instead, give each other space online, keep the messages simple and sweet and leave the deep talk for face-to-face time.Quit the Facebook/Twitter stalking. Do you really need to know what your partner is up to all the time? Avoid spending too much time on social media. Find distractions, such as reading a good book and walking in nature.

, Consider your feelings when this person doesn't call, text or email you. If you're usually so crazy, angry or sad that you put off doing other things to wait and then end up making all sorts of excuses to explain this silence, it's probable that you're obsessed and that you're failing to get on with your life.Don't ever think the other person is sitting around thinking about you. The reality is that, even if you are an incredible person, your partner is probably wrapped up in getting on with their own life. If they feel interested in you, they will take the initiative to contact you. Since they are not doing that, it means they are busy or think you've already connected enough lately or have other things to be doing that don't need your hand-holding. None of these reasons are about you or about leaving you out––they're each about getting on with everyday life in a normal human way.


Even if your partner fails to contact you because he or she doesn't much care or is doing suspicious things such as being unfaithful, this is not a reason to obsess. This is a reason to find a new partner!

, If you don't seek healthy outlets and find ways of coping with the things that aren't sorted in your own head, there is a risk that you'll try to use your partner as a proxy for feeling better about yourself. Develop your self-esteem, deal with your feelings of loneliness, and learn to connect with other people outside of a romantic relationship. In this way, you are putting effort into building your sense of self worth rather than hoping to ""catch it"" from another person (it sure doesn't work like that!).


If you feel you ""need"" a partner, use that a warning bell to take a good look at yourself. Nobody ""needs"" a partner; we all need healthy social relationships, supportive people and love but a partner is only one source of that. It is certainly something many people would like in their lives but neediness shouldn't be the motivation to become involved with someone. Love is a choice remember, not an imperative. Pick wisely.Realize that the irony is that the more you care about yourself and others, the more likely you are to attract someone who will love you deeply. Focusing on being the best person you can be and caring broadly for all people are attractive traits in any person.

, The cliché ""if you love someone, let them go; if they love you, they will come back"" is never more relevant than when you feel a relationship is wavering. Make it clear that you love this person but that you are not going to put up with second-rate love, shenanigans, unkindness or any other negative behavior and actions. Tell your partner to get their act sorted without expecting your tolerance for misbehavior. If you're obsessive because of bad behavior--trying to ""love someone"" into loving you--it can be really hard to give such an ultimatum and to let go, which can lead you to cling to something that is plain unhealthy for you. You don't deserve incomplete love or a shadow of love; you deserve the entire commitment. So let go and see what happens. If complete love is not forthcoming, you too are free.

Give yourself – and her – space.,
Reassess yourself – and clean up your act.,
Keep busy.,
Revamp your image.",How to Reconcile With an Ex Lover2," For a few weeks after a breakup, you will be feeling a lot of emotions, some of them conflicting. Give yourself time and let these emotions settle. Do the same for her. Don’t call or contact her. Don’t respond if she contacts you.Use this time to rest, recuperate, and, if need be, mourn the relationship. Get away from the stress and unhappiness of the event and take time to focus on your personal wellbeing.
Try to keep your spirits up. Go out with friends and vent. At the same time, don’t be tempted to mask your feelings with alcohol.

, Now is the time to act on your personal reassessment. If the breakup was your fault (or even if not), take stock of your traits and decide what you need to change. Did you smother your ex, for example? Or perhaps you were overly insecure about the fact that she had some close male friends? If these were issues, confront them head on.


It might be helpful to talk to a counselor. You will learn more about your wants and needs in a relationship and how to respond to others. Even if you don’t end up back with your ex, it will be a chance to talk and grow., Keep busy and happy while working on your personal growth. Breakups are emotionally difficult, and the activity will be good for your mental health and mood. Do the things that you love to do; be independent and pursue your interests.


Connect with friends. Good friends are a support network. Meet them for coffee or lunch, they will make you feel better and encourage you.
Renew a hobby. Paint, write, or go dancing. Don’t let the breakup stop you from doing the things that you love.
Exercise. Working out will boost your mood and make you feel better about yourself, emotionally and physically.

, You don’t need to change your appearance to make an ex jealous or to entice her back. However, a new wardrobe or makeover may well boost your self-esteem. There is nothing sexier than self-confidence – and consider it a bonus if she or others notice.


Try a new hairstyle. Update your wardrobe. Get a stylish new pair of glasses. Grow that beard that you always wanted. The changes will put you in a fresh frame of mind.
Live healthier. Eat a better diet, work out regularly, or join a gym. If you feel better about your body, you will become more self-confident in your interactions with others.

Reach out to him.,
Ask to meet up.,
Have a heart-to-heart talk.,
Move forward slowly...or move on.",How to Reconcile With an Ex Lover3," At some point, you will have to make contact with your ex. It might be easier to start with an email or text, especially if you have been out of contact for a while. Unlike the phone, both of these methods give you time to plan your response.Your first tries should be brief. Send a simple message, e.g., “I was out to eat last night at (Name of your favorite restaurant) and thought of you...” or “I saw the movie X last night and remembered how much you liked it!”
If you get a positive reply, wait a while before renewing contact. Be confident. Do not expect anything, and don’t pester your ex with messages. This will just seem needy and desperate.
Don’t ask to meet. The aim here is just to clear the air. A meeting, if it happens, will come later.

, After re-establishing contact, you will at some point have to take a risk and ask your ex to meet. You might try framing this as “catching up” rather than as a date. For example, ask whether he’d like to get coffee sometime, maybe next week, to catch up with each other. That will make the situation less stressful.


Be prepared for a refusal. Try not to get angry or beg if he turns you down. Accept the refusal gracefully and wish him well. Ending the conversation on good terms will leave the door open for future contact., You’re finally catching up with you ex over coffee. You’ve told him about all the things that you’ve done since the breakup – how you took an art class and have been singing in a choir. You’re showing your confidence and independence. Now is the time, but only if he seems open to it, to bring up your relationship and what went wrong.


Pick your spot. Try to read his body language. If he becomes defensive or makes it clear that he doesn’t want to talk about the past, accept it and change topics.
Tell him how you feel. Say that you’ve missed him and regret how the relationship ended. Be honest, be sincere, and say that you miss him.
Maintain eye contact. Don’t look evasive or distracted.
Acknowledge your mistakes and apologize. Be specific and sincere. An effective apology takes complete responsibility – no “buts” or excuses., Your heart-to-heart talk may get the answer you’ve longed to hear. In that case, move forward slowly. Try a casual date. Be communicative and remember what issues caused the relationship to fail the first time. Be wary of falling back into old bad habits.


Accept a refusal gracefully and try to move on with life. Don’t grovel or beg. At the very least, you will have closure and know that you tried as best you could to salvage the relationship.

Take stock of your feelings about the situation and the person. Try to determine how you feel about them before you decide to go any farther.


If your instincts are making you feel uneasy about the situation, don’t take this lightly. Reigniting an old flame can be hard work, so don’t jump into something if your heart seems to be telling you to be cautious.
It may be hard to pinpoint your feelings without designating some time for this purpose. Take time out in a quiet space and try to detect your immediate gut instinct about your Ex asking you out again. What is your instinct telling you? Are you sad, happy, depressed, moody, enthusiastic, or excited? Try not to question this instinct. If your gut intuition is positive, then he may be worth reconsidering. If your gut intuition negative, then you may need to just respectfully decline his offer and move on.;
, Take some time to think about what happened between the two of you in the past. Why did you break up? How do you feel about him now? How did you feel about yourself when you were together? There are a million reasons why people break up. Think about why you two broke up and decide how you feel about it.The most important thing here is to realistically reflect on what actually happened between the two of you and think about your feelings on the issue.

, There is always an underlying cause for any break up. Think about why the two of you broke up and consider if the situation is still the same. Have your circumstances changed enough that you think your relationship could be more successful this time around?Perhaps you broke up because you didn’t have enough time for each other, but now your work situation has changed and it could work between the two of you. Or maybe you broke up because he cheated on you, in which case you would have to decide if you could move forward and trust him again.

, It is important to stay in the present moment, but you might also want to consider what you want in your life moving forward and think about whether or not he fits into that picture you have for your life. You need to make the decision that’s best for you, not just for him. So carefully think about where you want to go in your life and if you think he’s the right person to be by your side while you do it.Can you picture him in your life forever? Do you want to move away for college? Will he accept that? These are the kinds of questions you should ask yourself.

, This is true whether you want to get back together or not. You want to make sure you are both clear about what happened and why. You shouldn’t rush into anything and make a rash decision.Make sure you are somewhere quiet where people won't overhear and make both of you nervous or embarrassed.

, It is important to forgive and move on when you have a relationship issue. However, if the problems you both had in the relationship haven't gone away, then maybe you two just don't work together as a couple.If you are still upset about something that happened between the two of you and you are not ready to consider getting back together, then be clear about the reason you two broke up before and express any fears you may have about repeating the same situation again.

, If you have forgiven your ex and you do decide to move forward in the relationship, then it is important to make your expectations known. Otherwise, you may end up in a similar situation.Talk about what you hope will be different this time around and be clear about your feelings.

, If you do so, remember that you will need to let go of the past and focus on your future together. You both may want to take things slowly similar to how you did when you dated the first time.


If it's yes, make sure he knows where you're coming from immediately, especially if you are truly giving your relationship another chance. It's important to be very clear, as it may be a case where he assumes that he knows how you feel, especially when it comes to him. Honesty is the key to any great relationship.

, If your answer is no, then you can just say “no.” You don’t have to offer an explanation. However, it is important to be direct with your answer. This will save you the embarrassment of him asking you again, and him the embarrassment of you saying no again.If a simple “no” doesn’t seem to work, you may need to be more firm in your replies. Try saying something like, “I appreciate the sentiment, but I am not interested in giving this another try. Please stop asking me.”
The most important thing to keep in mind is that you need to do what is right for you. If he is making you uncomfortable by continuing to ask repeatedly, then feel free to block him from contacting you. Block his number in your phone so he can’t call or text you; block him on Facebook and Gmail; and delete him from all of your other social media accounts.
If he continues harassing you, tell him you will report him to the police and apply for a temporary restraining order (TPO).

, Whatever the outcome of your decision, take some time to ease back into the new situation – whether it’s a relationship together or moving forward on your own. Don’t expect to jump straight back to the place you were at before you broke up. There may be trust issues or distance between you that you’ll have to overcome together.Give yourself time to adjust to being together or to being on your own without him for real. These things take time, so don’t beat yourself up about it if you need some time to adjust or to heal.

Live your life.,
Enter your ""me"" phase.,
Get in shape.,
Give yourself a makeover.,
Always look your best.,
Date other people.",How to Make Your Ex Jealous1," This sounds like a basic concept, but the best way to make your ex jealous is to live your life. More importantly, enjoy your life. Be happy with where you are in life. Being happy tells your ex that you are happy even though you are alone and he is no longer in your life.Mean it. Don't just pretend to be happy, but actually feel it. You may be sad you are broken up, but focus on other things. Don't stop working, exercising, going out with your friends, or doing things that you enjoy. Instead, do all that and more. Take up a new hobby or do something you've never done before.
Post pictures on social media of your life. Take a selfie while on a hike, post a picture while out with friends, and get someone to take a picture of you doing something you've never done before. When your ex sees these pictures, he will know you are living your life without him, and be jealous that you are still happy and doing awesome things.;
, Since you are single now, focus on yourself. Don't mope around the house, waiting for your ex to call. Don't try to win him back. Don't try to contact him. Instead, make this time about you. Do things that make you happy. In the process of making yourself happy, you will make your ex jealous by doing things other than being sad you broke up. Plus, whether you are moping or going on your next adventure, word will get back to your ex. There's no better way to make him jealous than by not dwelling on him.Call up friends you haven't seen for awhile. Arrange fun outings that will take your mind off your breakup.
Take a trip. Don't let being single keep you from a weekend getaway or a day trip somewhere new. Get out of the house and explore the area.

, Sitting around eating ice cream and chocolate is not going to accomplish anything, except maybe an extra 5-10 pounds. Instead of letting yourself go as you get over the breakup, get moving. Drop a few pounds and tone your body to make your ex jealous when he sees your improved physical shape.Join a gym. You can lift weights, go to classes, and get out of the house. You might even meet someone. If you don't want to join a gym, then get outside. Go running, take a hike, ride a bicycle, or go kayaking. Try any kind of physical activity.
Exercise helps boost your confidence. When you accomplish even small goals, like running a mile or hiking a trail, it helps make you more confident. Confidence is definitely something you want to have to make your ex jealous. Being a strong, confident individual is a cause for jealousy.Exercise not only will make you look better, but it will help you feel better. Engaging in activities gets your mind off of the breakup, and exercise releases endorphins into your brain that help lift your mood.

, Breakups hit everyone's self-esteem hard. To help yourself feel attractive and confident, do something to pamper yourself. Get a haircut. Grow a beard. Buy a new pair of shoes. Buy a new outfit.Do something nice for yourself to make yourself feel better.


Go for simple changes instead of drastic. Don't go shave your head, pierce your tongue, or dye your hair blue because you are emotional. Instead, keep it small.

, Wherever you go, look your best. Even if you only go to the grocery store or to the gym, make sure you are putting forward your best face. That doesn't mean you have to wear your best, but look presentable and attractive. Ask yourself before leaving the house, ""Would I want my ex to see me in this?""Looking great when you are around your ex is a great way to make him jealous. Show your ex what he is missing., Just because you're not over your breakup doesn't mean you can't date other people, especially if you keep it casual. You don't have to be looking for the perfect person. Instead, go out and have fun. When it gets back to your ex that you are dating someone, he will more than likely be jealous.Don't use the person. Remember, the person you are dating has feelings, too. Instead, make sure he knows it's casual. Don't kiss him, and don't give him any reason to think it's more than it is.

Act like you're fine.,
Keep all your common friends.,
Stop all contact.,
Post pictures of yourself with the opposite sex.,
Hang out with the opposite sex.,
Act nice.,
Ignore your ex's life.",How to Make Your Ex Jealous2," One key way to make your ex jealous is to not let on that you are upset. Even if you are heartbroken, pretend that you are good. Don't talk about the breakup, and don't let your ex see your sad. Make your ex think that you don't care that the relationship has ended.


Don't talk about the breakup on social media. Don't update your status or tweet about how you are sad, refrain from posting sad lyrics, and make sure you don't make cryptic posts. Your ex may see this and think you are talking about the relationship.Try not to be too chipper. There's a line between being okay and over it and being fake happy. You want to seem genuine so as not to tip off your ex. Don't include your ex in your happiness. Don't update things like, ""So happy single!"" or ""So happy without the ex!"" Those comments show that you are definitely not fine.

, When you break up, don't stop hanging out with the friends that you and your ex have in common. Instead, go hang out with your friends when invited somewhere, or go to the normal dinner in the city both of you used to attend together.Staying friends helps you remember that these people were your friends, too. There's no point in losing good friends just because you broke up.
Going out with mutual friends also helps information get back to your ex. This is a good way to show that you are doing great and not moping around.

, One way to make your ex jealous is to sever all contact between the two of you right after you split. Shoot for a decent length of time, like 3-4 weeks. This lack of contact may get your ex to think about what you are doing. Have you moved on? Are you dating other people? Are you over the break up already?If your ex texts or calls you, don't respond. If your ex tries to contact you on social media, don't reply. Don't text or call him, especially to talk about the relationship. Get some distance.You want to make it look like you're moving on and not letting the breakup bother you.
The key is to make your ex think about you and start wondering what you are doing because he doesn't know what you are doing, who you are seeing, or where you are going.
Resist the temptation to text with your ex late at night. Late night melancholia may make you do things you'll regret in the morning. Don't give in if your ex texts for a booty call. Be strong and ignore those messages.After the period of silence, respond back with simple comments. Say something like, ""hey,"" or respond to their text with something short and witty. Keep it light and casual.

, A good way to get under your ex's skin is to post pictures of yourself with the opposite sex. It doesn't matter if it's a colleague, a friend, or someone's sibling. Interacting and letting your ex see you with someone else helps show that you are moving on. It also shows that he is being replaced, which helps trigger jealousy.Decide which social media outlet your ex would be more likely to see. Then, post a few good pictures with someone.
Don't overdo it. Don't post pictures with ten different people, and don't post tons of pictures. You want to tease your ex with the idea that you are with someone else. Don't be obvious that you are trying to make him jealous. You don't want to seem desperate., Hanging out and being friends with the opposite sex can also cause your ex to be jealous. Flirt, meet, and have fun with the opposite sex. Try to do it so that your ex finds out about it. This could be accomplished by posting about it through social media, or flirting with the opposite sex when mutual friends are around.Date other people with caution. If the ultimate goal is to get your ex back, then dating someone else can push him away. You don't want to sabotage your chances of getting back together if that is what you want.

, When you see your ex, act nice. By talking to him, smiling, and asking how he is doing, you show that you are moving on and getting over it. This can help make him jealous. He may even think about how nice and great you are afterwards.


Keep the conversation light and natural. Treat your ex like an acquaintance. Ask surface questions, not questions about who your ex is dating. If asked how you are doing, say you are doing well. Make sure not to oversell it. You don't want your ex to think you are faking.Don't be rude to him. That is a classic way of showing you are not over the breakup. If you say something mean to him, it could turn him off and make him glad you two broke up., Don't show your ex that you are interested in him at all. When he posts updates about life events, like a promotion or a trip, don't engage. Don't like the post, don't comment, and don't mention it to your friends. Make it so your ex thinks you are totally off his radar.If someone brings up something about your ex later, claim that you didn't know, even if you did. Make sure it's clear to your ex (even through the grapevine) that you are not interested in his life and are not keeping up with him.

Write down your feelings.,
Analyze your feelings.,
Commit to letting go of your hatred.,
Avoid contact with your ex partner or spouse.,
Practice self care.,
Make a list of goals for the coming year.,
Spend time with family and friends.",How to Not Hate Your Ex," Take out a piece of paper and spend some time writing down why you have hatred towards your ex. This could be because of the things he or she did to you, or the decisions you made while with your ex. Try to be as detailed as possible and do not be afraid to really be honest about your feelings and emotions.

It may help to do this over a period of time, adding to it every day until you feel you have rid yourself of every instance of anger or pain you associate with your ex. You may want to detail any infidelity, any moments where your ex made you feel like a lesser person or abused you in anyway.;
, Once you feel you have written down every possible bad moment or feeling of hatred towards your ex, read it over at least twice. Use the document as evidence of your past relationship and how bad you felt during the relationship. When you are done reading it, tear it up or destroy it. This will symbolize you are willing to admit your hatred for your ex and you are choosing to destroy that hatred or be rid of it.

If you are seeing a therapist or other professional counselor as you work through your issues with your ex partner, you may want to bring the document to your session and tear it up in front of your therapist. Having a trusted witness to the destruction of the document can help to motivate you to feel you can let go of your hatred.

, Remember that hate is not a very production emotion and can often be debilitating to yourself and to those around you. Think about how you can replace your feelings of hatred with excitement about the future or motivation for the next phase of your life, without your ex. Once you commit yourself to letting go of your hatred for your ex, you can move on to other less detrimental emotions like pity, dislike, and even acceptance.

You may be afraid to let go of your hatred because in some way it keeps you connected to your ex. Anger can act as a form of negative attachment, as opposed to love or happiness, which are positive attachments. Rather than let your hatred keep you emotionally tied to your ex, release your hatred so you can finally leave your ex behind. By letting go of your anger and hatred, you do not need to forgive or forget your ex’s hurtful behavior, but you can be freed of emotions that will only make you feel worse and more alone.

, Though it may be tempting to share your anger with your ex in the form of a long, hate filled email, a text message, or angry voicemails, avoid contacting him or her in any way. Creating distance between you and your ex will help you to process your emotions and not get sucked back into the negative feelings you associate with your ex.


If you need to exchange personal items post break up, enlist the help of a friend or relative so you do not have to see your ex face to face. Give yourself time away from your ex so you can move forward with your life, free of any reminders of past anger and hatred.

, Often, anger and hatred are emotions that can distract you from your needs. Take the time to re focus on yourself by pampering or treating yourself. This could be a long bath, a walk in your favorite area, or working on a hobby or craft. Practicing self care will show you have compassion for yourself and give you the opportunity to focus your energies on your needs, rather than the needs of your ex.

, To motivate yourself to focus on the future, rather than the past, create a list of short term and long term goals for the year. Think about skills you have wanted to learn or get better at, but were not able to get to due to your relationship with your ex or dealing with your hatred after breaking up with your ex.


These could be short term goals like take a cooking class or long term goals like run every morning or do yoga at least three times a week. Focus on realistic goals that you feel you can meet and push yourself to achieve these goals. You’ll get a boost of self confidence and feel good knowing your energy and personal time is not being spent on your ex-partner.

, When you are dealing with break up feelings, it can help to lean on your family and close friends as your support system. Often, family and friends will encourage you to let get of your hatred of your ex and focus on your goals for the future.


They can also offer guidance and support in a constant and accessible way. Don’t be afraid to ask for their help or advice if you are struggling with your feelings of anger and hatred. Leaning on family and friends during a hard time can make all the difference and give you the confidence you need to finally let go of negative feelings.

No contact will give both of you time to heal and also give your ex-girlfriend time to miss you.
If the relationship ended badly, this period will allow both of you to cool off and work through any negative feelings.;
, Even if you no longer talk to your ex, seeing pictures of her and knowing what she is doing will make you want to contact her.

This can be done in person or on the phone. It is better not to have long or emotional conversations through text messaging.

, Now that you and your ex have been communicating, ask her if she would like to go on a date or hang out. Try to be very casual and polite when you ask her. Do not make this out to be a big deal. Try saying, ""Hey, do you want to go get coffee or something?"" or ""Let's get together to catch up."" You can also use the phrase ""hang out"" instead of ""date.""If she is reluctant, you might say, ""It's only coffee. What would it hurt?""
If she does not want to meet up with you, do not push the issue. Give her space. Tell her, ""I respect that you don't want to meet up, let me know if you change your mind. It would be great to see you.""

, To win her back, you must do all of the things that you did to make her interested in you the first time. If you used to send her flowers or write her sweet notes, begin to do those things again. Think of this opportunity as a new relationship. You need to make her fall for you again.Although you want to impress her, do not be needy or beg her to be with you again. This will only make you look insecure or weak. You want her to take you back because you are a great guy not because she feels sorry for you.Do not say things like, ""I can't live without you.""

, You and your ex are starting over again. Focus on the positive things that made your relationship work the first time around.If you won her over by being funny, continue to make her laugh. If she enjoyed your cooking, prepare a nice meal for her.


Focus on building new memories with her. She needs to see how things will be different this time around.

, You cannot pick up where you left off when you get back together. Treat this as a new relationship. Take your time and get to know each other again. You also do not want to overwhelm her or put pressure on her to get back together. Focus on building a strong friendship.Do not text or call everyday.
Go out on dates and do activities together. Learn her likes, dislikes, and habits again.
Hold off on the physical aspect of the relationship and spend more time talking.

, If your ex completely resists all of your effort, you need to respect her decision. If she tells you to leave her alone or that she has moved on, you need to move on as well. Being too needy and persistent will make you look bad and could ruin any chances of getting her back in the future.


If she has a new boyfriend, be respectful of her new relationship. Do not try to get her to break up with her new boyfriend. Be patient and see if her new relationship is serious or just a rebound.

Accept the situation.,
Focus on your physical health.,
Pay attention to your mental health.,
Soothe yourself.,
Build your confidence.",How to Make Your Partner Come Back to You1," The first step toward trying to mend a broken relationship is to accept how things currently are and give up control over your partner.Acceptance of feelings, thoughts, and situations actually increases your ability to make positive changes.This occurs because practicing acceptance takes the pressure off of the need to control the situation and shifts your focus onto things you really can control such as your own behaviors.


Let's say that you and your partner split up because you had a fight about not spending enough quality time together. Out of anger, your partner broke up with you. Try to accept your partner's feelings about the situation (anger), and allow for space to deal with these emotions. Accept that right now you are not together but maintain hope that you may be able to mend the relationship.
Remember that your partner has a choice about what whether she wants to be in a relationship with your or not. You may not be able to fully control the outcome of the situation with your partner.
Ask yourself questions like, how much can I control in this situation? Is there anything I can do about this?Imagine that your partner broke up with you due to lack of private time together. Can you control that your partner broke up with you? No. But what you can control is how you react to the situation.;
, Experiencing loss can lead to physical issues such as: headaches, nausea, chills, high blood pressure, heart palpitations, and more.Therefore, it is important to maintain your physical health in order to combat these common symptoms and cope easier with the recent breakup.


Make sure you are sleeping at least 8 hours per night. If you are having trouble sleeping, try relaxation techniques such a deep breathing exercises. Simply breathe slowly and deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth, while focusing on how your breathing feels. Do this until you feel completely relaxed or fall asleep.
Exercise regularly even if it's just taking a walk around the block. Cardiovascular exercise, such as aerobics or running, can be especially helpful in increasing endorphins in the brain and thus reducing feelings of sadness.
Drink plenty of water, and limit caffeine drinks as they may increase anxiety.
Eat healthy. Oftentimes, we may turn to junk food or comfort food to make us feel better because food also releases similar endorphins in the brain. However, overeating or eating unhealthy food can make you more stressed, and is not healthy for your body.

, Experiencing a loss or break-up can lead to all kinds of mental health concerns and negative feelings such as: anxiety, depression, anger, fear, difficulty concentrating, nightmares, memory issues (forgetfulness), impaired judgment, and impulsivity or poor decisions.Due to these possible symptoms and their negative effect, it is critical to acknowledge your specific mental health concerns (everyone is different) and try your best to cope in healthy ways.


Be mindful of your emotions and name them. Analyze how you are feeling, is it anger, sadness, or another emotion? How do you experience that emotion? Where do you feel it in your body? For example, when you are angry your muscles might feel very tense, your heart might race, you may experiencing trembling, and you might clench your fists.
Understand that some negative emotions are necessary and useful. Guilt, for example, can serve to actually strengthen bonds between people because it often causes the guilty person to want to make up for her behavior by doing something nice for the other person., Often people feel guilty, anger, or depressed when they have relationship issues or are dealing with a recent break-up.It is important to understand how to soothe yourself when dealing with these negative emotions. If you cannot cope in a healthy way, it will be more difficult to appropriately communicate with your partner about getting back together.


Use your coping skills for dealing with each negative emotion. For example, if you are feeling angry you might try kickboxing or punching/screaming into a pillow in order to healthily release some of the tension. If you are feeling sad, you might try writing in a journal about your feelings and then watching a funny movie to cheer yourself up.
Avoid drinking alcohol or using other substances to cope. You don’t want to be intoxicated and make a bad decision such as trying to talk to your ex. If you are inebriated when communicating this may lead to miscommunication.

, Practice self-acceptance and increase your confidence by owning your weaknesses; this can help you make positive changes.Work on tolerating being alone; try shopping alone, going out to eat alone, going for a jog, etc.
Focus on the things you like about yourself and who you are that are independent from your relationship. Remember that you are your own person - with your own unique qualities and talents. One way to focus on your positive qualities is to write down everything you like about yourself, from your hair to your attitude.
Try engaging in activities that you are good at. Some examples may include: art, writing, crafts, cooking, exercise, and sports.

Accept the break-up.,
Cut all communication.,
Give each other time to heal.,
Honestly assess your relationship.,
Apologize, if necessary.",How to Make Him Want You Back1," Handle the break-up maturely and with grace. If he broke up with you, respect his decision and give him some time to see things more clearly. He will appreciate your understanding and respect you all the more for handling yourself with dignity.


The last thing you want to do is make a scene. Crying or getting angry with him won't get you anywhere, in fact, he'll be more likely to run in the other direction.
By accepting the break-up calmly, you are leveling the playing field. He was probably expecting a different reaction from you, but now he .will be curious as to why you're not more upset. This may plant the first seed of doubt in his mind.;
, After a break-up, emotions run high and people don't always make rational decisions. For this reason, it is advisable to cut all communication with your ex for a while.


Don't harass your ex with phone calls, texts or Facebook messages. This will have the opposite of the desired effect. Wait until he contacts you first.
It will be tough, but try not to contact your ex for at least 2-3 weeks. Give him time to miss you.

, Break-ups can be rough. Harsh words are exchanged and feelings get hurt. You need to give both yourself and your ex time to cool down, reflect and heal. Only then should you consider resuming the relationship.


Getting back together while the wounds are still fresh will cause the same old issues to resurface and your efforts to revive the relationship are sure to fail.
Wait until enough time has passed that you can think about the break-up objectively and can speak to your ex without getting upset or angry.

, Take this time apart to honestly assess your relationship, think about what went wrong and what went right. Try to pinpoint the exact problems that led to the end of the relationship and figure out whether they can be fixed.


If you believe that the problems in your relationship are fixable, and both you and he are willing to put in the effort to make that happen, then your relationship stands a chance.
If, on the other hand, the circumstances which led to the end of the relationship are not likely to change, or if you or your ex are unwilling to modify your behavior for the sake of the relationship, then getting back together may not be the best idea.
Use your head for this decision, not just your heart.

Open the door for communication.,
Communicate face-to-face.,
Use assertiveness.,
Avoid aggressive speech and actions.,
Limit passive communication.,
Engage in conflict resolution.,
Commit to positive changes.",How to Make Your Partner Come Back to You2," After a break-up it may seem like a daunting task to re-engage your partner. However, the most important concept associated with initiating contact after a separation is to really listen to your partner and respect her needs.If you attempt to initiate a conversation and your partner is not ready to talk, it is important that you give your ex time and space. You want to show that you are sensitive to your partner's needs.


Try reaching out by phoning, texting, or emailing your partner. Simply say something like, ""I'd like to talk to you about the situation. Are you open to that?"" If you are ignored, do not repeatedly call or text, leave a message and explain that you would like to talk about what happened. You will need to wait until your partner is ready for the conversation.
If your partner is open to communicating with you about the break-up, set up a time to meet in person. Public places are a good choice because they are neutral. One option is to go out for coffee. If you prefer more privacy, you could go on a walk together.
Avoid showing up at your partner's home, school, or place of business unannounced. This can be viewed as a breach of her boundaries, and could lead to more conflict. Instead, pay attention to your partner's wishes during this time and respect her boundaries; if she is not ready to see you or talk about the issue then forcing it will likely lead to further confrontation., When attempting to solve a conflict it may be better to communicate on an issue face-to-face in order to successfully come to a compromise or solution. Face-to-face contact is associated with greater ability to grasp both the content (the message) and context (nonverbal communication such as tone and posture) of what the other person is saying.


Avoid texting, email, or phone conversations about issues. Use these forms of communication only to set up a time to meet in person.
Try to set up a face-to-face meeting with the person to discuss the problem at hand.

, Assertive communication is the best tool to use when discussing relationship problems because it focuses on expressing your feelings and needs in an appropriate way.Using assertiveness skills increases the likelihood that your message will be well-received. Be direct, but tactful. If you want to mend the relationship, it may be beneficial to be direct about your desire. For example, you could say, ""I really want to patch things up between us; I don't want to lose you.""
Use “I statements” such as, “I feel ____, when you ______.” For example, you might say, “I feel angry when you walk away while I am trying to discuss an issue with you.” You can also explain what you’d like the person to do next time such as, “Do you think next time we can talk about the issue when it comes up?”
Be supportive and empathic. Try to understand where your partner is coming from. Avoid jumping to conclusions or taking things personally. Focus solely on her experience of what happened. Say things like, “I understand that you feel angry. I can see how you would feel that way.”
Ask questions for clarification such as, “I am hearing that you are angry at me for not spending enough quality time with you and ignoring you, is that right?”

, Some examples of aggressive communication and behaviors include: yelling, cursing, belittling, calling names, interrogating, threatening, giving dirty looks, bullying, throwing objects, and hitting.These behaviors are not conducive to enhancing positive relationships.


Don't beg her.
Don't be overly persistent. Realize when ""no"" means ""no"".

, Passive communication consists of: not saying anything, avoiding, ignoring, hiding, giving in to what the other person wants, an inability to say no when needed, taking all of the blame, apologizing when unnecessary, avoiding eye-contact, and pouting.


Do not avoid the problem, this does not result in conflict resolution.Try communicating assertively about how you feel instead.

, Conflict resolution skills are useful when trying to mend a broken relationship.One important component of conflict resolution is to be able to admit your mistakes. Identify how you contributed to the separation and own up to them to your partner. Apologize for these behaviors.
Point out the positive aspects of the relationship and the characteristics that you admire in your partner. It may be especially helpful to bring up aspects that you admire about her that are related to your breakup. For instance, you might say, ""I know I was angry, but I really appreciate that you were able to speak your mind and tell me that you wanted to spend more quality time together.""
Focus on collaboration, instead of compromising any of your values. Come to an agreement together that is a win-win situation. Have realistic expectations of the outcome.

, Marriage and relationship experts stress the idea of focusing on solving your solvable problems and letting go of differences that are not solvable or worth the effort.For example, solving the issue of your partner making critical comments is a solvable issue that can be corrected through learning appropriate communication skills such as assertiveness. However, the issue of your partner having a certain personality trait (such as extroversion) that you do not like may not be a solvable issue; some characteristics of individuals may not be malleable.


Begin by asking your partner directly what she would like to change about the relationship. If this is a request that you believe you can compromise on, then you can work toward a solution together.
Let your partner know that you are willing to make the specific changes that are necessary to mend the relationship. You can say, ""I commit to ____, ____, and ____."" For example, you could say, ""I commit to spending more quality time with you, responding when you text or call me, and controlling my anger.""
Some options for working toward positive changes are engaging in couples therapy to work out issues, or going to a retreat or relationship education course."

Recognize the reason for separation.,
Forgive.,
Do positive things for the person.,
Reconnect.,
Engage in stress-free activities together.",How to Make Your Partner Come Back to You3," In order to work toward mending a relationship, you first need to understand what led to the separation.


Try making a list of everything that you think contributed to the problem. This will help you organize your thoughts and identify what may need to be done to mend the relationship. For instance, this might look like: anger, lack of time together, ignoring the problem, not responding quickly enough, walking away from conversations instead of dealing with them, and putting down the other person.
Try completing a relationship worksheet which identifies your/your partner’s situation or concern, thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and the ultimate outcome., Forgiveness is associated with higher chances of having a resolution to a conflict.This is due to the notion that forgiving another person may produce a more positive outlook and emotional state overall. Instead of dwelling on what the other person did wrong, you accept her faults and mistakes.


You do not necessarily need to forgive the person face-to-face initially. You can practice forgiveness by trying to understand where the other person is coming from (empathy). Remind yourself that mistakes are human.

, Engaging in pro-social behaviors can serve to mend broken relationships because positive actions may help the other person appreciate you and focus on the good aspects of the relationship.Examples of pro-social behaviors are: apologizing, offering to pay for something, giving a gift, doing favors, giving complements, and helping out.
Avoid insulting the person or engaging in anti-social behaviors such as: avoiding the person, yelling, hitting, throwing objects, etc.

, Some of the most important components of a healthy relationship are connection, intimacy, admiration, and support.Focus on reconnecting and spending quality time with your partner.


Set up a date with your partner where you can focus on reconnecting instead of focusing solely on discussing the problems within the relationship. This can take the pressure off and remind your partner of the positive connection within the relationship. Some examples of fun and intimate dates are: going out to a romantic dinner, having a picnic in the park, walking on the beach, going for a hike, or watching the sunset together.
Express your admiration for your partner by telling her what you appreciate about her.
Agree with your partner as much as possible if you can in order to reduce the likelihood of a conflict. If your partner brings up any issues, simply validate her feelings., Research shows that stressful situations increase negative thoughts about the relationship.Thus, in order to increase positivity about the relationship and encourage your partner to reconnect with you, you will want to reduce stress levels as much as possible.


Invite your partner to do something fun and relaxing such as cooking a meal together (as long as it's easy!), sitting in a hot tub, getting a couples massage, or sitting by a fire with a glass of wine.
Try to reduce the amount of stress in the situation by having dim lighting as opposed to bright lights, lighting aromatherapy candles or having other positive smells, playing soothing music, and controlling the room temperature.
Avoid potentially stressful situations such as: driving in traffic (or at all), loud situations such as going to a club/bar or concert, and any activities involving very hot or cold temperatures.

Stay calm.,
Talk to someone.,
Be independent.,
Take care of yourself.,
Work on improving yourself.,
Put yourself out there.",How to Make Him Want You Back2," If you've just been through a break-up that you didn't initiate, it can feel like your world is spinning out of control. Don't panic. Stay calm and remind yourself that you are strong and you handle whatever life throws at you.


Don't make any rash decisions. You are in a vulnerable state of mind right now, try not to do anything you might regret.
If you have your mind set on getting your ex back, that's fine. But allow yourself some personal time to work through your own issues first.

, After a break-up, it's probably safe to say that you have some demons you need to work out. The best thing you can do is talk to somebody you trust - a friend, a family member, a therapist. With them, you can unleash all the rage, hurt and pent-up tears you have inside. You'll feel much better after.


By talking about the break-up with someone on the outside of the situation, you are free to express every feeling and thought without the risk of doing irrevocable damage to your relationship with your ex.
Talking about the break-up will help you to work through your feelings and give you some perspective on the situation. You might start to see matters from a different point of view and understand where your ex was coming from. This understanding and empathy can help you to get back on the right track later.

, Use this break-up (even if it's only temporary) as a chance to liberate yourself. In a relationship, people tend to over-rely on their partner and forget how to function on their own. Now is your chance to recover your long-forgotten, independent self. You won't regret it.


Go places on your own, meet new people, try new things. Doing things by yourself will allow you to gain confidence and help you to feel whole again.
Reconnect with your friends. Many people are guilty of neglecting their friends while in a relationship. Now that you're free to do as you please, take the initiative and organize a girls' night in or out. You'll soon be laughing so hard you'll wonder why you didn't do it more often.

, You've been through a rough time recently, so take a moment to focus on you and your needs. Do things that make you happy and make you feel good.


Take long baths, get plenty of rest, eat healthily and do some exercise. You'll look and feel better for it.
You need to feel good about yourself before you think about re-entering a relationship.

, Have you been complaining about your job for the last year? Quit and find something better! Been talking about taking up a new hobby or starting a new exercise regime for forever? Now is the time! Embrace this opportunity to improve yourself and become the best you that you can be.


Many people claim that a hot new body is the best way to recapture your ex's attention. But don't just do it for him, do it for yourself. Exercise and healthy eating will release the good mood hormones and will give you more energy and motivation to get through your day.
Getting a new job or taking up a long talked-about hobby will give you a new outlet to focus your attentions on and leave you less time to mope about the break-up. Hopefully your ex will also be impressed by your new go-get-em attitude.

, Just because you have your heart set on getting back with your ex doesn't mean you can't have a little fun in the meantime. Get yourself all dolled up and go out and flirt to your heart's content. If nothing else, you will be reminded that you are an attractive and interesting person and that you have plenty of other options if your relationship doesn't work out as planned.


Letting your ex see you with another guy can arouse feelings of jealousy and desire in your ex. This might make him realize that he wants you back and help you in your quest.
Be careful with this tactic, however - if your ex feels that you're perfectly happy with someone else, he might move on too.

Let him contact you.,
Remind him why he was attracted to you in the first place.,
Take things slowly.,
Leave the past in the past.",How to Make Him Want You Back3," Let him make the first move. It might be hard to wait, but stay strong. A least then when he contacts you, you will know that he was thinking about you and that he's ready to take a step forward in your relationship, whatever that might be. If you push him too soon, he might pull in the other direction.


Once he contacts you, don't play hard to get. Respond in a timely fashion and be perfectly sweet and polite.
After he has made contact, you can suggest meeting up to talk in person. Go for somewhere neutral where you can have a private conversational, but can leave easily if things take a turn for the worse. A cafe or public park would be perfect.

, Sometimes the bad things that happen at the end of a relationship can overshadow all the good that came before. Remind this guy why he fell in love with you in the first place.


Spark his memory by wearing the same perfume you wore on your first date, or a piece of clothing he thought you looked good in.
Reminisce about some of the great times you had together. Make him remember how he felt about you when times were good.

, Don't rush headfirst back into the relationship. Take time to talk things through and make sure the two of you are on the same page. Ensure that you both know what you need to work on and are willing to give things a chance.


Try dating again. Go out for dinner, go bowling or go see a movie together. Spend short, concentrated periods of time together. Get to know one another all over again.
If you try to pick up exactly where you left off, then history is doomed to repeat itself.

, If the two of you have worked through your issues and you're both willing to make a fresh start, be thankful for it. Look on this as a brand new relationship, with no baggage attached. Forget about what happened in the past and focus on your future together.

If he sends you a text, leave it for a couple of days.",How to Make Your Ex Boyfriend Jealous," This is so important. Sure it's okay to be upset in the days or weeks after you break up; it might even seem strange if you weren't. But soon it'll be time to snap out of it and project your inner happiness, even if you aren't completely emotionally healed. Who knows? There's a good chance that trying to be happy will make you happy in the end.


Remind yourself of what you have to live for. Your friends, your family, your health; these are all things that we tend to take for granted when we're caught up in a relationship. Remind yourself of all that you have, and happiness should come easier.
Treat yourself. It's a great idea to pamper yourself in order to put a little pep into your step. If you're feeling extravagant, go shopping for a new coat or some new shoes. If you just want something simple, go to a day-spa with girlfriends, get some fro-yo, or go to the movies.
Remove all mementos of the relationship from your life. You don't have to throw away all the pictures you took with him, or burn his love-letter. Stash them away someplace safe and forget about them. This will help you forget about him.;
, If you bump into your ex, it's okay to go over and talk to him. Show him that you're mature enough not to hold a grudge. More than anything, show him that he doesn't faze you anymore. Guys hate thinking that they're easy to get over, because it suggests that they weren't all that great to begin with.



Don't: Bring up things about your relationship or your breakup. Don't act moody or mopey; you don't want him to think you're sad because of him, even if you are. Talk about normal things. Smile and act confident.

Do: Act friendly, but not flirtatious or suggestive. Try hard not to laugh too hard at his jokes. Say you're ""doing fine, just kinda busy"" or something along those lines. Keep it brief.
Remember your goal: You don't want to be so unfriendly that he's happy you're out of his life. You want to be friendly but distant, possibly distracted by your new life — the life in which you're better off without him.

, You only need to be friends with them for it to bother your ex. Don't try to get yourself a new boyfriend until you're over your old one. It would be unfair on the new boyfriend as you'd be leading him on, and it would make your ex lose interest rather than get jealous as you're basically saying he stands no chance. Try the following to get his attention:


Become friends with his buddies. You probably got to know his friends a bit while you were together, so just try making conversation with them. No doubt they'll go and tell your ex that you've been chumming it up, and darned if that doesn't get him jealous pretty quickly.
Talk to a guy who's older, richer or who has bigger muscles than your ex. Guys are famously insecure when it comes to certain things: age (makes them feel inexperienced), wealth (makes them feel like they can't provide) and strength (makes them feel unmanly). Your ex will compare himself to any guy you are getting close too. If he thinks there is a chance that the guy is better than he was, he'll be back in no time trying to get your attention.
If your ex once thought that he had male competition, go back to the guy he felt competitive about. Your ex will feel stupid for letting you get close to someone he's already insecure about. The feelings of jealousy, his sense of competition with other guys, will come roaring back.

, Did you have any annoying habits that your ex used to complain about? Whether it's being messy or biting your nails, think about breaking those habits and bringing out the new and improved you. If he sees that you've stopped doing all the things that bugged him once upon a time, it shows that you've made strides without him instead of with him.


With all that free time you have, learn more about the world. Travel, if you can. (Your ex will boil with jealousy if you meet a foreign man.) Be a student of the world, its people, its food. Guys secretly, or not so secretly, want to be with a girl who's both interesting and interested. Read the news and learn about different customs and habits. Don't boast about it, but slowly let it seep through.
Do something challenging. Run that 5k that you've always been meaning to run. Attempt that Guinness Book of World Record challenge that you've dreamed about. Whatever it is, push your boundaries and learn a little about yourself in the meantime. Your ex will see you getting better and wonder what he was doing to hold you back.

, If he liked you to dress in a certain way, try doing that more often when you have a feeling you might bump into him. If you're not happy with your figure then do something about it, get fit, do something nicer with your hair, choose more flattering clothing. When he sees you he'll be asking himself why on earth he left you.


Try to look good all the time. You never know when you might run into him randomly shopping or at the movies. The better your overall fashion sense, the better you'll feel.
Talk with your stylist about getting a new haircut. Maybe try a shorter length of hair. Even if the haircut is just symbolic, it says a lot to your ex: ""I am a new person without you and I'll come away from this relationship better than before.""
Go on a diet (if you think you need it). You should know if you need a diet. If you're unsure about whether you should shed some pounds, then you probably don't need to diet. But if you do diet and fit into that dress that was three sizes smaller than you were while still with your boyfriend, it'll make a huge impression.

, If you have Facebook/Pinterest/Twitter, then use them to upload photos of you having a good time since you broke up. Social media can also be used for you to chat with your new guys, even if you're only chatting. Don't delete him from your social media networks, but think about unsubscribing from their posts so that you're not preoccupied with what they're doing.


Give your Facebook a makeover. Have a friend help you take a super-flattering profile picture, and change some of the information to reflect your new attitude. The attention that you get from your other friends once you give your profile a makeover should make him jealous.
Don't be an open book. Be a little mysterious with your posts/tweets. Don't spell out exactly what you're doing. Instead of saying ""Just got back from the beach with my friends!"" say something like ""Copacabana in my back yard; next stop, Havana!""
Don't talk about him in any of your public posts. You really want to ignore him as much as possible. You want him to believe that you're having a swimming old time without him, and that the memory of him is growing dimmer and dimmer every day.

, If he's texted you, tried to call you or messaged you, then he's back in the picture trying to get your attention. So to keep the power in your hands rather than giving the power back to him, and ignore the message for a couple of days.


Doing this says ""I have better uses with my time than you."" During those couple of days, he'll be thinking and worrying about it, wondering whether he said something wrong or stupid. When you message back, say ""Sorry, didn't see the message, hey!"" He'll be relieved that you weren't just ignoring him because he's scared of looking like an idiot.
Be careful about whether he can see that you've checked your text/message. Facebook now records whether you've seen the message and sends the information back to the other party. It'd be strange to check his message immediately and then say that you only saw it three days later, even though he knows when you checked it.

It's so hard to forget that everyone has battles they're fighting. We all see other people and think, ""Wow. They're so put together!"" when on the inside, they could be crumbling. Take advantage of this by always being bright and positive with everyone. When you're constantly happy, funny, and friendly, you'll give off that ""perfect"" vibe almost effortlessly.;
, There are tons of news stories lately about how ""Facebook makes us sad"" because we look at other people's lives and want them. Use this to your advantage! Post photos of you having fun with your friends, tweet funny comments and talk about all the awesome things you're doing.


It's surprisingly easy to make your life seem awesome online, even if you spend your weekends on your couch with a bowl of cheese popcorn and your three cats. As long as you're a bit selective and aren't obnoxious about it (OMG LOOK AT THIS PHOTO OF ME AND TAYLOR SWIFT AHHHHH!!!!!!!), people will wonder if you're just absolutely perfect and be just ripe with envy.

, Which won't be hard, because you know everyone. Being ""in the know"" makes you look viable, up-to-date, and like you're at the center of everything. Which maybe you are! It'll give you interesting things to talk about and an edge on every situation, too.


And when it comes to knowing the drama, it's no big deal. Eliza just dumped Jacob for John? Yeah, you know. You knew two weeks ago. It's just not something you mentioned because you don't talk about other people's business. Besides, what's it matter? Eliza goes through boyfriends like underwear.

, Wink, wave, smile, blow kisses, and get to being confident. There's something about a person who's confident enough to be flirty initially that's inexplicable attractive. And if you're flirty, you're probably positive and happy, too, getting your audience, smiling, laughing, and feeling good about themselves. And then everyone else will wonder why they can't make others do that, too!


These bold things might seem awkward at first, but once you get used to being noticed, that awkwardness will fade away. Make sure you make eye contact and believe in yourself. Nobody wants to flirt with someone who feels unattractive!

, A little is fun, but if you do it too much people will start to wonder whether you talk about them behind their backs and will start to become more wary of you, not liking you. Any negativity should be avoided. Think Regina George from Mean Girls: she didn't let anyone know she gossiped about them. She was a princess on the outside and that's why everyone wanted to be her. If she were evil, she would've been hit by a bus much sooner.


Knowing the latest drama and gossiping, for the record, are two totally different things. When you gossip and people know you gossip, they'll avoid telling you things. When you don't gossip, people will trust you, and come to you with their drama themselves. That makes it all so much easier on you!

, Because the fact of the matter is that it's too easy to skip the jealousy line and go straight to downright disdain. If you walk into the room, sit down, and pull out your diamond wallet that's too small for your 50 dollar bills, your 2 iPhones, and your personal maid you brought to lay rose petals down 1 step behind you, no one will be jealous -- they'll just not like you. So keep it cool!


Don't flaunt all the awesome stuff you have and all the awesome stuff you are. The fact that you have a diamond wallet is so painfully normal to you that you don't even think twice about it. And it's the fact that your diamond wallet is so normal to you that you want people to be jealous of -- not your diamond wallet itself.

, You know that one person in every group that wants people to like them so badly that they'll do absolutely anything to get it? The one that loses their identity bending over backward to please everyone but themselves? They're never the ones people are jealous of. To get people aching for your green grass, don't worry about whether they do or not. Because if they should, what's there to worry about?


Caring whether they're jealous of you or not sheds light on the cracks in your otherwise perfect façade. So when no one comments on your state-of-the-art tablet or your perfect hair, don't think twice about it. Who'd admit it anyway?

, The last thing the people around you are going to say to you is how much they envy you (whether they do or not). No one likes being jealous and everyone hates admitting it. So even if the entire room is wishing to be in your shoes, you may never know. You'll just have to trust!


And no, you can't ask. It's a huge turn off assuming people want to be you -- asking them will give them the impression you're haughty and love yourself enough for just about everyone. Don't do it.

, Copiers are a dime a dozen. Sure, you could look through fashion magazines and watch TV shows, but you'd wind up looking like everyone else trying to be in the cool club. You want to be a trendsetter, ahead of a curve. So do your own thing or make your own twist on what's out there. People can't try to be like you if you're trying to be like everyone else.


So many of us are so concerned with fitting in that we're just in awe of those who are comfortable going outside of the mold. You don't have to wear grocery bags or dye your hair rainbow-colored to be different -- just add your own flair to what's already out there.

, Even if you don't have a significant other, big deal! Being single and playing the field is something to be jealous of too! So whether one boy is texting you all the time and bending over backwards for you or a dozen are trying to get your attention, drop little hints. Your buzzing phone will be hint number one! Now which boy is it again?


Be subtle but clear about this. When someone asks what you're doing Thursday night, you're hanging out with the boy-toy. It's date night. No need to mention that he may or may not have showered you with roses last weekend between rounds of feeding you Belgian chocolates. People may turn up their noses, being disgusted with how it seems you're exaggerating for validation.

, Because sadly, people get super jealous of this stuff too easily. Even if you don't have that much money, no one has to know! Keep your things in good condition, keep up on trends, piece together your outfits carefully, and always be aware of the newest thing.


Wealth is something that's understood, not spoken about. Saying, ""Ohmigod, I just have so much money I don't know what to do with myself!"" is not effective. But whipping out your brand new Coach purse might just do the trick.

, Another thing that plagues most of us is fear. We're afraid of putting ourselves out there, being vulnerable, and doing things we're not good at. But not you! You take chances and more often than not you succeed. What's not to be jealous of?


We're not talking about jumping off of bridges, here. We're talking about walking up to that cute boy and starting a chat with him. Signing up for that intramural team and picking up a new sport. Signing up for the study abroad program. Running for class president. Things most people would be uncomfortable doing, but might like to do in a perfect world -- your world.

, This is an important step: You don't have to be in a clique, but to avoid bad days of school, to build a network you can fall back on, make sure your best and true friends are there for you. You don't want ones that are good-looking or popular -- you want friends that you actually like and that actually like you.


Respect them and keep their secrets. In order for you to have good friends, you need to be there when they need you, too. Never talk about their drama just to show that you're ""in the know.""

, You'll get to know more people, get involved in school or your community, and you'll just be an all around fascinating person. You'll stay busy, be social, hone your skills, and have fun while doing it, too. You'll be able to talk about anything and for every story you'll know a person who knows a person who knows a person that was involved. You're so well-connected and talented. How do you do it?!


Branch out! Instead of playing basketball, soccer, and softball, do basketball, choir, and Italian. Spread yourself across a whole bunch of different personalities. Be the one who plays sports, gets creative, helps the community, and builds robots in the few spare minutes she has. It's like you're a machine!

, Be successful at everything you do. Have excellent grades, get a main role in a play, be good in your favorite sport, and be great at making friends. This gives people a more of a reason to be jealous of you. What aren't you capable of?


This will take work, which you probably figured, huh? No one said making everyone jealous would be easy! Just make sure not to burn yourself out. It's better to do three things well than six things halfway okay.

, People would love to catch you with your guard down, but it just won't happen. Even the tiniest of details about you are worthy of jealousy. Think of the small stuff, like having good handwriting. Smelling good. Reading the latest bestseller. Accessorizing. Making a mean chocolate cake. The more people know about you, the more they're still in awe.


Sure, it's one thing if people are jealous of you from afar. They see you and they see beautiful hair, beautiful clothes, and a smiley, bubbly personality. But then when they get to know you, you don't want that to go away, so you gotta back it up! It's these small things that will really put the icing on the cake.

, Moisturize your skin with a daily moisturizer or body butter to smooth your complexion. Make sure your hands and nails are perfectly groomed, too, and your toe and fingernails are properly trimmed. It doesn't matter if you're pale and freckly or dark and caramel-y, just exude radiance.


Wash your face every day and drink 6-8 cups of water every day for that natural glow. Water is just about the best thing you can do for your hair, skin, and nails!

, Having bad hygiene is the quickest way to get people to not give you a second look. So every day, make sure your breath is as fresh as the Prince of Bel-Air by brushing your teeth, flossing and using mouthwash, your body is like a field of daisies, and your hair smells just as sweet. In other words, use deodorant and shampoo on the regular. Your friends will appreciate it, too.


Unfortunately, we humans generally judge books by their covers. So even if you're this perfect, overachieving goddess, you won't be the object of others' envy if you smell like a baby's bottom. And you won't want to be around you either!

, You never know who you might run into at the grocery store! Make sure your hair is clean and styled at all times. Experiment with finding ways to deal with those bad hair days (we all have them) and perfect the pajama-chic look. Those girls that look good when they wake up in the morning? Like that.


That being said, keep it natural. Definitely don't look like you're going to the prom everywhere you go -- that'll raise a few eyebrows and not in a good way. Keep your make-up natural and your hair styled, but not like it took you hours. You have too many other things to do and friends to hang out with!

, Work it! Don't care about what other people are wearing -- just do you. Be eccentric and yourself, all the while looking fashionable and inspiring others. Whether you're the sundress type or the flannel shirt and jeans type, if you rock it, it'll work.


At the end of the day, the clothes that look good on you are the clothes you like (apart from the dirty and wrinkly ones, of course!). So don't fret over the trends that all your friends are taking part of. If you like it, try it. If you don't, you don't!

, Imagine a song in your head and walk to that beat. Hold your head high when you walk, throw your shoulders back a bit, and keep your eyes level. People will notice you walking with such purpose. You'll look confident and ready to take on the world. You'll look unstoppable.


Remember to have good posture and remember to smile. You want an aura of confidence and positivity that everyone will want to emulate. You're so awesome -- what would you not be confident and positive about?

Let them know you are uncomfortable.,
Set boundaries.,
Help them make a commitment.",How to Make a Friend Stop Swearing1," Tell your friend that you are uncomfortable every time they use a curse word or a succession of curse words. Make sure to let your friend know that you do not have a problem with them, but with their excessive cursing. Preface the conversation with a positive tone by saying something positive first.You can say, “Hey Barbara, you’re a great person and one of my really close friends. I enjoy hanging out with you because we always have a great time together. However, I noticed that you are beginning to curse a lot. It makes me feel very uncomfortable and anxious. Do you mind refraining from using these words? I can help you.”;
, Perhaps you are uncomfortable with a specific curse word, for example curse words relating to someone’s gender or race. Let your friend know that you will not tolerate the use of these words around you. Don’t alienate your friend by avoiding them completely. However, let them know that you lose any interest in what they are saying once they start using these words.For example, “I don’t mind a curse word here or there, but I feel very uncomfortable when you refer to people and things as ‘fag’ or ‘gay.’ There are better, more descriptive words that you can use to explain your feelings.”

, Let your friend know that you are willing to help them make a commitment to stop cursing or using specific curse words. Help them make a commitment by setting a goal. Let them know that you will help them achieve this goal as long as they are willing to commit to it.For example, if your friend curses at least five times a day, set a goal to reduce the amount of curse words used to once per day. Once this goal is achieved, set a new goal of four curse words per week. Keep going until the use of curse words is eliminated from their vocabulary.

Be confident in yourself. Don’t allow a jealous person to affect your confidence or to create self doubt.Keep doing what you're doing, and don't allow others to stop you.
Focus on people that support you.
Remind yourself that they're jealous because you are doing something well.;
, Although it’s hard to do, ignoring mean comments from jealous people tells them you are not going to validate their feelings., When ignoring someone is not an option, approaching the situation directly may help release the jealous tension. Have a conversation to confront them about their behavior.


""I want to have a positive working relationship; what can I do to help promote that environment?""
""While I appreciate your constructive criticisms, I feel that you sometimes come across a little harsh.""

, If you can change your environment or social dynamics it will reduce the jealous person’s ability to influence you.Hang out with people who support you, so the hater is less likely to confront you when you're with a group.
When you see the jealous person, be the first to speak with a polite greeting then move on.
Become friends with their friends to make them feel like the outsider.

, Take a different path when walking, use a bathroom in another hallway, or see if you can switch your schedule to change classes or shifts.

, Don’t feel like you have to continue to listen to a jealous person vent to you all the time. Set boundaries to distance yourself from the person. Make a mental time limit for how long you will engage with a negative person, then politely excuse yourself from the conversation.Give yourself 1 minute when you talk to them, then walk away saying ""I need to go check something.""
Keep track of negative comments, and after 3, end the conversation.

, While you don't want to be rude and upset the person further, making them aware of how they are making you feel may cause them to change their behavior.


""I feel uncomfortable with the way you speak to me.""
""Your approach when we talk makes me feel bad. Can we change our interactions to be more positive?""

, No matter how negative a person is, keep your interactions with them positive. Show them a better way to handle situations by being the example.Compliment the person on their positive traits.
Be kind in all your interactions with the person.
Offer to help the person improve their skills in the area they are jealous of you.

, Some people feel like they are the only ones who have negative experiences. Opening up about your own personal pitfalls may help them realize they are not alone and improve your relationship.


Share times that you have failed at something.
Discuss tasks that are difficult for you.
Ask the jealous person to help you with something to help their confidence.

, Jealousy can come from feeling inferior. Offering to tutor or coach a jealous person to improve their skills in the area in which they are jealous of you may help alleviate the feelings. Be supportive of the other person's efforts so you don't come across as condescending by implying that you are better than the other person., If someone is jealous because of what you have or are doing show them options as alternatives. It is not always possible to provide what everyone wants. Be creative in creating alternative options to present to people who are jealous of you. Try offering multiple possibilities to allow them to make a choice., You don’t need to stop using social media, but thinking about the way others perceive you can go a long way in making sure your posts aren’t offensive and creating jealousy.

, People get jealous when they feel that someone else has something that should be theirs. People who are jealous often blame others around them rather than recognizing the emotion that is making them feel hurt., Most jealousy comes from fears; the fear of being disrespected or not being loved can be powerful influences. Find out what fear is fueling the jealousy to gain perspective on where they are coming from. The jealousy can stem from a variety of sources:Physical objects
Personal relationships
Professional positions
Social status

, Politely approach someone who is acting jealous or hating on your success and ask them why. Don’t add more reasons for them to be upset by being rude, but be direct and open for best results. You could try one of these suggestions to help them open up:


”I’ve noticed you acting different around me. Have I done something that bothered you?”
”I want to make sure I haven’t upset you, is everything ok?”
”You’re an awesome person, and I wanted to know if there was something that is coming between us.”

, Think about who is providing the comments you feel are hateful or jealous. If the person is your superior or a coach, they are most likely trying to help you improve and not cut you down.

, Some people have a tendency for medically recognized delusional jealousy. These individuals constantly express jealousy and may not mean what they are saying., Even when you feel that someone is being too blunt or rude with their comments, you can still accept their comments as constructive criticisms. Embrace the suggestions and keep your outlook positive.

Use a swear jar.,
Talk with your friend.,
Take your friend out.",How to Make a Friend Stop Swearing2," A minor punishment, like a swear jar, can help curb your friend’s cursing. When engaging in minor punishments, like a swear jar, both you and your friend should participate. By participating, you are showing your support.With your friend, make a pact that you will both carry around a small jar or pot. Every time you use a curse word, donate a penny or a nickel to the jar. At the end of the day, you can compare who has more money in the jar.

, People use profanity for a variety of reasons. Some common reasons are that they think swearing makes them look more mature, impressive, or respected in front of their peers. Explain to your friend that using profanity can actually have the opposite effect. It can turn people off, as well as give an impression of immaturity.You can tell your friend, ""I know you like to curse a lot, but I think it is having the opposite effect of what you intended. When you use curse words instead of other, more descriptive words, it comes off as immature and excessive. I know I curse sometimes, too. But we can work on this together.""

, If you notice your friend making progress, then recognize their effort. Offer to take them out to coffee, ice cream, or the movies. This will encourage your friend to keep improving. It will also show your friend that you support them and want the best for them.You can say, ""I noticed that you stopped cursing so much. I am really impressed. It takes a lot of effort to change bad habits, especially cursing. Let me take you out to coffee.""

Identify the triggers.,
Advise your friend to calm down.,
Help them find substitutes.",How to Make a Friend Stop Swearing3," There are people and situations that can trigger the use of profanity. Long lines, traffic jams, people they dislike, and people or things that also use profanity in a casual manner can trigger the behavior. Once they become aware of these triggers, they will be able to control their behavior better.You can ask them, “What triggered you to use that word?”
Help them eliminate music, movies, or TV shows that use excessive profanity.

, Pent up anger can also cause your friend to use profanity excessively. Help your friend divert their anger by advising them to use breathing techniques whenever they feel the urge to express their frustration with profanity.Tell your friend, “Every time you feel like using a curse word, instead of saying the word, use a breathing technique. Close your eyes and slowly inhale. Hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale. Let the moment pass you by.”
Exercise can also relieve pent up anger and frustration. Offer to go biking or running in the park whenever your friend expresses anger and frustration.

, Curb their use of curse words by helping them find healthy substitutes. You can either help them expand their vocabulary, or offer more benign substitutes for the curse word.Help them look up substitute words in the dictionary that more accurately describe how they are feeling.
Help them come up with substitute phrases. For example, tell them to say, “Oh shitake mushrooms,” instead of “Oh s***t.”

Don’t react.,
Change the subject.,
Stay rested and happy.,
Remember that sometimes you might be the jerk.",How to Get Rid of Annoying People1," Often people will bother you to get a reaction. Try to avoid blowing up or expressing your discontent non-verbally. Don’t roll your eyes, make mean faces, or mutter things under your breath or else you might feed the fire.


Remember that silence does not make you weak
Take a few deep breaths and focus on your breathing to calm yourself.
Think about the big picture. Getting into a physical confrontation could cost you your health, your job, or your education. Remember what really matters and try to put these small annoyances in perspective.;
, If you can feel a conflict coming, bringing up something different can be a good way to distract someone.Often annoying people will be defiant despite being obviously wrong because they see the confrontation as a battle of egos. Once you’ve defused the situation, they might no longer feel the need to assert themselves.


If, for example, someone is invading your space, try directing him to something in your surroundings that is funny or interesting. If someone is pestering you with an annoying topic of conversation, try to bring up something else that you know will interest them., Your ability to tolerate annoying people is proportional to how emotionally and mentally stable you are. Rest up and try to have a good time. If you find yourself getting annoyed by others too frequently, consider if there is anything that you could fix in your own life to cultivate a sunnier disposition., It can be hard for us to recognize our own faults. If someone keeps on complaining about your behavior or asking for something you don’t think they deserve, it is worth considering that perhaps you’re being the unreasonable one. Listen to friends and family when they critique your behavior to get a sense for your own faults."

Recognize rebelliousness.,
Don't be too strict.,
Don't give in.,
Examine their side of the story.,
Give your teen space.,
Set clear rules.,
Decide what to do with your teen.",How to Handle Teenager Rebellion," Teenage rebellion includes many actions and ""warning signs"" that let you know your child is being rebellious. You'll start to notice dropped grades, maybe trouble at school, shorter temper, and more lip. Your teen will likely begin by rebelling in a small way in order to push the limits of what they can and can't do.;
, It may seem appealing to be hard on rebellion all the time in order to discourage it but rebellion almost wants that. It's really difficult to rebel against someone who isn't strict. Minor power struggles are always best won but sometimes you have to just not play. Give your teen some space. Let them change their look and their personal space.

, Once you tell them to do something, don't let them avoid it without a compelling reason. While you shouldn't be strict, once you make a decision you have to follow through on it. If they were supposed to take out the trash an hour ago, and it still isn't done for whatever reason, it is paramount that you make them do it. Don't give in to these minor power struggles, because they set the stage for all of the other ones.

, They might have reasoning for wanting to do/not do something that you haven't thought about. Be flexible if they have sound logic. Don't be afraid to change your mind, or ask for time to think about it.

, Lying and hiding things are small acts of rebellion that are gateways into larger ones. By not giving your teen reason to lie or hide things from you, you prevent them from even considering those things.

, Your teen should never be able to claim that they ""didn't know"" something was forbidden.


However, avoid setting rules for things that they probably won't consider. As in the parable about the boy who stuck beans up his nose, you don't want to give your child ideas.

, Keeping them busy is a good way to prevent any rebellious desires from taking root. A job (volunteer or paid), sports, and other time-occupying activities are good methods. If your teen is unresponsive to your trying to intervene and nip things in the bud you'll just have to let them find themselves in hot water. Let your teen get themselves into some moderate trouble outside of home. Once the school has them for vandalism or the they call you from the sheriff's office being a rebel won't be much fun anymore.

Announce a timeline for when to leave.,
Start motioning that you need to leave.,
Politely make up an excuse.,
Get someone else’s help.,
Scream.",How to Get Rid of Annoying People2," It’ll be a lot easier to get out of a conversation if, at the beginning, you make it clear that you can’t be around for long. Tell him that you have an appointment or a call that you need to make. Tell him specifically that you have five or ten minutes left, so that he won’t be surprised when you bolt., Most people will get the clue if you begin to pack up your bags and start looking off in the distance. Conveying that you need to leave with body language saves you an awkward conversation and convinces the other person that they have decided to stop talking to you., If you’ve told someone that you have a timetable to leave, you’ve begun to pack, and they still haven’t responded, you might just need to tell them directly that you need to go. Try to be polite and pretend that you are sorry., Come up with a signal that you can send to a friend so that she will come over and pull you out of the conversation. Otherwise, just start talking to someone else in your vicinity. The other person should catch on that they’re no longer part of the conversation and eventually leave., If someone refuses to leave you alone, move to a crowded place and scream. Yell “leave me alone.” The fear that other people will intervene to protect you will cause even the most persistent people to give up.


This is an extreme solution. You should generally refrain from following this course unless you believe the person might endanger your safety.

Point out their annoying habits.,
Ask why he acts the way he does.,
See if he is willing to change.,
Tell him you need to take a break.",How to Get Rid of Annoying People3," Don't be afraid to tell them how you feel. Instead of accusing them of doing something wrong, use ""I-statements"" to explain how their behavior effects you. To do this say ""I feel ______ when you do _______ because ______.""


There are several advantages to I statements. Instead of placing the blame on them, you make it about how you feel. Furthermore, instead of exaggerating by making a blanket statement like ""you are always angry,"" you can specify exactly when their bad behavior pops up. That will make it easier for them to correct their behavior.

, If he is needy, anxious, or overly talkative, it might because he has his own personal issues. Ask him if anything is up. Talking about it might help him get over it. If not, see if there is anything you can do to help him get over his issues.

, After you have raised the person’s faults, you should give him time to respond. See if he is willing to adapt his behavior and become a different person. Don’t push the subject too persistently or he will probably fight back. You’ve already told him what you think; give it some time to sink in.


Remember patience is important. If he doesn't seem to respond, try to make your message clearer by pointing out when he acts in a way that bothers you. Do it in a non-confrontational way, like ""Don't you think that question is a bit personal?
Evidence shows that people who have close personal relationships are happier than those who don't, but maintaining those will generally be hard and require sacrifice. Don't give before giving the other person a chance to get better., If he persists in his behavior and you don’t think you have the patience to tolerate him, sit him down and be honest. Just tell him that the friendship isn't working for you and you need to take some time apart. Say that it hurts you to say this, but that it’s better than leading the person on.


This will give him more time to allow your comments to sink and try to develop. This might help salvage your relationship by saving you from an angry explosion that would only make things works.
Remember that you may be doing him a favor. If everyone around you thought you were annoying, wouldn't you like to know how to change that?
Be polite and stick to ""I-statements."" ""I am going through a hard time right now, and it bothers me when you ask personal questions, because it reminds me of what has happened. Could I get some space for the next couple of weeks?""

"
"
Suggest some new friends for the person.,
Cut him off.,
Tell him you no longer want to be friends.",How to Get Rid of Annoying People4," Maybe you know some other people who share the same interests as the person, or maybe you know some people who have a higher tolerance for annoying people than you do. Try to introduce him to people around your school or workplace that will distract him. Avoid introducing him to mutual friends, because that might make you more obligated to spend time with him.

, If you are not particularly close to the person, it is acceptable to just end communication. Unfriend him on social networks, ignore or block his phone calls and emails, and try to avoid situations where you might encounter him. Most relationships have a trial stage, during which it should be expected that you might break it off if things go sour.


This is not a valid strategy if you have been friends for years or if you live or work in close enough proximity that you can be expected to encounter one another again, When ending a relationship with a close friend, you should do so directly and in person. To soften the blow, start off by telling him what you liked about him and your relationship with him. Be honest about why you no longer want to be friends, but do so in a way that is neutral and not offensive.


Instead of accusing him of doing something wrong, tell him in an impersonal way what you need in a friend: “My life is stressful right now, and I need to be surrounded by people are relaxing and empathetic.”"
"
First, you have to get to know them.,
If you know these things, you know how to keep them to explosions as little as possible, and what type of anger you're looking at, which will help you to deal with your unruly person.

,
Once you know a bit about your person, you can try to figure out what kind of person he/she is.,
Okay, so now that you know what type of unreasonable you're dealing with, you can start to be able to handle him/her.,
Consider talking to the unreasonable, saying ""not everything needs an argument,"" and that ""being right isn't that important in life."",
If you are one of those who doesn't like talking (Recessive), you probably need some tips for how to deal with the talkative unreasonable.,
Act like you don't get it that they're angry or why.,
Quickly change the subject.",How to Deal With Unreasonables," If you're good at reading people you just met, this will be a breeze for you. You need to know some key aspects of this person: What little things frequently make him/her angry? Does this person yell/scream often? How quickly does this person get to that breaking point?;
,, There are three types of unreasonable people:



The Arguer - Argues frequently, often for little or no reason whatsoever.
Arguers will often have little idea what they're talking about, but once they say something, they won't give up, insisting that they're right and you are an idiot, even if they have been shown to be wrong, but they just don't want to admit it.

The Explosive - Freak out at the tiniest thing, trying to make you feel like a moron.
Explosives are a bit of a variation from Arguers. They will argue a lot, but more violently, sometimes yelling or even pushing and hitting until you cave. Explosives don't usually lash out at people they don't know well, but they can sometimes. People that they do know avoid them and decide ""It's not worth it.""

The Passive-aggressive - They won't argue, but are still very unreasonable. They use avoidance, silent treatment, and make you feel guilty or confused without directly showing their aggression.
They use body language to show you they're angry, and that you are in big trouble. Often they will try to pretend like they're not angry, but you know.

, The most important thing to remember when dealing with an unreasonable is that one will often not give up without a fight, no matter how small the issue may be.

, Sometimes, if you let them know how you're feeling, they'll try to tone it down a bit. Other people, however don't do well talking things out.

,


In the case of Arguers: if they say something wrong, and you want to correct them, or say something that may start an argument, think to yourself: Is being right really important right now? Is this an issue really worth getting into a big hubbub about? A lot of the time, the answer will be no, and in this case, I would let it go, ignore, it, or, just agree: ""Okay."" Would it really matter if you allow yourself to lose and be wrong a few times?
In the case of explosives: try to use the arguer strategy before they get out of control: give-in. This isn't always possible, sometimes an Explosive can catch you off guard when you thought there was nothing wrong. If they do get into a screaming spree, sometimes, it will still work to just agree, give in, but make sure you don't do it in a way that seems passive-aggressive (sulking), this drives explosives nuts.

Avoid any arguments after giving in, because while an explosive is calming down, he/she is still a ticking bomb. The tiniest of things could set him/her off, he/she may even be looking for things to get mad about.
Just pretend that nothing is wrong. Act like they are having a civil conversation, but don't make a point of it. If you seem to obviously ignoring the outburst, this comes out as very passive-aggressive.
Remove all emotions from your way of being, except serious and calm. Don't react to their explosions. Don't act angry, scared, happy, sad, or even some degrees of nonchalant. Just be after a while, your unreasonable may get bored of the fact that he/she is getting no reaction from you. This helps things.


In the case of passive-aggressiveness: it is a first reaction to get angry. Passive-aggression is meant to make a person irritated and tense, meant to hit them silently but bitterly. It's hard, sometimes to ignore this, because it may make you so angry to be given the silent treatment, but you need to put real effort into it. You shouldn't strike back with passive-aggression (going into a sulk or withdrawing), because that would just make things worse for you. Act nonchalant to their passive anger.

, Try to lighten the mood, even. Don't laugh, though, don't get happy all of a sudden, this will make your unreasonable very angry.

, If you can get to a lighter topic, you might be able to switch him/her to a happier mind set, which is definitely a plus.

"
Identify what annoys you about the person.,
Stay calm.,
Choose a word to calm you.,
Manage nonverbal reactions.,
Practice talking to them in the mirror.,
Be direct and discreet.,
Communicate boundaries.,
Don’t engage in arguments.,
Practice silence.,
Set the example.",How to Deal With Someone Who Really Annoys You1," Take some time to think about why the person annoys you. Is it the sound of their voice? The things they say? Their attitude? Or something else. Becoming more aware of why the person annoys you may help you to manage your interactions with them a bit better.

For example, you might prepare yourself for an interaction with someone who annoys you because of their negative attitude by telling yourself something like, “Tom and I see things differently, and that’s okay. He has a pessimistic point of view, but it is likely because of things that have happened to him. Just because he sees things this way does not mean I have to see them that way.”
You may also want to consider ways that you can limit your interactions with the person. For example, if you work together then you will likely need to see them every day. However, if the person is a family friend, then you can reduce your exposure to them by showing up a little late to gatherings where you know they will be present, or leaving a bit early.;
, When you see the person who annoys you, you might begin to feel angry, agitated or even nervous. Employ various tactics and strategies to keep yourself calm during this time so that you don’t react negatively or get yourself worked up. One thing you can do is to breathe deeply and slowly. Another thing you can do is to think of a memory or mental scenario that calms you.For instance, imagine that you are on a beach or on a relaxing walk through nature. Try to visualize the sights, sounds, smells, and other sensations of being in your relaxing place. For example, you could imagine the feeling of sand between your toes or the smell of flowers in a nearby field. Practice this frequently and you will be able to calm yourself more quickly.
Breathe in slowly through your nose and exhale through your mouth until you feel calm.

, Sometimes, your anxiety and agitation can be similarly soothed if you repeat certain mantras in your head to calm yourself. Repeat something like “peace” over and over until you feel that the word truly resonates and describes your current mental state.You can also choose a word like “happiness” or “serenity.” Repeat it in your head or write it down in a notebook.

, Often times, nonverbal communication is even more telling than the things you say. Avoid adding more hostility and angst to the situation by being visibly closed off and angry. Keep your arms and legs uncrossed, avoid frowning or looking down, and never put your hands in someone’s space or face.Make sure that you are doing your part to not escalate the situation verbally or nonverbally.

, You might be feeling a lot of anxiety about having to interact with people who annoy you. Practice different ways of speaking to them without sounding too harsh. For instance, if they tend to talk over or interrupt you, practice continuing to speak despite interruption, or better yet, point it out to them to let them know when they are doing it. You might even practice with a friend. Work on your facial expressions as well so that you don't look too stern.

, Sometimes the best way to combat the annoyance is to address them directly rather than trying to avoid or ignore them. Pull them aside away from earshot of others and have a talk with them about your relationship. They may be unaware that they are annoying you at all. Or perhaps they know but don’t understand the extent of your frustration. After your talk, keep the things discussed between the two of you.You can start by saying “Hey Ryan, sometimes in the mornings, I need time to get settled in before chatting. It really is starting to frustrate me. Do you think you could give me an hour before you come by to talk about non-work related things?”

, The person annoying you might have difficulty understanding or respecting your boundaries. They might get into your physical space, talk over you, or overshare personal details about their lives that you do not want to know. Perhaps they even pry for inappropriate details about yourself. Let them know that you need them to cease this behavior and ask them to keep things a bit more cordial and professional.You can say something like “Sarah, I know you like to talk about your sex life, but could you do that with someone else? I don’t really like to share or know about details like that.”

, It can be tempting to argue with people who are annoying, particularly if they are combative or know-it-alls. However, avoid engaging in these debates with them. Unless they have presented some information about you or something important to you that is untrue, let it go. Learn to pick your battles and don’t sweat the small stuff.Remember that you do not have to get involved in other people’s issues. This will help you to save precious emotional energy.


If they are telling others things that will defame your character, then address and correct it.
If they have an opinion about their favorite musician however, let it be.

, Know that every statement or action does not require a response on your part. If you are feeling overwhelmed or simply do not have anything nice or constructive to say, exercise your right to be silent. If the person who is annoying you is not getting a rise from you, they will likely cease their behavior and find someone else to interact with.Though you should respond if someone asks you a question, you don’t necessarily need to respond to general statements or comments.

, It can be tempting to be petty or act in ways to annoy this person on purpose to get back at them. Doing so will only likely cause their annoying behavior to increase, however. In order for you to establish more peace in your dynamic, you should be embodying those characteristics yourself. Work towards being kind, hardworking, and respectful at all times, regardless of what people do.If they ask you for a favor and you have time, try to do it.
Don’t ignore them if they tell you “hello.’’
Don’t gossip or talk badly about them or others.

Look for basic signs of a toxic person.,
Watch for people who are constantly angry.,
Watch for cynics who get you down.,
Assess how you feel around people.,
Get a second opinion.,
Express yourself effectively.Since tension is bound to occur in friendships and relationships, it is crucial that you can express your feelings clearly.,
Tell them how you expect to be treated.,
Speak firmly and assertively.,
Protect yourself from harm.,
Apologize if it's appropriate.,
Set and maintain boundaries.Boundaries are important in general, but they become especially important when you're dealing with toxic people.,
Listen to your gut.It's easy for some people to make excuses for a toxic person.,
Ask for help.,
Take responsibility for what you're doing.,
Walk away.",How to Deal With Toxic People," Toxicity can show up in a lot of different ways.You may have a toxic friend and not even realize it. Here are several ways that toxic behavior can manifest:


They create and are surrounded by interpersonal issues.
They try to manipulate and control you.
They are needy and make strong demands on your attention.
They are extremely critical of themselves and other people.
They are unwilling to seek help or try to change.;
, A strong form of toxicity is constant anger. These people are irritable and will get upset at you for the smallest slight. You may feel like you are having to watch your back constantly in order to keep them from jumping on you. Recognize the traits of an angry person so you can learn to respond appropriately. Here are a few signs of an angry person:Shouting at people.
Threatening people.
Interrogating people with hostile questioning.
Regularly using strong, intense language.

, Another form of toxicity that shows up is the cynical person.Cynical people have a negative view of the world. This view infects everything in their life and they have a difficult time being positive. They are hard to be around because of the unending dark cloud overhead. Cynical people may:


Complain endlessly about their lives.
Never be satisfied with how you act toward them.
Fail to contribute anything positive to the relationship.

, One useful way to determine if people are toxic is to pay attention to how you feel around them.You can ""check in"" at certain points while you are around people. Ask yourself the following questions:


Am I feeling drained right now? Does it seem like the person is draining my emotions?
Am I walking on eggshells? Am I afraid to say the wrong thing because they might react negatively?
Am I ignoring my own voice? Is the person making it hard for me to listen to myself and follow my own values?

, You may be too close to the toxic people to know if they are really toxic or not. They could just be going through a rough patch. Try asking a different friend or someone with good judgment if they think the person is toxic. This will help you zero in on the toxic people in your life.


Your own judgment is a good source of information, but sometimes when we get too close to a situation it can be hard to have an unbiased opinion.

, When you are owning and examining your feelings, you have the opportunity to handle this tension smoothly. And, speaking expressively will open space for other people to express how they feel, and work through these different feelings together.


Start by listening. Make sure to acknowledge what the person is saying before you counter with your own views.
Use ""I"" statements. A simple way to avoid being too confrontational is to tell people what you're experiencing rather than what they're doing wrong. For example, you can say ""When you're late to our coffee dates, I feel like you don't value my time"" rather than ""You're always late and it's really rude.""

, As strange as it sounds, sometimes people don't know what's acceptable behavior. Acceptable behavior to one person can be unacceptable to another. In order for people to know what you are willing to put up with, be upfront and make it clear.


For example, if being late to coffee dates is your pet peeve, let them know. They might have no clue what effect their behavior has on you.
If the person is really toxic, this strategy may not work, but it's good practice for setting boundaries regardless.

, This ties into effective arguing, but speaking assertively is something you can do all the time, whether you're arguing or not. Being an assertive speaker will help improve your communication and relationships.


Try to figure out where you could use some improvement. Maybe you're easily intimidated and people tend to step all over you, especially if they have a toxic personality. Identify the problem area as a first step.
Reflect on tactics for specific situations. Maybe your toxic friend asks you for money and you have a hard time saying no. What can you do in these situations? Could you rehearse a simple script for the next time they ask? For example, you could say ""I care about you, but I'm not able to give you any more money.""
Practice responding assertively in your life. You can use techniques like the ""broken record,"" where you simply repeat yourself if they argue about what you've said. Start small if this is difficult for you, such as saying no (when appropriate) to family members or non-toxic friends.

, Be aware of what goes on inside your relationships with toxic people. For example, avoid taking everything they say at face value if you've noticed a tendency for them to be harsh and critical toward you. Protect yourself in these relationships, if you choose to continue them, by developing awareness of what they're saying to you, how they're behaving toward you, and how it's making you feel.


For example, if they make a claim about you, such as ""you're never there for me,"" analyze the claim. Is it true? Can you think of examples that prove it wrong? Toxic people often exaggerate and make all-or-nothing claims.Practice thinking critically about what they say to you.

, Even if someone is toxic, that doesn't mean you'll always be right and they'll always be wrong. Own any mistakes you make and apologize when you feel it's appropriate.Even if they don't accept your apology or rarely apologize themselves, at least you will know you've done your best to be a good friend or partner.


You might even make a positive impression on them. This is called modeling, or showing people healthier ways to behave than what they've traditionally done., Toxic people often take advantage of people with poorly defined boundaries and low self-assertiveness. Here are some steps to help you maintain better boundaries:


Tune into and act on your feelings. Avoid getting swept up in the emotional turmoil of toxic people. Pay attention to what you feel and need.
Give yourself permission to be firm. Many people feel guilty if they have to establish a firm boundary. However, taking care of yourself is also important. Avoid neglecting yourself in favor of others. Learn that saying no doesn't make you a bad person.

, You may know deep down that the person is bad for you or is taking advantage of you. Avoid rationalizing these gut instincts or explaining their behavior away. Let your instincts have the final word, because they probably know more about what's going on and what you need than you realize.

, Learn to know when enough is enough and you need help.Contact a close friend or family member you trust to be there for you. If you want to maintain relationships with toxic people, be sure to make use of your support network. Keep self-care a priority. Giving too much of yourself is not the best way to be there for other people.

, Try to make a sober assessment of the kind of relationship you're in and the effect it's having on you.Many people who continue being friends with toxic people have a ""people pleaser"" personality, where they want to be liked and want to feel like they're supporting others. There's nothing wrong with being supportive, but be aware of what's going on so that you can have a realistic picture of the situation. If the situation is hurting you, that's something you should know about. If it's enabling the other person and preventing them from change, that's something else you should know. Ask yourself these questions to get a sense of whether or not you're being indiscriminately supportive:


Am I usually the one keeping up communication?
Do I often take on the role of ""peace keeper"", cleaning up tense and difficult situations?
Does it sometimes feel like I am following around this person, handling responsibilities or working behind the scenes to avoid anger or confrontation?

, At the end of the day, you may need to end your relationship with the person if it's toxic. Cutting people out of your life can be a painful exercise, but in the case of toxic people, short-term pain can be healthier than long-term pain.Keeping toxic people in your life can mess with your self-esteem, your finances, your emotional balance, and your other relationships. If the toll is too high, it may be time to plan your exit.

"
"
Try to avoid the person when possible.,
Close your door.,
Make yourself unavailable.,
Back yourself up with a friend who knows about your situation.,
Step away from the situation.",How to Deal With Someone Who Really Annoys You2," Sometimes, the best way to prevent being annoyed is to get space from the person who is bothering you. Walk a different route to your classes, take a different lunch break at work, or even reconfigure your office so that you do not have to face them if you are in neighboring cubicles. If you work closely with the person, this might be a bit difficult, but you can set up more phone calls and emails rather than meeting in person frequently.

, Though you cannot change the person, you can alter your surroundings. Perhaps the person who annoys you lives in your home or is someone you work with. If you have your own room or your own office, you can simply close your door when you need some alone time or when you have something to work on that requires your full attention. Exercise your right to privacy as much as possible and whenever you need it., One other way to monitor and limit your interactions is to make yourself unavailable so that they cannot approach you. Put your headphones in, make a phone call, or put your purse or bookbag in the chair next to you so they can’t sit by you.If that is the only seat left, don’t be cruel. Allow them to sit down and pull out a book so they know you are busy.

, Though you should steer away from gossip, if the person’s annoyance begins to escalate, tell a friend or give them a sign so they can create an excuse for both of you to walk away from the person. Don't make it obvious that you are trying to get away from the person, or they will think you are mean, especially if they do not intend to annoy you.


Perhaps your sign is that you pat their shoulder or wink at them.

, Sometimes, the best way to keep yourself calm is to walk away. If someone is annoying you in particular and you feel yourself on the verge of lashing out, step away, take a walk, go get a snack, or go to the restroom. You will often find that once you return to the situation, you will be much calmer and less likely to respond negatively.For instance, if a coworker is bragging again about how much money his family has, knowing that you are going through a financial hardship, say “Excuse me for a moment,” and take a quick walk until you are calm.

"
"
Talk to a close friend who does not know the person.,
Put their behavior into perspective.,
Think about the situation broadly.,
Use humor.,
Report their behavior to the necessary people.",How to Deal With Someone Who Really Annoys You3," Sometimes, you just need to vent, and venting can help you to feel better and decrease feelings of annoyance. Rather than taking your frustrations out on the person who is annoying you, which will only further damage your relationship, vent to a trusted friend or family member. Though it can be tempting to gossip to your coworkers or to others who this person might annoy, shy away from doing this so you don’t create drama.


Call your mom or spouse and say “Do you have a few minutes to talk? I need to vent about this person I work with.”
You can either have them just listen to you or you can ask for advice.

, Remember that they might not be purposely annoying you, it might just be one of their characteristics. People could find some things that you do annoying, so don't be too harsh to the person or you could offend and upset them. If you feel the situation is starting to get out of control, or if they are getting angry, walk away or an argument could erupt.


Reflect on the times that others have called you annoying. Recognize that them lashing out in anger towards you did nothing to dissipate the situation, but often times only made both of you feel worse.
Try to remind yourself that what you find annoying might not be annoying to other people. The feelings of annoyance are coming from within yourself, not from the other person.

, Often times you might find that what annoys you in the moment is something that will hardly or never cross your mind again in a week or even in an hour. When you are getting worked up because someone is annoying you, badgering you, or being loud, think to yourself “Will this matter later?”, Laughter is the best medicine and this instance is no different. When you feel yourself on the brink of annoyance, take a moment to laugh. Watch a funny video on YouTube, revisit some funny memes that you have in your phone, or call a friend who is hilarious. Doing so will improve your mood and allow you to let things go more easily.Distracting yourself can be helpful when the emotions you are felling are getting to you. Take some time to focus on something you enjoy for a while and then come back to the situation.

, The person annoying you may be doing so purposely or their behavior may border on bullying. For example, if they are regularly playing pranks on you that are disrupting your work or your peace, this is unacceptable. If they are calling you names or contacting you frequently outside of work, this is not okay either. Report their behavior to the necessary people, whether that be your boss, teacher, or someone else.

Start with a bit of flattery.,
Show that you value their opinions.,
Don't tell them that they're wrong.,
Show how the decision will benefit them.,
Make them think they've come up with the idea on their own.,
Be firm.,

Don't say that they're being stubborn.,

Pick your battles.,
Break the pattern of always giving in.,
Don't beg or sound desperate.,
Be patient.,
Maintain your confidence.,
Know when to give up.",How to Deal With Stubborn People," One of the reasons that stubborn people are the way they are is because they hate to be wrong. They think that they know the best way to do everything, and therefore, they may be a bit sensitive when they are told that there are other ways to do things; they may view a difference in opinion as a personal attack even if you mean no harm. So, when you talk to stubborn people, try to make them feel good about themselves by offering them a bit of flattery first. Just make sure it's sincere and that it doesn't sound like you're just sucking up to get your way. Here are some ways you can start off:


""I know you've been working so hard lately. I'm so impressed by how you're able to keep your act together during such a stressful time.""
""You always have such great ideas and I thought I'd throw one out for you.""
""I'm so glad I got to see you today. I've missed hanging out with you."";
, Another thing you have to do to deal with stubborn people is to acknowledge their positions and show them that they really have a great idea. Don't make them think that their idea is completely stupid, invalid, or poorly thought-out (even if you feel that way), or their chances of listening to you will be approaching 0%. Make sure to repeat their argument and show that you do see the good in what the person is saying; that way, the person will see that you do value him or her as well as his or her ideas. This will make the person much more open to listening to you. Here are some things that you can say:


""I think going to get Italian is a great idea. I love the gnocchi at the Italian place, and they have such a great wine selection. However...""
""I know we didn't have the greatest time hanging out with Sarah and Mike last time, and you're right about them being a little bit weird. But I really think we should give them another chance.""
""Moving to San Francisco from Oakland would have a lot of benefits, just like you said. There would be more to do, we'd be living closer to the airport and we do travel a ton, and we'd be moving closer to our best friends. But having said that...""

, The last thing that a stubborn person wants to hear is that he or she is flat-out wrong. Don't ever say, ""You're not looking at this correctly,"" or ""You just don't get it, do you?"" And definitely don't say, ""How could you be so wrong?"" This will alienate the person and make him or her shut down completely. Make it clear that he or she has some great ideas and that you have considered them carefully. They may be right for another time or situation, but right now, you'd like to do what you want to do. Make that very clear.


Say things like, ""We both have such great ideas"" or ""There are a lot of ways to look at this situation"" to show that you think the person is ""equally"" right.

, Stubborn people are often stubborn because they are very invested in themselves and how their decisions can help them feel even better and do what they want to do. So, if you want to stroke their egos a bit and make them think the decision is valid, you have to show how it can end up benefiting them, even if it may seem a little surprising. This will pique their interest and will make them much more likely to give in. Here are some things that you can say:


""I'd really love to check out the new sushi place down the street. Remember you said you were having a craving for fried ice cream? I heard they have an amazing a variety at that restaurant.""
""Hanging out with Sarah and Mike should be fun, and what's more, I heard Mike has an extra ticket to the 49ers game and is looking for someone to go with him. I know you've been dying to go.""
""If we stay in Oakland instead of moving to San Francisco, we'll be able to save on rent. We can use that extra money to go to Costa Rica this summer, just like you wanted to do.""

, This is another trick to convincing the stubborn person to do what you want. Make the person think that, in the course of your conversation, he or she had actually come up with the idea, or had introduced an important aspect of why the idea is such a good one. This will make the person feel proud of himself, and like he's still getting his own way. This can be a little tricky to pull off, but if you can do it right, you'll be amazed by how much better this will make the stubborn person feel. Here are some things you can say:


""That's a great idea! I forgot about how much I love plum wine. The sushi place will definitely have that.""
""You're right -- we can meet up with Sarah and Mike this weekend. And you think Saturday night is the best time to do it, don't you?""
""That's so true -- I would miss our little farmer's market way too much if we left Oakland.""

, The reason that stubborn people often get their way is because the people around them often cave in and let them get exactly what they want. This can be for a number of reasons: you may think that the person will throw a fit or sulk if he doesn't get his way, you may not have the energy to resist, or you may even be convinced that the person must want whatever you're arguing about more badly than you do. But remind yourself that the person is using cheap tactics to get his way, and that you're entitled to have things go your way for once.


If the person starts to get emotional or visibly upset, slow down until the person feels more calm, but don't just say, ""Fine, fine, you can get your way, just stop crying"" -- this will show the person that he or she can manipulate your emotions and get you to give up what you want easily.
Being firm means sticking to your side of the story and offering a rational, logical argument for why your idea is important. It does not mean getting aggressive or yelling or name calling. Stubborn people are already defensive, and this kind of behavior will only make them feel more threatened.

, Stubborn people are also afraid of the unknown. They may not want to do something simply because they've never done it before or because they're not used to breaking their routine. The more you can tell them about the situation, the better they will feel about it. They'll see that the thing you're proposing isn't so scary because they can have a sense of what it will be like. Here are some things you can say:


""The new sushi place has a great deal on sashimi. It's a lot cheaper than the Italian place too. They also have an awesome big screen TV, and you can catch the end of the game while we eat.""
""Sarah and Mike have the cutest little dog -- you'll love him. Mike is also really into craft beer and they have an awesome selection. They only live fifteen minutes away, so it won't be a trek, either.""
""Did you know that rent in San Francisco is on average 100% higher than the rent in Oakland? How can we afford to live there?""

, If the stubborn person cares about you, then he or she will be persuaded just by hearing why the things you want would mean so much to you. This will help them see the situation on a human level, and they will see that it's about more than about being wrong or right, but about giving you what you really want and need. If you're in a relationship with this person, then helping them see why this would make you happy is a great move. Here are some things you can say:


""I've been craving sushi for weeks. Can we please go? I can always go with Maria, but that just won't be as fun as going with you.""
""I'd really like to spend more time with Sarah and Mike. You know I've been lonely in our new neighborhood, and I'd love to have some more friends.""
""I'd really love to live in Oakland for another year. Commuting to work is so easy for me, and I'd hate to have to wake up an hour earlier to get there.""

, If you're used to dealing with this particular stubborn person, then chances are, you have given in again and again. It's time to put your foot down and remind the person of all of the things you have given up for him or her, whether it's big or small. You can do this without making them feel horrible, but you can really show them the big picture and let them see that it's time that you got what you wanted. Here are some things you can say:


""We've gone to the restaurant you've wanted to go to for the last five times we hung out. Can I pick, for once?""
""We've hung out with your friends instead of mine for the last three weekends. Can we give my friends a chance this time?""
""It was your idea to move to Oakland, remember? Well, now it's my idea to stay put.""

, You may not be able to get what you want completely, but you may be able to get the stubborn person to meet you halfway. Compromising or negotiating with the person can help you persuade him to do what you want to do without fully giving in. If the person is truly stubborn, then baby steps may be the way to go, and you won't be able to convince the person to follow your plan overnight. Here are some things you can say:


""Okay, we can go to the Italian place tonight. But that means we'll go to the sushi place tomorrow night, right?""
""How about we meet Sarah and Mike for a drink instead of coming over to their place for dinner? We'll still hang out with them for a bit, but it won't take up our whole night.""
""I'd be open to moving to Berkeley. It's more expensive than Oakland, but not as pricey as San Francisco, and there's always a lot going on there, too.

, If you really want to deal with a stubborn person and even have a chance of getting your way, then you can't let your emotions get the best of you. If you start getting visibly upset or even angry, then the person will think that he won, because you can't keep yourself in check. Take deep breaths, slow down, or even leave the room for a few minutes if you see yourself getting heated. The stubborn person will be much more likely to listen to you if you look calm and collected, not angry or crazed.


It's easy to lose your cool when you're dealing with someone who is unwilling to do what you want or to change. But remind yourself that the more likely you are to have an outburst, the less likely the person will be to see your side of the story.

, The last thing a stubborn person wants to hear is that he is stubborn. Stubborn people are defensive, and, well, stubborn, and if you even say this word around them, then they will clam up and be even less likely to change. Don't say, ""Why do you have to be so stubborn!?"" or the person will stop listening to you. Resist the urge to say this word even if it's on the tip of your tongue.

, Finding common ground with the person can help you persuade him to see things from your perspective. Stubborn people can feel a bit ganged up on and if you convince the person that you're both coming from the same place, then he or she will be much more likely to listen to you then if you have wildly different opinions. Here are some things you can say:


""I completely agree that we've been having productivity issues at the company. We definitely need to find a solution here. However, I do think that it has more to do with a lack of employee satisfaction than with the new projects we've been assigned.""
""I agree that the people we've been hanging out with have all been a little weird or boring. But if we don't give new friends a chance, we'll never find people we really like, will we?""

, If you have to deal with a stubborn person in the long term, then you have to know that stubborn people don't like to dive head first into the unknown. They like to put their toes into the water and to slowly walk forward. So, if you want to convince a person close to you to try something different, then you have to get the person used to the idea little by little until the person is fully comfortable with the situation.


For example, if you have a slightly possessive friend who doesn't like the new friends you made from your art class, have the person meet the friends one on one for a short amount of time instead of throwing the person into your new friend group; this will make the person more likely to be excited about the new social situation.
If you're trying to convince your roommate to be more clean, then ask your roommate to do the dishes every other day. After that, you can talk about taking out the trash more often, vacuuming the carpet, and so on.

, This is key when dealing with stubborn people. You can get stubborn people to give in on some occasions, and with the right approach, you can even convince them to make some pretty big changes. However, if the person is truly stubborn, then it's unlikely that he or she will give in to your demands very often. So, if you have a hard time getting a stubborn person to do what you want, then you should only ask about the things you really care about.


Maybe you don't really care about picking the movie on date night; but you may, however, care about where you go on your spring break trip. Save up for that.

, A stubborn person may continue to get his or her way around you because you always end up giving in. If you never say no, then why would the person want to change for you? So, the next time you're negotiating something, even if it's as simple as what movie to see, say that you're going to go on your own or go home if you don't get your way. This will surprise the stubborn person so much that he or she will either give in or will start to think of you as a person who can't be easily manipulated.


If you don't give in easily, the stubborn person will actually respect you more and will be more likely to value your opinion.

, This is not a good way to get the person to come around to your point of view, no matter how badly you want things to go your way. If you feel that you've exhausted all of your resources and options, then just walk away. There's no use in degrading yourself by begging and whining, and this will not only not work with a truly stubborn person, but it will be a little humiliating for you.


If you want to convince a stubborn person to do something, you have to take the rational approach. The emotional approach will only make the person even less likely to agree with you.

, It takes time to truly persuade a stubborn person, especially if you're trying to break a stubborn pattern of behavior. It won't happen overnight, and you have to remind yourself that you'll have to start with the small stuff (what to watch on TV) before you can to move to the bigger issues (where to move). Tell yourself that you can change the person little by little, but that you won't be able to make him or her someone completely new.

, Confidence is key when you're dealing with stubborn people. If you waver or show some doubt in your own ideas, then the person will respect you less and will be even less likely to listen to you. You have to act like your idea or perspective is the best idea ever (without being arrogant, of course), and the person will be more likely to think you know your stuff. Don't let the person intimidate you into backing down or saying that maybe your own idea isn't so great.


Keep your head up, maintain eye contact, and don't let the person make you hunch over or look at the floor when you're talking. Maintaining a confident posture can go a long way in making your ideas sound confident.
If you're nervous about what you have to propose, practice it in advance. This will make you sound more confident about your ideas when the time comes.

, Unfortunately, you may try everything when you're dealing with the stubborn person and may get absolutely no results. If the stubborn person isn't budging an inch, listening to you at all, or willing to accept another perspective though you've tried providing more information, flattering him, being firm, and showing how much the decision would mean to you, then it may be time to walk away. If you can't do any good, then you may only be doing harm, and it's better to leave the situation if you know it's not going anywhere.


If you keep trying to make a stubborn person see your point of view to no avail at all, then you may end up being the stubborn one.
Giving up on a stubborn person doesn't mean you're weak. It just means that you have been rational and know when there's nothing else that can be done.

Spot your inner critic at work.,
Learn to accept your shortcomings.,
Reframe negative self-talk.,
Quit telling yourself self-criticism motivates.",How to Give Up Self Criticism As a Perfectionist1," Feelings of inadequacy are a major sign that you are experiencing a negative inner critic. In order to effectively quit your self-criticism habit, you must first recognize when you are being critical. Observe your thoughts and feelings for a few days to spot critical and unhelpful statements.


Pay special attention for judgmental statements like “Because I needed help, I am a loser” or “My coworker performed better than me, which means I don’t do my job well.”
You’ll come to notice that such thoughts often precede negative feelings like depression, anxiety, or anger. What’s more, negative self-talk can also cause you to procrastinate on anxiety-provoking tasks or medicate with unhealthy behaviors (e.g. overeating or using drugs).Being workaholic is another sign that you may be a perfectionist, which can lead to negative self-talk.;
, As a perfectionist, you probably have a hard time accepting imperfections. However, being able to acknowledge and be okay with your flaws is a necessary step to overcoming self-criticism. Perfectionism is a defense mechanism against you shortcomings, but learning to be vulnerable can help. To be vulnerable, you will need to have courage as well as look closely and objectively at your flaws.You must know that everyone has both strengths and weaknesses. Being ashamed of your inherent flaws only wastes important energy. The only way to truly grow is by accepting your weaknesses. Then, you can begin to use that energy to improve these areas.
Generally, people ignore or hide their flaws and act like they aren't there. Accept your flaws by overcoming your denial about them. If you have poor spending habits, voice this flaw aloud. Say, “I have a tendency to overspend when I am upset. I am racking up a lot of credit card debt."" Owning your flaws is the best way to gain acceptance of them., Once you have learned to identify self-criticisms and start accepting flaws, you can transform negative thoughts into positive, helpful ones. When you find yourself in a cycle of self-criticism, isolate one thought and try to put a positive spin on it.


For example, you might say, “I’ll never reach my goals.” Reframe this perfectionistic statement into “I have accomplished many of my goals. If I stay focused, I will reach others.”Try to look at setbacks as opportunities for growth rather than as negative or as personal flaws. Remind yourself that failure is a necessary part of improvement, so it is normal and helpful to experience failures in your lifetime., One of the primary obstacles keeping your self-criticism habit in place is that you’re telling yourself it works for you. It’s very common for perfectionists to say “The only way I can succeed is by being hard on myself.” In truth, self-criticism often drives away success and happiness and pushes you further along the path of self-hate. It can even jeopardize your physical health.Tell yourself “I am not helping myself by using negative words. Negativity is only hurting me.”

Identify your positive traits.,
Recite positive and realistic affirmations daily.,
Treat yourself as you would a friend.,
Change the way you see mistakes.",How to Give Up Self Criticism As a Perfectionist2," If you are a perfectionist, you probably fail to see the amazing accomplishments or talents in your life. Rather you choose to dwell on what you haven’t done or reached. Improve your perspective by learning to focus on your strengths.Make a list of the many achievements you have made. If you have trouble getting started, ask others, or consider what they would identify as things you should be proud of. The list might include traits like being a good friend, standing up for others, and having great ideas.
Whenever you catch yourself being critical, review the list. Praise yourself regularly for all the things you obviously can do right.

, You can decrease your desire to criticize yourself by repeating realistic self-statements. Write down or type up a list of positive and realistic statements to place in your wallet, on your bathroom mirror, or in some other location where you will see it regularly. These may sound like:”Everyone makes mistakes.”
“So what?”
”I don’t have to be liked by everyone—no one is!”
”Perfection is impossible, and boring.”
”I commit to doing my best. That’s all I can do.”

, As a perfectionist, you tend to hold yourself to impossibly high standards, as if you are not a typical human. On the other hand, you may not hold others to these same expectations. Practice self-compassion by regarding yourself as you would a friend.


Would a friend call you a loser or judge you for making a mistake? Of course not. Give yourself permission to be human and imperfect.
Give yourself a hug like your best pal would. Remind yourself of all the challenges you have previously overcome. Be gentle with yourself instead of engaging in self-blame., It seems that it’s not just high expectations that negatively affect perfectionists. In fact, many successful people have high expectations. The difference lies in how people view mistakes. Perfectionists tend to dwell on their errors much more than others.See your mistakes as learning opportunities rather than measures of your self-worth. For example, if you screw up on a speech, don’t berate yourself. Commit to improving for your next speech and move on.
You can also relax your perspective on mistakes by purposefully making them. Go part of the day with a stain on your shirt. Show up for a meeting a few minutes late. This can help you see that the world won’t end simply because you make a mistake.

Be aware of the “highlight reel.” You may engage in self-criticism more often when you are exposed to the seemingly “perfect” aspects of others’ lives.,
Limit negative media and increase positive, uplifting media.,
Stay away from toxic or perfectionistic people.",How to Give Up Self Criticism As a Perfectionist3," To counteract this, keep in mind that most people aren’t going to advertise their flaws, but they may be very vocal about their achievements.


Don’t assume that what you see on social media or hear about in conversation fully describes their situation. These people have setbacks and doubts, too. Refuse to compare your full story to someone else’s highlight reel.It has been proven that looking at other people’s “highlight reels” on websites like Facebook can contribute to depression. If this is the case for you, then delete your account or at least limit the time that you spend on the site., A primary symptom of perfectionism is the fear of how others view you. As a result, you try to buffer their evaluation by doing everything exactly right. The resulting desire to be perfect can lead to conditions like social anxiety and eating disorders. You can decrease these feelings of self-consciousness by removing your access to negative media.When you witness people who judge or shame others on TV, magazines, or social media, you will automatically believe that this is how others will perceive you, too.
Access media that focuses on solutions rather than problems. It can also help to view media that emphasizes the many positive differences in people rather than expecting everyone to be the same.Try to focus on positive or uplifting media to help improve your outlook.

, Parents, friends, or partners who suffer from perfectionism can be very demanding. They may require perfection from themselves and you, only reinforcing this negative habit. Other perfectionists may make constant comparisons between themselves and some ideal. When you're around them, it's easy to fall into the comparison game, too.


If possible, minimize the time you spend with these people. And turn on your inner-filter when around them to tease out negative and unhelpful feedback.Build a support network of positive people who encourage and accept you. Spend time with them as much as you can.

Don't trust them to be on time.,
Try to understand why they're chronically late.,
Determine if you could relax a little.,
Adjust your expectations -- and your behavior.,
Give them an earlier arrival time than everyone else.,
Bring things to keep you occupied.",How to Deal With Someone Who Is Always Late1," In other words, don't get your hopes up. Don't expect someone who is always late to suddenly be on time. If you have a friend or family member who has been running late for 27 years, chances are they aren't going to change. Even if they promise they will. Someone who is chronically late will probably be chronically late forever. Unless there is some seriously drastic intervention -- that they will also probably be late to!;
, It's probably not because they're selfish or on a power trip. Odds are they're not good at foreseeing how long things will take, they have a chaotic life, or they're just naturally fickle. When you see the cause behind the symptom, it's easier to not get angry.


And consider their background. Certain cultures say 6 pm and they mean 6 pm. Others say 6 pm and really, they're saying, ""Show up between 7 and 11 if you, you know, feel like it.""

, Okay, so it really is their problem, but in what ways could you change? Maybe you could cut your friend some slack. Make a pact with yourself that you will only get angry if they are more than 20 minutes late. Anything less than that and they are off the hook. It sucks, but it save you mental anguish.


When you know they're going to be late, you sort of have to take some of the responsibility on yourself. Why get angry over a sure thing?

, If you don't expect them to be on time, you won't be as disappointed when they aren't. And if you don't expect them to be on time, you can be late, too!


And if for some reason the universe stops and they're on time the one time you're late, tell 'em it's a taste of their own medicine. Do they like their time being wasted? Probably not.

, The party starts at 9:00 pm, but for the chronic latecomer, just say it starts at 8:30. Once again, you're probably doing them a favor. You're not the only one who's irritated!


This only works until they catch onto your game. When they do catch on, it may be time for a discussion!

, You will be more angry with your friend when they arrive late if all you had to do was wait around for them. Bring a book or a pen and paper with you so you can stay busy. Time will fly by and you might not even notice they were late.


Think of this as a reward if at all possible. You get an extra fifteen minutes to finish that book you've been slacking on. Awesome! Some unaccounted for downtime!

Stay calm.,
Be direct.,
Use humor.,
Be polite.,
Have a civilized conversation.,
Use “I” statements as opposed to “you” statements.,
Talk to them in private.,
Don't overthink the situation.",How to Deal With Rude People1," Confronting the person won’t work if you’re angry and aggressive.


If you feel upset or frazzled by a rude comment the person said to you, take a few deep breaths before approaching them. The more flustered you look, the less they will listen to what you have to say.
Spend a moment thinking carefully about what you will say beforehand instead of impulsively yelling at the person. They will be less likely to argue back if you show that their rude comment has not fazed you. Being the bigger person means that you are confident and in control of your emotions.
Don't engage them in any sort of physical fight or argument - this will also only worsen the situation. If you’re worried you might lash out, have a friend with you to keep you in check.;
, Avoid beating around the bush or being passive-aggressive. Face them square on, make eye contact, and cut straight to chase about what it is they did that upset you. They can’t learn from their mistake if they don’t know what they did.


If someone cuts in front of you in line at the grocery store, don’t let out a dramatic sigh and roll your eyes hoping that they will notice. Address them directly by saying, “Excuse me, but I think I was in front of you in line” or “I’m sorry, but the line starts back there.”

, If you feel uncomfortable directly calling someone out on their rudeness in a serious way, incorporate humor to diffuse the tension.


If someone is loudly munching on their sandwich and making a mess next to you on the subway, smile and casually say something like, “Wow, you’re really enjoying that, aren’t you?” with a laugh. If they don’t get the point, follow up with, “Would you mind chewing a little less loudly?”
Make sure your humor is light-hearted and not passive-aggressive or sarcastic. Stay friendly and smile. You want your comment to come off as a joke that the both of you can laugh about, not a sassy comment that fires off an argument.

, The best way to fight rudeness is with kindness. Be the bigger person and don’t stoop down to their level by being rude in return.Keep your tone of voice respectful and not sassy. Smile.
Use please and thank you. These words can go a long way. For example, try saying, ""Please stop, I find that rude and insulting. I don't appreciate your behavior,"" or ""There's no need for such comments here. Thank you.”
Oftentimes, people who are rude have something bothering them. Their rudeness might be a cry for help, or they might be searching for an empathetic ear. If you know the person well enough, ask them if something is bothering them or if they need help. Make sure it does not come off as being sarcastic, however. Try saying something like “I’ve noticed you’ve been acting more lately. Is everything okay? Is there anything I can do to help?”, If the person insulted you personally or said something that you strongly disagree with, politely state your opinion or ask them why they are behaving this way.


Try to understand their perspective by saying, “I find what you just said to be rude and disrespectful… what makes you say that?” This could launch a healthy discussion or debate - but make sure it doesn’t spiral out of hand.
If it “does” turn into a heated argument and person continues to be rude and disrespectful, walk away. Realize you’ve done all you can and let it go.
Remember that some people are dead-set on their opinions. It isn’t possible for everyone to agree on everything, and sometimes even if you try, you won’t be able to change their mind.

, “You” statements point the blame and accusations to the listener, which might make them defensive. Instead, express to them how their actions make you feel personally.If a relative keeps making comments about your weight, try saying something like, “When you say those things about my body, I feel insecure and down about myself,” as opposed to “You are so annoying and rude.”

, No one likes to be singled out in front of others when they are at fault. If a person is being rude to you when you’re in a group, try to wait until you can talk to them one-on-one.If a friend is making racist or sexist comments during a group conversation at lunchtime, wait until the others have left or offer to walk with them to class so you can discuss it privately. Or, text them later and say, “Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something. Do you have a minute after school?”
Talking in private also prevents other friends from taking sides in the conflict, which only worsens the situation and could potentially create a divide in your friend group., If you've confronted someone about their behavior and things haven't improved, accept that you've done as much as you possibly could to improve relations with them.


You can’t make someone be polite if they want to be rude, and it is not your responsibility to try to “fix” them. In fact, trying too hard to force a change in their behavior will often make them behave worse instead of better. Sometimes you just have to accept people’s rudeness, realize it is not your fault, and let them find their own solutions."

Ask your significant other why she has chosen to wear makeup this way.,
Ask her how she feels about herself and if wearing makeup changes anything for her.,
Ask your significant other to describe how she thinks your makeup preferences operate.,
Tell your significant other that she is beautiful when she isn’t wearing any makeup.,
Focus on one specific feature.,
Point out your mate’s inner beauty.,
Pay for a professional day of pampering.,

Be aware that your significant other may disagree with your concept of attractive makeup.,
Stop criticizing your partner.,
Act with mutual compassion, understanding, and generosity.Acting with generosity breeds cooperation, kindness, and compassion.This will demonstrate a concern for your partner’s well-being.",How to Get Your Significant Other to Stop Wearing Excessive Makeup," It is important to remember that people wear makeup for a variety of reasons. Moreover, it is personal choice and personal taste that determine the amount and type of makeup one wears. Questions to consider include:


Is she attempting to cover a flaw?
Does she enjoy bold and bright colored makeup?
Is this makeup done for the wearer or for someone else?
Is she wearing makeup to enhance her features?
An example of how you might begin this conversation would be to say: “I notice that you often wear a lot of makeup and I was wondering if you could explain to me why women wear makeup and what your personal reasons are for doing your makeup the way that you do?”;
, Many people wear makeup to feel prettier or because they believe that they will be perceived negatively without it.Others wear makeup to fit in. It’s been proven that people who wear makeup are often perceived as more trustworthy, competent, and likeable than their bare-faced counterparts.Discuss openly and kindly what your partner shares with you.
Do not make criticisms about your significant other’s feelings about herself and/or makeup.
Listen carefully to what you are being told and do not pass judgments.
You might say something like, “I was wondering if you could tell me what it’s like to be you? I mean, in general, how do you feel about yourself and your appearance at any given time?” Once she has answered this, you might segue into discussing how she feels about wearing makeup and if that changes how she feels about her appearance. Make sure to empathize with her when she answers this question and do not ask the question in a way that might sound like an accusation.

, After listening to her description of her understanding of your likes and dislikes pertaining to cosmetics, you should talk about your preferences. Explain why you like a natural look with less makeup on a person more than a robust makeup application.


Remember to be kind and careful with your words.
Don’t take this opportunity to insult your significant other’s makeup applications, or to offer criticism.
Be objective.
Make your preferences about you and not about your significant other.
You might begin this conversation by asking, “What kind of makeup do you think I like best?” or by asking, “What type of makeup do you think I find the most attractive and why?”

, Complimenting your significant other when she is fresh-faced is a sweet gesture.This will help to build your mate’s self-confidence and may provide enough of a hint to let your significant other know that you wish they would wear less makeup without your actually saying so.


Repeat your compliments of your significant other whenever she is free of makeup as positive reinforcement.
Make sure that you mean what you are saying and that you are not offering empty compliments.
Make sure that your compliments are not backhanded compliments that could double as insults, or which contain snark.
Make sure that your compliments do not come off as a criticism of your significant other’s makeup skills.

, Perhaps she has naturally alluring eyes or full lips. Tell your partner about your favorite part of their face and why. Again, this will boost your significant other’s self-esteem and self-confidence., Rather than focusing on superficial beauty, express your appreciation for his/her depth and character.Reinforce that she is a beautiful human being inside and out regardless of the amount of make she is wearing.

, Tell your significant other how much you love her by treating her to a spa day. Be sure you purchase the package that includes a makeover. She may love her new, more subtle makeup, providing you with a sneaky, but sweet way to revise her look.


Speak with the spa professionals about what you hope to achieve. Be sure you tell the makeup technician that you do not want her to know you ordered a makeover, but that she wears too much makeup, which detracts from her appearance.
Be sure you include other spa goodies such as a massage and a manicure or pedicure to complete the day. If you only have her go for makeup, she will most likely be suspicious of your intent.

, While this may feel abnormal for you or your partner, you should use positive reinforcement in order to build your significant other’s confidence and self-esteem, as well as to effect a more permanent change in his/her makeup application. Additionally, this will help revise your partner’s desire to appeal to the mistaken preference that you have like heavy makeup. , Let them know that you found this particular item of makeup and you knew it would help to enhance their natural beauty without overpowering it.

, If this occurs you should accept her decision, as the way she applies her makeup is wholly her choice. You won’t always be attracted to your partner, but if you love them, you need to accept them as they are or want to be., You selected your partner for a reason and during the courtship phase of your relationship you accepted her flaws, including her decision to wear a lot of makeup.Ask yourself why you are now willing to criticize what you previously managed to overlook.


What will you gain from this criticism?

Determine if it's something personal.,
Let them know your bottom line.,
Get real.,
Give them a chance to tell you something that bothers them about you.,
Don't make them the responsible party member.,
Give them incentive.",How to Deal With Someone Who Is Always Late2," Is your friend only late when she's meeting up with you? Consider whether it's chronic lateness or rudeness directed specifically at you. Tailor your communication with them accordingly. It's probably less acceptable to yell at someone for being late to your birthday party if they were late to every birthday party they've ever been to.

, There is nothing wrong with telling your friend nicely that if they aren't there by a certain time you are just going to go on without them. That's perfectly reasonable, mature and un-threatening. If your friend really wants to participate in the activity with you, he or she will be sure to make it on time.


In some cases, after 20 minutes you'll have to leave. It's gonna suck; it's gonna be a waste of your time, but hopefully the point will have been made. The next time they ask you to do something, tell them you're not going to get ready, go, wait, and just go home. Be firm but rational -- your time matters!

It's a great reason to get them to come to you. If you can stay comfortable, it's less of a big deal.



, Your time is important. When your friend is late, it's a blatant indication of how they don't respect you. Tell them this! It cuts into your productivity, it's rude, and above all it's completely unnecessary. After the talk, straight up ask them if they are going to be late the next time you have plans. Have they heard you loud and clear?


There are ways to point out things that bother you about your friends without hurting them. Keep your tone level and your words neutral. Use ""I"" statements and smile.

, If you are upset about them being late all the time, chances are there is something that you do that bothers them just as much. Be fair and let them critique you too. That will even the playing field and help you deal.

, Never let the late guy be responsible for transportation or carry the opera tickets. An already irritating situation can take a turn for the worst when the guy with the birthday cake is late and isn't answering his phone.


If they ask for responsibility, be honest! They need to get in gear if they want to be a part of the action.

, If you have a group of friends that hangs out all the time and cutting the one person out because they're always late isn't really an option, get crafty. Come up with something like, ""Whoever is late has to pick up the check."" If the entire group agrees on it, it could be incentive to change!"

Maintain a “poker” face.,
Cut off direct eye contact.,
Turn your body away from them.,
Walk away.,
Avoid the person.",How to Deal With Rude People2," Do not show any emotion. Even if you feel yourself getting angry, annoyed, or irritated, don’t give them what they want by showing that their rudeness is getting to you.


Stay calm and collected. Close your eyes and take a deep breath if you feel yourself losing your temper.
Keep a straight face or try going for a “blank” look on your face, disengaging completely from the person and showing them they are not worth your time.

, When you make eye contact, you are acknowledging the person and validating their actions. Look away from them and gaze straight ahead at something in the distance.


Avoiding looking down at the ground. This type of body language comes off as submissive and unconfident. Keeping your gaze up and steady makes you look self-assured and in control., You can convey a lot through your body language alone. Turn your shoulders and feet to point in the opposite direction. Cross your arms in front of your body to look closed off and disengaged.

, If possible, walk quickly in the opposite direction from them and don’t look back. Stand up tall and look confident as you are walking.If you feel awkward not saying anything before walking away, keep your response short. This will acknowledge that you’ve heard what they’ve said but don’t agree with it. You can just say something like, “OK” or “I don’t know” before turning away.
If a classmate keeps rubbing in your face that he or she got a perfect score on his last exam, just smile and say, ""That's nice.” Then turn your or her attention to other, more important things.
If it’s someone that you know you will have to interact with again, like a coworker or friend, walking away from a few minutes can give them some space to calm down. Hopefully when you meet again, they will have changed their behavior.

, Keep your distance from the rude person so that their negativity does not bog you down on a regular basis.If the person is a stranger, this should be easy - you will likely never have to see them again.
If you really can’t stand the person but tend to run into them on a daily basis, try to limit contact with them as much as possible. If it's possible for you to switch offices or make some other change to avoid running into this person, take that step. It will definitely help to not have them in your presence."

Know what qualifies as stalking.,
Determine the type of stalker you have.,
Sense how much danger you are in.,
Be observant.",How to Deal With Stalkers1," Stalking is a type of harassment, which is the act of making repeated or inappropriate contact with you that is unwanted and unreciprocated.Stalking may take place in-person, with someone following you, spying on you, or approaching you at your home or workplace.
The following may be signs of stalking: receiving unwanted gifts, being followed, receiving unwanted mail or email messages, receiving unwanted or repetitive phone calls.
Stalking can also occur online, in the form of cyber-stalking or cyber-bullying. These types of contact can be difficult to prosecute, but you may be able to avoid this harassment more easily by changing your online privacy settings or email address.
Any instance of cyber-stalking that then transitions into in-person stalking should be considered very serious and should be reported immediately.;
, Some types of stalkers are more dangerous than others, and knowing the type of stalker you are dealing with can help you notify the police appropriately and defend yourself if necessary.Most stalkers are known as simple stalkers. These are individuals who you know that you may have had a romantic or friendly relationship in the past. The relationship ended for you, but not for the other person.
Love obsession stalkers are individuals who you have never met (or very casual acquaintances) who latch onto you and think that they are in a relationship with you. People who stalk celebrities are in this category.
Stalkers who have a psychotic fantasy about a relationship with their victims will often turn from unwanted attention to threats or intimidation. When this fails, they may escalate to violence.
Sometimes the abuser in an abusive relationship or marriage becomes a stalker, following his ex and watching from afar, then moving closer, and eventually repeating or escalating violent attacks. This can be one of the most dangerous stalkers.

, A casual acquaintance who develops an obsession and drives by your residence occasionally or often may be ultimately harmless. An abusive ex-husband who has threatened you may try to kill you if you let your guard down.If you are being stalked online, decide whether it is likely that the stalker has any information about your real-life whereabouts. Be sure to maintain a secure online presence and never reveal your home address or even your hometown on public pages.
You should trust your instincts, be cognizant of the history of the person’s behavior (if you are aware of it), and be realistic about the danger you’re in.
If you truly feel like you or your family members are in danger, you should seek help at your local police or sheriff’s office or with a victim’s services organization.
If you think danger is imminent, call Emergency Services immediately.

, If you believe that you are being stalked, you should be extra observant of your surroundings. Notice anyone acting strangely or unknown vehicles in your neighborhood or near your workplace. Be sure to take notes about anything you observe that seems unusual.

Let people know how you feel.,
Sit upwind.,
Compromise.,
Get plenty of vitamin C and stay well hydrated.,
Keep mints on hand at all times.,
Some cigarillos have rather pleasant scents like vanilla or cinnamon and can be bought at convenient stores.,
Be clear about your philosophy.",How to Deal With Smokers when You Are a Non Smoker," Believe it or not, your friends and acquaintances have no wish to make you miserable. Most people are very willing to leave the room or rub out their cigarette if it's really making you uncomfortable.;
, If you don't feel comfortable asking people not to smoke, at least ask them to keep the smoke from wafting your direction. Be polite or funny about this, especially if you don't know them that well.

, Promise you won't complain about the smoke at bars, just as long as no one smokes during mealtimes.

, Second hand smoke can lower your immune system. Vitamin C can help counteract its effects, and water can soothe your dry throat.

, The only thing worse than smoke is smoker's breath. Many smokers are very aware of this and are stocked up with eclipse mints, but not everyone is this self-aware. Buy the small, potent, sugar-free kind and pass those puppies around.

, If you desperately need a night off from the stench, buy a couple of these for your friends and guilt them into using them. They may even see this as a treat.

, If you're going to ask those around you to go out of their way for your comfort, be very clear about the reasons their smoking bugs you and don't do anything inconsistent with that logic. It'll just give them more excuses to smoke. (If this is the case for you, do not buy them cigarillos or any other tobacco product!)

Examine your feelings.,
Figure out why.,
Trust yourself.",How to Get Your Boyfriend to Hang Out With You1," Write about your frustrations, or talk to a trustworthy friend. Perhaps you feel neglected, or frustrated, or insecure – or all of these things. Try to determine whether he is truly failing to keep up his end of the relationship agreement, or whether you are holding him up to unrealistic expectations. Think about how your feelings have changed over time, and consider whether this problem is symptomatic of any other problems in your relationship.;
, Think about your relationship, and think back to all of the times you've seen your boyfriend recently. Try to understand why he isn't hanging out with you as much as you'd like. It can be much easier to find a solution once you fully understand what's wrong. Keep in mind that speculation will only take you so far. The best way to understand the problem is to ask your boyfriend about it.


Perhaps your boyfriend is very busy with work right now, or he's stressed out about another pressure in his life. He might not feel like he can relax and hang out right now. Be patient.
Maybe your boyfriend isn't putting equal energy into your relationship. If you are always making time for him, but he never makes time for you: it might be time for a change. Don't let him take advantage of you.Your boyfriend may be perfectly happy in the relationship, but completely unaware that you are feeling neglected. Try telling him how you feel and asking him to spend more time with you.

, There is nothing wrong with wanting to see more of someone that you care about – especially if you are ""going out"" and you've made a commitment to spend time with each other. Do not think of yourself as ""needy"" or ""clingy"" just because you want to hang out with your boyfriend. The important thing is that you both have the same expectations for the relationship.

Don't give the attention seekers the attention.,
Begin distancing yourself from such persons and their parades.,
Beware deliberate attempts to undermine you when it becomes clear you're no longer going to be supportive.,
Ignore continued lies and tell people the truth.,
Let others take care of the drama.,
Find forgiveness.",How to Get Rid of Attention Seekers," That's all they want. They just want drama. They want to be the center attention. Don't give it to them. Learn to burst their balloons every time they raise the drama by not responding in kind.


Be aware that attention seekers find every way possible to share the drama around and draw attention to themselves. This includes going onto social media accounts, gossiping and being self-absorbed face-to-face, making phone calls, posting constant selfies and sending emails. All of these approaches can be responded to, or not, as you choose.;
, Sound and look serious when distancing yourself from the attention seeker. You need to be serious about withdrawing your supporting act for their dramas. If they think you're not being serious because you don't look and sound like that, they won't believe that you really aren't going to keep on being their for their every new drama. Ways to start removing yourself include:


Not agreeing with the person when he or she needles you to agree that what they're going through is worse/better/scarier/more momentous than anything else possible.
Actively disagreeing with broad-sweeping statements that they make about things not going well, by pointing out what is going right.
Staying calm at all times, not raising your voice and not buying into the fear or anxiety that they're trying to promote.
Failing to turn up when called, asked for or begged for. Refuse to be the lapdog who quickly turns up to console the poor dear.
Politely mention that less complaining tends to result in enjoying life somewhat more.
Suggest that budgetary/medical/psychological or decluttering help might be the only real solution to the problems that constantly ail this person. Then provide the phone number of a reputable professional and refuse to engage any further.
If the person keeps annoying you, mention something along the lines of ""Confidence is silent, insecurities are loud"", then leave it at that.

, The person will eventually find out, and may be tempted to tell lies about you. So watch out for lies. If they say ""(Your name) is gossiping about me!"" or ""(Your name) called me a so and so!"", deny it, as you should because you haven't. You're telling the truth and they're being an attention seeker.


If you get in trouble, walk up to that person and say ""I'm not gossiping about you. All you want is attention and if you think that lying is an appropriate way to get people to listen, then I'm really not interested anymore."" Or, if this is because this person is wanting attention to make you look bad, tell the person he or she likes the truth. Say something like this: ""If you don't stop, I'm going to give you what you deserve, no friends."" You may sound mean, but that's what they deserve. ""If this is what you're going to do, I'm going to tell everyone to stop being your friend if all you want is attention.""

, Give this attention seeker what she or he deserves. You might sound like an attention seeker yourself for a time, but you're doing the right thing by reiterating your innocence. Giving them a taste of the truth for a change. Ultimately, you're after respect, not attention, so by not playing the game anymore, you are the stronger person.


Tell people who are good friends with this person that all the person wants is attention. They might not believe you, but give true reasons, do not embellish or fall into the trap of lying as well. If all you want to do is make this person look bad, you're an attention seeker too. Remind yourself that all the reasons this person seeks attention for are all the reasons why they no longer have yours.
Don't strive to make your presence felt, as the drama queen or king does. Instead, be reassured that this person notices your absence. You matter, either with or without this person in your life.

, It's probable that she or he will find a new cohort of friends willing to lap up the drama. But think of the peace and calm that has descended upon you and your life. It's now time to go and find friends who have their feet firmly planted on the ground and who don't have the slightest interest in playing victim, showering forth resentment or yelling wolf every time they want people to come running.

, This may seem strange after distancing yourself and trying to be the stronger person but forgiveness sets both of you free. Be compassionate about why the person is an attention-seeker, as a way of understanding, then letting go of their hold over you. It's time to move on.

Avoid contact with your stalker.,
Avoid unintentional signs or messages.,
Hide your personal information.,
Get a protective order.,
Move to an undisclosed location.",How to Deal With Stalkers2," Stalkers often feel as though they are in a relationship with their victims, and any contact the victims make with them is perceived as validation of their “relationship,” which is nonexistent. If you are being stalked, do not call, write to, or speak to your stalker in person if you can avoid it at all.

, Sometimes stalking victims yell at or talk to their stalkers, but even overt rudeness can be misconstrued by stalkers (who are frequently mentally disturbed) as communication of affection or interest.


If you are being stalked online, do not respond in any way to any messages, regardless of how angry you become. Just print them for evidence and leave the computer.

, If a stalker does not have personal information about you such as your phone number, home address, or email address, do not let him find it.Do not give your home phone number aloud to anyone in public places. If you find that you must provide a phone number, try using a work phone instead, or writing the number down then shredding it.
Avoid putting your home address in writing. In cases of extreme stalking, you may want to get a PO Box for your mailing address so that it’s less likely that you will need to provide anyone with your home address.
Do not share your home address or place of work online or on social media. This may give an online stalker the opportunity to find you in person.

, In cases of repeated stalking or stalkers with a history of violence, you may be able to get an order of protection which legally requires the stalker to stay away from you. Be aware, however, that this could potentially anger the stalker and push him to violence.

, In very extreme cases of potentially violent stalking, you may decide to move to a new place. If you do so, you may want to consult an organization such as a battered women’s shelter for tips about how to make yourself truly disappear.


Do not have your mail forwarded directly to your new home.
Be careful when registering to vote in a new place. You can request anonymous registration.
If you purchase property, your name may be on the public record as the land’s owner. Sometimes these records are tied to searchable databases, so you may want to rent to remain more anonymous.

Tell a variety of people about your problem.,
Report stalking and threats to the police.,
Report the stalking to other appropriate individuals.,
Alert your family about the danger.,
Seek help from an organization devoted to stalking or violence prevention.,
Make a safety plan.,
Have a security check done on your home.",How to Deal With Stalkers3," While you may not want to post on social media or announce to a large crowd of people that you have a stalker, it is important to tell enough people that if something were to happen, you may have witnesses. You may want to tell your parents, your boss, a co-worker or two, your spouse, your neighbors, and the office management or doorman if you live in an apartment building.


If possible, show people a photograph of your stalker. If not, give them a detailed description.
Tell people what they should do if they see the stalker with or without you being around. Should they call you? Call the police? Tell the stalker to leave?

, Even if the stalking has been from a distance and non-violent, you may want to tell the police about it.


Be sure to include any and all signs of stalking, as many police departments need to have evidence of at least 2-3 unwanted contacts before they can charge someone with stalking.
Be aware that the authorities may not be able to do anything until the stalking has escalated to or near the point of threats or violence.
Ask them what you should do to keep track of incidents, when and how to call for help if necessary, and if they have any tips for developing a safety plan.
Call the police frequently if you feel as though they do not take your complaint seriously at first., If you are a student, you should notify campus authorities about stalking. This may be a campus police officer, administrator, counselor, or residence hall director.


If you are unsure who you should tell, start with a trusted friend or family member who can likely help you find the proper authorities.

, If you are in danger, your family may also be in danger. You need to tell them about the problem and about how to deal with the problem.


If you have children, this may be a difficult conversation to have with them, but it may save their lives.
If the stalker is a member of your family, this may cause division among other family members. While this can be difficult, remember that you are protecting yourself, and the stalker is the one who is responsible for his illegal actions.

, If you feel uncomfortable talking to friends, family, or the police, try calling a resource that deals specifically with violence prevention. There are resources, particularly for women and children, that can provide counseling and help you make a plan., If you feel that the stalking might escalate, you need to have a safety plan. This may be something as simple as keeping your phone with you 100% of the time to call for help or keeping a packed bag and a full tank of gas in your car.Try to avoid being alone in vulnerable situations, like walking to and from your workplace or home, particularly at night.Be sure you tell a trusted friend your safety plan. You may also want to have a “check-in” plan, where if she has not heard from you by a pre-arranged time, she calls you and then the police if she can’t contact you.

, Security companies or your police department may offer to carry out a security check on your home to be sure that there are no hidden recording devices or potential entry risks.


When you schedule the check, ask the person with whom you schedule the appointment to give a physical description of the individual who will be performing the check on your home.
Ask the person performing the check for his or her credentials when they arrive.

"
Keep anything in writing.,
Record phone calls or voicemails.,
Be observant all the time.,
Write notes in a journal.,
Watch for any changes in behavior or escalation.",How to Deal With Stalkers4," If you receive any emails, social media messages, hand-written notes, or gifts, keep them. Your first instinct may be to destroy anything related to the stalker who is making you uncomfortable, but it is best to keep the evidence in case you need to build a case against him.


Print any electronic correspondence. Be sure that details such as date and time print as well.
Keeping the items doesn’t mean that you have to look at them. Place them in a box and keep it in a high shelf in your closet or basement.

, You can download call recording programs for your smart phone or put the call on speakerphone and use an old-fashioned tape recorder. Be sure to save voicemails with threatening or violent content so that you can report them to the authorities.

, Unfortunately, one of the best strategies for dealing with a stalker is being a bit paranoid and not letting down your guard. If you are a little bit paranoid, you are more likely to pick up on subtle signs of inappropriate contact or escalating behaviors.

, If you ever need to make a case for a restraining order or file a police report, it will be much easier to do if you have detailed, specific records of stalking activity that made you uncomfortable.


Be sure to include dates and time.
The journal could also be used to determine habitual behavior and possibly catch or avoid your stalker.

, Stalkers can get violent very quickly. If you start to see signs or even have a general feeling that things are about to escalate, notify the authorities and ask for help. A few potential signs of escalation are:


Increased frequency of contact or attempted contact
Increased severity of threats
Increased display of emotion or stronger words
Physically closer encounters
Increased contact with other friends or relatives

"
"
Tell the stalker that you are not interested in a relationship.,
Be sure he knows that you will never be interested in a relationship.,
Do not use emotionally colored language.,
Ask for support during this communication.,
Do not engage a stalker with a history of violence.",How to Deal With Stalkers5," If you believe that your stalker is nonviolent and will back down with confrontation, you might try speaking to him directly.Telling the person who is stalking you that you are not interested in any kind of relationship with him might make him back off.


Consider having another person present to help protect you in case of escalation to violence and to act as a witness to the conversation.
Try not to be too nice with your rejection. Being nice to a stalker can unwittingly encourage him, and he may try to “read between the lines” and listen to your tone rather than your words.

, If you believe that your stalker is nonviolent and will back down with confrontation, be sure to tell him that a relationship will never happen. Saying that you’re not interested in a relationship “at this time” or “because you have a boyfriend right now” leaves the window open for future relationships and may not deter the stalker. Be clear that you do not—and you will never, under any circumstances—want a relationship.

, If you are frightened or angry, it can be difficult to have a conversation with your stalker.It is important to remain as calm as possible, avoid yelling or cussing, and be clear and direct. Anger may be misinterpreted as passion, just as sympathy or niceness may be misinterpreted as affection.

, It is best not to have this conversation alone. Ask someone for help, but you may want to be sure that any friend you bring with you to the conversation will not be perceived as a threat or competition. You may want to include a friend who is the same gender as you, as long as you both feel safe confronting the stalker.

, If you have experienced violence at the hands of the stalker, or if he has threatened you, you should not try to contact or talk to him on your own. Consult the police department or victim services about the best way to send a clear message to a violent stalker.

Talk to your boyfriend.,
Listen to your boyfriend.,
Ask him to hang out with you.",How to Get Your Boyfriend to Hang Out With You2," Tell him that you want to hang out with him more often. Explain how you feel about the situation, but try not to be accusatory. He might not be experienced with relationships, and he might not even realize that you are upset with how things are going. Sometimes, getting onto the same page is enough to solve the problem.

, Ask him how he feels. Try to find out if there's a reason that he isn't hanging out with you as much as he used to. Be patient. Let him explain his side of the story.


Although you should not necessarily blame yourself, it's possible that you're doing something to put him off. This doesn't mean that you need to change. However, it might help you understand what's wrong.

, The most important thing, once you have explained your feelings and listened to your boyfriend's perspective, is to simply get your boyfriend alone. Set a date in the near future, and hold him to it. This doesn't need to be anything fancy – it could just mean setting aside an hour to go for a walk together.


If your boyfriend declines your invitation without a good reason, and does not offer an alternate time – it might be time to reconsider the relationship. It is neither fair nor healthy for you to pour your energy into someone who doesn't want to spend time with you.

Be positive when you're together.,
Find activities that you both enjoy doing together.,
Be kind and open.,
Compromise.,
Know when to end it.",How to Get Your Boyfriend to Hang Out With You3," You don't need to fake cheeriness, but try not to get bogged down in worrying about the particulars of your relationship. Let your time together be easy, fun, and stress-free. If you and your boyfriend only ever talk about the heavy stuff, he may have formed negative associations around hanging out with you. That said: if you need to talk about these things, you may as well let them out., Whether it's a walk, a trip to the beach, or a movie night – find something that you both can get excited about. Consider what he's into lately, and what he might most want to spend his time on. Think back to where you met him and what the two of you did together at the beginning of your relationship. Find common ground.


If you aren't sure, you might need to take a more active approach. Try as many different things as you can until you find a few that you both enjoy.
Think about what he does with his friends. You don't need to do these things, and you shouldn't cut completely into his friend time – but it might help to understand where his time is going.

, Engage with his thoughts and feelings while still being true to your own. Be considerate, and don't force him to do things that make him comfortable. Don't try to make him jealous or stressed-out just so that he will hang out with you.

, When you are hanging out together, try to strike a balance between what you want to do and what he wants to do. Sometimes, you might have to spend time doing something that bores you in order to be around him. If you do things that your boyfriend likes doing, he may be much more open to spending time with you when you're doing things that he doesn't enjoy.


For example: Say that you hate baseball, but your boyfriend loves it – and you love going to museums, but your boyfriend can't stand them. Make an agreement: if you go to a baseball game, he'll accompany you to a museum!

, Check back in periodically to see if things have improved. If you find your boyfriend spending more time with you in an enjoyable way, then you should keep doing what you're doing. However: if he still isn't spending time with you despite your best efforts, then it might be time to end things. You may simply not have common interests; he may not like you as much as you think; or he may just generally not spend much time with his partners. Whatever the case, he's clearly not giving you the attention you need – so if you aren't comfortable, you might consider leaving him."

You start watching football because your boyfriend is into it, or you watch drama movies because that’s all your girlfriend wants to watch. If you feel like everything about you is changing, there might be a problem.

Ask yourself if you’re compromising your values, opinions, or clothing preferences for your partner.
Remember who you were before the relationship, and consider how that differs from your current state.;
, Not everyone is going to like your significant other as much as you do, but if multiple people close to you raise concerns, it might be time to listen.

, A relationship should be mutual in all aspects, so the big decisions should be made by both people.


If you are constantly going where he wants to on dates or visiting his family and friends, you need to think about why.
If your girlfriend never wants to go to parties, go out for dates, or always makes you stay in, you need to consider if this is the kind of relationship you want.

, Your significant other should not control every aspect of your life. In a relationship you will want to be around your partner; however, you should still be an individual.


If your significant other starts to restrict who you hang out with or how much you see your family, consider this a warning sign.
Telling you what type of clothes to wear, restricting the music you listen to, or deciding who you are allowed to be friends with are examples of controlling behavior.

, Mutual trust is an important component of a relationship. Without it, relationships easily turn bad.

Constant questions are an indication of a lack of trust.
Jealousy about hanging out with others is a trust issue.

, Constructive criticism from your partner can be helpful, but it should not be a constant in your relationship. You shouldn’t be put down every time you are around your partner, and you shouldn’t always be the butt of the joke.

If you’re hearing criticism about the way you look or your personality, this is a warning sign of a bad relationship.
Constant criticism indicates an unhealthy relationship.

, Ask a trusted friend or family member if you can spend some time with them after you cut ties in the relationship. Having someone close to you provide support will help you feel better about your decision.


If your relationship has had a history of abuse, it is important to let someone know your plans to help provide you with safety following the break up.

, To be able to succeed at ending a bad relationship, you need to have a plan in place. Creating a plan of action can help you hold yourself accountable to follow through. The most successful plan is one with specific implementation intentions, or if/then statements.

”If I start to miss my ex, then I will call a friend to go hang out.”
”If I begin to regret my decision, then I will write out a list of the reasons I left.”
”If I become depressed over the break-up, then I will seek out help.”

, Prepare yourself for when you are going to end the relationship.

Large social gatherings may create embarrassing scenarios for a break-up.
Consider meeting in a quiet public space to avoid confrontations.

, Be blunt and direct. When ending a relationship, it is best to be to the point about your intentions. Tell your partner how you feel in person, rather than calling or texting, to help you process what is happening and show you mean what you are saying.


Make sure you stick to the facts so you aren’t caught up in emotions: ""I have been unhappy with our relationship lately, and it's time to end things between us.""Deliver the message in a calm, direct voice so your significant other knows you are serious about the decision: ""I am breaking up with you.""
If you are afraid of your significant other having a violent reaction to the relationship ending, you should not meet in person or alone. In this case a phone call would be the better option.

, Once you’ve ended the relationship, you will need to stay away from the person you left. Bad relationships are often mentally tough to leave; make it easier on yourself by ending contact with the person so you aren’t tempted to get back together.


Delete your ex on all social media accounts.
Take your ex’s phone number out of your phone.
Go to different places for entertainment where you won’t see your ex.
Ask your friends not to talk about your ex to help you create distance.

, After getting out of a toxic relationship, it is important to surround yourself with the right kind of people. You need to be around someone who will build you up and remind you that you did the right thing.

, When a relationship ends, it’s easy to fall into the trap of dwelling on what you could have done better to change your ex. Know that no matter how much you think about the past, it won’t change.

Learn from the relationship rather than regretting it.
Be kind to yourself. Try not to overthink the reasons why the relationship went bad. Focusing on the past will only hinder you from thinking about the future.

, You shouldn’t feel bad about a failed relationship. Many people beat themselves up for not seeing the signs of a bad relationship, but this kind of thinking will only make you feel worse.

Forgive yourself by stating it aloud or writing it down.
Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and you can learn lessons from the failed relationship.

, It’s easy to lose track of your true interests when you have been in a bad relationship. Now you have time to rediscover yourself revive your interests or seek new ones.

Take a class in something you used to enjoy learning about.
Join a club.
Pick up a hobby from your past.

, When it’s too hard to process the break-up by yourself, you might need to have some help. Ask for help from friends or family; talk with people who are close to you when you are feeling down.

Don’t feel ashamed if you need to ask for help. Many people find themselves in the same place, and professional help gets them back on their feet.
Use your family and friends for emotional support to help rebuild yourself after a bad relationship.

, If your ex is harassing or intimidating you, get in touch with the local police to request a restraining order. Reach out to shelters or support groups if you feel threatened or endangered.

Remember that he is your friend.,
Make him see the value of your friendship: Talk about your boyfriend, commiserate with him over your life dramas, make it clear that you are absolutely comfortable with him because, to you, he is sexless.,
Let him see the negative side of you: You might be prone to gossiping, hate children, really messy or you swear way too much.,
Decline invitations to go out to dinner or anything resembling a date with just the two of you.,
Meeting for coffee after class or work is fine, but don't do it too often.,
Lead by example: Be a good friend to him, but don't go too far.,
If he started this whole mess by declaring his feelings, be kind, but firm.",How to Get Him Into the Friend Zone," He will only ever be your friend: The key here is to be oblivious. When he starts dropping hints about how good you two would be together, just shrug it off with a laugh. If he tells you about how much he likes a 'girl,' but she does not seem to notice, just nod sympathetically and say ""that sucks"" or ""that's too bad, you really deserve better."" Then, quickly change the subject.;
, He will start to realise that you value him as a confidante and he will be even more reluctant to wreck things by needlessly confessing his feelings.

, When guys fall in love or 'like' they put the girl on a pedestal. To him, everything about you is perfect. You must destroy this pedestal and quickly. This could mean really embarrassing things like letting him see you without makeup (if you always wear it) or tell an inconvenient truth like ""I can't wait to move away after school/college/this job finishes and travel. I'd hate to get tied down!"" Pretty much do the opposite of what you would do or say to a guy you have a crush on.

, Just say you're too busy or you might be feeling really sick or you've already made plans. If he's really persistent, you might have to be cruel to be kind. Tell him you're going on a date.

, Regular outings like shopping or team sports is great; that's the sort of thing you do with your regular friends.

, If he is upset or angry or hurt, you are welcome to comfort him. Avoid hugging or anything too emotionally attached.

, Tell him the dreaded ""I'm sorry, but I only like you as a friend."" Let him lick his wounds then practice steps 2-6 consistently. If he is still persistent, then its time to stop seeing him for a while.

Start by saying ""hi"" and only that.,
DO NOT laugh of his/her jokes.,
Walk away.,
Lunch time is tricky.,
Nature's calling as a result of dehydration.,
When being around ignorant people, one may often be exposed to a lot of unnecessary and uninteresting topics.,
Make an agreement with your friends where and when to meet, so when the bell rings you run, as fast as you can, to the meeting spot and disappear from the surface of earth, incognito is the clue and a secret wall would to the rest.,
Play hide and seek, without them even knowing.,
Be the hipster.,
Ignore.",How to Get Rid of Annoying Persons in Your Life," DO NOT encourage the person to talk and unless you are being talked to, keep your mouth closed and do not utter a single syllable. IF this person has some form of social intelligence, which should not be the case or else this would not have happened, he/she will take the hint and drift away, but as mentioned, the case is probably some what more complex than that;
, IF by chance they are funny, hold your tongue, turn away your head or simply eat something, to keep yourself from laughing. A laugh is an invitation, the opposite of what you seek. This, indeed, might be hard, especially if you have a bad sense of humor, but try at least and stuffing something in your mouth helps a lot. STAY AWAY FROM WATER! you will only choke yourself.

, Always. See them in the hallway? AVOID EYE CONTACT and quickly walk away. Run if you have to. if they ask you why, say you forgot to do something or have to print out some school stuff, find an excuse or two or ten. Whatever you do, DO NOT STOP.

, If he/she sits at your table, exclude him/her, not to be rude, because if you are talked to, remember to answer,. But simply do not give this person any opportunity to interfere. Talk about intern things you and your friends did last week, or some funny stuff that happened on the way home etc. Whatever it is, make a big deal about it and keep the conversation eloquent. as long as you guys are talking, they cannot randomly interrupt you.

, One can never get enough fluids. Excuse yourself and run to the nearest water-fountain, claiming you're suffering from dehydration. Since the water at the 3rd floor is clearly infected with poisonous calcium, you have no other choice but to go down all the way to the 1st floor. You can take your time because of all the stairs and claim as a result, that you need to use the little lady's room due to a high intake of h2o.... as if that didn't take enough time, there was a long queue and you could not go up all the way to the 4th floor because the toilets there do not work...

, what better way is there to get them to stop talking, when one completely disagrees with everything they say? this may be fun for you and so very annoying for them, which truly is a win-win situation for yourself. this also gives one a great opportunity to be as ridiculous and objectifying as possible. warning!: this may lead to people thinking that you may be uneducated, but that is a small price to pay if this results in people staying away because you are clearly not able to have a normal conversation without disagreeing.

, BUT, if one of you fail, the person MUST somehow let the others know and shake the clingy person off. how? Well, excuses, excuses. Tell him/her you have to use the bathroom and are going to stay for a long time. unless this person is invalid or something, he/she will most probably not follow. then you have clear sight, and can find your friends. just remember to say that you met some one in the hall and had to finish this project you forgot about! silly you!

, A very efficient way, indeed. Eat your lunch in the most creative places. You and your friends can eat out, eat in the gym, eat on the roof, eat in a tree, eat in a stairway, in the hallway, in the classroom, in the computer room, wherever! Use your imagination, but remember, do not seek the same places everyday. Never underestimate your enemies. They can figure out and then you are screwed. So remember to alter between the places you seek and be unpredictable.

, Never agree to anything he/she says. ""the weather is beautiful today!"", they might say. What do you do? Disagree. ""you think so? it way to hot. I hate the sun. I prefer rainy days..."" here you might sound emo, but hey, do you want to get rid of the person or not? so act cool, disagree and hold your mask.

, ignore, ignore and ignore. ""whoops, did not see you in the hallway! to busy with my...hair!"" IGNORE as much as you can. IF all of the other steps fail, this one might just save you. ignorance is what makes us feel unwanted. so if all of the ""nice and discrete""-steps fail, this one is doomed to succeed!

Remind him you don't like it if he forgets.,
Discuss the consequences.,
Turn on the sass if he brushes you off.,
Ignore it.,
Recognize that your feelings are valid.,
Consider whether a catcalling guy is worth your time as a boyfriend.,
Consider reading up on feminist theory and anti-catcalling projects.",How to Get Your Boyfriend to Stop Wolf Whistling," Explain to your boyfriend that you find this annoying and you want him to stop. Your negative feelings should be enough for a good boyfriend to stop treating you that way. Here are some examples of ways to broach the idea:""I feel very uncomfortable when you wolf whistle at other people. It makes me feel like you don’t respect me.""
""Please don't do that. I don't like it.""
""Please stop wolf whistling. It makes me feel on edge."";
, If wolf whistling and catcalling is absolutely unacceptable to you, tell him that. He needs to know that you won’t tolerate this kind of behavior and that you will consider leaving if it continues.


Try saying something like, “I love you, but I refuse to allow you to wolf whistle. If you continue with this degrading behavior, I’ll have no other choice than to leave.”

, If he's used to wolf whistling and other forms of catcalling, he might need some time to remember that it's rude. Acknowledge a good-faith effort and encourage him to keep trying.A habit can take a while to break, so give him some time to adapt.

, Tell your boyfriend that in many places and cultures, wolf whistling (and other forms of catcalling) are considered hate crimes. They can make people feel uncomfortable and unsafe. And this kind of behavior can be punished by the authorities in many parts of the world.Your boyfriend probably doesn’t want to go to jail or be prosecuted for a hate crime. If you live somewhere where catcalling is considered a hate crime, bring this to your boyfriend's attention.

, If a little attitude is your style, you can try creative ways to make it clear that you aren't okay with his gross behavior. Come up with a clever retort to get him thinking.Try wolf whistling back at him to give him a taste of his own medicine.
Consider saying something like: “I’m sure your attention is totally the highlight of her day.”

, If possible, ignore the wolf whistling and don’t let it get to you. If you have talked to your boyfriend about it and he continues to do it, then decide if you can live with it or not. If not, consider breaking up with him. If it is not that important to you, then stay with him and just tell him you don’t like it every time he does it in front of you.Sometimes it’s better to just ignore the behavior than to get in a big confrontation about it.

, Wolf whistling is a form of catcalling that makes many women feel reduced to sex objects. It's not a compliment and this behavior on the street can cause victims to fear for their safety. Wanting to not experience harassment is well within your rights as a human being.Don’t try to minimize your feelings or get used to his behavior if it makes you uncomfortable.
Wolf whistling is a way for guys to exert power over women, which is why they often do it to show off around friends., A boyfriend who insists on inappropriate and classless behavior, even after you've asked him to stop, is not a boyfriend who respects your comfort levels and opinions. If he refuses to treat you with respect, it may be time to dump him.Don’t rush to any conclusions. But if he isn’t willing to take your feelings into consideration about this, then he will probably ignore your feelings about other issues as well.

, There are quite a few anti-catcalling movements that are active now, such as Hollaback and #YouOkSis. Reading up on these projects will help you better understand the importance of anti-catcalling movements.Read works by feminist theorists like Simone de Beauvoir, Betty Friedan, Elaine Showalter, and Julia Kristen if you would like to get a broader scope of feminist theory.

When people are all worked up and there blood boils the mind becomes fueled by adrenaline, which causes a chemical response known as the ""flight or fight"" response. Which is a primitive part of the brain early humans used to fight off predators and avoid becoming a meal. Our brain tends to overreact to a non threatening situation , which prevents people from making rational decisions. We can say or do hurtful things in the heat of the moment. So remember to take a deep breath and think about what you are going to say, and how is what you are going to say or do effect you later on. Could it hurt someone , could that be used against you in the future , could it make you look immature. These are some of the things that you want to think about before saying or doing anything rash.;
, Men can be very prideful creatures and the last thing you want to do is to emasculate him, make him feel unappreciated, or disrespected, Which can lead to pent up emotions and resentment. Keeping your ears open to what he has to say really shows that you value him and his opinion. Let him say his peace before you react. Not listening means its ""your way or the highway"" and that's disrespectful. When you don't listen it shows that your relationship is a one way road and his opinions do not matter. So listen before you speak.

, A relationship is supposed to be an equal partnership and you have every right to say what you feel. This part can be a little tricky since emotions can cause us to react in an aggressive or defensive way. Remember that you are both hurt and both need to say what you are feeling. Try using ""I"" statements like ""I feel offended that you....."" . Instead of using ""its all your fault"". Do not use condemning words like ""you are"" or ""your so inconsiderate, these statements can cause someone to react in a defensive way causing the fight to escalate.

, Feelings of resentment can destroy a relationship and create feelings of hostility and anger towards one another. So apologize for what you have done and make sure it is a genuine apology.

, Try to put yourself in his shoes. We all think and act in different ways. Just because you would say this or do that does not mean everyone else would do the same. Understanding can be an easier road to forgiving one for there actions and words.

, Forgiveness is a true characteristic of strength, because it is difficult to forgive yourself let alone another person for what they have done to you. Only forgive when you truly feel like you have gotten over the ordeal. People can forgive, but some never forget which brings up future fights and causes strain in a relationship. So make sure that you work through your problem before moving on.

, Part of being in a relationship is having that closeness and trust. After having a fight your emotions may feel drained , and part of having a healthy relationship is being open with each other. So after having a fight let your emotions poor out, cry, laugh, and reminisce on old times with each other. Tell him how much you adore him, how much you love his smile. This is a great way to remind you of the reasons you are together, and he might just let his guard down as well. This practice strengthens the bond and helps ease the hurt of a previous fight.

, Sometimes a fight cannot be resolved. If things become violent or escalate to a dangerous situation back away, to avoid hurting or getting hurt. In some cases all somebody needs is a little space to clear and organize there thoughts in order to resolve the situation. So know when to back away and give yourself and others space.

, In times of stress people need people. Sometimes we need the opinions of others to battle our own irrational thoughts and behaviours. Don't do anything stupid take the thoughts and opinions by family and friends with a grain of salt you don't want to be lead astray by others. Go to someone you trust and respect.

, Sometimes relationships are not meant to be and this can be one of the hardest things in life to recover from. Heart break can hurt but it is best to take the steps in realizing that you are not meant to be. If you really love the person you can try to make it work, after all relationships do not happen effortlessly, but there are something's you cannot control or make work and it is better to let go. For example if the person is drug addicted, violent, or simply moves away the best thing to do is to let go and know that you should be number one in your life and your well-being and safety come first.

, Recovery from a broken heart takes time and should never be expected to happen overnight. It is good to surround yourself with friends and family. You should talk about your hurt and pain with others. Avoid sitting in your room all day that can worsen your depression. Go out and do things, waking up everyday with a purpose and goals helps to put your mind to more productive tasks. Keeping your social life up is also refreshing and renewing and can help those stagnant negative thoughts from building up. Maintaining your appearance and hygiene still show that you care about yourself so keep it up. There are many other ways to recover from a broken heart. Be strong and love yourself.

Make time for her.",How to Gain Her Trust," If you’ve given her a reason to distrust you, such as cheating on her, being shady with other girls, talking about her behind her back, or just doing something to make her think that your intentions are less than pure, then the most important thing you should do is to give her an apology that is genuine and sincere. Look her in the eyes, put away all distractions, and make it clear that you recognize that you’ve made a huge mistake and want to make it up to her.


Don’t make excuses for why you were disloyal or hurt her feelings. Instead, focus on how much you regret it and how there’s no way you’ll do it again.
Saying, “I’m sorry you’re so upset” makes it sound like you’re blaming her. Instead, say, “I’m so sorry that I acted like a real jerk. I take full responsibility.”
Of course, no one said it was easy to apologize, but if you really want to gain her trust, then this is far better than being in denial about doing something wrong.;
, Whether you’ve made a mistake and want her to forgive you or you’re just with a girl who needs some time to put those walls down, if you really want to gain her trust, then you have to give her time to open up and to feel safe with you. If you get impatient because she’s not opening up enough or not warming up to you after a few weeks, then you may be on the way to spoiling a good thing. If you’re trying to win her trust back after cheating, then the ball is really in her court and it may take her much longer than a few weeks to feel like she can trust you again.


If you cheated on her, then you have no right to be mad that she’s taking “too much time” to feel close to you again. It’s all up to her now.
If she just has trust issues or has been hurt by boyfriends in the past, then the best thing you can do is reassure her that you’re different. That said, if you lose patience with her, she may be scared off. Show her that she’s worth the wait.

, If you want to gain her trust, then you have to let her make some of the calls. Whether you want to get more intimate, have her meet your buddies, or go on a weekend trip together, make sure she’s ready before you move forward. You don’t want her to feel like things are moving too fast, or she’ll be scared off. Instead, wait for things to move at her pace, and you’ll see that she is ready to move forward with you, but she just needs a little time.


If you feel like you want things to move a lot faster and just can’t wait anymore, then you may be better off moving on. If you don’t think it’s worth it to wait, then you may be better off with another girl who is more open.

, Of course, one of the best ways to gain a girl’s trust is to not abuse it. If you want her to feel like she can trust you, then you have to be honest, you have to be open, and you have to show her that you’re reliable. If she thinks you’re going to flake on your date, not keep her secrets, or flirt with other girls when she’s not around, then yeah, it’ll be pretty hard to gain her trust. Instead, work on being the best man or boyfriend that you can be, and she’ll see that she doesn’t need to worry about you.


The best thing you can do is to be loyal and open with her. Don’t make her feel like she can’t believe a word you say or that you’re trying to smooth-talk your way out of a lie.
If you hang out with another female friend one on one, for example, don’t lie about it when nothing happened; instead, tell her the truth and show her that she has nothing to worry about. If she finds out from someone else that you’ve been hanging out with another girl, then she’ll have much less reason to trust you.
If you abuse her trust, however small the infraction, then giving her a sincere apology is the best thing you can do.

, Another way to start to gain the girl’s trust is to be dependable. If you say you’ll pick her up for a date at 8 o’clock, roll in there at least five minutes early, to show that you won’t leave her hanging. If she needs help putting together a bookshelf, be there when you say you will and follow through. If you have a routine of walking to class together, don’t flake out without an explanation one day. Let her see that she can depend on you to be there when she needs you.


If she expects to talk to you on the phone, make sure you answer shortly after she calls. Don’t go off the grid for a few hours when you know she needs you.
Be there for her, even if she just needs a shoulder to cry on. The most important thing is that she feels like you’re available and wanting to help.

, Nothing will make a girl suspicious faster than a guy with a password protected phone who is always stepping out to take mysterious calls. Take that password off your phone, unless you’re really worried about it being stolen; in that case, make sure you’re okay with her going through it. When someone calls, let her see who it is before you take the call, and don’t slyly send text messages when you’re with her unless she knows you’re just texting your buddy about the Warriors game.


Of course, you may say that your phone is your property only, and you’re not required to let her go through your phone if you want her to gain your trust. That said, if you’ve been shady with it before, you want her to see that you’re not a repeat offender.
The same goes for your computer. If you immediately slam your laptop shut the second she walks into the room, then yeah, she’ll have a reason to distrust you.

, The best thing you can do if you want to gain a girl’s trust is to be honest with her. That’s right. This means you tell her the truth. Tell her where you’re going with your buddies. Tell her what you were up to last night. If you wish you two went to more concerts together, let her know what’s on your mind. She’ll appreciate the fact that you’re honest with her, and she’ll be much more likely to trust you than if you only selectively tell her the truth.


That said, a white lie or two never hurt anyone, if you really decide there’s no point in being honest about something. If you think her new haircut makes her look a bit too severe, for example, you may want to keep that to yourself.

, If you want her to really start trusting you, then you should confide in her. Tell her about what’s on your mind, what your fears are, what your childhood was like, what drama you’re having with your friends, or really anything else you’ve been thinking about. If you open up to her, then she’ll see that she has more reason to trust you, because you’re willing to open up to her. You don’t need to freak her out by revealing incredibly person details when you’re just getting to know each other, but the more time you spend with her, the more you should open up.


If you talk to her about the things that really matter to you, then she’ll see that you really do think she’s special and that you like her.
The more you confide in her, the more she’ll be comfortable confiding to you back. That said, she may not be comfortable confiding at the same pace, so don’t put pressure on her to reveal more to you than she’s ready for.
If you tell her things you’ve never told anyone, then she’ll really see that she means a lot to you. Of course, you should only do this if you want to.

, If you really want to gain her trust, then she has to see that you’re not just there for the good times. If she’s in a fight with her best friend, having a rough week at work, or just not feeling so great, then it’s up to you to be there for her. If she thinks you’re only around for the kissing and the fun dates, then she’ll see that she can’t really trust you. Show her that you’re there for the sunshine and the rain.


If you want her to see you as someone she can truly depend on, then you should support her when she’s upset. Don’t just get frustrated and act like she’s getting upset over nothing or like you’re just waiting for her to be in a better mood.
If you really want a long term thing with this girl, then you have to be prepared for the fact that she won’t always be in a good mood. The same is true for you, right?

, Another way to gain her trust is to actually take the time to listen to her. Look her in the eyes, don’t interrupt her, and let her see that you’re really taking in every word she says. Don’t give her advice unless she asks for it and put away your phone and other distractions, showing her that she has your full attention. Really take the time to process what she’s telling you, whether she’s describing a conflict with her mother or a career choice she’s been struggling with. The most important thing is that she sees that you really care about what she has to say.


Don’t get that glazed look in your eyes that says you’re just waiting for her to finish talking so you can tell her what happened that day.
In addition to listening to her, you should actually remember what she says and follow up about it. For example, if she’s telling you about a big test she has later in the week, wish her luck the night before.

, If you really want to gain her trust, then you have to show her that you’re ready to commit. This means putting your arm around her in public, introducing her as your girlfriend, making long-term plans with her, and generally making it clear that you’re serious about her. If you won’t book tickets for a concert that’s two months away, then it’ll make her suspicious. If you’re sweet to her in private but treat her like she’s just a friend or kid sister in public, then she’ll see that you don’t want the world to think you’re really serious about her.


Of course, if she’s not ready to really commit, then you don’t need to pressure her to do so. But if it seems like you’re on the same page, then make it clear that you really want to make an effort for her.
Check in with her. When you don’t see her for a day or two, make sure to give her a call or at least send a text if you’re really busy. This will make her see that when she’s out of your sight, she’s not out of your mind.

, If you really want to gain her trust, then you have to be willing to make an effort with her friends and family as well. Be kind to her friends, show an interest in them, and let them see how much you like your girl. Treat her family with respect and care, and take the time to really get to know them and to open up about yourself. If you’re nice to her but don’t give her friends or family the time of day, she’ll see that as a red flag that she can’t really trust you.


It’s okay if you’re shy about meeting her parents. That’s only natural. The important thing is that you’re nice and friendly and act and dress appropriately in their presence. Make an effort with them, especially if you’re meeting them for the first time.

, If you really want to win her over and gain her trust, then you have to stick to your word. If you tell her you’ll watch her dog over the weekend when she’s away, don’t flake to take a road trip with your buddies at the last minute. If you say you’ll give her a ride to the doctor when her car is in the shop, show up when you say you will. If you tell her you’ll be loyal and honest for as long as you’re together, then make her see that she can believe it.


Even following through on the smaller promises, like saying you’ll take her to lunch, can make a big difference. If she feels like she can’t even trust you to go to lunch with her, then she’ll see that she can’t expect you to follow through on the important stuff, either.
If you do happen to be late or to forget a promise you made, make sure you apologize profusely and show her that it won’t happen again. You don’t have to be perfect, but you should make an effort to make her see that you want her to depend on you.

, If you want to have a meaningful relationship with a girl who trusts you, then one of the most important things you have to do is let her know how much you care about her. Tell her you love her, give her meaningful compliments, spend time with her, plan romantic dates, and always let her know how lucky you are. Don’t ever take her for granted or she may feel like she can’t trust you because you’re losing interest.


You don’t have to smother her with hugs and kisses all the time, especially if that’s not your thing. However, you have to find a way to let her know you care every time you’re together.
Getting her a meaningful gift just because, instead of because it’s Valentine’s Day or her birthday, can really show her that she matters to you. It’s the thought that counts, not the price tag.
Write her love letters to surprise her when she’s having a bad day. If you do this when she least expects it, she’ll be charmed.

, If you really want to continue a serious relationship with this girl and to make her trust you, then you have to be able to compromise with her. Let her see that you don’t always need to get your way and that you want her to be happy, too. Even if you’re working on winning back her trust, you don’t have to completely give in to her every single time, or she’ll think you don’t have a backbone. Instead, work on having productive conversations that weigh the pros and cons of a decision, and on finding a way that can make both of you happy.


She’ll see that she can trust you if it looks like you really take her thoughts and feelings into account instead of just always wanting to get your way.
Sometimes, you should just give in and let her see the movie she wants to see or go to the restaurant she’s been craving; this is okay as long as sometimes, she gives in to you as well.

, You may think that, if you want the girl to trust you, that you have to be Mr. Perfect all the time, and that you can’t possibly ever disappoint her. While you should be loyal and reliable, you shouldn’t put too much pressure on yourself to be absolutely perfect. Make an effort to be the best person you can be, and she’ll feel like she can really trust you because of it. That said, this is no excuse for cheating. Cheating is never acceptable.


If you show up late to a date, just apologize and show her how sorry you are. As long as you don’t make a habit of it, she’ll appreciate the fact that you’re willing to admit you made a mistake.
You should also be okay with saying, “I don’t know”. You don’t always have to act like you know exactly what to do if you want her to trust you. In fact, she may be even more eager to trust you if she knows you’re honest about your feelings.

, Another thing you can do to make her trust you is to be open about your feelings. Let her see that you want to confide in her, to be frank with her, and that you’re willing to tear down those walls for her. While you don’t have to reveal every single secret you have to her, you should work on being open and honest when you’re talking to her, whether you’re telling her what you did this past weekend or you’re talking about your concerns about your college major. If you’re open on a regular basis, she’ll see that she’s able to trust you in the long term.


If something is troubling you, you should be comfortable enough to open up to her about it, even if it’s a little bit embarrassing or you worry it’ll make her think less of you. If you never tell her about your problems, then she’ll feel like she should never open up to you, either.
If you’re having a bad day, you can be honest with her about it, explaining what’s going on. You don’t want her to think you have to hide everything from her. If you hide things from her, then she’ll hide things from you, too.

, To maintain a meaningful relationship with a girl who trusts you, you have to be open and willing to communicate with her. You can’t brush her off every time she wants to have a talk, and you have to make her feel comfortable with bringing up issues to you. When she talks to you, make sure you’re open to having a conversation and that you really stop and listen. If you have something to say to her, don’t put it off or be passive aggressive instead of hashing it out.


Communication is key in any healthy relationship. If you want the girl to trust you in the long run, then you have to make her feel like you’re open to talking about your relationship and sharing your feelings with her.
If she feels scared about sharing her feelings with you because she thinks you’ll be angry or dismissive, then she won’t be able to really trust you.

, If you want to make your relationship with the girl work and really want her to trust you, then you have to be able to make time for her and to show her that she’s a priority. If you spend too much time with your buddies or don’t answer your phone for hours, then she’s likely to not trust you because she won’t know what you’re doing when you’re not around. Make an effort to be there for her, to have a regular hangout routine, and to let her know what you’re doing when you’re not together. Putting in a time commitment is essential to making her trust you.


If you know you won’t have your phone on for a few hours, because you’ll be in a long meeting or watching a movie, you can text her before to say hi and let her know what’s up. Of course, you don’t have to be accountable for every minute of your life and that can get exhausting, but letting her generally know how you spend your time can really help her trust you.
Making time for her shows that she’s central to your life. This is crucial for making her trust and believe in you.

Perhaps the best thing that you can do for your own emotional health is to practice forgiveness, even if the person who wronged you does not appear to feel sorry.Numerous studies show the value of forgiveness. If you carry around negative emotions for a long time after someone hurts you, you can bring anger and bitterness to new relationships, stop enjoying everyday life, and become anxious or depressed.;
, In order to forgive someone, you do not have to excuse their actions to yourself. You don’t even have to eliminate all of your feelings about the situation. It’s perfectly normal to go on thinking of an incident even after you have forgiven a person for it.You also don’t have to tell a person that they are forgiven, though if it makes you feel better to do so, this is certainly a possibility.
You don’t have to forget in order to forgive. In other words, protect yourself. If possible, don’t put yourself in a situation where you could be hurt again. For example, even if you successfully forgive an abusive ex-boyfriend, remember that he was abusive when you are tempted to return to that relationship.

, Forgiving someone else can help you heal and help you move on from an unhealthy relationship. Particularly if the person you are trying to forgive shows no remorse, forgiveness will be something that you do for your own mental health, not to improve your relationship with the other person.Remember that forgiveness is probably the best thing you can do for yourself, even if the person you are forgiving has no idea that you’ve done so.

, In your own thoughts, acknowledge that this person really did do something to hurt you. Acknowledge your own feelings and reactions.Particularly if someone very close to you hurt you, you may be minimizing the severity of the situation or even blaming yourself for “overreacting.” It’s also possible that, on some level, you are pretending that this never happened. This is the time to acknowledge the reality of the situation to yourself once and for all.
It may help you to speak about the incident. You can say it out loud to yourself, or you can speak about it to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor.

, You are likely feeling hurt or angry at the person who wronged you. In order to forgive, you need to process the emotions you’re having. Let yourself feel them for a while without telling yourself that it’s wrong to feel this way.Give yourself a few minutes at a time to feel this way, and then move on to an activity that gives you joy. You may have to do this for several days or even weeks. Try to spend less and less time each day feeling the hurt or anger.

, In all likelihood, if a person hurt you badly, you have changed as a person as a result. Look for the results of those changes. Have you learned anything new about yourself or your relationships? You survived something painful. Acknowledge that this has helped you grow stronger as a person.

You don’t have to find major changes in your life in order to recognize growth. For example, if you are trying to forgive parents who kicked you out of the house when you were a teenager, “growth” could simply be making the resolve in your own mind to never treat your own children the same way.

, No one is perfect. What might have made the person behave this way and then not feel badly about it? Do you know something about their past, their family, or their mental health that can give you insight into their actions?Recognizing the logic behind another person’s actions is not the same as excusing their actions. Maybe your boyfriend physically abused you, and you happen to know that his father abused him as a child. While this can give you empathy towards him, it should not make you feel like his actions were justified.

, In some cases, you may be perfectly innocent of any wrongdoing. For example, if you are holding onto anger against someone who inflicted a childhood trauma on you, you most likely did not contribute to the situation. Think critically about whether this is the case for you. On the other hand, if your wife cheated on you, you may have contributed to the situation by spending too much time at the office. That doesn’t mean that you are to blame. It doesn’t mean that your wife is innocent. It just means that your actions contributed to the situation, and it will be important for you to recognize that before moving on.

, This process is hard, and it’s perfectly normal if you can’t accomplish it on your own. Talk to someone you trust. This can be a friend, a family member, a therapist, or even a higher power. If none of these options feels comfortable to you, you can write in a journal or even an anonymous online blog.If you can unburden yourself a bit, this can help you move on. , This may be the hardest step of all, but in the end, you just have to let it go. Try imagining the weight of your hatred, anger, or hurt leaving your body and flying away like a bird.


You may find it helpful to engage in some sort of forgiveness ritual. You could write down an account of what happened, and then toss it into your wood-burning fireplace, put a message in a bottle and “send” it down the river to the person who hurt you, release balloons into the air to symbolize your feelings of relief, or even call the person and tell them you forgive them. Consider doing something that marks the incident as “finished.”
If you feel yourself reengaging with your negative feelings toward the person who hurt you, you may need to revisit some of the other steps in the process or seek counseling., When you think about this person, is your first thought about the way they hurt you, or do you think first about other aspects of their personality? Do you still think about seeking revenge against them? If so, you may not have completely forgiven them yet, so you should continue working through your feelings, remembering that this is a process that may take some time., There are a lot of reasons why it may feel impossible to forgive someone. Perhaps you have fantasies of revenge, which you would have to give up if you forgave the other person. Perhaps the feelings of anger are more powerful than the desire to forgive.It may take some time to overcome desire for revenge or feelings of anger. Forgive yourself if it takes you a while.
Seek counseling or talk to a friend or family member if you are afraid that your anger will actually lead you to enact revenge. No matter what they did, hurting them back is not a good option.

, Accept that you may not be able to continue being friends with the person. Just because you forgive someone, that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t hurt to be around them. Depending on how badly you think they have wronged you and how painful it is to be around someone, you may have to avoid seeing them even after you have forgiven them.Particularly if you have been in an abusive relationship, it is likely best to remove yourself from the relationship even after you have forgiven another person.

, Do things that make you happy. Spend quality time with friends and family. Take nice walks. Pick up an old hobby. Read a good book. Start working out. Do anything that gives you pleasure but doesn’t involve the person who hurt you."

Make it absolutely clear that you are not interested.,
Make it even clearer that you will never be interested in this person.,
Put the person off.,
Be annoying whenever the person crushing on you is around.,
Ignore the person.,
Tell your friends to not make things worse.,
Get yourself a boyfriend or girlfriend if this is what you want.,
Get on with your life.",How to Get Someone to Stop Crushing on You," Be polite but be clear and firm that you don't return the feelings for this person. Be kind but don't give in to the person just because you feel sorry for them. If this isn't what you want, then it isn't what you want.


Say something like: ""It's flattering to hear you say such a nice thing to me. However, I am not interested in a relationship right now as I am focused on other things which are important to me.""
Or: ""I appreciate your interest in me. I don't feel the same way about you though. I like being friends/classmates but that's all it is to me and that's how I want things to stay.""
Or: ""That's kind of you to think of me this way but I'm actually interested in someone else and it wouldn't be fair to you to pretend that I don't have feelings for another person."";
, Realize that some people will still hold out a hope that a person may change his or her mind; indeed, much advice about rejection often makes a suggestion to wait patiently for the person to ""come around"" to their viewpoint. This myth of the value of persistence in relation to changing a person's mind about something so fundamentally uncontrollable can mean that the person with the crush doesn't give up but keeps trying to ""win you over"", which just makes things worse.


Make it clear that you don't appreciate any continued attention and will ask someone to intervene if the crush doesn't stop the unwanted attention.
Say something like: ""I have already told you that I am not interested. I am repeating this now because I mean it. I am not and will not ever be interested in dating you. Please respect my decision.""

, If you feel as if you need to be unattractive to the person, there are a few behavioral things you can do put the person off. For example:


Spit on the ground or sniff loudly; pick your nose openly in front of them.
Make snorting noises when you laugh near them.
Eat in a messy and ill-mannered way if you're having a meal with them. Or, talk to them with food in your mouth.
Eat garlic or something else that is pungent, then talk to them with foul breath. Get close for a stinky whisper in the ear.
Curse in this person's presence if they're the sort to find this offensive.

, Hum the Nyan Cat theme loudly and constantly. Chew bubble gum and blow large bubbles that pop loudly around them. Tell jokes that are meant for elementary school level and laugh really loudly. Answer fake calls when this person tries to talk to you, or text while they're talking to you.

, If they persist after you've rejected the person crushing on you, cut all communications for a time. Don't initiate conversation, don't greet the person and deliberately go away from them if they come near you. Look away if they try to make eye contact with you. Avoid talking to them or looking at them during group conversations.


Don't reply to notes, texts, IMs or emails that this person sends you.
Don't send Valentine's, holiday or other cards to this person, not even if they have sent you one.
If you get paired with them for a class project, only talk about the project and what needs doing. If they try to talk personally, ignore it and only discuss the project. When class is over, avoid the person.

, Don't allow your friends to tease you about this person or to suggest that you'd make a good couple. If they start this sort of teasing, no matter how good-natured, tell them with no uncertainty that they are not helping and that you are serious about not wanting to reciprocate the crush's intentions. Ask them to be supportive and to not undermine your strong front to help the crush realize that you really mean it when you say you're not interested. Your friends should get the message.


Tell your friends that you're worried that this person might stalk you or try to pressure you if he or she isn't clear that you're not interested. Ask them to be on the lookout for such negative behaviors and your friends will soon be more interested in supportive sleuthing than joking about it.

, If the reason you're not interested in this person crushing on you is because you're genuinely interested in someone else, see what you can do to turn that into a reality. It's fairly evident then to a persistent crush that you're not going to be interested in them. However, be careful using this as a ""solution"", as the person crushing on you may simply ""wait it out"", hoping to pick up the pieces when your relationship fails. Hence, this isn't the best way to solve the problem of a persistent crush.

, Don't let the person crushing on you waste your time and interfere with you getting on with your life. Keep doing what you wish to do and let this person see that their interest in you isn't curtailing your usual routine. Eventually, most persons will get over their crush and find someone more suitable. It's a healthy lesson for everyone involved.

We know it doesn't feel like that—it feels like you'll never be whole again. That you can never be happy without them. But it's not true. You will move on, and you will feel like yourself again. At the end of the day, you just need time and a little TLC towards yourself.;
, After you break up, you may find that you have lots of extra time and money that you no longer have to spend on your ex. So date yourself! Throw some dollar bills in the air and make yourself feel like a king or queen. Getting used to single life isn't all depressing—it's about putting you first. Remember, there's nothing wrong with showing yourself a little love - especially after a hardship like a breakup.


Get what you want. Even better, get what they didn't want you to have when you were dating. Your shackles are off—enjoy the freedom!

, The best ways to leave behind the painful memories? Literally leave them behind. New sights, sounds, and experiences stimulate the senses, making the pain of a breakup seem distant and unimportant. Added bonus: you won't be driven to tears looking at the coffee maker you used to share each morning.


Even a short trip, like a new cafe or running route, will shake some of the baggage off.

, You want to avoid interacting with people and things that remind you of your ex. You don't have to throw it all out—there is no reason to be heartless—but you do have to pack it away. Throw the old shirts, photographs, and mementos in a box and bury it in the attic or basement. It won't be easy packing all those things up, but it is necessary. Once the mementos are all gone, you don't have to hold back the tears every time you pass that one photo of you two last summer.

, If you're looking for a change in your life, try changing the company you keep. The world is a big, wide place, and though your sweetheart might have seemed like the bee's knees when you were dating, they're not the only fish in the sea. New friends bring new perspectives, activities, and conversations—and you'll soon be wondering, ""ex-who?"".


This advice is especially important if, after a breakup, you find that some of your friends have ""sided"" with your ex. Pay these people no attention—focus your energy on finding friends who respect your choices.

, Significant others take lots of time and energy—leaving your best bros and gal pals wondering if you fell off the face of the earth. This is nothing to be ashamed of - everyone has to budget their limited time between partners and friends. Now that the shackles of romance are off, though, it's time to pay the old gang a visit. You may find that both of your lives have changed since you last had contact, and there is nothing like catching up with old friends.

, During a relationship, when you're splitting time between your own interests and desires and those of your partner, it can be tricky to find time to do all of the things you'd like to. The silver lining of a breakup is that you suddenly have lots more time to spend on yourself. Stop spending that time feeling sad for yourself and go do something! Play a video game, cook a new recipe, go for a hike—anything! Just get out of the house already and use your newfound freedom.


Sometimes, after a breakup, the intensely negative emotions that result can leave you feeling like you're boring and that you don't have any hobbies or interests worth mentioning. That's bull—you can go online right now and find a new activity to explore in your area.

, Work towards bettering yourself physically and mentally. Chances are good you've let your passion project slip away. You've gotten used to sweatpants and Netflix every Friday. You've eaten more stir-fry (your beau's favorite) than is healthy or exciting. You still have a gym membership?! Kick off the dust and get back to basics—you've got plenty of time to focus on you. Most importantly for the lovebirds out there, self-improvement ups your confidence and makes you even more appealing for the next catch to come along.


Exercise been clinically proven to fight depression, anxiety, and stress. It doesn't matter what you do, you need to be moving your body.Building muscles isn't the only way to better yourself. Hone your mind by learning a new skill, exploring a new creative outlet, or mastering a new area of study.You may want to try learning a new language (Polish! Swahili! Wolof!), becoming skilled at a vocational trade (Jewelry Maker! Artisanal Jam Chef! Gardener! Amazing Race Contestant!), or learning how to play a musical instrument (you know these already).

, Rebound relationships get a bad rap that they don't deserve. There's not anything wrong with having a low-stakes, lighthearted relationship following a breakup of a major relationship. However, you must be perfectly clear about your goals and intentions from the start. Saying something like, ""Hey, I should let you know that I just got out of a difficult relationship, so I'm just looking for something casual"" lets your partner know that you're not looking for marriage, just a bit of fun.


It should go without saying, a rebound is no reason to get careless. You're with new people now—wear protection and get to know your partners.

, The people who love you - your family members, personal mentors, and close friends - want to see you happy. If you're unhappy after a breakup, don't be afraid to ask these people for a little extra love. After all, we all need somebody to lean on. Talking to an old friend, a parent, a sibling, or someone else who's close helps you eliminate built-up stress and patch the whole in your heart. Your love was not the only person that loved you—you just have to remember that and spend time with those that matter.


Even if you find that the advice you receive from your close confidants isn't perfect, the sense of comradeship you get from your close relationships can be exactly what you need when you're reeling from the loss of an ex.

, After you've spent time on yourself, had a few flings, and enjoyed the single life, you'll eventually want to start a new relationship. That's great! When you're ready, you're ready—but don't feel like you need to jump into a new relationship to feel normal again. There is no ""perfect"" amount of time to wait, so don't let anyone tell you otherwise.


It may or may not be appropriate to restart a relationship with someone you had a bad breakup with. At the end of the day, it's your call. However, if they were abusive or manipulative, keep them away with a thirty-nine and half foot pole.

, Some people take weeks or months to feel ""100%"" after a painful breakup. Ultimately, there's no substitute for the natural healing power of time. As you get further removed from your breakup, it'll creep less and less into your thoughts. You'll feel normal again. You won't be awkward at parties (not that you were before!), and you'll get an eye for that cute coworker or friend. The pain won't go away immediately, but it will go away with time.


There will be bumps in the road—holidays, events you used to do together, watching your favorite ""couple's night"" TV shows—but this is natural. It will fade.

, You may feel like you've made a mistake, or like you won't ever be able to find another partner again. These feelings, though nasty, aren't really that weird, it is perfectly natural. But don't let temporary feelings of low self-worth sabotage your chance at escaping a relationship you aren't happy in. The last thing you'll want to do is come begging your ex for forgiveness right after breaking up. Give your breakup time to ""set in"" before you even think about the decision again, otherwise you're wasting valuable mental energy on the dunce you just dumped or the dummy who just dumped you. Either way, they're not worth your negative energy.


If you're seriously regretting breaking up with your ex, wait 2-3 months. If you still feel that way, you can consider calling. But you can only consider it! Chances are good you're starting to move on anyway.

, In the days, weeks, and even months following a romantic split, your emotions are going to be a hot mess. You may find that you feel conflicting feelings of sadness, relief, frustration, and/or nervousness. This is perfectly normal - breakups can lead to long periods of emotional unease where you don't feel ""right"" for a long time. While you're in the middle of such a period, it's always a good idea to avoid any and all forms of contact with your ex until you feel better. Strong emphasis on the ""any and all."" Don't see, call, text, email, or otherwise interact with your ex until you're well on your way to moving on.


Sometimes, exceptions must be made to this rule in order to reclaim any personal possessions that your ex still has, or to sort out any official business (bank accounts, etc.) that remains unresolved. Keep the interaction as short, basic, and polite as possible. If you can't bear to see your ex, try sending a friend to do your business instead—you should be more worried about moving on.

, It seems like a good idea to blow your savings on a 2-week trip to Cuba after a breakup, but is it really? Don't make any major decisions until you've had time to cool off and calmly consider your possibilities. A single bad decision made in a moment of anger or frustration can have long-lasting consequences that may make it more difficult to move on in the long run. For reference in times of need, here is a list of things you should not do after a breakup:


Vandalize your ex's property.
Sabotage your ex's next relationship.
Confront your ex in public, or spread hurtful rumors.
Spend exorbitant amounts of money as a hobby.
Move, buy, or sell your house and possessions.
Quit your job or change careers suddenly.

, If they hurt you, you still need to report things. This is especially important if you are worried for your safety after the breakup. To clarify this last point, if your ex abused you in any way, you can and should tell the proper authorities. No one else, after all, should go through what you went through. See:


How to Report Sexual Abuse
How to Report Domestic Violence

, Today, unfortunately, the idea of ""going to a therapist"" carries a certain social stigma, but that stigma is a load of hogwash. It's sometimes thought that the person looking for help is mentally unstable or emotionally ""weak"". But 48% of Americans have seen a therapist or asked for mental or psychological help—you are far from alone.Millions of average, ordinary people talk to therapists, counselors, advisers, and other professionals for advice and guidance during difficult times.There's no reason at all to be afraid to get help.


Some of the people you may consider talking to are professional therapists, psychiatrists, school and occupational counselors, and, if desired, authoritative voices in your community like priests or rabbis. Just find a voice you trust and you're in good hands.

People develop strong emotional attachments in love. They tend to see their romantic partner as the first person in their life they contact when they need emotional support. When a relationship ends, it can be hard to move away from your ex as you go-to for support. In order to get over the relationship you need to make an effort to do so.Do not call, text, or e-mail your ex. If necessary, temporarily block him on social media to avoid the temptation to contact him through something like Facebook or Twitter. Minimize the amount of time you spend with your ex and do not engage in activities together that increase feelings of attachment. If watching movies together was a romantic activity for you, for example, do not watch a movie with your ex.Get rid of any mementos you associate with your ex. This can help remove the temptation to call and talk to him when you're stressed or upset.;
, Consider why you're trying to forget this person. Was the relationship not working? Was the person not nice to you? There are many reasons why a relationship might end and being aware of why yours did not work out can aid in the healing process. Spend time thinking about why things ended and assuring yourself the break up was for the best., Research shows that it's not actually a bad thing to think about a relationship while trying to get over it as long as you think in abstract terms. Remember the emotions you felt during the relationship rather than the physical presence of your ex. Focus on what you enjoyed about being with this person on an emotional level and how lucky you were to experience feelings of love and attachment. Remember the relationship as an abstract concept rather than a physical experience., Contrary to what you may read in women's magazines, there is no magic formula that can tell you when you can expect to get over an ex. A variety of factors impact how long it will take you to get over a relationship. As you attempt to get over a relationship, be patient and accept it will take time.


The duration and intensity of the relationship are two of the biggest factors in determining how long it will take you to heal. Longterm relationships of high intensity can take as long as year to get over. However, shorter relationships that were very intense can also be difficult to forget., You might end up seeing the boy at school, work, or around town. It can be hard to forget someone when you're occasionally forced to interact. Try to limit interactions unless absolutely necessary. Be courteous when you see your ex and if you need to work with him on projects, be respectful but stay professional. You will likely experience some feelings of sadness the first few times you have to interact with your ex after the relationship ended. Accept these are normal and will pass with time.

, While it's important to acknowledge and experience sadness in the wake of a break up, dwelling on negative thoughts too long eventually becomes counterproductive. Try to stay busy with a variety of hobbies and activities to stop yourself from lingering in sadness.


Find something you enjoy. You can go to a museum, see a movie, do a puzzle, play a video game. Anything that keeps your mind focused on the present moment can help you avoid thinking about your ex.Create time and space for your hobbies. While it seems strange to stick to a schedule for leisure activity, sometimes this is the only way to get yourself out of the house after a breakup. Promise yourself you'll spend at least 3 nights a week going out or swear you'll only spend one weekend night in alone., Spend more time with a friend, siblings, classmates, and other people you're close to. Being alone can lead you to ruminate on negative thoughts so heavy socialization is vital when it comes to moving forward. Make plans with people you know and make efforts to get to know new people. Attend a club or meeting. Go to a bar alone and talk to a stranger. Attend poetry readings or art shows and see if you meet anyone., Many people fall into the trap of not caring for themselves in the wake of a breakup. As hard as it might be, continue to practice self care even when you're feeling down.


Keep up with eating and sleeping right. Go the gym if you work out regularly. Try not to let day-to-day activities that help you feel your best fall to the wayside.Push yourself. Doing basic day-to-day tasks might take extra effort during a breakup but poor eating, hygiene, and fitness habits will only exasperate a bad mood., While it's important to keep up with self care, cut yourself some slack in regards to work. Some people feel throwing themselves into work is a great distraction, but this can create a negative pattern. It can be hard to go back to a normal work load once you're feeling better. Try to put in less effort than normal at work and, if possible, take a mental health day to spend time taking care of yourself., As stated, the attachment you feel to an ex is what makes breakups so difficult. You end up feeling lonely and isolated when this person is suddenly out of your life. Work on forming closer relationships with friends and family members to fill in the gap your ex left.


Relying on people can actual require some training on your part. You might have to force yourself to call your mom or your best friend after a bad day instead of your ex. However, once you learn to rely on these people over your ex he'll be easier to forget.Remind yourself your ex is not the only person in your life who loves you and who you feel close to. Being single does not have to mean being alone. Having this realization can help you heal and move forward with your life., Do not jump into a new relationship after a bad breakup. This can make you want your ex more. However, casual dating in the wake of a bad breakup can actually help you move forward. It reminds you that you are attractive, desirable, and will find someone again.


Go on casual, fun dates. Have a friend set you up. Attend a singles mixer. Try creating on online dating profile.Remind yourself you're not necessarily seeking out the love of your life, but rather trying to have fun and date around while you're single. This can help you shift romantic focus away from your ex and out into the world of potential matches., If you have preexisting issues with depression and anxiety, you may need the assistance of a therapist to get over your ex. You can ask for a referral for a therapist from your primary doctor. You can also get a list of therapists from your insurance providers. If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling from your college or university."

State your needs explicitly.,
Ask about your partner’s needs.,
Be sensitive to your partner’s needs.,
Stay positive.,
Manage conflicts.,
Have “big picture” conversations.",How to Fall Back in Love With Someone1," Don't expect a longtime partner to read your mind. If you find yourself becoming frustrated that your partner does not meet your needs or expectations, try having a conversation in which you outline those needs.For example, you may feel as though your partner does not appreciate you because she does not tell you that she appreciates you. It’s quite possible that she feels appreciative and notices all of the things that you do, but she doesn’t say anything about them. In this case, you might tell her, “Sometimes I feel unappreciated. It would help me feel more appreciated if you would verbally acknowledge what I have done and thank me for it.”
Another example is if you feel as though your partner is no longer attracted to you because she does not typically initiate intimacy. If this is the case, tell her how you feel and explain how you would like her to act differently.;
, When discussing your emotional needs, be sure to offer reciprocation by asking what your partner’s needs are. If your partner tends to be less communicative about emotions, you may need to help her find the language to communicate her needs. Be patient and realize that she may need time to think about it before responding. If she asks for time, don’t forget to follow up. When she does talk to you, really listen to and try to understand what she says., Once you have shared your needs with each other, you and your partner should try to put your knowledge into action. You may even work together to create an “action plan” to implement meeting each other’s needs.


For example, if your partner wishes for you to verbally communicate your appreciation for her, you might set a reminder on your phone to pay her a compliment a couple of times a week.
You could say things like, “thank you for planning and organizing our upcoming vacation. I know you have worked very hard to try to make everything go smoothly for the entire family” or “it really means a lot to me that you got up and made me breakfast before I left for work this morning. You do so many little things to make my life easier.”
If your partner has communicated that she wishes you would initiate physical intimacy more often, try doing so. Sometimes a little extra effort towards romance can go a long way in a relationship. Don’t underestimate your power to pleasantly surprise your partner.

, Being overly negative can sour a relationship with anyone, but is particularly bad for a long-term romantic relationship. Keeping your communication positive and clear and maintaining a positive outlook on life whenever possible can help keep your relationship happy.

, Avoiding all conflicts is nearly impossible, and avoiding conflict is not always the best way to deal with them. Instead, think about managing your conflicts; this may mean avoiding them sometimes (picking your battles) and working to resolve them at other times.


If you and your partner disagree about the process for managing conflicts (for example, if you want to talk about and solve the conflict immediately but she prefers some distance to cool down first), you may need to compromise. Have a plan for how you will address future conflicts, respecting each individual’s preferences.

, Often when people begin dating, they have conversations with each other about really influential events in their lives and their future dreams and ambitions. After being together for a long time, conversations may center more on who is going to pick up the dry cleaning or drop the kids off at soccer. Trying to find the time and space for big conversations about life and goals can help you feel closer to your partner again.

Schedule time alone together.It can seem strange to schedule a date with your own partner, but it is important to keep your relationship a priority.,
Pay special attention to your appearance for a date.,
Make time to play.,
Hold hands.Get back to basic with your relationship and initiate some PG-rated intimacy in the form of hand-holding.,
Flirt more and be kind.,
Remain intimate.,
Revisit your courtship.,
Create traditions.",How to Fall Back in Love With Someone2," Sometimes the only way to do that is to work it in to your schedule intentionally. Invite your partner out on a date, take care of any necessary details like babysitting or transportation, and make it happen. See if you can make it a routine, such as Saturday night dates. This can offer you an opportunity to connect and talk about your week.

, If you’ve been with your partner for a long time, she has likely seen you at your best and your worst. While it is impractical (and perhaps unnecessary) for you to look your best whenever you’re together, try getting “spruced up” before going out on a date together. Think about when you were first dating and you would spend extra time getting ready for the date so you could be sure to impress.

, Play and laughter create strong connections and reinforce relationships.If you set aside time to do things that make you feel happy—and you do them together—you will likely feel closer to your partner. Try something new and fun together, or take some time to get out and do something silly.


Some new things you could try together include trying new sports, ziplining, an obstacle course, mini-golf, a video game, a board or card game, or even attending a sporting event together.

, You probably held hands with your partner when you were first dating, so why not now? Simple touching outside of the bedroom can often help you feel closer and revitalize the bond between you.

, Think of love as an action. Every day, find ways to show your partner how much you care about them. Make it so that they couldn't ever forget that you love them.

, Don’t let go of your sex life because you have other demands in your life. If necessary, plan or schedule your intimate moments. Build romance into your schedule, and talk about ways to revitalize your love life if it seems to be waning.You may consider visiting a sex therapist if you have trouble solving intimacy problems on your own.

, Go back to the place you met or where you had one of your first dates. If you have children now, go somewhere that you used to frequent before you had kids but haven’t been in awhile. Going back to these places with your new perspective as an established couple can help you remember where you came from and appreciate how far you have come.

, Traditions can help couples (and families) establish shared experiences and viewpoints. Marking anniversaries, birthdays, or a day that is uniquely meaningful to you with a ritual or tradition can bring you together. It gives you the opportunity to reflect on past years and speculate about the future.

Create a love map.,
Admire each other.,
Establish trust.,
Renew your commitment.,
Keep a gratitude journal.Keeping a gratitude journal has been shown to help people appreciate what they have and feel happier.,
Practice self-care.Taking care of yourself and feeling that your own emotional needs are being met can help you have the energy and motivation for maintaining your relationships with others.",How to Fall Back in Love With Someone3," A love map is a physical representation of your partner’s emotional and relationship history. Even if you don’t physically draw a map, you should be mindful of your partner’s emotional “landscape” and try to appreciate the (often) long road that led you to be together in the end., The chances are that if you’re in a long term relationship with someone, you admired her in the past. She had qualities that you found desirable and attractive that you may not be taking for granted. Try to take an objective step back and look at your partner through new eyes. Make a list of all of the things you admire about her; you may even decide to share this list with her later. However, the value of creating the list is to renew your admiration.


You might try to encourage your partner to engage in mutual admiration as well. It may be awkward to come out and say “I think you should admire me and remember how great I am,” you could talk about your quest to admire her more completely and how you think it could help your relationship. This could prompt a reciprocation that could solidify both sides of your relationship.

, Approach your relationship with complete trust; if you assume that you trust and are trusted in return and let go of fear, jealousy, and suspicion, your relationship will benefit. While maintaining a healthy relationship may take work, trust shouldn’t.


If you have a reason to distrust your partner, such as a history of cheating, you may want to go to counseling together to reestablish a bond of trust.

, You’ve likely committed to your long-term partner, particularly if you are married, but it may be beneficial to renew that commitment. A renewal of vows or a formal ceremony is not necessary. You can just decide to renew your commitment and tell your partner about it.


For example, you might say, “I know we’ve been married for 17 years, and we’ve been through a lot together. I just want you to know that I’m committing myself to our shared happiness, and I will do the work and the fun necessary to continue making our relationship and our life better every day.”

, Keeping a journal that focuses on the gratitude that you have for all aspects of your life, including your relationship, may help you feel happier and closer to your partner.


Even if the gratitude does not directly benefit your relationship, doing something that makes you feel happier will have an influence on your relationship.

, You may also feel appreciative of your partner for helping you set aside the time for self-care.


Self-care does not look the same for every person. It may mean just spending time alone in quiet reflection or taking the time to participate in a hobby or sport that you enjoy.
Offer your partner opportunities for self-care as well. Give her time to herself and encourage her to pursue things that make her feel fulfilled and refreshed. When you come back to each other, you’ll likely have the energy and emotional space to devote more time to your relationship.

Know when you have a problem.,
Don’t wait to seek help.,
Find a therapist or counselor.,
Look for group classes or couples’ retreats.",How to Fall Back in Love With Someone4," If it seems like your friendly disagreements are becoming increasingly less friendly, you’re losing your desire or ability to talk to your partner, or you routinely get the cold shoulder when you try to initiate discussion or intimacy, you may need to look for marital help.Ups and downs are normal for most relationships, but if your “downs” seem like they won’t go away, you may have a bigger problem. The first step is talking to your partner about your feelings, but it may be good to have a specific “solution”—such as counselling—in mind.

, Too many couples wait until they are separated or discussing divorce before they look for help. You can seek help strengthening your relationship before your problems progresses past the point of saving the relationship.

, Look for a therapist who specializes in marriage counseling. If you don’t feel comfortable with a therapist, look for another kind of counselor such as a church or community leader, these individuals often have training in couple’s counseling.


Ask friends and family for referrals if you’re comfortable with others knowing that you are seeking counseling. If you know anyone who has divorced recently, you might ask her if she tried counseling before divorcing and whether she would recommend a therapist.
You can check the directory on the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy website or search online for “marriage counselor” plus your area. If reviews are available online, read them before selecting a counselor.

, If you don’t feel that you need counseling but would like to strengthen your relationship, look into group classes or retreats geared towards relationship building. These are often run by counselors but may be geared more towards strengthening a relationship than saving one, which might be a better fit for some couples.

Remember, in as much detail as you can, why you fell out of love.,
Ask yourself if the relationship could work.,
Give yourself time to be out of love.,
Don't force things.",How to Fall Back in Love With Someone5," If time, location, or circumstances cut your love short, then you might be able to pick things up where they left off. You want to have a good reason to fall back in love, because there was probably a good reason you fell out of it.


Do not rekindle the romance if you broke up because of manipulation or abuse, if the problems of your last relationship feel unresolved, or you're only reason to get back together is ""comfort.""

, Falling back in love with someone is great, but only if you're both willing to commit to the relationship. If there are hurdles in the way, such as distance, jobs, or other partners, there is no reason to fight an uphill battle. Don't, in other words, fall back in love without putting it all on the table.

Don't fall back in love if you just want to be with someone comfortable again. Don't treat love like an old friend you can visit once in a while or someone will inevitably get hurt.

, Did you every really fall out of love? If you're hurt or angry, but still want to rekindle things, you probably haven't given yourself enough time to get over them. You don't have the perspective needed to see how things are when you're flying solo. If you want to get back together, but know that you'd live if you didn't, then you should go pursue him or her.

Don't rebuild the relationship just because you feel uncomfortable or awkward alone. Falling back in love will not help you get to know yourself, nor will it help your fix other problems in your life. You should want to fall back in love with them, not need them in order to feel complete.

, Love is not a manufactured emotion. If you've fallen out of love and its not coming back then perhaps it isn't meant to be. People fall in and out of love all the time, and though it can be difficult, there are not always explanations. Sometimes it just happens. By the same logic, however, sometimes your feelings will just spring up naturally, renewing love where you thought there was none. At the end of the day, the best advice is to follow your gut, be honest with yourself and your partner, and hope for the best."

Play it cool for the time being.,
Brainstorm ways to get even.,
Put your plan into action.,
Document getting even so he remembers.,
Reconcile after you get even.",How to Get Even1," Sometimes getting even is a way to release negative emotions like anger which can be unhealthy.Don’t show your hand, or your anger right away and say you're going to get even. Instead react honestly, and make your target think he's won. This way he'll be less likely to expect payback.


Say your coworker didn’t tell you about an important meeting or used your work as his own. Don’t call him out and make a scene at work, that will only make you look worse. Let him think he's won and wait for your chance to get even.
Is your friend taking advantage of your relationship? Tired of trying to talk to him and not getting through? Don't blow up at him, wait for your chance to get even.
Or perhaps your significant other is taking advantage of the relationship. Freaking out may exacerbate the situation, so stay calm and try not to say something you might regret like ""This is why..."" or ""You always..."".;
, There are plenty of inventive ways to get even.Now it’s time to channel your frustration into creative thinking. Either come up with your own plan or try giving him a taste of own medicine. Plan the what, when, and where. Get to work early before anyone else so you have time to set up. Make plans to hang out with your friend at his place, or plan a date with your significant other.


Remember that coworker who wronged you? Think of what he did to you and use what you have at your disposal to get even.
Maybe your friend is always borrowing your stuff without asking. Why not get even by returning the favor?
Maybe your significant other is always late, or never offers to pay for anything.

, Now it’s time to get your “just desserts”. With your plan all set up, you’re going to have to do some acting to keep him from thinking anything is up.


If you use something like a shared calendar at work you can set up a private event that won’t show up on your coworker’s calendar so he won’t know about it. If you’re looking to have a bit more fun, you can also go into a shared folder and move his files around, hide them in subfolders, or even remove them completely. Just make sure that what you're doing won't get you fired.Borrow your friend’s phone charger and hide it so that when his phone runs out of battery he can’t charge it. It may sound kind of silly, but hey, we're getting even here. Or, if you’re really feeling creative, use his phone or computer to get on his social media account and post on his behalf apologizing for all of his transgressions.
Get even with your significant other by making him wait for once, or “forget” your wallet when you go out.

, This way you can enjoy it over and over again. This part is just as fun as getting even. Snap a couple of photos or shoot a video, you can even have a friend help you out with this. There’s no better way to make someone remember what he's done than to provide proof, after all.


And if you’re feeling a little vindictive, you can always upload it to social media.

, Remember here that you’re getting even, not ruining his life or destroying a relationship. Reveal why you did what you did and show him that you’re even now by helping him with anything you may have done.

Stop viewing this as a blame game.,
Realize that you cannot make anyone feel something you want them to feel.,
Be genuine when you express forgiveness.,
Think about what matters.,
If you have a history with this person, remember all the good things and the good times.,
Make the choice to forgive.,
Focus on your values.",How to Forgive Someone Who Hasn't Forgiven You," If you're waiting for the other person to offer forgiveness first, then you will likely be waiting a long time. Ironically, it's probable that you're maintaining the reason for a lack of forgiveness, in that it's competitive or about proving you're right after all. You'll need to step back and remove the blame aspect of it.;
, If they are not ready to express forgiveness and you're already at that point, you'll need to accept that you're simply more advanced in being ready to forgive. Forgiveness is not something you can force, it's a choice that a person needs to reach personally. No other person can force this out.

, If you aren't genuinely sorry, it'll be obvious and you won't be able to get past the fact that the other person hasn't yet forgiven you.

, Does being right or being forgiven matter more than you being the bigger person and letting go of your own resentment, anger or irritation about whatever happened? Have a good think through of what is really stopping you from performing an act of forgiveness.

, These are memories that show you that you shared special times together at one time. Perhaps now these can help you to feel ready to forgive and move on.

, Forgiveness isn't tit for tat or reciprocal round robin. You must make the choice that you are ready to forgive and not take into account whether or not the other person is ready, capable or intending to forgive. This is about your release from festering or living in the past, not their willingness.

, If forgiveness is one of your values, rely on this as your motivation for moving on rather than on worrying about the unforgiving person's morals, values and preferences.

Work harder.,
Open yourself to new experiences.,
Get in shape.",How to Make an Ex Girlfriend Suffer1," Change your life through the power of education. You will simultaneously enrich your mind, increase your earning potential, and become a force to be reckoned with on trivia nights. If you’ve never graduated high school, enroll in a GED course. These are often available through your local high school or library. If you’ve never graduated college, visit some local college campuses and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to discover what kind of financial aid is out there to help you attend college.


Educating yourself doesn’t need to be expensive. Start reading more. Visit your local library and ask the librarian to recommend books that every well-educated person should read. Read a balance of both nonfiction and fiction. Watch documentaries about the topics you are interested in. Write your thoughts, feelings, and reactions to what you’ve seen or read when finished.
You could also visit a local museum. Tours or talks at local museums or landmarks can be a great source for building your historical, archaeological, and scientific knowledge.
There are tons of free courses online covering a variety of topics. Check out edx.org, openculture.com, and coursera.org for access to some great free learning material.;
, Read a book, catch a movie with some friends, or start a band. Invite your friends to try something new with you. Whatever you like to do, do it! You might try:


riding a roller coaster
baking a cake
learning karate
climbing a mountain
learning a musical instrument
swimming
writing poetry

, Now that you’re unattached, you’ll have more time and energy to devote to your job. Put in longer hours at the office. Go the extra mile on reports, presentations, and company projects. Go to your local library and ask for books about professional development, with a focus on your chosen field. After a few months of really exceptional work, pursue a raise or promotion. Even if you don’t get it, you’ll feel good about the way you’ve improved your work and given it your all.


A breakup can be an opportunity to institute other positive changes in your life as well. If you are unhappy in your current employment, consider changing jobs. Update your resume and start browsing classifieds online and in your local newspaper for something more suited to your temperament.

, Cash in those vacation days at work and travel somewhere new and interesting. It doesn’t have to be out of the country, but challenging yourself by encountering people, foods, and situations you aren’t familiar with promotes personal growth and makes you more open to new experiences.If you don’t have money or time for extended travel, you can still find plenty of ways to explore the world around you. Try an exotic dish, or travel locally to a nearby landmark. Additionally, you might:Get a shave or a haircut.
Get a tattoo (henna if you prefer a less permanent option).
Buy some new clothes.
Throw a “Free At Last” party. Invite all your friends (and her friends too, if you can swing it).

, Besides making you more attractive to women, getting healthy and fit will channel all your post-breakup frustration and energy in a constructive way. Adjust your diet and exercise daily for at least thirty minutes. A whole foods diet with lots of grains, fruits, and vegetables will make you feel energized and healthy.


You can exercise at home by doing yoga, lifting weights, riding an exercise bike, using an exercise ball, or running on a treadmill. Use exercise DVDs at home to guide you through unfamiliar workouts. Alternately, you could strap on your running shoes or hop your bicycle for some fresh air if you don’t want to be cooped up at home. You could also get a membership to your local gym. Adopt a diet with little to no added sugar, fat, or cholesterol.
Ensure your workout plan covers all major muscle groups and consists of:

a warmup (brisk walking) and stretching (such as touching your left foot with your right hand while not bending your knees)
an aerobic workout (getting your heart rate up through running or bike-riding)
a strength-building workout (lifting weights) requiring 10-15 reps of each exercise
a cooldown period (walking for at least ten minutes)


Diets rich in fiber, whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables will improve your healthDrink water and limit your intake of caffeinated beverages and alcohol.

You may start to see the person as “all bad” and that every action he or she takes is somehow an act of defiance against you. However, with some distance, you can start to see the situation (and the person) more clearly. Take a couple steps back and allow yourself to gain some perspective. You may realize you are being critical or harsh, or not taking responsibility for what you contribute.Reflect more on yourself than the other person. Are there things within you that you’re unable to examine, such as guilt, shame, or fear? How do your shadows or demons contribute to your relationship?;
, Without jumping back into the fight, talk about what feelings, situations, and other factors led to the poor communication. Specifically, talk about your feelings. What were you feeling before the fight? What about during the fight? Ask these questions to this person and discuss your feelings clearly and openly.You may have felt tired, lonely, hungry, or overwhelmed before the fight. Perhaps you were feeling stressed from work or school and carried the stress home with you.
During the fight, you may have felt ignored, defensive, criticized, misunderstood, fearful, overwhelmed, ashamed, or unloved.

, Together with the person, ask what went missing in the fight. Was there a misunderstanding? Misperception? Poor communication?How did a discussion turn into a fight, or how did it stay a fight? Identify what set things off course.


Think about how to communicate more clearly in the future, or not to jump to conclusions so quickly. What can you learn from the misdirection of this fight?

, Take a moment away from the specific subject of the fight and focus on validating each other’s feelings. Listen intently when the person speaks. Avoid interrupting or jumping in with your opinion or perspective and instead, allow the person to complete each thought. Lower your defenses and open your heart.Talk about each of your perspectives of the situation, keeping in mind that there is no “wrong” perspective.For instance, the fight may have been about finances, but this person may have been triggered by a fear of not having enough money and lashed out. Instead of fighting about money, acknowledge your partner’s fear and validate those feelings.

, Take ownership for what you contributed to the fight. Admit that you accused your partner, said something mean, or spoke before having all of the information. Admit if you’ve been emotionally closed off, running on empty, taking your stress out on this person, or taking the person for granted. Take responsibility for your words and actions without blaming.Say, “I know I contributed heavily to this fight. I’ve been working overtime at work which has caused me a lot of stress, and I’ve been taking out this stress on you. I haven’t slept well in weeks, so I feel overly sensitive and irritable, and these feelings definitely contributed to the fight.”

, Forgiveness is about freeing yourself and letting go of any resentments or hard feelings.When you hold onto resentment, it can have physical and emotional impacts that negatively impact your life.


Forgiveness doesn’t mean forgetting or pretending that the situation didn’t happen, it just means you’re willing to let it go and move on.

, Demand and withdrawal can be a popular pattern in a relationship: one person brings up a topic (such as household cleaning, money, or childcare) and the other person immediately withdraws (such as crossing the arms or becoming immediately disengaged). If you notice patterns in your fights, learn to block them from the very beginning. For instance, if the withdrawal response is crossing arms, notice if you (or the other person) begins to cross arms, then take a different approach. Call a “time out” and come back when you feel you can engage differently with each other.When you notice withdrawing behaviors, say, “ I don’t want this conversation to spin in circles like other conversations. Let’s take a break, process what’s going on, and then come back.”

, Get out of the habit of blaming the other person for things. This can lead to the person feeling defensive. Saying, “I’m really sad I didn’t see you at the party last night” has a different tone than saying, “Why weren’t you at the party last night? Where were you?” Instead of putting your focus on the other person, put the focus on yourself. Own your feelings and express them in conversations openly. While it may seem more natural to place blame or accusations, turn the focus on yourself and express your feelings.For example, if you’re mad at someone, avoid saying, “I can’t believe what you did, you’re so careless and unkind” and instead say, “I feel really hurt and I’m having a hard time understanding your actions.”

, Find ways to mitigate your negative emotions and control them when they start to erupt. Practice mindful awareness by noticing when your thoughts become negative, what triggers them, and how you release the negative emotions.When noticing negative thoughts or emotions, switch your awareness to your body. Where do you feel the negativity? Can you relax that part of your body? What does the relaxation do to your thoughts and emotions?

, You may be more upset with someone’s patterns than who the person actually is. Spend less time figuring who is “right” or who is “wrong” and instead focus on the pattern that is enacted. You may notice you fight more around certain times (like right before visiting your family) or situations (like when rent or the mortgage is due). Instead of getting mad at the person, determine to change the pattern.If you see a pattern of fighting when dishes are in the sink, say, “I notice things get tense between us when we neglect the dishes. I don’t want to fight, so I’m wondering if we can do this differently.”

, Some things will be near impossible to accept or see eye to eye on with certain people. Accept each other’s differences without criticism or blame.Acknowledge that you can love this person despite the differences you have. Recognize that there is no one person on the planet that will agree with you on everything. You can learn to talk about why you hold these specific differences and how they are influenced. Some things cannot be changed and it’s okay to acknowledge that.


For instance, you may have a particular political stance due to how you were raised, what you’ve experienced, or in tandem with certain beliefs. Express this to the other person and allow the other person to express this view to you, too. Then, accept the person, even if he or she differs from you.

, Trust is an integral part of a relationship, and there are ways to gradually build trust over time. When you suspect the person is distressed, choose to move toward the person and not away from the person. Respond in a gentle, kind, understanding, non-defensive and empathetic way.This is especially important when you want to do one thing but it looks like the person needs some support. Make the decision to support the person and let go of your wants for the moment.


If you notice the person looks sad, ask what is going on. Show your care and trust in small ways by being there and not ignoring even “small” occurrences.

, Reflect on whether shame exists in the relationship. You or your partner may feel shame about behavior or one of you may try to shame the other in a fight. As much as you can, keep shame out of the relationship. If it does exist, talk about it. Things like guilt and shame do not motivate positive behavior or encourage change.To deal with insecurities, guilt, and shame, talk about the insecurities you have in your relationship. Share your story and ask for empathy from your partner.

, One of the best parts of a budding relationship is getting to know the other person, finding commonalities, and discovering parts of yourself along the way. Relive this period by sharing and asking questions. Share your hopes, dreams, silly thoughts, and even your insecurities.Find some discussion questions or come up with your own. You can start with, “If you could know one thing about your past or your future, what would it be?” or “If given the chance to speak with an animal, which animal would you chose, and what would you ask?”

, Reach out and bridge the separation between the two of you with a warm hug. Touch (like hugging, placing your hand on a shoulder, or holding hands) can help to connect you two and build compassion.Touch can help you re-establish connection and begin to rebuild emotional bonds.

Find others who are looking to get even.,
Assign a role to everyone.,
Practice and rehearse.,
Execute the plan for getting even.,
Bask in your glory!",How to Get Even2," Chances are you’re not the only one who feels wronged. This could come in handy when looking for ways to get even.


Maybe your coworker has wronged several of you. Work with others to formulate a plan.
Grab your friends for a multi-front getting even scheme. You can all use social media to your advantage, or if you have access to your target's apartment or home, enough of you can easily rearrange his furniture, and if you really want to get even, you can do something like putting his mattress on the roof.

, Just like every great heist flick, or mafia movie, everyone has a role. Figure out who is going to distract your target, who’s going to be the lookout, who’s going to be the greaseman, etc. Getting even requires precision when there are many moving parts so make sure everyone knows his role.

, You wouldn’t play in the Superbowl without practicing, so don’t get even without some rehearsal.

, Now that everyone has been assigned a role, it’s time to put your plan into action.


If you’re getting even with your coworker, know how long it will take you to complete your task. Have you and your compatriots get to work early to clock how much time you have.
If you’re getting even with your friend, know what his schedule is like and how long it will take you to get in and get out. If you need his phone or computer pay attention to how he uses it and if he leaves it unlocked. Alternatively, if he has a passcode on his phone, one simple option here is to have your other friend distract your target while you put in the wrong passcode enough times to lock him out. You can even lock him out for 24 hours if you’re feeling especially vindictive.

, You did it! You and your friends got even, now relish in your achievements with a beverage or two.

"
"
Make the decision to let it go.It might sound counterintuitive to getting even, but sometimes the best way to get even is by leaving it up to karma and making peace with yourself.,
Express how you feel.,
Focus on the present and the future.,
Forgive him.Sometimes showing someone you forgive him is a very powerful way to get even.",How to Get Even3," Show the person who wronged you that his immaturity doesn’t affect you by deciding to just let it go.

, Deciding to let it go doesn’t mean ignoring what happened. Feel free to confront the person who wronged you and tell him that what he did isn’t ok.


Letting it go also doesn’t have to mean that things stay the same. For example: stop letting your friend take advantage of your relationship by not loaning him things or letting him use your stuff.

, You can’t change the past, but you can change how you let what happened affect your future.


Dwelling on things that have happened to you isn't always bad, but when you can't let something go, especially if it's a negative memory or feeling, you can get stuck in a sort of neutral zone.If you're taking the high road approach and deciding to move forward, try setting positive goals to accomplish or flip negative feelings into positive ones. For example: if your coworker made you look bad, maybe it's a cry for help. Perhaps he actually looks up to you and values you. In the future try and help him with his work.

, And just because you forgive, doesn’t mean you have to forget.


Forgiveness can come in plenty of forms, from simply telling someone that you forgive him to helping him accomplish something he's having trouble with.
Express your feelings verbally. Tell him why his actions offended you, and how he made you feel.
Put yourself in his shoes. What's the reason for his actions? Think of a time you felt similar and what you did to move past the situation.
If all else fails, just breathe. Take some time to yourself and take a few deep breaths, try to remember that the world is larger than you and what's going on in your life.

Be happy.,
Forgive your ex-girlfriend.,
Maintain a positive mental attitude.Viewing your daily life and experiences in a positive way can improve your health, the quality of your relationships, and chances for success.,
Move on.",How to Make an Ex Girlfriend Suffer2," Finding happiness is a lifelong journey, but there are a number of ways to reach it. Form “happiness habits” which make being happy second nature by doing one of the following:


Try to find happiness in everyday situations.Tell yourself a story as you go through the day, focusing especially on the good things. For instance, maybe you ate a delicious breakfast, heard a funny joke from a coworker, or took a relaxing shower. Appreciating and remembering these simple things can make a mediocre day great.
Spend time with friends and family who care about and respect you.
Practice empathy. If a client or guest is late, or your kids make a mess, try to empathize with them instead of becoming angry. After all, nobody can be punctual all the time, and kids tend to make messes once in awhile.Practice meditation. Regular mediation will adjust the “set point” in your brain, the point at which you feel happy or unhappy. You will become more empathetic and feel happy more often., Even if she doesn’t deserve it, you do. When you hold on to a grudge or to pain someone else caused you, it wears you out emotionally and mentally.Breaking up always hurts. Acknowledge that you have been hurt and confront the pain in order to move through it to a state of forgiveness.
Accept that both you and your ex-girlfriend are flawed. Nobody is perfect.
You don’t need to communicate with the ex-girlfriend you are forgiving to forgive her.However, when you feel ready, you might want to communicate your feelings about your breakup to her.
Forgiveness doesn’t mean you are not allowed to continue feeling sad, disappointed, or otherwise.
Hating your ex may feel good in the short run, but in the end it will only trap you, and leave you feeling more angry and frustrated., Changing your mental attitude in a positive way will help you realize that life after your ex-girlfriend is gone is still worth living.


Practice positive affirmation. When you encounter a negative thought such as “I am never good enough for anyone,” visualize the words in your mind and watch them drift away. Replace this thought with a positive one, such as “I deserve love and respect.”
Stay conscious of your thoughts and feelings throughout the day. Doing so will give you control of your mental attitude and help you overcome feelings of jealousy, hate, anger, disappointment, and self-doubt.
When you do encounter failures at work or school, reflect on them as opportunities to do something better the next time around. Don’t let one failure -- or breakup – blind you to the fact that you’re equally capable of success and victory.
Adopt a daily mantra and begin each day with it. For instance, maybe your personal mantra is “Today will be a good day and I will do my best to make it so.” Recite the words of your personal mantra in front of the mirror before leaving each day., Don’t dwell on the past. Minimize or eliminate contact between you and your ex. You can be just as happy alone or with someone else as you were with your ex-girlfriend.It is okay to still love your ex-girlfriend. But understand that love alone is often not enough to make a relationship work, especially if it is only felt by one partner in the relationship. Accept your pain and heartbreak, and give yourself time to let your love for your ex transform into the more caring, compassionate, universal love you have for a friend.
Stay in contact with mutual acquaintances. Depending on the length of your relationship, you and your ex-girlfriend may share many friends. Moving on with your life doesn’t mean you have to abandon shared friends. Be cordial to them despite whatever happened between you and your ex.

Keep your distance.,
Embrace positive changes.,
Define your relationship.",How to Make a Guy Regret Losing You1," He doesn’t get to decide when and if you talk again. Of course you need to respect any boundaries or requests of his, but if he’s left it open, you choose when you’ll talk again and how, be it via phone, text, or email. This may be difficult initially, but with practice, keeping your distance will be easier.Your control over the initial communications shows him that he no longer has unrestricted access to you.
Go at least one month after your breakup before you speak again.
For example, if you used to send him a message the day of a doctor’s appointment to remind him to go, don’t do that now. He will need to rely on his calendar, not you.
Or, don’t call to tell him that your favorite movie has come on television. Instead, make some popcorn and enjoy your show.;
, After the breakup, it’s time to reinvent yourself a little. Not for your ex or anyone else, but for you. You deserve a fresh beginning. Maybe you’ve been interested in joining a club or taking up a hobby – now’s the perfect time. Or perhaps you’d like to connect with someone who you’ve lost touch with – now’s the perfect time. Whatever you choose, give yourself permission to change, to be even better than you were yesterday, and do it for you and nobody else.Your ex will see positive changes in you and notice that you’re moving on and growing without him. He will hopefully be happy for you and almost definitely regret that he’s not a part of it.

, It’s important that you both have a clear understanding of what your relationship is and isn’t. You are together or you aren’t. It can be difficult to stick to your word, but you need to tell him that you’re together or over. There is no on and off option and you won’t be sticking around for him to come back to when he chooses.This is about you asserting control over yourself and your emotional health.
You can tell him, “Now that we’ve broken up, we need to figure out what our relationship is and how we’ll interact with one another, if at all. There cannot be ambiguity here and I need closure.”

Pay attention to the way he treats you.,
Observe group settings.,
Notice lack of commitments.,
Study his body language.,
Provoke responses.",How to Figure Out if Your Guy Is Mad at You1," Anger can manifest as avoidance, snippiness, negative body language, aggressiveness, or uneven emotional temperaments. This means that anger doesn’t always transfer itself as a disagreement.If he is a quiet person, avoidance may not mean he is mad. If he is constantly outspoken, snippiness could just be his sarcasm. Only take note of these body language traits if they are different than his normal behavior.;
, If he is avoiding direct engagements, showing deference, paying more attention to others than normal, or making offhanded slights, he may be suppressing anger. Overanalyzing these factors will cause problems, so discuss these interactions with friends that were in the group. Make sure to ask a friend that has consistently been around both of you in group settings to get a proper opinion., This doesn’t mean that if he hasn’t proposed, he’s mad at you. Simply taken, if he can’t commit to a date night or party in the future, he could be angry. If he’s angry at the moment, he won’t want to commit to something in the future with you.

, Anger won’t always manifest itself as aggression and violence. Although these are clear signs of anger, his body language won’t always be this straight forward. Crossing his arms is a sign that he has put up his defensive shield and is blocking you out. The extent of arm crossing indicates how firmly closed he is. An extreme version which may indicate additional hostility is a tight close with hands formed as fists. If legs are crossed, it adds to this signal.Note that not all crossed arms are defensive. Often, crossed arms are used when the person is cold in temperature. So don’t take only this body language change to deduce that your guy is mad at you., Using positive behavior should result in a positive reaction. Doing something nice and receiving a cold response is an indicator of an issue. Do something nice for him, like making him a snack or giving him a gift, and make a note of how he responds.

"
"
Stop calling or texting him.,
Wait some time before returning his calls or text messages.,
Limit social media posts.,
End the conversation first.",How to Make Him Miss You1," If you are constantly calling and texting him, he won’t have any time to think about missing you. Take a break from the daily phone time, and wait for him to call or text. When you stop calling or texting, he’ll wonder why, and this will cause him to start thinking about you and missing you., When we like someone, we typically jump at the chance to return their phone calls and text messages because we’re so excited. If you want a guy to miss you, you need to create that moment of longing for your response.


When he calls you, don’t answer, and let it go to voicemail. Wait a few minutes, and then call him back, telling him you couldn’t answer because you were really busy.
After receiving a text message, wait about 5 to 10 minutes before responding. This will give him time to start longing for your response, and make him start thinking about what you might be doing without him.

, If you're someone who is constantly updating social media with your activities, try limiting how much you post. Social media posts are an easy way for people to stay connected and never feel like they’re missing you. When you post less, your guy will start to miss learning about what’s going on in your life.Limit communication with your guy on social media as well. If you use social media to talk to him when you aren’t together, stop this form of communication for a while. He’ll be wanting to hear from you and will hopefully reach out when he starts missing you.

, Start hanging up the phone or ending the text conversation before he does, especially if you’re usually the last to say goodbye. Being the first to end the conversation will leave him wanting more, and keep you on his mind until he talks to you again. This longing for more communication will start to drive him wild with his desire to talk to you."

Visualize winning him over.,
Be confident and strong.,
Find other things to focus on.",How to Make a Guy That Used to Like You Like You Again1," It's inevitable that you will spend some time thinking about the guy who used to like you too, but you can control how you spend that time. Imagine how it will be and what it will feel like when you do win him back. Envision this as a future memory and not a distant one. Positive thinking goes much further than you often realize.;
, This is often easier said than done when you're trying to win back someone who rejected you. However, appearing sad or desperate is a guaranteed way NOT to win him back. Show him you are capable of moving on.

, Even though you can win back the guy who used to like you, it's not going to happen overnight. Constantly thinking about him will not do anything but cause undue stress. Take up a new hobby or devote more energy to your career and friends. In addition to having less time to focus on this guy, this will make you feel like you have regained some control of your life.

"
Get some exercise.,
Be social.,
Practice positive thinking.,
Focus on your strengths.,
Get to know yourself.",How to Make a Guy Regret Losing You2," Exercise really does nourish the body, mind, and heart. Whether you enjoy exercising initially or not, keep with it. Make exercise a new habit. Your body will become stronger, your brain will actually work better, and you’ll nourish your heart.There are plenty of gyms that offer monthly memberships now, meaning you get all the perks of a gym without a lengthy contract to bog you down.

, Get out there, be social, and enjoy your life. Take this opportunity to reconnect with people and activities that bring you joy. This is also an opportunity to discover new social activities that you have been meaning to look into. He will likely hear about your new social life, or he may even see photos online, and he’ll see that you’re living your life without him.See your friends
Go to dinner
Go to the theater
Go to festivals – make a day trip of it
Join a meetup group
Join a hobby club
Don’t go overboard with pictures of you going out, as it may give the appearance that you’ve lost self-control because of your breakup.

, There’s an idea that you attract what you think, and if you think positive thoughts, you’ll attract positive energy in your life. More than that, by practicing positive thinking, you’ll learn to quiet all those negative, self-doubt thoughts that tend to creep up when we least expect them. Positive thinking is a habit that takes work, but is well worth the effort.Start small. Think about a negative thought that you tend to have and how you could make it positive. Then, the next time you have that negative thought, push it away and replace it with the positive thought instead.
For example, you might have a recurring thought that you’re just not as talented as everyone else and that you’ll never be successful. Counter that negative talk. You are merely expressing fear and anxiety, not a true fact. Instead of letting your fears and worries run rampant, correct your fearful thinking. For instance, you could say, “Everyone has a talent. I just have to discover mine.” And, “There are many ways to be successful. I have succeeded in many aspects of my life already. I will find ways to be successful every day, and I will continue to find ways to improve.""

, You have strengths, and you need to focus on them. Focusing on what you do well will encourage you to continue thriving and succeeding. Your success is yours, and it is something that nobody can take from you. You build it by exploiting your own talents and, as with anything, the more you do it, the better you’ll become. And your continued growth will only open up more opportunities for personal growth and advancement.You might consider your professional strengths, or your personal talents, or even your artistic abilities. Combine strengths to develop something truly unique to you.
For example, you’ve been a hobby baker for years. You absolutely love making homemade goodies and sharing them with your loved ones. Consider starting a blog in which you highlight your baking skills and recipes.
Or perhaps you’re great at organizing and juggling complex tasks. You’re the person that people go to at work to fix problems, especially when they seem too big to handle. You can use these skills and start your own business on the side as a personal assistant or even a life coach.
Maybe you absolutely love animals and would love to spend more time with them. You have an almost empathic connection with them, it seems. Take that special talent and volunteer at a sanctuary for the rehabilitation of animals or the zoo.

, You might find yourself wondering “what now?” after a breakup. You’re so accustomed to sharing experiences with another person that you may have lost touch with yourself. Getting to know yourself and figuring out who you are, what your likes and dislikes are, and even how you feel about religious and political matters are essential to moving forward. When you move forward, he will see what he’s missing out on.Start out simply and make a list. List what you like to do for fun, what adventures you’d like to take, your dream vacations, your hobby interests. Make as many lists as necessary. The acts of considering yourself and writing your thoughts down will help you get to know yourself much better.
Or you can meditate, formally or less formally, by simply closing your eyes, doing calming breathing, and allowing yourself to sit in silence. Acknowledge and quiet your thoughts so that you’re alone with only yourself with no distractions.

Make new friends.,
Treat yourself.,
Be kind to yourself.,
Have fun.,
Create new habits.",How to Make a Guy Regret Losing You3," Whether you lost a few friends in the breakup or not, it’s a good idea to make new friends after you’ve broken up. That is not to say that you should get rid of your current friends, but that you should expand your social circle. Making new friends will open you up to new experiences and will also help you distance yourself from your ex. If you don’t share the same social circle, he won’t always be able to keep tabs on you either, which will allow you some room to heal.The digital age has really opened up options when it comes to meeting people. You can join local Facebook groups, or MeetUp groups, or participate in message boards. These groups can be about shared interests (books, movie genres, or even music), or geography (city, state, neighborhood), or even shared experiences (parenthood, divorce, military veterans).
Also, your local bookstores and coffee houses will likely have groups that meet regularly for a common interest or goal.
If you attend school, your high school or college will have social, sport, and academic clubs that you can participate in.

, You deserve to treat yourself to something that you normally wouldn’t splurge on. Go for it – pamper yourself a little, or go exploring, go on a date with yourself, or maybe get that hand bag you’ve been looking at for the longest time. Think of one or two things that you’d really enjoy and give yourself a gift.Try going on a trip or vacation alone. Take some time to explore a new place or experience something new by yourself.
Pamper yourself with self-care gifts. Maybe now is the time to buy that massage package or those new pots and pans you’ve been looking at.
Take yourself out – go to a bookstore, or dinner, or even a movie.

, You know that being kind to others is important because it helps someone else and also makes you feel better. But you can’t forget to be kind to yourself, especially now. You take care of others and now it’s time to take care of yourself. He will regret that he’s missing out on your kindness.Stop and get yourself a coffee on the way to work.
Go splurge on a new outfit, game, or piece of sporting equipment.
Compliment yourself – find one thing every day to compliment yourself about.
Be patient with yourself.

, You want him to regret losing you, but the most important focus should be your own happiness. Go out and have fun! Don’t worry about his regret. You can’t control how he feels. But you can have fun – go out with friends, go play miniature golf, go swimming, go camping – just go out and have fun., This is a little different than changing your routine. Creating new habits means developing positive new behaviors that become almost second nature with repetition. New habits that you develop should be created with the sole focus of improving your life or making you happier. After all, your happiness is great for you and attractive to others.Your habits might be learning based, such as learning two new foreign language vocabulary words every morning or spending 20 minutes reading the news.
Or they might be more physical based, such as doing two minutes of sit-ups and pushups every morning.
Or they might be spiritually based, such as reading from a religious text for half an hour every evening.

Choose a spot to talk.,
Rehearse an opening.,
Be persistent.,
Stay engaged in the conversation.,
Be prepared to empathize.",How to Figure Out if Your Guy Is Mad at You2," Finding a safe, quiet space is good for both you and him. It will make both of you feel more comfortable and open than if you were in front of other people. If you want to have friends there to help you feel more comfortable, make sure you don’t make him feel attacked. Don’t gang up on him, or he is likely to shut you out.


Talk to him directly, rather than over the phone. This will cause him to answer quickly and directly. If you discuss it with him over the phone, he has leverage and can respond at his leisure, promoting negative conflict management., Either with a close friend, a pet, or in the mirror, prepare the first few minutes of the conversation. This can be an awkward moment for your guy and if he feels attacked, misled, or ambushed, you’ll want to stay direct and emotionally neutral. This will help him feel more comfortable in opening up to you.


”I feel like you’ve been angry at me about something, and I’ve been thinking about what. Can we clear the air?”
”Lately, I feel like we haven’t been the same. I’ve noticed you shutting me out, are you angry about something?”
”Is something bothering you? You’ve been acting differently lately and I would love to help you.”

, Do not escalate the emotional level of the conversation by showing inconsistent feelings. Stay positive and consistent to keep the conversation flowing. Remind him that you’re concerned about him and that you want to help him through any conflicts he might be feeling.

, Show you care by using positive eye contact and by talking with your hands. Occasionally touching his hand or shoulder will encourage him to be more open. Avoid rolling your eyes at all costs! He will take this as annoyance on your part and can make him more upset with you., If he is mad, it is important that you don’t get defensive. Be prepared to apologize for any mistakes you have made. You’ve put him on the spot and asked him to be open to sharing his anger with you, denying it or becoming aggressive may close this window in future conversations.

Find a signature scent.,
Be mysterious and surprising.,
Leave things in his car or at his house.,
Leave him wanting more.",How to Make Him Miss You2," Find a subtle scent to wear every time you are around your guy. He will begin to associate this smell with you, and it gives him another sense to miss you with. When you aren’t with your guy, he'll begin to miss the smell of you and crave smelling your signature scent.Make sure you don’t wear too much or he might be turned off by the strong scent. Wear just enough for it to be smelled when someone is very close to your body.
To create this effect with smell, you have to wear the same scent every time you are around him.
This also works when you want to make your ex-boyfriend miss you. If you show up to a place he’s at wearing the scent you used to wear, he’ll instantly associate it with the time he was with you.

, If you are a complete open book when you first meet a guy, it won’t leave him with anything to be surprised by. Instead, you should tell an interesting fact about yourself each time you get together. This will leave your guy wanting to hear more about you, and waiting to find out what new thing he'll learn next. Be spontaneous with him. If you usually go to dinner for dates, invite him on an adventure like rock climbing one day. This spontaneity will excite him and keep him guessing at what you’ll want to do next.

, If you casually leave one of your belongings at your guy’s house or in his car, it will constantly remind him of you. When he’s reminded of you, he will start to think about you and miss being with you. Small personal items that you don’t need daily work best for creating this subtle reminder of you.A hairbrush
Jewelry
Makeup
A pen or notebook
A small picture

, Whenever you go out with your guy, you should always leave him wanting more. More kisses, more laughter, more fun, more conversations, you just want to leave him wanting more of you. You can do this by taking your time and having clear time limits with your time spent together.Cut conversations short because you have to get home at a certain time.
Only give him one sweet kiss at the end of the night to make him dream of wanting more kisses.
Have self control when it comes to your personal curfew times. You’ll probably want to spend more time with him, but if you leave when you planned, you’ll get him to want more time with you.

Create space between you and him.,
Go out with friends and tell him about it.,
Use social media to highlight the fun you’re having independently.,
Give yourself a makeover, and then go see him.",How to Make Him Miss You3," A guy can’t miss you if you’re always right there for him. A great way to get him to miss you is to create space between the two of you. If you spend every minute of the weekend with him, start carving out time to spend away from him. Spend a Friday night at home alone or with friends instead of hanging out with your man. At first he will probably like the time alone, but if you begin to do this regularly, he’ll start missing you in his arms.

, Start having nights out with your friends instead of date nights, and then tell your guy all about how much fun you had. He will probably be happy for you, but he’ll also be a bit jealous of how much fun you can have without him. If you spend a couple weekends having fun with friends, you’re guy will soon start to miss being the person that's having fun with you.


This works well with an ex-boyfriend as well. When an ex sees that you’re having fun and enjoying life without him, he will begin to miss being in your life.

, Start to post pictures and status updates about how much fun you’re having doing things on your own. This works very well when trying to get an ex to miss you. Show how much you’re enjoying life on your own, and your guy will be begging to hang out with you because he misses you so much.


Don’t be fake on social media, just highlight the fun you’re having going out with friends and participating in activities on your own.

, Treat yourself to a new hairstyle and new clothes so that you look and feel awesome. Dress yourself up, and then go meet your guy somewhere. He’ll be surprised at your new look, and want to see you more.If you want your ex-boyfriend to miss you, show up with your new look to somewhere you know he’ll be. Walk by him looking awesome and as confident as ever. This will make him wish he was still with you and miss the time he used to be in your life.

Try making him miss you to help him see how special you are.,
Switch to straightforward communication when you're ready for more.,
Avoid making him miss you as a way to manipulate him.",How to Make Him Miss You4," Flirting with a guy you like by dressing up, using a sweet-smelling perfume, showing him that you've got a big social life, and so on can help him see that you're interested - and interesting. There's no harm in playing a little hard to get, as long as you don't get too consumed by trying to attract his attention.

, Making him miss you might turn his head initially, but eventually he'll get bored if you wait forever to answer his texts or avoid him for too long between dates. He might also catch on to your plot to make him miss you if you spend too much time bragging about the fun you have without him. Instead of figuring out new ways to make him miss you, try telling him how you really feel.

, It's normal to want your ex to miss you when you're gone, especially if you were the one who got dumped. However, focusing too much on making him miss you will probably end up backfiring. You'll get too obsessed by what he thinks, when instead you should be moving on. Give yourself, and him, a break and don't try to manipulate him after you've already broken up.

In the early stages of trying to win him back, try to keep the interactions short and sweet. Don't put yourself in a position where you will feel tempted to bring up negative feelings.

, If you call or text a guy repeatedly, he will often view this as harassment or stalking and be turned off by it. Limiting your contact will also leave him wanting more, and make him more likely to come to you.

, Once you have spent some time together again, this is an appropriate step to do. Use your eyes to flirt or wear a bold red lipstick. Remember, there's a difference between playfully flirting and appearing desperate. Guys love to feel like there ""all that and more"" laugh at his jokes unless they upset you. Make him feel like he has control but not to much control.

, If he ever complimented you on a shirt you wore, or you had a particularly good day with him while wearing a certain outfit, don't be afraid to bring those items out again.

, When you're ready to make the first bold move in winning him back, remind me of the good times you both enjoyed together. Bring up a funny anecdote or a particularly fun or sexy date.

Listen to yourself.",How to Love Yourself After a Long Battle in an Abusive Relationship," You may still feel helpless and overwhelmed, but take a minute to feel pride that you are doing something about improving your life. The biggest step is over, and you freed yourself from the grips of an abusive relationship. You will be busy trying to figure out how to start your life on a different path and begin the process of emotional healing, but it's important to take a moment to appreciate your own strength. You did it. You're free.;
, Do some things that you enjoy, both little and big, to get the healing process started. Give yourself a break. Whether it's a hot bath, a TV binge, or a long vacation, it's important to allow yourself little extras and big rewards during this healing process.


Especially indulge everything your abuser forbade for no good reason. You really can put your favorite music on and dance to it while you clean up, laugh at your favorite comedian, and enjoy eating the foods your abuser hated. Reclaim those small joys in life, one by one, for yourself.

, Gaining emotional strength may be a long road, and your abuser will likely try to win you back. It's important to eliminate contact with this individual regardless of how charming or apologetic the actions and words seem to be. Allow yourself the opportunity to heal and pull yourself away from your abuser's manipulative spell completely.


Well-meaning friends and family, possibly unaware of how bad your situation was, may try to convince you that you should stay with the abuser. Ignore this advice. You don't need to return to a physically or emotionally abusive relationship ""for the kids"" or because your partner ""is going through something.""
Whatever you do to help the healing process move along, don't go back. It only gets worse. You only get one life, do not chance losing it because you think that person will change.

, The early signs of serious anxiety and stress-related depression are all made worse with poor diet, lack of exercise, and sleeplessness. These factors can start to cycle and spiral downward, making it very hard to start the healing process. You're likely exhausted and you need to get plenty of rest.Sleep as late as it seems like you need to.


Try to move your work schedule around some, if you can, to make sure you're getting enough sleep. See if anyone could switch shifts with you to go on to a later shift, so you don't need to get up. Better yet, consider taking some time off work and resting up, healing your body and your mind.

, Talking to and learning from other abuse sufferers can be an important step in your recovery. It's recommended that all survivors or domestic violence reach out and talk in a safe and accepting environment to help learn the skills to cope and to move on. To find a support group in your area, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or TTY 1-800-787-3224.


It is natural for us to want companionship and love, especially during times of transition. Surround yourself with friends, animals, or new experiences, as opposed to responding to any offers that may be made by the abuser. Don't go back when you want companionship, find it elsewhere.

, The abuse that you endured was not your fault, and there is never any justification for abuse, emotional or physical. All people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. It's important to let go of feelings of guilt you may be experiencing as a result of ending this relationship, and let your healing continue.


Write down a list of people in your life who make you feel good about yourself and who'll be willing to talk to you when you're struggling through something. If you feel like going back to your abuser, or if you feel yourself cycling down into feelings of negativity and guilt, call up your friend for a coffee or a quick chat.

, Write down all the abuser's criticisms that haunt you and cause you to keep undervaluing yourself. Get them out. Don't worry about trying to reason with them, refute them, or disagree with them. They're not even worthy of that. Instead, take the paper and burn it over a candle, or tear it up and flush it down the toilet. Destroy those negative comments, as a ritual. Let them go and never think of them again.


It's very important to stop obsessing over the negativity and the content of the emotional abuse that you endured. Don't argue with the criticism, or with the abuser.Don't worry about refuting the criticisms, because it was never worth listening to in the first place. It's beneath you.

, You may feel as if you were abused because you are unattractive, uninteresting or unworthy, but this is not true. You were abused because somebody cruel chose to treat you badly.


Right now, write down a list of times in your life that you felt confident, satisfied, and happy. What are your biggest successes? What have you done right?
Whenever you find yourself feeling unworthy because of the false messages your abuser gave you, use your lists of positive memories to counteract your negative feelings.
At this stage, you have to actively remind yourself that you do have lots of good qualities and you do deserve to be treated properly.

, Mantras are little reminders, like tokens, talismans, or good luck charms made of language. When you're struggling with self-doubt or disappointment, many people find solace in chanting a self-improvement mantra to comfort and calm. Prayers, aphorisms, and song lyrics are all great mantras. It doesn't need to be more complicated than, ""I'm good enough.""


Find an idea that comforts you personally and that is worded in a short sentence you can memorize. ""Grant me the strength to accept the things I cannot change"" is a common mantra.
Focusing on one thing and repeating the words is usually enough to help many people calm down and find an inner peace for a few moments. Even if you chant, ""Hey, ho, rock and roll, deliver me from nowhere"" it can work.

, Professional abuse counseling can help you process the whirlwind of emotions produced by your tumultuous relationship. Talking with friends is helpful, but it's important to have someone who is completely non-biased. Someone who has no emotional ties to you or your abuser. Many areas have abuse counseling or shelters available at little or no charge.

, Seek support groups for people who shared your situation. Again, you need to talk to people who've been when you've been and who understand, to help you rebuild who you are. Make friends within these groups, and go out doing things you enjoy.


It's also important to spend time just socializing normally. Try to move on as much as possible.

, Abusers chip away at their victims' self-respect and self-image. It will take time to repair and rebuild the damage from the abuse, so be gentle with yourself, and don't expect it to happen all at once.


It might be necessary to take some time off from work and other responsibilities to get a clear head. How long? A week? A month? Who knows. Move through the process at your own speed.

, One by one, explore activities and interests that your abuser shut down by telling you that you were no good at them. Chances are, those are exactly the things that you shine in, the things that make you feel good about yourself. Even personal choices like what to eat, or how to arrange your clothes, are things you can indulge yourself in, and appreciate having them without fear or conflict.


How were you held back by your abuser? Was your desire for more responsibility at work mocked? Do you want to go back to school? Are you interested in a career change? Explore the possibilities and dreams that were shut down as a result of your relationship.

, Start moving forward with your life by setting manageable goals for yourself to improve in some area, and meeting those goals regularly. Whether career, health, or happiness goals, it's important to keep focused on satisfying yourself and living your own life. Set yourself a major and a minor goal, and then replace them with new ones when you satisfy each.


A major goal might be saving enough money to go on a big vacation you've always wanted to go on, while a minor goal might be exercising three times each week, or reading a new novel each week. When you satisfy your improvement goal, set a new one and keep up with the old one. Gradually improve yourself and find new purpose.
Make sure your goals are realistic. A good goal is something that you can actually measure and accomplish, not something abstract like, ""My goal is to be happy"" or ""My goal is to be better.""

, Start replacing your toxic memories of the past with joyful new memories and new experiences. Make your old abusive relationship seem distant by spending lots of time with new people, visiting new places, and never looking back except to heal.


Avoid locations, neighborhoods, and businesses that you used to frequent, even if you live in the same town as your abuser. Find new grocery stories, restaurants, and places to hang out. Move, if necessary.

Start dating again, when you're ready. This can take a long time for many people to feel comfortable enough in their own skin to trust another, so take your time and wait until you find someone worth it.

, Abusers can drag down your confidence and ruin your ability to control your own life. No one else is in charge of your life but you. You don't have anything to prove to anyone but yourself. You don't have to live to satisfy anyone but yourself. Listen to your heart and take joy in making your own decisions.

If you’re letting go of the man because he turned you down, then you need to be firm to yourself about the fact that it’s really over. If you told him you’d like to end the relationship, then it’s important to tell him as firmly as possible, so he has no doubts about the end of the relationship.;
, Don’t be embarrassed about feeling sad and work on letting all of those sad, angry, confused, or bitter feelings out. Cry as much as you need to, whether you’re alone at home or talking to a friend. Write all of your feelings down. Accept that you may need to be by yourself for a few days. Do whatever you can to get those feelings out on the surface, so you can begin to accept them and deal with them. The longer you keep them bottled up, the harder it will be to let go of the man you love.


Nothing is too sappy or too ridiculous. If you want to watch a romantic comedy and cry your eyes out, put on Love Actually and go for it. If you want to sing “Let it Go” at the top of your lungs, no one is stopping you.
This is your time to deal with your break-up, and you can let your feelings out however you want. If you find that you can’t cry, that’s okay too. If you’d rather punch a pillow, no one is stopping you.

, Don’t expect to be running around with your friends, having an amazing time with a martini in your hand, the weekend after you have to let go of the man you love. It can take months, or even longer, for you to be ready to really have fun again, and you shouldn’t put pressure on yourself to be “okay” right away. Though it’s probably a good idea to stop wallowing after a few days and to spend some time outdoors or with other people, you shouldn’t feel like you’re forcing yourself to put on a happy face too soon.


Every woman has her own timeline. The pain you feel will depend on your way of dealing with things, as well as the seriousness of your relationship. Don’t feel like you have to be “fine” after a week just because that’s what your friends expect.
Don’t force yourself to be social if you really don’t feel like it. There’s nothing worse than going to a big party when all you want to do is cry. That said, you should try to seek one-on-one hangouts with your friends so you feel less alone.

, One of the best ways to let go of the man you love is to stop talking to him, stop looking at him, and stop hearing his voice. If you have the luxury of cutting off all contact with him, then you should try to do so as soon as possible. Delete his number from your phone, avoid him on social media, and don’t have any awkward coffee dates until you’re really ready to just see him as a friend. If he keeps reaching out to you, make it clear that this is not what you need.


If you know you have to see him in places like school or work, then you don’t have to ignore him completely if that will make things awkward, but you shouldn’t feel obligated to make small talk with him, either.
Though you may be desperate to see him or to hear his voice, remember that this will only make things worse, in the end.

, Though you may be feeling desperate to keep spending time with him, or even to get back together with him, you have to remind yourself of the pain you’d feel if you had to go back to him. Think of how horrible he made you feel, of all the nights he made you cry into your pillow, or all of the pointless fights that made you so angry. It’s easy to only remember the good times, but you should focus on the bad times if you want to let go.


Any time you’re tempted to call the guy or to see what he’s been up to, just think of yourself during the worst day of your relationship. Remember all the pain you felt, and think of how awful it would be to feel even a fraction of that pain again.
Of course, you don’t have to make a habit of remembering all the bad times every day, if it makes you feel worse. But if you find yourself pining for your man, then it may be the best thing you can do to keep a level head.

, You may feel angry, sad, confused, and upset at yourself about the fact that you’re still thinking about this man. You may ask, “What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I get over him already?” but you have to avoid this kind of thinking. There’s no sense in being angry at yourself for what you’re feeling and you have to let nature take its course. There’s nothing wrong in having deep feelings, and being mad about them will only make things worse.


Of course, by making an effort to let go of the man you love, you’ll be moving the process along more quickly than you would if you were pining away in your room. But it’s important to remember that it still takes time to heal.
Instead of being disappointed in yourself for still feeling sad, be proud that you’re honest about your feelings instead of being in denial about how you really feel.

, This part won’t be easy, but you have to do it right if you want to move on. It’s time to go through your room, or even your home, and to get rid of all the things that remind you of the man. This could mean the teddy bear he got you at the carnival, the t-shirt of his you love sleeping in, or even the necklace he gave you on your anniversary. If you have an item that is truly valuable to you, then you should put it out for a long time if you just can’t bring yourself to throw it out.


This may be painful, and it won’t hurt to have the help of a trusted friend when you go through this. Just remember that it’s like ripping off a Band Aid: the sooner you do it, the sooner the pain will be gone.
If your room is covered with things that remind you of your man, then you won’t be able to move on as quickly because you’ll have more reason to subconsciously think of him.

, In today’s world, social media may be the way that you keep up with your ex the most after the relationship is over. You may tell yourself that you’re not really staying in touch with him if all you do is longingly scroll through his Twitter feed or check his Facebook photos for evidence of a new girlfriend, but really, this is just adding insult to injury. Make sure you’re no longer friends, followers, or associated in any way on social media, so you’re not stuck looking at a picture of your ex all day instead of moving on.


Don’t worry about him being upset if you defriend him or no longer want to be in touch on social media. This is about you feeling better, not about him.

, Take your mind off of your own problems and channel all of your energy productively by helping out your community. You’ll be doing a good deed, getting out of the house, and learning from people who can also benefit from your help. You’ll build your confidence and will feel better about yourself once you see that you really are needed, and that you are able to make a difference. Being part of a community of volunteers can also make you feel more connected and less alone after your break-up.


Of course, you shouldn’t volunteer simply to get over your ex, but because you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself.

, You may keep telling yourself that he was the one, that he was the most perfect man on the planet, and that no man you meet will ever compare to him. However, if he really was so amazing, then you’d probably still be together, wouldn’t you? Instead, you have to remember that your ex is just a person, too, and that he has flaws—maybe even many more flaws than you give him credit for.


The sooner you accept that your ex wasn’t perfect, the sooner you’ll be able to move on and to give other guys the time of day.
Once you get over the idea that your ex was Mr. Right, you’ll be able to have a more realistic perspective on your relationship.

, Before you can start dating again, you have to be truly content being on your own. This can sound nearly impossible, especially when you feel like all of your friends are coupled up or like you want nothing more than someone to snuggle with at the end of the day. However, if you want to truly let go of the man you’re with and to be ready to find love again, then you have to make sure you’re comfortable being on your own first.


It can take a while to accept and be happy with your solo status. Once you work on personal growth and loving yourself without your man, though, you’ll be on your way to being happy about it.
Spending more time with other single girlfriends can help, as long as they don’t encourage you to date too fast. If you spend all day around your married or coupled up friends, then you’re likely to be more down about being single.
If you want to be able to move on, then it’s important to be able to enjoy your own company first. You can’t depend on another person to make you like yourself more.

, You may think that the only cure for getting over your man is to find a new man ASAP, but this is the furthest thing from the truth. You’re much more likely to get over the man if you find peace on your own, instead of having to depend on another new guy to bring you comfort. If you go on the rebound immediately, then you won’t be giving yourself the time you need to heal properly, and you’ll actually prolong the pain.


Not only is rushing into a new relationship inadvisable for you, but it’s not fair for the other person. He may really like you, while you may find yourself using him just to fill a void.
Besides, if you try to date a new person in an effort to get over the old one, you may actually end up longing for your old significant other more, because the new one may seem inadequate in comparison.

, If you want to move on, then you have to work on improving yourself as a person and on reaching your full potential. You should stop worrying about your past relationship or future relationships, and focus on becoming the best that you can be. Once you find a meaningful routine for your life, you’ll find that you’re letting go of the man you love without even thinking about it—because you’ll be too busy thinking about yourself.


Think about three flaws you’d like to address and make a game plan for tackling them. At the same time, work on accepting the things that you absolutely can’t change about yourself.
Make a list of all the things you’ve wanted to do but haven’t tried and set a personal deadline for crossing them off your list.

, One thing you can do to let go of the man you love is to try a completely new hobby. This can be anything you had thought of trying before but never had the courage, time, or self-discipline to really do. It can be learning to bake pies, singing, taking yoga classes, or even taking a crack at that novel you’ve been meaning to write for the past five years. It doesn’t matter what you do—the important thing is that you throw yourself into becoming better at it.


It takes discipline to work on a hobby, and you should set a schedule that you can stick to so you’re always moving forward. This will help your drive and will keep your mind off of your ex.
You can also try picking up an old hobby from your childhood or something you haven’t done in years, such as sketching or playing tennis.

, There may be some activities that you always wanted to do with your ex, but he either never wanted to do it or you two just couldn’t get your act together. Well, there’s no time like the present to do those things and to move on without him. If you’ve always wanted to go hiking, ask a friend to go with you. If you always wanted to travel to a town in the next state, plan a road trip with your girls, or even go by yourself.


Doing something that doesn’t remind you of your ex can make you feel more independent and more like you’re really growing as an individual.
If there was something your ex hated, like going to the movies or eating sushi, enjoy doing that, now that there’s no one holding you back.

, If you want to let go of the man you love, then you have to spend more time with the ones nearest and dearest to you. Opening up to your friends and family members about your pain can help you feel more loved and less alone. They may offer advice, or they can just give you a shoulder to cry on, and you’ll feel comforted by their love and warmth.


Don’t think that you’re too much of a drag to hang out with people right now. It’s important that you get the love you need and deserve instead of isolating yourself.
Though you don’t need to completely fill up your social calendar and it’s important to leave time for yourself, you should make sure to hang out with a friend or family member at least once or twice a week so you don’t feel too lonely.

, This doesn’t mean you should start a dating profile or immediately get the digits of the cute guy you noticed from across the gym. It does mean, however, that you should make an effort to enjoy more friendships and to be a more social person. Ask an acquaintance out for coffee and see if you can turn it into a friendship. Hang out with the cool girl in your yoga class after your latest vinyasa session. Be more open to new social opportunities and you’ll be on your way to letting go of your man.


You can also draw on old friends, too. If you’ve lost touch with an old friend, call her up and see how she’s doing. If a childhood friend moved to your neighborhood, ask her to grab lunch.

, Another way to spend more time on yourself is to write in a journal. This can help you get some alone time and to be at one with your thoughts and feelings. Spending just 15 minutes a day writing down your thoughts or narrating what happened to you that day can make you feel more in control of your life and mind and less rushed. You can even read over what you wrote every Sunday to get a better sense of the ideas you’ve been having throughout the week.


You can also open up about your feelings about the man you lost, and feel comforted to express your feelings in a place of non-judgment. This can help you get over your feelings faster, and will make you more in touch with yourself.

, While you don’t need to book your social calendar for the next 365 days in order to let go of the man you love, you should make an effort to fill as much of your time with the things you love as you can. Make time to do yoga, to see your friends, to read your favorite book, and even to start a home-improvement project, while making time for your work or studies. Leave some time to decompress but make sure you always have something to look forward to so you don’t resort to moping.


Staying busy will help take your mind off of your pain and will also make it so you direct your focus elsewhere. That said, distraction can’t be your only method of letting go of the man you love.
If you really need some time to yourself, don’t feel compelled to be social. It’s important to know your limits.

, Getting some exercise will help you feel happier and healthier. You don’t want to spend all of your time in your room feeling sorry for yourself and eating ice cream—though ice cream can work wonders for a broken heart now and again! You need to make sure you get around 30 minutes of exercise each day and that you keep your body active and your limbs moving.


If you do something you love, such as yoga or running, then you’ll feel even better about exercise time; it shouldn’t have to feel like a chore.
Exercising outdoors can also help you feel less isolated because you’ll be surrounded by people and sunshine.

, If you want to let go of the man you love, then you have to focus more on yourself than ever. Give yourself the freedom and the license to spend more time doing the things that matter the most to you. Maybe you stopped reading as much because you spent all of your time with your man; what better time than now to start a book club? Maybe your favorite thing is to be out in nature; what’s stopping you from going on a week-long camping trip with your girlfriends?


The most important thing is that you remember to take care of yourself and to make yourself happy. If you focus on that, then the rest will follow. If you’re busy with your friends and family and spend time doing what you love, then you’ll be able to let go of the man you love before you know it.

Avoid contact.,
Don't talk directly to him.,
Find new attachment figures.,
Stay busy.,
Never let it bother you!,
Respond with kindness.,
Be the better person.,
Talk to your friends.,
Report dangerous behavior.",How to Ignore Your Mean Ex Boyfriend," Don't initiate any contact with your ex, including phone calls, texts, emails, messages on social media, and in-person conversations. If he tries to initiate contact with you, don't respond.


Depending on the situation, you may want to respond to a text or email by simply telling your ex that you are not interested in talking to him. If he is being completely unreasonable, don't bother responding.
If you are getting threatening messages from your ex or he is stalking you, report the behavior to the police immediately. You may be able to get a restraining order to keep him from contacting you or coming near you.
If your ex-boyfriend will not stop calling, texting, or emailing you, you can block his number and email address. If he is very persistent and starts calling you from other people's phones or emailing you from different addresses, you might want to consider changing your phone number and/or email address.
Most social media sites allow multiple options for blocking or ignoring a person. If you want to prevent your ex-boyfriend from viewing your profile and you want him to get the message that you don't want any contact with him, block him. If you don't want to take it to that extreme, but you also don't want to see any updates from your ex, ignore or unfollow him.If possible, avoid places where you know you are likely to run into your ex. If this is not possible, just keep walking when you see him instead of stopping to talk.;
, If you share mutual friends, have classes together, or work together, you might have no choice but to spend some time in the same room with your ex. It might be hard at first, but do your best to interact with everyone else in the room normally, and avoid talking to your ex as much as possible.Don't go overboard by literally pretending not to see him. This will probably make him think that you're uncomfortable being around him, which is not what you want. Instead, address him as you would a stranger. Keep your interactions brief and avoid body language that suggests intimacy, like direct eye contact.
If you're with a group of people, make an effort to talk to other people in the group instead of to your ex-boyfriend.
If your ex starts talking to you, respond politely, but very briefly, so he will know you're not interested in talking. For example, if he says, ""That math test was really hard. How do you think you did,"" just say, ""Fine,"" and show no interest in continuing the conversation.
If your ex-boyfriend tries to use other people to give you messages, respond according to the situation. If the messenger is your friend, just tell him that you're not interested in hearing what your ex has to say and you hope that he won't let that get in the way of your friendship. If the messenger is not your friend and has been sent by your ex to say something mean to you, just ignore him.

, If you're like most people, your boyfriend was probably the first person you went to for consolation when something bad happened to you, and also the first person you told when something exciting happened. This can make it very hard to let go of your ex because you may still feel like contacting him in these situations. Instead, try turning to a friend, a sibling, or a parent.It might be tempting to replace your ex with a new boyfriend, but don't do this unless you're really ready to commit yourself to a new relationship. If you do feel ready, then go ahead and date new people.

, It will be much easier to ignore your ex-boyfriend if you really are occupied with other things. Start doing more things with your friends, join a club, or take up a new hobby to get your mind off your ex and make ignoring him completely natural.If you and your ex-boyfriend are in the same social circles, it will help if he sees you looking happy and enjoying life without him. This will make him feel like none of the mean things he's been doing are having any effect on you.

, If he calls you ugly or fat, never believe it. Remind yourself that he's just upset that you broke up and doesn't know how to deal with it maturely.

, You don't have to go out of your way to give him compliments, but don't be nasty in return if your ex-boyfriend says something mean to you. Keep your cool in these situations and show him that what he's doing isn't bothering you.

, This means being nice behind his back as well as to his face. Never try to get even and spread rumors about him. If you do things like this, you will be acting just as mean and immature as your ex, and you will probably make the tension between the two of you worse., If you and your ex-boyfriend have mutual friends and his mean behavior is making social interactions uncomfortable for you, let your friends know what's going on. They may be able to reason with your ex in a way that you would not be able to, or they may decide to stop inviting him to events as long as he continues to be mean to you.Depending on the relationship that both you and your ex have with your friends, you may have to be willing to cut ties with some of them. Keep in mind that someone who encourages your ex to be mean to you is not really your friend at all.
Talking to your friends about the situation will also give you a way to vent. Supportive friends will make you feel good about yourself, which will make it much easier to deal with your mean ex.

, If you ex's behavior gets serious enough that you feel like you are in danger, report him to an adult at your school or to the police. You should never have to live in fear of being harmed or harassed, so don't be shy about asking for help.

Notice if they ignore your phone calls.,
Acknowledge their failure to answer text messages.,
Check if they fail to initiate conversations.,
Check to see if they have “unfriended” you on social media.,
Make sure they haven't changed their phone number.",How to Know if Your Ex Is in Love with Someone Else1," When you call your ex, notice whether they answer the phone or send you to voicemail. If they are regularly ignoring your phone calls (especially if this is a new behavior), this could be sign they’ve fallen for someone else.Wait and see if they ignore your calls three or more times in a row.
Be sure to spread out each of your phone calls by at least a day, if not more.;
, If you text your ex and they fail to write back (or wait more than a day to do so), this can mean they love somebody else. They might be out with that person (or even sleeping over) when they receive your text, and that is why they do not respond.As with calls, try and wait for them to drop text messages at least three times before you jump to conclusions.
Once again, be sure to spread you text messages out, as not to overwhelm your ex in the process.

, If your ex responds to text messages and phone calls, but never initiates any communication, this can be a sign that they’ve fallen for somebody else. This can show that they still want to be polite, however, they seem to have no innate desire to speak to you. Try ceasing your attempts to get in touch for a while (say, one week).
Notice whether or not the step up to get in touch with you instead.

, If you try to visit your ex’s Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram page, only to realize you are no longer among their friends list, this can be a negative sign. They may have deleted you because they don’t want you to see a change in their relationship status, or photos of them with their new love.If their social media pages are set to private, it will be immediately clear that they have unfriended you.
If they keep their profiles public, you may need to directly check to see if you are listed among their friends.

, A far more dramatic action for your ex to take (and a much more dramatic sign) is to change their telephone number. If you attempt to contact your ex and realize that they have changed their number without notifying you, there is a good chance they have fallen in love with someone else.Inquire to your friends about the change in number. If there is some kind of good explanation for the phone number change, a mutual friend may be able to clue you in.

Gauge whether or not they respond to your flirting.,
Feel if they are distant.,
Note them cancelling plans with you.,
Pay attention to how much time they make for you.,
Acknowledge if they have stopped being affectionate with you.",How to Know if Your Ex Is in Love with Someone Else2," If your ex has always reciprocated your flirty behavior, and now suddenly they don’t, this can indicate they are spending their flirtatious energy on their new love.

Try flirting with them the way you normally would (don't overdo it) and gauge their reaction.
See if this happens more than once before you draw any conclusions.

, If your ex suddenly grows distant from you, this can be a sign that they’ve moved on. If they longer share details from their life, no longer reach out to you for support, or no longer allow themselves to be close to you physically, they may be in love with someone.

Try to find out if there is something else bothering them that might make them act distant.

, If you have made plans with your ex a while ago, and suddenly they begin cancelling them, this could be sign that they’ve fallen for someone. One cancellation might not mean anything, but several in a row could be a bad sign., If you used to be able to call on your ex for company, support, or just to catch up, but suddenly they don’t seem to have time for you, they may have moved on. If they are spending all of their time with their new love, it makes it difficult for them to spend time with you.Also notice if they occasionally come calling on you for some type of attention or support, but are not there to reciprocate when you need them.
This can also mean that they have started a new relationship, but they still come to you in times of loneliness (which reflects poorly on their character).

, If you and ex had remained “friends with benefits” since your official break-up, and suddenly they have ceased this side of your relationship, this is a pretty strong sign that they are having this need filled by someone else. If they have fallen in love with someone else, they likely can’t continue being affectionate with you.


If they turn down your advances, you may want to simply ask them point blank what has changed.

Watch for public displays of affection.,
Talk to mutual friends.,
Listen to what they tell you.,
Look for a change in their Facebook status.,
Ask yourself if it’s time to move on.",How to Know if Your Ex Is in Love with Someone Else3," If you happen to spot your ex being affectionate with someone else in public, this is pretty solid indicator that your ex is moving on. If your ex is comfortable enough to make public displays of affection, this shows that they may be in love with someone new.

PDA is more than just kissing. If you see you ex out with someone, try to notice their body language.
Are they touching one another? How close are they sitting?

, If you hear rumors that your ex is in love with someone else, take these rumors seriously. You may be tempted to ignore or disbelieve such murmurings, but just remember that rumors are often based on some measure of truth.If you suspect something, ask around.
Consider asking your ex's friends directly.

, If your ex tells you point blank that they are moving on, you should believe them. If they explain that they’ve fallen for someone else, you should try to accept this fact and move on yourself.

, If you are still Facebook friends with your ex, you may notice if they alter their relationship status. A status of “in a relationship” is a very clear message that they feel strongly about someone. Even a vague relationship status like “it’s complicated,” may mean that they have fallen in love with someone new.You might also keep an eye out for romantic-looking images on Facebook.
You may also watch out for flirty posts.

, Rather than pining away for your ex, and playing gumshoe to determine whether or not they are seeing someone, consider having a direct conversation with them. Figure out, honestly, whether or not the two of you have a future together, and if it seems like you do not, set your sights on moving on."

Keep interactions short.",How to Handle an Ex Who Harasses You," Assault, abuse, threats, and even stalking are considered punishable criminal offenses.If you are being subjected to one of these forms of harassment, report your ex to the authorities immediately. They will keep an eye on your ex and even issue a restraining order. On the other hand, your ex may not be doing any physical or emotional harm, but simply hasn’t accepted the break-up. If the latter is the case, there are steps you can take to make it more comfortable while they come to terms with the separation.


A restraining order places restrictions on their interactions with you. If they violate the restraining order, they could be arrested.Many states have a legal distinction between civil harassment and domestic abuse. Domestic abuse is between close family members and people currently or formerly in a romantic relationship. Civil harassment is between 2 people who are not and have never been close family members or romantically involved. However, the illegal behavior is the same – assault, abuse, threats, stalking, and other physically and emotionally harmful behaviors.Abuse can be physical or emotional. Hitting, shouting, and insults are examples of abuse. Broadly defined, it is harm done to you.
Threats of abuse can be just as harmful emotionally. They can be expressed or simply implied.
Pestering may just be repeated calls or emails to you. If your ex is simply calling you often to find out what you are thinking about them, it may not constitute harassment yet.;
, If the harassment gets worse, you might change your mind to see the authorities. They will need to know some details about your ex’s exact behaviors. Keeping track of them, even writing them down, is a good idea in case you feel their attempts at contacting you may turn violent.


Who, what, when, where, and why – these are basic details any authority figure will ask about up front.
How often is it happening?
Are you alone when they harass you?
Have you told them that their advances are unwelcome?
Is there hard evidence of their harassment? It may not be necessary to have criminal charges brought against them without physical evidence of harassment, but it would make it an open-and-shut case., It may seem obvious to you, but vocalizing your fear and discomfort to them may get them to stop. It is also the first step in legal recourse against their behavior. By establishing that you have told them to stop, their continued attempts at contacting or harming you become criminal offenses.


For example, try telling them, ""I know you only want to spend more time with me, but I your repeated calls make me uncomfortable. I want you to stop calling me for at least 2 weeks. I'll get in touch with you if I need you."" Putting a time frame on it may make it an easier pill for them to swallow. After 2 weeks, or however long you see fit, they may not be as obsessed with you any more.

, Not all ‘harassment’ is criminal or violent. It may just be residual feelings of infatuation gasping for air. Go easy on them while they come to terms with the break up. There is no need to contact the police about someone who is causing no harm.


For example, an ex may try to bring you lunch at work. It is unwanted behavior, but they are only bringing you food. Remove yourself and your relationship from the story, and see their behavior in its most basic form.

, Would they feel alarmed or contact an authority? If so, your ex's actions may be criminally punishable. It is important to figure out if they are a threat to your safety as soon as possible so you can contact the police before get hurt.For example, imagine your last face-to-face. Did they raise their voice or act physically imposing, or imply future abuse? Did they use unfriendly language? If not, they may not be interested in taking their attempt to win you back any farther than asking you what they did wrong.

, If they are behaving generally rational, your ex’s advances are fueled by contact with you. Don’t give fuel to the fire. Try to avoid them whenever possible. This may be difficult if you work together or socialize in the same circles. Nonetheless, the more you can break off contact with them, the easier it should be to gradually come to terms with the break up.


Take note if your ex intensifies their attempts see you after you break off contact. This irrational behavior may be a sign of criminal harassment or even psychosis. If they become more desperate or abusive, contact the police immediately.

, It is important that you have a support network in times like these. Keeping others aware of your ex’s behavior will also serve as an impartial judge of whether they cross the line. Have them check in with you regularly to make sure you are ok and the pestering hasn’t intensified to abusive harassment., If they leave you messages/texts that make your blood boil, take a moment before doing anything. It is probably best not to respond at all, and let their feelings for you suffocate. Alternately, you may think that will only make them more determined to getting in touch with you. If so, keep your comments and responses as positive, respectful and brief as possible. Communicate to them that you respect them, but no longer wish to have a romantic relationship.


If they won't stop texting you, try a quick message like, ""I still respect you, but I don't want to date you. Please stop sending these texts.""

, Until this blows over, you may want to avoid seeing their correspondence. Most email clients make it easy to filter out unwanted messages. However, if you don’t even want to be confronted with the possibility of opening their email, you might create a new temporary email account. Share the address only with those you need to contact, and tell them why. Making sure your ex doesn’t find out this email address will create a safe space for you.For a step-by-step guide to creating an email filter, see this.

, Their phone calls and voice messages will be harder to ignore than their emails. This will be a major source of stress for you until the issue is resolved. Luckily, it is easy to block phone numbers. Look at this guide for instructions on how to do this with a variety of phone carriers.

, If your ex is part of one of your circles of friends, take this as an opportunity to explore new forms of entertainment and cultivate new friendships. It is unlikely that all your old friends break off contact with you unless they have a reason to. Nonetheless, take the stress off of your interactions with them by keeping a safe distance. They will appreciate you keeping them out of the dispute as well.

, Sometimes you cannot avoid direct contact with an ex. Try to keep the contact brief and public. They are unlikely to do anything abusive with others around, and it should make you more comfortable. If they do cross the line to harassment, others will be around to step in or at least act as witnesses.


Acting stressed or hysterical may make your ex feel like they need to ‘help’ you. By having calm, public interactions with them, they may see your happiness and not want to disturb it. After all, if they truly cared for you, they would want you to prosper even if it meant leaving you alone.

Keep it spontaneous.,
Let enough time pass.,
Let her know you want to hook up.,
Make your intentions clear.,
Make sure you're on the same page.",How to Hook Up with an Ex Girlfriend1," If you want to hook up with your ex without any strings attached and to have as much fun as possible, then you have to start off by being spontaneous. Don't call her or text her, asking what she's been up to. Instead, you should run into her at a club, a party, or just out in the middle of the day, and start charming her and letting her know that you want to hook up.


If you call her or start checking in with her, then she may get the wrong impression and think you want something more than just hooking up. Treat it like meeting a new and exciting girl out at a bar and then bring her home.;
, If you want to start hooking up with your ex, you should wait until at least a few weeks, if not a few months, have gone by before you start trying to hook up with your ex again. Even if you had an amicable and mutual break-up and there are no hard feelings, you should let the dust settle before you try to get back in bed with your ex, or things are bound to get complicated.


Enough time should pass that you can see your ex as someone hot who you'd like to hook up with, instead of letting all of your old complicated feelings or emotions well up at the sight of her.
Enough time should pass so you get rid of any anger or lingering resentment or bitterness.

, Once enough time has passed and you've run into your ex, you should make it clear that you want to take her home. Don't tell her that she's beautiful and that you've missed her smile; instead, tell her that she looks great in her new dress and that you've missed her body. You don't have to be too subtle since you should already be pretty comfortable with each other -- just make sure she's feeling it, too.


Don't give her a puppy-dog love gaze. Look her up and down and let her see that you think she looks hot.
Be blunt. Ask her to come over or wait for an invitation to go to her place.

, Before you even touch your ex's lips with your own, you should make your intentions and expectations clear. Tell her you want to hook up without any strings attached, that you're not looking to get back into the relationship, and that you just want to have a little fun. Let her know that you only want to see her to hook up, not to do all the date-y stuff that leads to hooking up.


Don't be a jerk. It's not cool to lead on your ex, hook up with her again, and then tell her that you're not really looking to reconnect.

, Keep in mind that, when you're about to hook up with an ex, it's pretty unlikely that you're both on the same page. That is to say, it's almost always the case that one of you is still hurt, still reeling, and still emotionally vulnerable from the break up. It could be the case that she dumped you and you're pretending that you want to hook up when you really just want to get back together, or that she's totally hung up on you while you just want to get her in bed. But if you really are looking for the same things, then it's safe to go for it.


Look into her eyes when you talk about your hook-up status. Does she really agree that it's a good idea, or does she clearly think it'll turn into something more?
Think about how serious the relationship was in the beginning. If you were only together for a month or two, then you're both much more likely to be okay with just hooking up than you'd be if you dated for a year or two.
Make sure you're both okay with also hooking up with other people. If you're not, then why not just get back together?

Avoid thinking about all the negative and emotionally-difficult times that you had together. Focus on being positive.Avoid trying to hide or pretend that your ex doesn't see you. If you both made eye contact, then your ex has seen you. If your ex hasn't spotted you yet, it's okay to duck into a fitting room or turn around to avoid them.
Consider taking a minute if you can to calm yourself. Take a deep breath, and picture in your mind a place that is relaxing, soothing, and calm.
Consider acknowledging the possible awkwardness of the situation when meeting your ex. It may help to lighten the mood. It's okay to say, ""Well, this is awkward,"" or ""Fancy meeting you here."";
, If you see your ex from across the room or a few aisles over at a store, you may just want to avoid conversation. Many people feel the same way. Decide if just a smile and nod might be best.


If you're feeling very anxious and flustered, and your ex hasn't made their way over to you, you may feel more comfortable with staying at a distance.
Consider a smile and a nod, or a brief wave to say hello. This may be all you want to do. Then you can just simply move on with your day.
If conversation seems unavoidable, then consider the next steps to stay calm and confident.

, Don't force physical affection, such as hugging or kissing on the cheek. Also a formal handshake may be too business-like. If your ex wants to hug briefly, then do so if you feel comfortable. If they don't, then give a polite nod or wave to say hello instead. Keep your body language relaxed.


Don't send mixed signals by being overly friendly. This is not a time to flirt with your ex if the meeting is out of nowhere and unexpected.
Smile and be polite. Act like you are open to conversation. But if the conversation drags on and becomes too awkward, then consider ways to end the conversation.
Consider saying, ""It was good to run into you. Nice to chat with you. I'm sorry but I need to get going. I hope you have a good rest of the day.""

, Whether things are going well in your life or not, running into your ex unexpectedly isn't the time to talk about how wonderful or how bad things are. Be mindful that, if you haven't seen your ex in a while, they may have moved on and changed things about their life. Show your confident and polite self in this moment.If you've started a new relationship, avoid talking about it with your ex, except for saying, ""I'm seeing someone now."" Avoid trying to tell all the details of your relationship.
Remember that if you're running into your ex unexpectedly, then you likely had limited contact with them recently. After a break-up, try to view your ex as a friend from your past that you've grown apart from. Avoid focusing only on the negative at the moment you see your ex.
If you still have feelings for your ex, try imagining that they are someone else. Turn your thoughts to someone neutral.

, Whether you're doing well or not, a run-in with your ex shouldn't be about who's better than who. It is simply an encounter with someone you know. Avoid getting flustered and talking about yourself too much.


If you've succeeded in something at work or school, avoid being full of yourself. It's okay to talk about what you're up to, but avoid trying to see this as an opportunity to make your ex feel guilty or worthless.
Don't make the conversation about stirring up resentment, jealousy, or drama.

, If you run into your ex and their new partner, it can be particularly awkward. Avoid being overly fake in your conversation. Remain calm and natural.Take the high road and be polite. This moment will likely be briefer and less painful if you stay strong.
Be willing to say hello and shake the hand of your ex's new partner. Consider saying, ""It's nice to meet you."" But you don't need to say much more.
If you act over-the-top and too sweet, or take the other extreme and avoid eye contact and act like the person isn't there, this may come off as disingenuous and rude. Act like you would when meeting anyone new.
There is a chance your ex's new partner might say something unexpected or rude. This is unlikely, but just make sure you're prepared to remain composed and have a quick reply to end the conversation quickly. Even just ""I'm running really late to meet someone, so I have to go. Nice meeting you!""

, Making the conversation brief will help to reduce tension. Don't try to recap every detail that happened since your break-up. Focus on small talk or other easy-going conversation topics.Focus on asking how their day has been, or how they are doing generally. If your ex asks the same, then focus on topics that are light and friendly.
Consider topics such as any current hobbies or travels, a funny anecdote about something that happened recently, your studies, your work, or things you've been watching such as sports or TV shows.
Avoid letting the conversation linger. When it starts to feel uncomfortable, excuse yourself or say that you need to go. Consider saying, ""It was nice seeing you, but I need to head to my class,"" or ""I'm on my way to another event. Please excuse me and have a good evening!""

, When you meet someone who has hurt you, you may want to talk with them about that pain. An unexpected encounter with your ex is not the time to rehash your relationship and its past problems. Be aware that brief meetings with your ex shouldn't turn into venting sessions or a time to start arguments.Avoid being angry or trying to stir drama.
Be understanding that your ex may also have awkward feelings about an unexpected meeting.
Ignoring and pretending that your ex doesn't exist may feel easier, but it can be immature or irresponsible.
At a minimum, smile and nod to your ex. If you feel that you can't talk with them, then this is basic courtesy.

, If you're running into your ex, and you're with your new partner or date, avoid trying to show how much you've ""moved on"" from the relationship by kissing or showing large displays of affection. Act as you would normally when in public.


For example, let's say you're at a friend's party, and your ex shows up unexpectedly. Avoid trying to act differently just because your ex is there. Try to talk with your ex and show that you accept them there. But if your ex is making you very uncomfortable, consider finding a different space at the party or leaving the party.
Avoid kissing or touching someone as a way to get your ex's attention and to make them jealous.
Don't focus on making yourself more attractive for your ex after you run into them. Be your normal and honest self in that moment.

, Your ex may ask you about something you are not willing to discuss — it's okay to say this. You don't have to talk about anything that makes you uncomfortable. For instance, if your ex asks whether you're seeing someone new or how things are going with your partner, you can say, ""Oh — nice of you to ask, but I'm not comfortable talking about my current relationship."" If your ex can't respect your boundaries and keeps asking, then end the conversation and walk away., If you live in the same city, go to the same school, or have the same social circles, it is much more likely that you may run into your ex unexpectedly from time to time. Be prepared for the possibility of an encounter.


Think about what you might say. Remember to keep it brief and respectful.
Consider how you might respond to certain questions, such as, ""Are you seeing anyone new?"" or ""What have you been doing since we last saw each other?""
Think about what you need to do to remain calm. If you know this encounter may be anxiety-provoking, have a friend or person to talk with after you meet you ex unexpectedly.

, If you were dating your ex for a while, you may have some mutual friends. Avoid talking badly about your ex with friends of your ex. Don't force them to choose sides.If you need to vent about your ex, do so with people who don't know your ex. Consider talking with people who already were good friends with you well before your ex was in the picture.
If you're at a friend's party, and there are many friends of your ex there, keep the conversation light.
Avoid trying to start drama, or making people feel uncomfortable. Most people don't want to feel ""caught in the middle"" of a break-up.

, Unexpected encounters with your ex will feel less stressful when you have moved on and found closure in your relationship. Jumping into a new relationship may indicate that you've moved on, but finding closure is a separate and important thing.Process what happened in your relationship. Avoid self-blame or blaming your ex. Understand that sometimes good people aren't right for each other. And sometimes, the people you trust will hurt you.
Take care of yourself, and focus on self-love. Do things that make you feel better about life after your ex, and help you to focus on the future.
Consider talking with a counselor for an outsider's perspective. If you become very anxious and overwhelmed in these unexpected moments, a counselor can help to teach you about healthy coping skills.
Talk with your friends and family. Strengthen your support system when you're feeling vulnerable, such as these unexpected moments with your ex. Keep the people who care about you close.

Make sure you only hook up.,
Hook up sparingly.,
Don't get too comfortable.,
Stay in control.,
Keep your new relationship private.,
Avoid ""lovey dovey"" stuff when you're hooking up.",How to Hook Up with an Ex Girlfriend2," Though it sounds harsh, if you're going to hook up with an ex, then you should only hook up with her.


Be honest about it. Don't make an excuse every time your ex wants to go somewhere public with you. Tell her that you're not looking for anything other than hooking up.

, Hooking up with your ex can be fun and exciting, but that doesn't mean you should do it every night, because guess what? That's starting to look like a relationship. If you're basically only hooking up with your ex, then you're not letting yourself meet other girls or have any fun on the side. The more time you spend together, the more likely you both are to be hurt, so keep it fun and spontaneous instead of setting a hook-up date for every night of the week.


Keep it fun and spontaneous. If you see her out, then take her home. If not, then don't call her or text her to find out where she is. You're not supposed to care that much, remember?

, It can be tricky to hook up with an ex without feeling too comfortable.


No cuddling, no passionate kisses as you leave, and no hanging out around the house in sweatpants eating cold nachos from the night before. All of these signs show that you're too comfortable in the non-relationship and that you're on your way to dating again.

, If you want to hook up with your ex without any trouble, then you have to maintain control of the situation at all times. Don't let her set the terms of your hook up, and try to keep things at her place so you remain the master of your own domain. Don't cancel your plans to hang out with your buddies if she wants to hang out; tell her you'll hang out with her if she's free.


This doesn't mean you should tell your ex exactly what to do; you should find a time and place that works for both of you, but you shouldn't fall prey to her needs.

, Don't hang out with your ex in front of your friends, go to a party with her because she doesn't want to show up alone, or tell your friends that you've been hooking up with her again. The more people you bring into it, the more complicated things will get, and you should keep it simple -- just between the two of you.


If you start going out in public with her and hanging out with her friends, they'll immediately disapprove and tell your ex that she should set the terms for your relationship.
If you bring her out in front of your friends, then she'll start to feel like your girlfriend again.

, Maybe when you were dating, you would be tender with your woman, telling her how beautiful she is, how much you love her, and how much you love the little dimples in her cheeks. Well, all of your Romeo-moves have to go out the door at this point, or she'll get the wrong picture. She'll think, ""He said I'm beautiful -- he must still love me,"" or ""He ran his hands through my hair -- it has to mean something."" By doing this, you'll be leading her on and making her feel like you still want to date her.


You can tell her how hot she is and how much you love her body, but stick to the sexy -- not the tender -- compliments if you want it to last.

Stop if one of you starts developing feelings again.,
Stop if one of you starts liking someone else.,
Stop when you've fallen into a routine.,
Stop if you start fighting like a couple.,
Stop if you're no longer having fun.",How to Hook Up with an Ex Girlfriend3," Unfortunately, it'll be hard to keep hooking up with your ex without having one of you develop feelings for the other person again. As soon as that happens, you'll have to push the eject button on the non-relationship, or things will only get worse from there. Unless you're still really in love with your ex and are using your hook up moves to win back her heart -- incidentally, a terrible idea -- you should cease and desist the second you or she shows signs of having feelings.


If you start getting that achy feeling in your heart and start musing about what a great relationship you had while knowing it can never work, then it's time to leave.
If your ex tells you she misses you, sends you sweet (not sexy) texts, or says she wishes you could do some couple-y things together, then it's time to bow out.
If you have to end the ""relationship"" for this reason, explain yourself first. You shouldn't be a jerk just because it's over.

, If one of you starts developing feelings for someone else, even if you haven't pursued that person, you should end up the hook-up period. Hooking up with your ex is something to do when you both want to get some action and are bored because there are few romantic prospects in your lives. But if one of you does start liking someone else, it's time to stop hooking up so you have room to explore those feelings.


If you know your ex has a crush on someone else, you're doing her a disservice by continuing to hook up with her and taking up her time.
If you start liking another girl, she won't want anything to do with you if she knows that you're hooking up with an ex-girlfriend.

, Hooking up with your ex should last a month or two at most before things start to get more serious. Even if you're both trying as hard as you can to keep things casual, if you've fallen into a rhythm, basically feel like you're dating, and know exactly when you'll see each other next, then it's time to stop hooking up. If you know when you'll see your ex next, and you stop feeling a thrill at the prospect of hooking up, then the fun is over.


You can't expect the hook up to last more than a month or two without it leading to something more. Be realistic.

, As soon as you start fighting again, you should end the relationship. If you're not actually dating, then you shouldn't be fighting. It's that simple. If you hear her say, ""Where is this taking us?"" or ""What does all of this mean?"" Then she's already back in relationship mode, and your hook up sessions have gone too far. You shouldn't be fighting about anything one of you is doing wrong, because you should only be hooking up, right?


It may be tempting to fight with your ex again if you're used to it, but remember that it won't lead you anywhere except back where you were -- a bad relationship.

, The whole point of hooking up with your ex is so that both of you can enjoy yourselves, get some sexual pleasure, and have fun without any strings attached. If you're not feeling the hook up anymore, if you feel like you're only in it out of obligation, or if you're hooking up with your ex just because you're bored, then it's time to start looking for someone new. You weren't having fun before and that's why the relationship ended.


Be honest about ending the hook-up session. Don't just start avoiding or ignoring your ex. Let her know it's time to move on.

Replay in your head what happened before she seemed to lose interest.For example, did you say something – maybe in a teasing way – that could have insulted her or hurt her feelings?
Try asking, “Did I say or do something to upset you?”;
, Embrace your humility and put pride aside. Tell her you’re sorry as soon as possible, through a note or in person. Address the issue with a kind apology, even if you don’t feel completely at fault.Try saying, “I sincerely apologize. Can you forgive me?”

, You could bring her a bouquet of flowers.Or, you could put more thought into the gesture and give her something related to her interests, that you know she’ll like. The gift doesn’t necessarily have to cost anything.For example, give her a sticker of a band or organization she likes.

, Let her know that you notice her through small gestures. Smile or wave at her when you see her. Send her a single text, if you haven’t talked recently. This lets her know you care and are not completely uninterested in her.Try texting, “Hi! Haven’t talked to you in a while. How are you?”

, Meet new people and expand your group of friends. Go out with people who are positive and make life fun. Staying busy can help you feel upbeat instead of dwelling on your relationship status.For example, try joining a new activity, such as a hobby class or sport.

, Don’t expect to be able to earn her interest back immediately. You may want to wait about 30 days before attempting to reconnect with her. After a month of little or no contact, she will be more likely to miss you., They may be physical, intellectual, emotional or spiritual. Discussing the positive feelings she had towards you in the first place will encourage her to embrace those feelings again.Try saying, “I’m just curious…what was it about me that you were interested in when we first met?”

, Tell her that you’re there to listen any time she wants to talk. If she is willing to talk, give her your full interest and attention. Don’t rush her or try to offer easy solutions; she’ll feel more heard if you just listen and reinforce that you support her choices.Try saying, “I understand your feelings,” or “I support you.”

, Without bragging, subtly work into your conversation ways that you’re working on yourself. Tell her something new you’ve learned, and how it’s expanded the way you look at things.People tend to be attracted to others who are intellectually engaging and interesting.For example, if you’ve done well at work or in school, casually mention it.
Try saying, “That reminds me of something I read about the other day…”

You both should be in agreement that the behavior is inappropriate and constitutes harassment.Tell your partner about every instance of harassment, including when the behavior first started. Talk about the behavior together.
If your partner is in denial about their ex's behavior, or doesn't think it constitutes harassment and that you should just ""get over it,"" the two of you may want to seek the assistance of a professional counselor or a neutral third party to better understand each other.;
, If your partner's ex has engaged in this behavior before, looking at what happened on those previous occasions can give you some insight into how seriously you should take it.For example, if your partner's ex has prior assault charges or similar brushes with the law stemming from similar harassment circumstances, you may want to go to the police sooner rather than later.
On the other hand, if your partner's ex has exhibited this kind of behavior in the past, but it quickly fizzled out and they moved on, you may be better off just to ignore it as best you can.

, When handling harassment from your partner's ex, patience makes all the difference in keeping the situation from escalating further. If you get angry or confront your partner's ex, you may make the situation worse for everyone.Keep in mind that it is sometimes difficult to prove harassment, and authorities will be less inclined to see you as an innocent victim if you did anything to harass or egg on your partner's ex.
Try to keep a cool head, and avoid responding or reacting to anything your partner's ex says or does.

, While the harassment is going on, even if you've decided that you're probably not going to involve authorities, you still need a record of everything that was written or said.If you're dealing with online harassment, create a screen capture of any posts or messages you see that are harassing – especially if your partner's ex has the ability to delete the messages. If you do decide to involve authorities, they may try to cover their tracks.
While it may be tempting to delete harassing voicemail messages, emails, or texts, keep them on your phone so you'll have them in the event you decide to go to the police.

, You must let your partner's ex know that you feel their behavior constitutes harassment and it is unwelcome. Either you, your partner, or both of you together should express this to your partner's ex on no uncertain terms.Particularly in situations where your partner still must maintain contact with their ex, such as if they have kids together, it may be best for you to present a united front. Then your partner can discuss what the boundaries are and what types of contact or communication are welcome to continue.
Keep in mind that your partner's ex may be acting from emotion rather than logic. They may feel hurt or betrayed, depending on the circumstances of the break-up. Be neutral and objective, and avoid making incriminating, threatening, or insulting statements.

, Provided you don't feel a threat to your safety or well-being, it typically is best to handle harassment from your partner's ex directly and rationally, before the situation goes too far.If possible, arrange for both you and your partner to sit down with your partner's ex. If your worried your partner's ex will feel as though you're ganging up on them, invite them to bring a friend or family member along for moral support.
You might also consider finding a neutral third party, counselor, or mediator to sit down with the group of you and get to the bottom of the issues at hand and the reason for the harassing behavior.
Come to this meeting with an open mind. Your purpose is not to confront your partner's ex, but to be open to them, understand the motivation for their behavior, and arrive at a resolution that works for everyone.

, All social media platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, have a means by which you can block an offensive account so that they can no longer contact you. Neither of you will see each other's posts or be able to access each other's pages after you block them.The biggest benefit to blocking someone on social media is the sense of ease that comes from the harasser being ""out of sight, out of mind."" However, in some cases it may not be that simple to get relief from harassment from your partner's ex – particularly if they still must remain in touch.
Keep in mind that blocking your partner's ex on social media also does not mean that they can no longer post harassing or insulting things about you – it just means that you won't be able to see those posts. If your partner's ex regularly posted insults or digs at you on social media, make sure you're okay with not knowing about it or having the opportunity to speak up for yourself.

, Your accounts, or those of your partner, may be at risk if your partner's ex had access to those accounts or the passwords. Make sure your partner has changed any passwords their ex might have known.Change your passwords to something that includes upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols or special characters, so it is not easy for your partner's ex to guess.
You also want to change the password of your home wireless network, if you have one.
Make sure you have the latest virus protection installed on your computer, with the most recent update.

, In addition to preserving any evidence of the harassment, get a notebook where you can create an entry every time an incident of harassment takes place. This journal is especially important if you have little or no physical evidence of the behavior.Record your journal entry as soon as possible after the incident has taken place, so the facts will still be fresh in your mind. Write down every detail you can remember, no matter how mundane or seemingly irrelevant.
Date and sign your entries so you have a record both of when the incident happened and when you wrote about it.

, Before you go to authorities, you need to make sure you have all of your evidence together and that everything has been dated and labeled if necessary. Make physical copies of any digital evidence.Particularly if your partner's ex has been interfering with online accounts belonging to you or your ex, you still want to save the digital files – they may be helpful in the investigation.
Make copies for your own records before you take any evidence or information to the police, including of your journal. They likely will want the originals, so you want to make sure you have copies just in case.

, If you want to report harassment, go to the nearest local police station in person and tell them you want to file a police report. Do not call an emergency number for the police unless you feel your life is in imminent danger.Tell the officer who takes the report as many details as possible, and give them all the evidence you have as well as your journal.

, If you simply want your partner's ex to leave you alone and stop contacting you, it may help to get a civil restraining order against them. Because the specific procedure varies, contact the clerk at your local courthouse to find out how to proceed.Keep in mind restraining orders often are categorized by your relationship (or former relationship) to your harasser. Domestic violence protections tend to be stronger than those for harassment by someone unrelated.
If your partner's ex is also harassing your partner, you may want to get your partner to apply for the restraining order rather than you. Your partner can then list you as another member of the household to be protected by the restraining order. If you don't live with your partner, this option may not be available to you.

, Depending on the response of police, you may want to take additional legal action. This is especially true if the police have indicated to you that there won't be any criminal charges filed.You can do a search online to find attorneys in your area who work for victims of harassment or stalking. Most of them will give you a free initial consultation.
If you decide to hire an attorney, interview at least three so you can compare and contrast to make the best choice.

, Once you've filed your initial report, police or other investigators may have additional questions for you, or may want to visit your home. Handle the situation by being as open and honest as possible.You may be asked some questions that you find offensive, or that make it sound as though you are being blamed for the harassment from your partner's ex. Try to stay calm and relaxed, and not get angry or indignant.
If there's something that you don't understand, ask an officer about it. You may want to get answers to questions, especially about procedural matters, in writing.
Keep all updated files, including the original police report, together with your copies of the evidence and your journal logging the harassing incidents.

, As a last resort, you may be able to file a civil lawsuit to get compensation if the harassment from your partner's ex has caused specific losses in your life. Depending on where you live, you also may be able to get compensation for general pain and suffering.For example, if your partner's ex destroyed property that belonged to you, or spread rumors about you that caused you to lose a job or income in some way, you could sue them to recover your losses.
If you think you might have a lawsuit against your partner's ex, consult an attorney as soon as possible. There are deadlines to file these lawsuits, which differ depending on the damages you want to claim. Most attorneys will give you a free initial consultation to assess your lawsuit and discuss your chances of success.

Acknowledge if there are kids.",How to Handle a Partner Staying Friends with Exes," It’s never easy to bring up a difficult conversation, especially if it has to do with your partner’s ex. Be curious and ask questions instead of making accusations. This allows your partner to speak and be heard without you making assumptions.Be careful not to cast blame on your partner. Instead, frame things from your perspective or on how you feel.


For example, use “I” statements instead of blaming your partner.For example, say, “I feel uncomfortable when you act secretively on your phone, and I suspect it’s because you’re talking to your ex. Is there something I should know?” This is much less aggressive than saying, “Why do you act so secretively around your ex?”;
, Say how you feel your partner’s relationship with their ex affects your trust. Is your partner deserving of your trust or do you feel like they may be trying to hide something? Recognize the difference between being suspicious of your partner’s actions and feeling insecure. Say that you want a trusting relationship with your partner and you need to talk about it.


For example, say, “I want to trust you, but the way you relate to your ex makes me feel unsure. Can you tell me how you feel about trust in our relationship?”
If you’ve been hurt in the past, recognize that your partner is not to blame for the hurt you’ve experienced. If you don’t trust your partner, ask yourself why., Talk to your partner about your experiences and why you’re having problems with jealousy. If you’re uncomfortable with the level of contact your partner has with an ex, say so. It may be time to set some boundaries. If you feel like you’re not getting enough of their attention, say so. If you’ve had a cheating partner in the past, tell your partner how they made you feel.Say, “It’s hard for me to see you have a friendship with your ex. My trust has been broken before, so seeing you be friendly with your ex makes me feel insecure.”

, If your partner’s relationship with their ex bothers you, say something. If your partner is attentive to your needs and respects any boundaries you agree upon, great. If your partner agrees then ends up continually talking to their ex, this may be a problem. If you feel like your partner is giving more attention and respect to their ex over you, then be careful in moving forward.Talk to your partner about your feelings of respect. Say, “I know you want to be friends with your ex, but it bothers me that you text them every day. Is it possible to have less contact with them?”

, Jealousy has everything to do with you, not your partner. If you’re feeling jealous, recognize that it’s okay to feel that way and that everyone feels jealous at one time or another. Yet, unhealthy jealousy occurs when you act on your feelings. Some examples include snooping on your partner’s texts, emails, or computer. If you’re feeling jealous, say something to your partner.Ask yourself what motivates these feelings. Is your partner actually acting suspicious or are you sensitive because you’ve been hurt before?
If your partner is being secretive or telling half-truths, say something. For example, you can say, “I see when you turn your phone over or take calls from your ex outside, and it makes me feel suspicious, like you’re hiding something. This is making me feel jealous.”

, If your partner wants to remain friends with their ex, think about how that may affect you long-term. Will you be okay in the future with their relationship, or will you continue to feel angry or jealous? If you want a future with your partner, you may need to come to terms with their relationship. Accept that they are friends and trust your partner when they say they want to be with you.Remember that your partner is with you. If your partner says their previous relationship is over, it’s up to you to trust them and know that they want to be with you.

, It’s difficult to generalize all relationships with exes. Some relationships with an ex may be healthy while others are not. Think about your partner’s personality: are they the flirty or secretive type, or are they someone who just likes to get along with people? Does your partner maintain friendships with several exes or just one in particular? Consider the personal variables regarding your partner and think about they affect you.If your partner has friendships with multiple exes, they may want to keep peace and enjoy friendships. Yet, if they single out one person and make frequent contact, this may alarm you more.

, If you feel threatened or jealous of your partner’s ex, don’t start comparing yourself with them. There will always be someone more educated, funnier, attractive, or witty than you. Comparing yourself to someone else never ends with you feeling good about yourself, so skip it altogether. Don’t think about how their relationship could have been or what makes the ex better than you. Instead, avoid it.Comparing yourself to others can affect your self-esteem and feelings of worth. You can always find something better about someone else than yourself, so don’t go looking.

, Most people have a dating past and have kissed or liked others before they have liked you. Often, people learn and grow from their past and become better people. Accept that your partner has a past without holding it against them. Especially if your partner is on good terms with their ex, acknowledge that your partner ended a relationship on good terms and values their relationships., If your partner’s ex is a part of their life, then consider making them a part of yours, too. Especially if their ex has been in their life a while as a platonic friend, resist the urge to fight back. Instead, ask the ex if they’d like to join you for dinner one night or for a game night. This shows your ex that you’re willing to make an effort.If you know your partner highly values their friendship with their ex, consider making a move to get to know them, too.

, Depending on where you both are at in your relationship, it may be beneficial to see a couples therapist. Relationships require work and effort to maintain. Even the healthiest of relationships may face challenges, especially if there are concerns with one partner’s friendship with an ex.

Attending therapy sessions can help to make any concerns you may encounter manageable, decrease tension, build trust and acceptance, and assist with developing good relational habits and coping skills.
If both partners are willing to participate in couples counseling, be aware that it will definitely be a positive support for the health and longevity of your relationship.

, If your partner has a child with an ex, they likely want to keep the peace at minimum. Recognize that your partner and their ex are raising a child and it’s in the child’s best interest for the parents to get along. While these kinds of relationships can invite jealousy, remind yourself that your partner being friends with their ex is likely what’s best for the child."

Head back out there.",How to Get Your Girlfriend Back from Another Man," At the end of any relationship, there are floods of emotions you go through. Examining what you are really feeling is often avoided because it is difficult and can be painful.Take the time to explore how you really feel about your ex so you will be calm and confident when you pursue her, or you'll be able to move on.


Are you feeling hurt? Sad? Rejected? When relationships don't work, it's easy to feel rejected, like something is “wrong” with you, or just sad over the loss of that connection.
Are you jealous she has moved on? Jealously is a powerful emotion, you may be feeling jealous because you still have feelings for her and she is with someone new, or it may be you wanting to be in any relationship again.
Are you lonely? It is common to feel lonely during a breakup, consider that you may just want her back to avoid feeling lonely.;
, Be honest about why the relationship ended; knowing what went wrong in your relationship can help you determine whether it's best to get back together. Think about any issues you may have had in the major areas of safety, trust, honesty and communication.Also try and investigate why she moved on with someone else. Determine whether your relationship suffered from:


Poor communication, including constant criticism, not sharing your thoughts or feelings, excessive expression of anger, and not being appreciated or feeling neglected.
Mistakes or dishonesty like cheating, lying, or stealing.
Unequal feelings, where one partner was more intense or invested than the other.
External factors like family, culture, or religion.

, If you are both open to it, hanging out may help especially if you are not sure what happened between you, or how you feel about her. Be careful to not try to be friends too soon, and make this a one-time event to help you both navigate the new circumstances.Ask her if you could spend some time with her. Be honest, let her know you are “working through some stuff” or “trying to figure things out” for yourself.
Try not to mention anything about your breakup while you are hanging out. Keep the contact between you friendly, casual, lighthearted, and doing something fun.
Be prepared that she may not be ready for this step yet and that you might not be either.
Tread carefully and be respectful, as the two of you spending time together may cause difficulties in the new relationship she is in.

, During this time of evaluation and while you are trying to win her back, keep in mind that she is in a new relationship. Try not to obsess over her new relationship, why she choose that guy, or what she sees in him. Centralizing your thoughts there will only make you more upset and you are more likely to come across as jealous.


Instead give them space and the same respect you hope they are giving you and your relationship with her.

, It is important that you listen to what she is saying and try to consider her feelings.Even if you have figured out where you are, and where you would like to go in the situation, she may not have yet. Give her time to get comfortable around you again and wait for her to open up to you about what she wants. Some common pitfalls to try and avoid include:


Assuming that she feels the same way about you that you feel about her.She might feel completely different, or may still be figuring out how she feels.
If she won't talk to you about it, talking to her friends or anyone else she knows. The relationship, and the break-up, are between the two of you no one else.
Not hearing her when she is telling you what she needs or wants. If she is asking you for some time and space, give it to her. She may need both to think things through or gain perspective.

, Getting comfortable around each other again is going to take time and effort.It may be difficult if you still have feelings for her as you will want to talk to her and be around her all the time. Try and start slow, making sure you are giving her time to be comfortable around you again, too.


At the beginning, just make eye contact and smile at her, showing her you are doing well and do not hold onto bad feelings towards her.
Send her a private message, on important days (like birthdays), letting her know you were thinking about her. Make these messages infrequent, short, and lighthearted.
When you do talk, talk about something you are both interested in. Maintain your boundaries and keep the conversation fun and as stress-free as possible.
Respect that she is with someone new, and know that getting comfortable around each other again includes having to be respectful of her and that relationship.

, Depending on the circumstances of the break-up, a good deal of trust may have to be rebuilt.Maybe she broke up with you, your trust that you will not get hurt again needs to be established. Maybe you did something to hurt her, and she will have to rebuild her trust in you. Whatever the circumstance, trust can be rebuilt given enough time and effort.Become trustworthy of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and let it guide you towards what is right and healthy for you.
Be honest, with yourself and each other. Lying and poor communication contribute to the failure of trust, and as such, need to be absent while you are building trust.
Be dependable and consistent. If you say you are going to be somewhere or do something specific, follow through on it.
Be respectful of the hurt you both felt or still feel, her, her new relationship, yourself, and your time.
Beware of your jealousy of her new relationship. Being rude to her current boyfriend will only serve to show her she made the right decision in moving on.

, Given the end of a relationship, there is an apology likely needed somewhere. Apologizing shows growth and maturity in you as a person and is a great first step to rebuilding trust.If you can, apologize to her in person. Make eye contact and be specific in your apology. Be prepared that she may not accept it right away or apologize back.


”I'm sorry for the way things ended between us.”
”I'm sorry for how I've been acting and how that has affected you.”
”I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm trying to figure out why I did what I did, but I didn't mean to cause you pain.”
”I know you are with someone new, and I'm not expecting anything from you, I just wanted you to know that I am sorry.”

, As you rebuild trust with each other, you may decide you would like to try and become friends. Becoming friends gives you a great opportunity to be there for her when she needs someone, get to know each other again, and remind her of what she liked about you in the beginning of your relationship.


Introduce her to your fun, playful side again by telling a joke or by making her laugh.
Spend time hanging out with each other doing fun activities like going for coffee, or going to the movies with a group of mutual friends.
If she is interested in something or has a particular talent or skill, show interest in that. For example, if she plays basketball well, ask her to show you how to play.
Be a positive and encouraging force in her life. Work to make your friendship a positive one for the both of you, maybe she might be missing this in her new relationship.

, This is a pretty big step to take, and one you should take with caution. If things have been going well between you as friends, or in her new relationship, consider how you would like to move forward. If you still want to try again at your relationship, make the conversation between the two of you an intentional one.Take this step privately, this is between the two of you and no one else.Buy her a flower and write her a note, saying ""Hey, do you want to hang out later? I'm sorry I'm not perfect and I know things ended badly between us. Can we talk?""
Write her a short note or letter saying, “I know you are with someone new now, but there are some things I would just like you to know. Could we meet up and talk?”
Ask her to talk in person. “I have some things I want to talk to you about, but I really want to do it face to face. When is a good time for you to meet up?”

, Set aside some time, and choose a comfortable place for you both to talk together.As you are talking with her, maintain eye contact and open body language, being open and honest with her in everything that you say and feel.You have been working up to this for a long time, be confident and be true to yourself.


Focus on you. Let her know what you've been thinking about, and what you've learned since your break-up.
Show her how you think you have changed. If there are things you have discovered about yourself along the way, tell her.
Tell her what she's done for you. It will make her happy to hear you think you are a better person for having been with her, or that being around her made you feel calm and content.
Tell her you still have feelings for her. Let her know how you feel now, and if you would like to get back together with her.
Acknowledge that you know she is with someone else, but in order to be true to how you feel, and the two of you, you had to at least try.
Thank her for hearing you out and let her know that you don't expect a response right away. As difficult as it may be, give her time to process what you have said.

, If the conversation goes well, and the result is that you get back together, then make sure this time the relationship is better.Determine what has changed or how you would like it to be different this time. Pick specific problem areas and find solutions to each one together.


If she felt under-appreciated, do something nice without expecting anything back, just because.
If you felt that you never went anywhere, or did anything fun, then plan dates or fun things to do together.
If communication was a problem, make sure she knows how you feel about her. Tell her how much you missed her.

, Make sure that as you go forward in your relationship, you keep solid communication. At the start, agree on common goals and the direction you want the relationship to go. Make an agreement with each other to talk things out if you are having problems and a plan in place for when things get rough.Communicate with each other that you are committed to moving on from what happened in the past and making it work.


Acknowledge that in getting back together, it means the end of the relationship she was in with someone else. Be open and be available to talk through that if she wants to.

, Chances are, your lives have been wrapped up in each other recently. To have a successful relationship, you have to have your own identities as well. Make sure you have room to be your own people in your relationship together. Give her time to spend with her friends and you with yours. Engage in your hobbies and interests together if you want, but separately is good too. Build more trust and confidence in yourselves as a couple.

, Getting her back may not work the way you want it to, and you might have to accept that it is truly over between the two of you. Trust that you did what you thought you had to, to be true to yourself and your feelings, and that maybe it wasn't meant to be. Begin the work of getting over the relationship so you can move on with your life.Know that you'll go through many different emotions, and that it's perfectly normal to feel anxious, sad, angry, and confused all at once.

Take care of your body. Make sure you are getting enough to eat, getting enough sleep, being at least a little active (like taking a walk) and keeping up with hygiene., Everything takes time, especially when healing from a loss. Give yourself time to grieve the relationship and get yourself to a place where you can move on.Don't fight it. Pretending that “everything's fine” is only going to prolong the process. Give yourself permission to go through the grief.
Remind yourself that it will get better and you have the chance to fall in love again when you are ready.
Do things that you enjoy. Engaging in things you like will help improve your mood and boost your confidence., Even though you may want to spend time with her and around her as friends, it will be easier for you to heal if you take some time apart. Being around her may just remind you of the relationship you had and of what you miss. Let her know that you just need some time and space. If she asks about being friends, be honest with her about if you think you can be friends some day down the road or not.


Try to steer clear of her social media, chances are what you see there will only make you upset and prolong the healing process for you., When you're ready, get yourself back out into the dating world. Relationships can be difficult and painful, but they can also be wonderful. Avoid hiding yourself away, you have a lot to offer and a lot to give to a special person who is out there waiting to meet you!

See if he only contacts you after dark.,
See if he only contacts you on the weekdays.,
See if he only contacts you sporadically.,
See if he doesn't respond to you unless you want to hook up.,
See if he's always ""so busy."",
See if he never invites you anywhere.",How to Tell when a Guy Is Using You for Sex1," If your guy only calls you hours after the sun has set below the horizon and the stars come out, chances are, it's not because he's in the mood for stargazing. Though it does mean that he's definitely in the mood. If you never hear from him until after-hours, unless he's a doctor with an insane schedule, it's likely that it means he only has sex on the brain.;
, If he gets in touch with you on week nights but you almost never hear from him on the weekends, it's because he's reserving the weekends for his Grade-A tail, or for the women that he actually thinks are worth dating. If you never hear from him until rarely on Friday or Saturday nights, but come Tuesday, his schedule is wide open, then it's because he expects your legs to be wide open, too., If you only hear from him once or twice a week, and it's not to set up a date, but to sporadically come over right now, then he may just want you for sex. If you can't get a hold of him when you want to see how he's doing for five days, but suddenly he's blowing up your phone at midnight on a Wednesday night, then he must be ready for some more convenient late night lovin'.

, If you text him to say, ""How's your day going?"" or ""How was your big test?"" and you hear nothing but the crickets in the woods behind your house, then he doesn't want to make small talk. But if you text him a casual ""I want to see you,"" one night, and you can already hear him put his foot on the gas pedal, then you have a problem. , It's okay to have a busy schedule, but if it means your guy can never make time for dinner and a movie but can always make time for some catching-up between the sheets, then he's not busy -- he just wants to get busy. If you know that he has time to hang out with friends, go to sporting events, and spend hours watching TV with his brother, but when he's too busy to grab coffee on a Sunday afternoon, then he just doesn't want to make time for you.

, If he only calls you to ""hang out"" at your place, or to spend some time ""catching up"" on the couch of his dirty apartment, then he doesn't really want to do anything that doesn't involve your body. Sure, the occasional drink or fancy dinner can be his way of ""making it up to you,"" but if you feel like you almost never see the outside world together, then he doesn't want you to be a part of his everyday life for a reason.

Identify whether what you and the other person feel is sexual attraction.,
Ask yourself if you or the other person feel love for the other.,
Realize that biology plays a role.,
Suggest doing different activities with the other person.",How to Tell if It's Real Love or Just Sex1," Signs of lust might include focusing on each other’s appearance, having a relationships that revolves around sex, and little interest in having real conversations and getting to know the other person. Having a relationship based entirely on sexual attraction can work for a while, but things can become complicated if one partner feels love for the other while the other only feels lust.

, Love is usually coupled with sexual attraction, but love goes deeper. Think about whether you and the other person have long and deep conversations to really get to know each other and if you value each other’s happiness. Analyze if you want to be part of that person’s life by getting to know friends and family, and whether you feel romantic attachment to that person. Do you share similar values and interests? Do you feel a deep connection to that person?

Some qualities you might find in a suitable partner include:A commitment to personal growth and becoming a better person.
An awareness of his or her own baggage or weaknesses.
Emotional openness.
Responsible and respectful.
Integrity; he or she practices honesty with you, him or herself, and others.
Loves because he or she feels good about him or herself, not in order to feel good about him or herself.

, Lust and romantic love are two of three brain systems that help explain universal human attitudes toward mating and reproduction. Sexual attraction, romantic love, and long-term feelings of attachment work together in different proportions to create feelings of love in a relationship.

, Try to find events that you would both enjoy. If it’s easy to find things that you love to do together, you might be on the way to love. If you have trouble finding anything to do together that doesn’t revolve around sex or the promise of sex, it’s a good guess that you’re just experiencing sexual attraction.

See if you never talk about your personal lives.,
See if it feels like all you do is sex.,
See if he's quick to leave after a love making session.,
See if you never kiss without it leading to sex.,
See if you've never hung out with his friends.",How to Tell when a Guy Is Using You for Sex2," If all you do is talk about hooking up or how much you want each other, then your relationship is mostly about sex. Sure, many relationships can start off like that -- you're obsessed with each other, you're always having sex, you're missing invitations to have sex, etc -- but if it's been a long time and you haven't progressed past the sex sex sex phase, then your relationship may not be deeper than that. Or if you are the only one disclosing all the details of your past history, relationships, etc, and he never shares real details about his past, but always phrases questions to get more information about you, then be careful he is trying to manipulate you.


See how he reacts when you ask him what he's thinking, feeling, wondering about. If he immediately backs off, then you have a problem.

, Are you spending an infinite amount of time in the boudoir? Is this balancing out with a whole lot of other activities together or is it the main (or even only) activity the two of you spend together? If it is taking up more time developing a range of interests together, then it is probable that he is only interested in your relationship for the sex. Is he requiring you to perform additional sexual acts that you are not comfortable with?


Even if it's not literally all you do, if you feel that way, then you have to follow your gut.

, Or if he doesn't really contact you after a love making session. Does he rarely or never stay the night? If so, you're one of his nightly activities, not the love of his life. If he'll give you perfunctory kiss, and then start throwing on his clothes, then he doesn't want to spend the night with you because it will feel too much like you have a real relationship. And if he always offers a convenient excuse for why he has to go, or why he doesn't contact, or he is always so busy, then that's even worse.


Sure, he may tell you that he has to wake up wicked early. But then why did he wait until 1 a.m. to come over to your place?

, In most relationships, people kiss just to show affection, to feel a connection, and to be intimate in a quick and enjoyable fashion. You can just be kissing when you're taking a walk, kissing in a dark bar, or just because you have the urge on a Monday morning. If every time you kiss your man, he starts reaching for your x-rated body parts, then he may think that he should only kiss you for some sexy time.


Check out his level of affection. Does he ever want to snuggle, cuddle, or hug just because, without any sexual connection? If not, then it may be because he wants one thing only.

, Have you been hooking up for months, but you've never met a single one of his friends? Does he hang out with his friends all the time without you but never invite you out to join him? That's because either he's too embarrassed to bring you around, because he doesn't want to invest that much in your relationship, or even because there may be some other girls hanging around who he wants to keep away from you."

See if he never reveals personal information.,
See if he's bored when you talk about yourself.,
See if he rarely seems to care how you're feeling.,
See if he tells you he doesn't want a relationship.,
See if he never talks about a future with you.,
See if all he talks about is sex.",How to Tell when a Guy Is Using You for Sex3," Guys who are using a woman for sex often give few or no details about themselves. Have you gleaned what you know about him from friends, personal observation, general conversations, past interactions, or has he really volunteered personal and revelatory information about himself to you? This is a VERY telling point, so it is worth considering carefully.

, Does he get bored quickly when you discuss your work, your hobbies, your activities, general daily issues? Does he try to stop the discussion and turn it back into ""fixing everything with a snuggle on the couch""?. If so, he might be pushing aside the emotional entanglement of a real relationship just so that he can keep open the using side without feelings of guilt. He could also present himself as a counselor and offer advice about all of your issues, but not disclose any of his so that you can be involved in his life.

, Have you never heard him randomly ask if you're upset, ask how your day was, or just wonder why you had tears in your eyes? If he seems absolutely allergic to your emotions, then chances are it's not because he's too shy to ask or too awkward to help you deal, but it's because, well, he just doesn't really care that much. If he's just into you for sex, then any of your complicated, messy feelings will be a hurdle for him and nothing more.

, This may seem like a no-brainer, but many women refuse to see what's right in front of their eyes, even if they hear it. If he has told you that he's just into casual dating, that he doesn't have time for anything serious, or that he's just not a relationship kind of guy, then he probably meant it. You might have brushed this aside, thought he was just trying to play hard to get, or were convinced that you could change him. Well, if he has specifically told you that he's essentially not interested in much more than sex, then you need to rethink your ""relationship.""

, Have you been hooking up for months and haven't ever talked about what you're going to do even a month from the day you see your guy, let alone next summer? Have you been at it for over a year but you haven't made any moves to get more serious? If not, then he may just see you as a temporary thing and isn't ready to be the boyfriend you want him to be.

, Is he interested in emotional discussions about his feelings? Does he discuss where things are headed with the two of you? Or is it more you? Or is he more interested in whether you've purchased new crotchless undies and if you remembered to pop into the pharmacy this morning for additional supplies? Or if you considered trying out that new sexual position?

See if his phone is always blowing up when he's around you.,
Check out all the girls all over his Facebook.,
See if you've been warned.,
See if you've just made no progress in your relationship.,
Go with your gut.",How to Tell when a Guy Is Using You for Sex4," If he shows up and his phone rings off the hook, and he keeps looking at it and then shutting it off, then it may be because the ladies are calling him 24/7. If he's texting as soon as you step out of the room and abruptly puts away his phone when you show up, then you're not the only girl in his life. And if he never leaves his phone unattended, not even for a second, then it may be because he doesn't want you to see all of the sweet texts from his other side pieces.

, Let's say you're his Facebook friend, and you better be. Check out his profile and see if there are tons of girls messaging him, if he's flirting all over the Internet, and if there are dozens of photos with him looking booze addled and surrounded by scantily-clad women. If that's the case, then you know where he goes when he falls off the radar for five days; and it's not just because he's having a crazy week at work. Is his facebook seemingly completely unmanned or he seemingly rarely uses it, yet you know he watches your every facebook move, that is a tell-tell sign.

, Have other women come up to you and told you to stay away from him? Have your friends told you that he's a player, and that he'll never be your boyfriend? Unless you think you can ""tame"" or ""change"" him, (and you can't) then these are bright red flags that say it's time to call it quits pronto. Don't think that you're different, or that these women don't know what they're talking about. If you've heard it from multiple people, then chances are, they're right.

, Has it been six months and you still haven't met his friends, talked about the upcoming months in your lives, gone shopping together, hung out during the day, or done any of the things that normal people do? It's okay if it takes a long time for him to say ""I love you,"" but if he has rarely even said, ""I really like you,"" and it's been a while, then things may not be moving forward because he only sees you as his plaything.

, Wake up! If you're even contemplating this might be a possibility, you've got a gut feeling in there that is trying to warn you. Look around you and assess the situation for what it is. How is it making you feel? Are you happy? Are you satisfied with the relationship as it is? Can you actually have a future with this guy? Most likely not, meaning you need to start thinking about whether this relationship is worth the risk.


Guess what? There's plenty more where he came from. Move on and locate your self-esteem; put it back where it belongs, reclaiming your self-respect and keeping your sexuality, physical health, emotional sanity, and sense intact.

Talk to the other person about what they are getting out of the relationship.,
Ask yourself whether you want to continue in a relationship if it’s clear you have different goals.,
Pause the relationship if you can’t agree.",How to Tell if It's Real Love or Just Sex2," If he or she only talks about your appearance or your sex life, that points to it being primarily a case of sexual attraction. Even if you might feel love, you have to consider the other person’s feelings and ideas about the connection you share. Discussions like these can be uncomfortable, but they can also help clarify how you both feel.

""I really like hanging out with you and I hope you like hanging out with me. What do you have the most fun doing together?""
""I don’t want a big serious conversation, but I wanted to know if you like keeping things the way they are between us or if ultimately you might be looking for more.""
""I know we haven’t defined things, and that’s fine, but I wanted to know how you see our relationship.""

, Even though lust can turn to romantic love, it’s often just about sexual attraction and will not develop into anything further. As much as you might want one kind of relationship with the other person, if they do not reciprocate you can’t have the connection you want.

, Sometimes both sides need time to think about what they really want. If you have two different ideas about where the relationship is headed, you might not be able to reach a shared understanding of what you have. If you can reach a shared vision about where you’re going, that’s great. But it’s often difficult, if not impossible, if you and the other person are far apart in terms of what you hope to get out of the relationship. At that point, you would probably want to break it off.

Share your vision for the relationship.,
Determine if the other person has the same goals for the relationship.,
Keep communicating about the relationship.,
Speak up if you do not like the way the relationship is going.",How to Tell if It's Real Love or Just Sex3," Be honest with the other person. If you want a monogamous romantic relationship, let them know. If you want a primarily sexual relationship in which you’re both free to see other people, they should know that as well. Don’t just assume they know what you want – tell them.

""I’d like to continue being with you, but I was hoping we could agree not to date other people. I really like you and would like to see where this relationship goes.""
""I think we have great sex and I want that to continue. I’m really not looking for anything more at this time. How do you feel about that?""
""I’m not sure where our connection will lead, but I think we have something special and I want to take the time to explore that. How would you feel about waiting to have sex for a while?""

, If the other person is in agreement, figure out each of your expectations. Any relationship you choose to have is legitimate – from one based on sex to one that saves sex and is only about romantic love, and everything in between. Think about how to achieve your relationship goals if you and your partner want the same thing. If you both feel just lust, what kind of parameters will you put on your time together? If you both are feeling romantic love, what next steps toward commitment do you want to take together?

""I’d like for us to keep hanging out like this, but I’d really like you to meet my friends – they really want to meet you. Would you feel comfortable coming to a party with me?""
""I know we’re both busy and want to keep this pretty light. Why don’t we just get in touch when we want to have sex?""
""Can I call you my girlfriend/boyfriend? I know we hadn’t talked about this yet, but I was hoping that we could define each other in that way.""

, You might find that your ideas about where it’s going change as time goes on. It’s possible that the romantic love you thought you felt was actually excitement and you just want to keep having sex with the other person and leave it at that. Or you might find the connection sex brings you leads to a deeper connection and the beginnings of romantic love.

""I know we had talked about seeing where this relationship went, and I think I’m happy for us to be friends who have sex together and leave it at that.""
""It’s been great being intimate with you, and I am feeling a deeper connection. Would you be willing to hang out sometimes and not have sex and see where we are?""
""I’m confused. I thought I wanted a _______ relationship with you, but now I’m not so sure. I think I want a _______ relationship instead. How do you feel about that?""

, You’ve laid out what you want from a relationship, now you need to make sure the other person knows exactly what you need. In the first stages of a relationship, it’s easy to let things slide, but this can lead to problems later. Tell them what you want and need.

""I like going out for beers with you, but could we do some other activities instead this weekend?""
""It seems like you always want to spend Sunday with your family. I’m okay with doing that some of the time, but I want to do other stuff too. Do you think you could go alone this weekend?""
""I don’t like the fact that we've fallen into a pattern of just having sex and watching TV. Can we plan something else sometimes?""

Break up with the person if you can’t agree on a shared vision of your relationship.,
Allow yourself time to move on.,
Find out what works for you.",How to Tell if It's Real Love or Just Sex4,"

This might happen early, when you’re just getting to know each other, or later, once the relationship has settled down into a rhythm. As much as you might want a relationship to work, if you can’t come to an agreement on the parameters of your time together, it’s not going to work. Giving it time might seem like a good idea, but it usually just makes it harder to leave as time goes on.

""I don’t think we want the same things and I don’t think we ever will. I think it’s best we stop seeing each other.""
""It’s been fun, but I need to move on. I want something different from you than you want from me.""
""I love you, but you don’t love me back, and it’s too painful to be in a relationship with you knowing that. I can’t see you any more. ""

, As tempting as it may be to get right back out and find someone new, you’re emotionally vulnerable. Spend time with friends and family, reconnect with your interests, and reflect on what you learned from the relationship that just ended. Recharging yourself emotionally is essential before you try and find someone new.

, Are you looking for romantic love, or someone with whom to have an entirely physical relationship? Your answers will probably change based on where you are in your life. Think about where and how to meet the kinds of people you want to date. Whether in person or online, you have an array of choices in finding your next relationship.

Men want to feel that they are doing things because they want their partners to be happy, not because they feel forced to do them. Use non-verbals like ""the lip"" and ""big eyes"" to persuade your man when words aren't working.;
, He loves to play the role of ""knight in shining armor."" While you may feel strong and independent without his help, allowing him to feel that he is taking care of you and protecting you will make him happy. Appreciate chivalrous gestures, like when he opens the door for you or lets you enter a room first.

, You will have an easier time getting your man to do something if you convince him that doing it is his idea in the first place. Use subtle clues that will gently push him to make the right decisions.


If you want him to fix your car, and you're tired of asking him directly, say something like, ""I saw a broken-down car on the interstate today. You know, it makes me feel paranoid about mine.""
You can also say, ""I'm starting to think that I need a new car. How long will we have to save money for a down payment?"" He's a lot more likely to fix your car because he's either a) motivated to protect you or b) concerned about spending too much money., Don't tell your friends (especially if he's standing right there) that you have him wrapped around your finger. Don't talk as though you can make him do anything or control him. The last thing your guy wants is to be emasculated in the eyes of your friends or family.

, Don't constantly talk about your ex or compare your current man to your ex. Also, don't date a new man if you're not really over your ex. Your new guy doesn't deserve to be blamed for someone else's actions or held to someone else's standard. Comparing him to your ex will make him feel like less of a man, so don't do it.

, Male emotions are a lot less complex than female emotions. They know what they want and what they don't want, and they scare easily. Guys do not normally discuss feelings and are rarely emotionally open unless they are extremely comfortable with you. In many societies, men avoid revealing their feelings so that they can feel as though they're in control.

, Some men will come out and answer ""yes"" and ""no"" to your questions, but others won't. If you want them to do something, they may say ""yes"" when they don't want to. You should know him well enough to figure out whether he's saying ""yes"" just to please you or ""yes"" because it's something he wants to do. He won't be mad if you don't figure it out, but he may resent it and feel as though he's being controlled.

, For example, suppose that you are bringing in groceries while he's watching the game on TV. If you want help, say something like, ""Do you want me to wait until the commercial to finish bringing stuff in?"" or ""Will you take a break and help me bring in these bags?"" Don't launch into a long discussion about how he's not noticing that you need help or that it makes you feel neglected, how he's never attentive to your needs, etc., because he'll immediately tune you out. Keep it direct and simple, and you're more likely to get your way.

, Both constant criticism and manipulation are sure to drive him away.


Listen to his ideas with respect, even if they differ from yours. Don't forget your Opinions either though. Make sure he listens to you as well as you do him and When you understand him and where he's coming from, then you can decide if you want to stay with him or look for another relationship.
If he has to change something major before you're going to want to spend life with him, then let him know how you feel and stick to your guns. He may want to change things like his job, his city, his religion or something else to make you happy at first. However, the change may not stick, and it could become a major problem down the road.
Be ready to walk away from the relationship instead of asking him to be someone he's not. At the same time, be who you are, and don't change what you value just so that he'll accept you.

, Guys want to be told by their partner what they should and shouldn't do physically because they won't always be able to figure it out on their own. His feelings will not be hurt, and it's not going to ruin the moment for him. If anything, it will be a relief so he knows the boundaries. Don't be aggressive with your words or actions. Be kind and gentle unless he takes ""Matters into his own hand."" Skip the subtle signals and tell him exactly what's okay and what's not.

, Guys can have obsessions over their partners' eyes, hair, hands or other random body parts. If he likes it when you do something with your hair, do it a lot. If he loves your hands and he gives you a ring, wear it whenever you're with him. If he likes a more intimate part of your body, enjoy it. A lot of women would kill for the attention that he's paying to your body.

, Hold his hand with both your hands or wrap your arms around his. Put your hand on his face, run your fingers up and down his arm or hold his hand against your face or chest. It's okay to be affectionate with your man as long as you aren't being clingy. Affection is about devotion and love; clinging is about ownership. Follow his nonverbal signals to learn what he likes and doesn't like.

, If your man has a bad day at work, then give him a shoulder rub while he tells you about it. Say something sympathetic about his day, and tell him that you love and appreciate him.

, Stereotypes say that all men want is sex, but the truth is that they want to please you as much as they want to enjoy themselves. When you let him know that you enjoy the way he touches you, you'll deliver a major ego boost for him. Again, communicate what you like and what you don't. When he delivers what you like, do the same for him in return.

, A guy likes to know that his partner feels grateful to be with him. He'll return the favor 100 times over. If you make him feel like he isn't good enough, he may feel insecure about your relationships other guys, or he may leave you. Guys don't like feeling inferior any more than girls do.

, Sure, he wants to take care of you, but you have to reciprocate. Learn the things that make him feel valued and loved. For instance, if he loves a home-cooked meal, and you enjoy cooking, then cook his favorite dishes to show him that you love him.

, Remember what it was like in the beginning, when you'd both do anything for each other. Keep that mindset, and treat him as someone who can't be lost. Just make sure that he's returning the favor and making you feel just as appreciated as you make him feel.

, Tell him you will never leave his side. Never give him the ""thin-ice"" feeling to get your way. Don't threaten to end the relationship to get your way about something really insignificant. On the other hand, know what's a deal breaker and what's not so that you don't carry on a relationship that's not meeting your needs.

, When he says that he won't leave you no matter what, and his behavior matches his words, then trust him. Don't ask him constantly whether or not he loves you because you'll drive him nuts--and you may drive him away.

, Guys tend to be territorial and jealous, particularly if their partners show any attention to other guys.


Respect his feelings and avoid getting too emotionally or physically connected to other men. The last thing that you want is a man who doesn't feel secure in your love.
Mystery is always good. Don't wear clothes that are too revealing when you're out in public. No matter how much he likes your curves, he hates it when you show them to others because he doesn't want anyone else looking at his lady. Look your best, but don't dress like a hooker. Save the revelations for the times when you're alone.
Expect a little jealousy if you often take trips by yourself. Guys have seen too many movies where the girl meets someone new when she's away and runs off with him. Try to include him in as many trips as possible. When you get home from a solo excursion, make sure to let him know you're glad to be home.

, Your man wants to be included in the things that you do. At the same time, respect the things he likes to do that you aren't necessarily familiar with.


If he loves to watch a sport, then learn something about the sport or try going to games with him. If you hate it, then you don't have to continue going. At the same time, you may discover that you'll enjoy yourself more than you thought.
Give him gifts based on his interests, not based on your interests. Doing this shows that you're into the things he cares about.

, Men are afraid of losing their independence, and they still want to be able to hang out with their buddies while still loving you. While he may have to do less with his friends than he did when he was single, he still needs the chance to go out once in a while. Make sure that you also maintain friendships apart from the relationship so that you preserve your own identity."

Keep in touch throughout the day.,
Improve how you argue.,
Drop the constant criticism.,
Be soft on the person, tough on the issue.,
Use words of affection.",How to Treat a Man So That He Doesn't Cheat1," Both partners should work hard not to withdraw. In order to have a positive relationship, you need to communicate on a constant basis. It’s important not to let things fester. You need to be so on top of your relationship that you spot little changes in the dynamic before they become big changes.


Talk to him about his day – every day. Text him an “I love you” or call him during the day to see how his day is going. Don’t do this so much you’re disrupting his work, but do it here or there to let him know you’re thinking about him.
Every single day ask him this question: ""How was your day?"" This lets him know you care, and it creates bonding to share positive or even negative experiences. Don't forget the art of listening. It's really important in relationships. ;
, Couples who ""argue well"" have a better chance of avoiding infidelity. Every couple argues. But there are ways to make sure arguments don't turn into something more lasting.


If there is some simmering unresolved issue, don’t dodge it. Address it by communicating your thoughts and feelings. However, avoid judging language. Rather than chastising him for not doing something, tell him how you feel about it. If you have concerns about something, frame them as ""I feel such and such"" rather than using blaming language, such as ""why didn't you, etc."" Keep your comments focused on the ""I."" Use plural pronouns like ""we"" and ""us"" and ""our."" Studies have found couples who do so don't have as lasting of arguments. Don't yell, and don't go negative and say things you will regret. If he needs space, give it to him, and continue the conversation in the morning.
Try the 48-hour rule. If you're upset about something your partner did, wait 48 hours before saying anything, and see if you're still upset. This approach will help you address the topic with less emotionalism.

, Yes, sometimes he doesn’t put away his socks. Or he came home too late or forgot to do something around the house. Just make sure you don’t harp on him every single day about this or that.


Men want to feel appreciated too. So avoid negative relationship habits such as blaming, threatening, punishing, or criticizing. You could make a list of things you nag him about and cross out half of them to consciously reduce the criticism. Avoid generalizing statements. This is ineffective communication. Words like ""never,"" ""always,"" or ""every time"" make a statement too generalizing. For example, avoid statements like ""How come you never come home on time?"" Don’t complain about his diet. This can really drive men crazy. Better yet, make him his favorite meals now and then so he looks forward to coming home.

, If you are upset about something he did, when communicating with him, separate the person from the issue.


Remind him you think he's a good person, or you know he didn't mean to make a mistake, but you felt sad when he did (whatever behavior upset you).
Ineffective communicators do the opposite of this. They personalize issues, attacking their partner, while minimizing the issue at hand.

, When's the last time you told him you love him? You can never say it enough. Tell him it before you fall asleep at night or when he leaves for work. Try to say it once a day.


Pay him compliments. Notice if he got his hair cut. Point it out if he's wearing a shirt in a color that looks good with his eyes.
Using terms of endearment - sweetheart, dear, my love - creates bonding and reminds him you care. Thread them into the day's conversation.

Be direct.,
Ask in person.,
Try a phone call.,
Send a text or email.,
Suggest something special for your next date.,
Don't wait too long before asking for another date.",How to Tell Your Date You Want to See Them Again1," Be clear and honest when asking someone for another date. Try to work through any nervousness and be direct with them so they get a chance to agree to see you again. Avoid stammering, stuttering, or speaking unclearly. Always try to be as clear and direct as you can when asking about the next date.Avoid seeking their approval when asking for another date. Saying something like “I'd really like to see you again. I hope you had fun and liked me.” should be avoided.
Take your time, speaking slowly and clearly. Speaking too quickly can make it seem like you are nervous. You may say, ""I had a great time tonight, can we see each other again?"" Or, ""I feel like we made a connection tonight. Let's go out again soon."";
, Asking for another date in person can be a great way to get instant feedback. You may also appear more confident and appealing if you ask about the next date in person. If you feel like your time together is going well, try asking when they want to go on the next date, before parting ways.You'll be able to gauge their interest level before, during and after you ask. Asking in person will let you judge when the best moment to ask might be.

, Calling your date can be a straightforward way to see if they want to go out again. Although texting is a popular method of asking someone out on another date, calling can bring its own benefits. Try calling by phone to send a more personal and direct message.As with asking in person, calling gives you the benefit of being able to pick on signals from tone, pace, or hesitation in the person's voice. Sometimes what is not said is just as important as what is said. You can get cues that you can't get from texting.
Calling by phone can make you stand out. A phone call can show that you are a mature and confident person. Phone calls can also be a better way to show your personality.
For example, during the phone call you may say, ""I had a great time last night. Can we go out again soon?"" Or, ""I feel like we connected well last night. Let's set up another date.""

, Although phone calls have a personal touch, sending a text or email is often the preferred method of contact when asking about another date. Sending an email or text will allow your date time to think and reply, taking some of the pressure away that a phone call would have. Try to send a text or email when asking about another date to help increase your chances of them saying yes.Texts and emails can be sent, received and replied to at any time, unlike phone calls.
You might try texting something like, ""I had so much fun at the movies with you the other night! Would you like to have dinner with me on Thursday?”

, Going on a second date is a good chance for you to show a bit more of your personality and do something exciting. Although it can be tempting to play it safe, taking your date somewhere different or energizing can be a good idea. Think of some fun and exciting places you can visit together to increase your chances of a second date.Trying out a cooking class together can be a fun way for you both to team up and learn something new. You could also take the person to your favorite spot in the city or do an activity they might enjoy, such as a picnic in the park or a drive-in movie theater.
Picking an unappealing venue or activity can make it less likely that your date will agree to going out again. You might want to avoid going out for coffee or to a bar on your second date and opt instead for something more special or unique.

, Waiting too long to ask for another date can cause your date to wonder if you're still interested. They may start to doubt how well things went or if things really worked out between you. To avoid having your date move on or worry about where things are at, try asking them as soon as you can for another date.Don't wait more than a day after your last date to ask about the next one.
Waiting for more than three days after your first date is generally too long.
Asking about another date quickly can help increase the likelihood of the other person agreeing.

Stay great friends.,
Keep your marriage couple-centered as well as child centered.,
Emphasize love and affection in your relationship.,
Use tender touching - even during arguments.,
Understand his love language.,
Don’t forget the importance of sex.,
Learn about his interests.",How to Treat a Man So That He Doesn't Cheat2," Making a relationship work longer term is not all about cruises and nights out on the town. It's being able to depend on each other and showing true caring.


Show understanding. If he's going through a tough time at work, or he's fixated on a stressful project for a short time, show understanding about that.
Show appreciation. Remind him that you appreciate small things he does. If he makes a nice dinner or fixes something around the house, let him know you care.
Above all, always show kindness - in your words and your actions. Be reliable. If he asks you to be somewhere for him, be there, and don't forget. Be someone he turns to first when he needs help.

, Essentially, you need to prioritize your marriage. You need to find time for you as a couple without the distractions of work or children who take your emotional energy. Have a date night for just the two of you several times a month. This gives you a chance to see each other in a romantic light, which can be hard when you're in the middle of parenting.
Pick the right friends. Studies have shown that couples who hang out with happily married couples are less likely to divorce. So pick your friends carefully. Develop couples friends, not just friends you both had individually when you were single.
If he starts developing friends you don’t know, such as at work, make a concerted effort to get to know them as a couple also. For example, invite that work friend over for dinner – with her husband.

, Realize he wants to feel wanted. Sometimes men cheat because they don’t feel desired anymore. If you take time to remind him that you love him - if you show him true affection - you will reduce the chances he will cheat, and he will be more likely to show you the affection you've wanted back.


To make him feel wanted, you need to create intimacy in your marriage. This can be done in different ways. One is through communication. Another is by holding his hand or kissing him. Small touches are really important in a relationship.Studies have found that emotional dissatisfaction is a far more common reason men cheat than sexual dissatisfaction. Leave him love notes, compliment him on his new tie, buy him a surprise gift, arrange a dinner, make him his favorite meal - these are all ways to show affection to a mate. This can't be a one-way street, but if you show affection, he likely will too.

, Human touch is incredibly important. If you're having a tough conversation, touch his hand or his knee. You might be surprised how hard it is to argue when you're touching. Hug him and/or kiss him goodbye in the morning, hello at night, and goodnight before you fall asleep. It creates a constant bond of intimacy.
Holding his hand, touching his shoulder, these small touches throughout the course of the day remind him how much you care.

, Dr. Gary Chapman wrote a book called the Five Love Languages that argues that people perceive love differently. What’s his love language? If you figure that out, you’ll be able to make him feel loved.


Acts of service. Does he derive a sense of love when people do things for him?
Physical touch. Is physical touch necessary for him to feel loved?
Words of affirmation. Does it matter a lot to him if you verbalize your love?
Quality time. Does he put most importance on the amount of time you spend with him and how you spend it?
Gifts. Does he believe you love him because you give him gifts? Remember that most people have more than one love language. However, figuring out which one they emphasize most really does matter

, Yes, sometimes you’re just not in the mood. Kids or a job can get in the way. And, yes, sex is only part of a relationship. But it’s a part that matters. So don’t neglect it.


Sometimes you should initiate sex. A man wants to feel desired. If you make a sexual pass at him, he will feel you desire him.
Don’t let it get boring. You should be open to some experimentation. That doesn’t mean you should do anything that makes you uncomfortable. But the missionary position every single time? Mix it up.

, Although you shouldn’t become a chameleon who loses herself in her man’s interests completely, what’s wrong with trying to develop a common bond by liking some of the things he cares about?


Take the time to truly understand what he does at work. Read an article a week about his field, so you can surprise him with knowledgeable conversation about what he does during the day.
What’s wrong with watching a sporting event now and then, or learning how to play golf, if that’s what he loves?
Rather than feeling threatened by his old college friend or single work colleague, get to know them too.

Be spontaneous sometimes.,
Have your own interests.,
Take care of yourself.,
Make sure you have fun.",How to Treat a Man So That He Doesn't Cheat3," Men cheat sometimes simply because they want physical variety. Marriage or a relationship has become mundane, and the man longs for something more exciting. There’s nothing like the feel of the chase or the rush of the first kiss. If you recognize this factor, you can work to keep your own relationship exciting.


Do spontaneous things (and sometimes leave the kids behind). Arrange a weekend trip without telling him and surprise him with it.
Change your hairstyle. He might be surprised to come home and see you with a hot new ‘do. Or try a new scent. Get a new car. Do something to change it up every now and then.
Develop a hobby. When he sees your excitement in something new, he might be encouraged to try it.
Travel a lot. Changing the environment now and then may reduce his boredom.

, Find a passion or a cause. Confidence is attractive, as is someone who has something interesting to talk about.


You don’t want to have to force a man to realize you’re worth not cheating on. Just develop a persona and life that tells that story on its own.
Men are attracted to women with confidence. Excessive jealousy is not very attractive. If you are snooping in his stuff and constantly demanding to know whether he is cheating, you might actually make him more likely to cheat. You’re a woman not worth cheating on because you’re surrounded by passion, good work, hobbies, friends who care about you, and a confident attitude. , Yes, he should love you just the way you are. And, yes, he’s probably gained a few pounds since college, too. However, if you completely let yourself go, he may be more likely to look elsewhere.


Work out together. Not only will you both be healthier, but you will get to spend more time together and in a positive way. Doing things together outside of the routine at home like this is a good way to build common ground. Although you don’t always have to make yourself up, if you’re not at work, don’t welcome him home in sweatpants, with unstyled hair. Put on a little makeup, and at least get out of the PJs.
Go to one of those mall makeup counters, and have them show you how to use the products. Some women don’t wear much makeup only because they’re insecure and don’t know how to do it. Most men don’t like it when women are too heavily made up, but a little mascara and concealer can do wonders.
Wear something nice to bed. This doesn’t have to always be fancy lingerie (although sometimes it can be). But can the bulky grandma nighties and sweatpants, at least. Go to sleep in his shirt or in a T shirt with pajama shorts.

, Relationships can be worn down by the mundane, the routines of daily life. Make sure you carve out enough time to have some fun.


You could each write down a list of fun things that you would like to do. A bucket list of sorts. Then, share lists. Each of you should choose one thing from your spouse's list, and then schedule it!
Try doing something new with your partner (exploring a new cuisine, for example) or try something athletic. "

Make eye contact.,
Break the touch barrier.,
Use mirroring.",How to Tell Your Date You Want to See Them Again2," On your date, you can make eye contact to send a simple and direct message that you're interested in the person you're with. Maintaining good eye contact will let your date know that you want to hear what they have to say and that you are enjoying your time together. Try to make good eye contact with your date to let them know you'd like to see more of them.Avoid staring contests. Try looking at something else to make eye contact breaks occasionally.
Lack of eye contact can mean that you or your date is uninterested or shy.

, Physical touch is a powerful message that you can send, letting your date know that you're really enjoying their company. You can try moving closer to them, putting your arm around them or even holding their hand. Take note of how they respond to learn if they might be as interested in another date as you are.You can break the touch barrier by lightly touching their arm or hand while you are laughing at something they have said. Or you may brush the person's hair out of their eyes or fix their hair for them to introduce some physical touch.
If you notice your date moving away from you or stiffening up, there is a good chance that your touch has made them uncomfortable. You should move away and stop touching them.
If your date moves closer to you or reciprocates the touch, they are likely comfortable and interested in you.

, Mirroring is the natural tendency for people who are getting along to copy one another's movements and behaviors. To help show that you're interested in your date and build a better connection, you can try subtly mimicking some of your date's motions. Looking for signs that your date is copying your motions can also be a hint that they are interested in you.Mirroring will generally be a natural and unconscious action.
Facial expressions, tone of voice and posture are all examples of behaviors that can be mirrored. For example, perhaps if your date leans towards you, you lean towards them also. If your date tilts their head when they look at you, you may do the same.
If you try to copy your date's behaviors, avoid doing so too obviously. Blatantly copying someone else's motions can actually cause them to dislike you. Don't mirror every single move your date makes, and allow a few seconds to pass before you mirror their actions.

Mention upcoming plans.,
Gauge their interest.,
Act confident.,
Have fun together.",How to Tell Your Date You Want to See Them Again3," Instead of directly asking about the next date, you can try suggesting one. Offering a suggestion can be a gentle approach, allowing you to make your plans known without pushing it on the other person. Suggesting an activity can also also allow your date to have their input known, giving them an active role in planning the date.You might open by saying “What are your plans this weekend? I'm going bowling and wondered if you might want to go with me.”
Try to phrase the date as an idea or alternative to whatever they had originally planned.

, During a date, you'll want to judge how interested the other person seems to be. If you think they are having a great time and feel that there is a real connection between both of you, it's likely that another date is on the horizon. Take a look at some of these behavioral examples to learn if your date might be interested in seeing you again:The date should have felt relaxed after you overcame the initial nerves of meeting.
If the conversation felt forced or was absent, your date might not be interested in going out again.
You and your date should both be naturally curious about one another.
If there really isn't an effort to learn more about one another, it might not be a good idea to ask for another date.

, Although you may be nervous on your first or second date, being confident can be a big help. Displaying behaviors that let your date know that you are relaxed, comfortable and confident can all help make you more interesting and attractive. Try using some of these tips to help you look and feel confident on your date:You can act confident by maintaining straight body posture and maintaining eye contact with the person you are addressing. You can walk confidently by keeping your head level and facing straight ahead, rather than towards the ground. Smiling and acknowledging others around you can also project confidence.
Sitting in a somewhat expansive position can also convey confidence. Sitting with one ankle resting on the opposite knee or with one arm resting over an adjacent chair can open up your posture.
Watch some examples of people who appear confident and self-assured. Try to copy the way they walk and move to help make you feel more confident yourself.
Think of your accomplishments to remind yourself that you are a capable and unique individual. But don't be arrogant or overly self-confident. Try to relax and keep the focus on your date, rather than your own strengths.

, Going on a first date can be a stressful time; however, being stressed out on a date can actually make things more difficult. Relaxing and being yourself are always good ideas when going on your first date. The less stress you feel, the more fun you'll be able to have, making it more likely that a second date is in the future.You can have fun with your date by opting for a more activity oriented date like bowling, playing board games, or going for a romantic bike ride around the city. You should focus on how you can keep your date entertained and engaged on the date so it feels fun for both of you.

Realize some guys have a hard time verbalizing emotions.",How to Tell if He Really Loves You," If your boyfriend loves you, he will treat you with respect. That means that he listens to you and cares about what's going on in your life. He notices the little things that you like and goes out of his way to give them to you. He values you as a person, and he genuinely listens to your opinions. Doing these things shows he honestly cares about you.;
, If a guy really loves you, it's doubtful you'll need to question it. That is, he's going to make you feel his love in one way or another, by showing you how he feels and saying it to you.On the other hand, you have to make sure that maybe you're not letting your insecurities overrule the emotions of someone who obviously loves you. In other words, you may not feel like he loves you, but it could be just your anxieties talking. If past partners have said you get clingy sometimes, it may be a sign you're insecure. You may also notice yourself trying to be extra nice to win his love or trying to meet his needs all the time without thinking about your own.One way to combat this type of insecurity is to pay attention to what you're feeling instead of always focusing on others; take the time to identify each emotion. As you identify emotions, notice how it guides your behavior. If you're feeling upset and you start worrying that your boyfriend doesn't love you, you may find yourself trying to please him more. Often, these anxieties are unfounded, especially if he's finding ways to show his love all the time.Also, it's important to identify the source of your insecurity. Maybe you've internalized the critical voice of one of your parents, or maybe you've had rotten luck in past relationships with guys who have mistreated you. Don't just let your inner critic run wild. Instead, talk back to it. When you catch yourself doubting the other person or yourself, try to turn it around. For instance, if you find yourself saying ""He didn't call me back, so he probably doesn't love me anymore,"" try to stop the thought. Say, ""No, that's not right. He tells me he loves me everyday. He probably just got busy."", A guy who loves you is going to want to spend time with you. If he makes time for you on a regular basis and goes out of his way to see you, he's likely in love with you.Watch to see if he blows you off. If your guy doesn't really care, he's more likely to blow you off. That means he won't make time for you as often as you'd like, and when he does, he may cancel at the last minute. If he's not consistently making time for you, then he probably doesn't love you.Of course, sometimes, a guy is going to have a legitimate reason to cancel on you. However, he should try to give you as much advance notice as possible. He should also be interested in rescheduling. If he's not, he may not be that into you.

, That is, he should be willing to come up with plans and dates, not just you. You shouldn't have to schedule everything yourself. If he's willing to take the lead at least part of the time, he probably cares for you.One way to make sure he's willing is to don't plan everything. Give your guy a chance to plan dates for you. He should be willing to take the initiative if he cares about you., Being in a relationship means making sacrifices sometimes by compromising with another person. That means, sometimes he gives a little more, and sometimes you give a little more. For instance, it may mean he's willing to go see a movie that he knows he's not going to like, while you're willing to go to the sport's bar sometimes, even if it's not your thing. If he's willing to participate in some give and take, then he's probably starting to fall in love with you.

, For instance, does he ask you if you want water when he goes to the kitchen? Does he plug in your phone when he notices it's low? If he anticipates what you need and does little things to make your life better, then he probably loves you., If a guy loves you and wants to be with you, then he shouldn't be embarrassed by you. That means that he's at least willing to introduce you to friends and family. If he doesn't want to introduce you, that may mean he's not sure about you yet. Though he could have other reasons to not want to introduce you (such as your religious differences), being embarrassed can be a red flag.

, This step goes hand-in-hand with the previous one. If he's embarrassed by you, he won't draw you close in public. In other words, watch to see if he likes to pull you close in public or if he likes to publicly display his affection, such as by holding hands or giving you a hug. If he doesn't, it may be that he's not that into you, though it could also just be that he's shy in public., If he only calls once a week and barely has anything to say, that's probably not a good sign. However, if he spontaneously texts, emails, and calls on a regular basis, then he probably can't get you out of his mind, meaning he loves you.However, every guy is different. Maybe he's an introvert, and he doesn't like to spend every minute with another person, even someone he loves. Make sure you try to figure out what kind of person he is before jumping to conclusions.

, That is, when you get together, does he ask questions about you and your day? Does he seem to genuinely care about what's going on in your life? If he's truly interested in what you're doing, he likely cares about you., Of course, guys (and people) in general are going to forget things, including important dates and past conversations. But if he makes an effort to remember important dates, and he obviously is paying attention to the conversations you have by bringing them up later, then he is likely in love with you., To truly fight with someone, you need to care about that person, and then find a way to make amends. If he's not willing to fight or if he just brushes off arguments with a shrug, he may not care that deeply about you.


You don't necessarily need to have knock-down, drag-out fights. But you both need to be able to express your opinions and thoughts, even if it leads to an argument. If he doesn't seem willing to engage, he may not be into you.

, That is, if he starts using ""we"" on a regular basis, rather than just ""I,"" that could be a sign he loves you. ""We"" indicates he's started thinking of you as a unit, a couple, which means he's starting to commit to you being together., If you have your own language, including pet names and inside jokes, that's a good sign. It means that he cares enough about you to fully engage in the relationship. If he has a pet name for you (and only you), it likely means he's at least falling for you.

, If you're in a healthy relationship, you can simply have a conversation about your feelings. Talk about what you like about him, and tell him what you are feeling. In turn, ask if he has the same kinds of feelings for you.


For instance, you could say, ""I think I'm falling in love with you. I'm not sure if you feel the same way, so I'm feeling a little insecure.""

, Saying ""I love you"" makes you vulnerable, as the other person may not reciprocate those feelings. He may feel afraid that you'll reject his love, even if you've shown him you love him already., If he's been in a bad relationship in the past, he may not be as willing to jump in emotionally to this relationship. Therefore, don't automatically assume something's wrong if he hasn't said it yet; he may just be waiting until he feels ready to make a commitment to you., It may be that he just doesn't like to talk about his emotions. Instead, maybe he prefers to just show how he feels about you, making you a priority in his life.

You can be taken advantage of no matter who you are. For instance, if the relationship is always one-sided, such as you're always driving her everywhere, you could be being taken advantage of.;

, That is, some women may use you by only calling when they want something. Maybe they want you to fix something or pick up something for them. Pay attention to when women call and how they talk on the phone with you. If she only calls every few weeks and seems to want a favor each time, she may not be that into you., If she only wants to chat you up at work, she may just be using you to get ahead.

However, she also could just be stringing you along., If she's only calling late, say after 10 or 11 pm, she may just want to have sex with you. You do have to take her schedule into consideration; she may be calling late because that's when she gets out of class or off work. Of course, if you're both open to that type of relationship, it's fine. However, if you want more than that, you may need to end it., Everyone does something wrong sometimes. You apologize and move on. However, if she never seems to want to apologize, that's likely a sign she doesn't care about the relationship. She may even use tears to move the situation along without her having to admit she was wrong.Of course, apologizing goes both ways. You have to be willing to apologize in a relationship, too.

, If she's proud to be in the relationship, she'll be happy to call you her boyfriend. However, if she doesn't want to acknowledge you publicly, she may be using you, especially if you've talked about being exclusive in private., Meaning, see if she actually wants you to meet her friends and family. If she deflects questions about getting together with her friends, she may be using you. A person who is excited to be in an honest relationship will likely want you to meet the other people she cares about., That is, does she suddenly drop off the map if you're low on cash. Do you know see her if your car is in for repairs and you sometimes give her a ride? If you notice she's only around when you have something material to offer, she's likely using you.Similarly, if she's all sweetness and light when she's asking for something but then turns mean once she gets it, she may just be using you., For instance, if she's constantly cancelling plans, she doesn't value your time. Everyone has to cancel sometimes, but if she is always bowing out at the last minute, that could be a sign she's not into you. Similarly, if she constantly wants you to change what other plans you have, she's saying she doesn't care about what you value., Think about what you want to say beforehand, and remember to include specific examples of how you think she is using you.Don't be angry or antagonistic. Try to keep the conversation polite and calm. Ask her what she thinks about the situation.Be ready for some anger. If the person is using you, she'll likely deny it and be angry about it. If she feels like she's not using you, she'll likely be angry at the accusation., Ask her what she needs and expects from a relationship. Present what you need and expect from a relationship. Negotiate from there how the relationship can move forward.

, You can only have one of two outcomes with this situation. Either you will need to work out a way to create a new type of relationship, or you will need to end it altogether."
"
Pay attention to how he is affectionate with you.,
Notice how much he pays attention to you.,
Compare this guy to a guy who has really liked you in the past.,
Think about whether he seems emotionally attached to you.,
Talk to other people about the situation.,
Think about whether he is honest with you.,
Chart how much progress your relationship has made.,
Notice when he is and isn’t available to see you.This is a big indicator of how interested he is in the relationship.,
Evaluate the way you have been feeling and acting over time.,
Go with your gut.,
Think about who has reached out more.,
Don’t act like you believe him.,
Tell him you don’t want to see him anymore.,
Be honest and straightforward.,
Be prepared to end the conversation.",How to Tell if a Guy Is Playing With Your Feelings," Typically if a guy is playing you, he will become very affectionate or physical when he has a chance to have sex with you. At that point, he probably goes from 0-60 pretty quickly. But up to that point, he was probably not very affectionate. He would not have seemed interested in holding your hand. He didn’t put his arm around because he wanted to. And he didn’t gaze into your eyes when you were just hanging out the two of you without the possibility of sex. Also, he isn’t affectionate with you around his friends or family.


Some exceptions to this could be on the first dates or if you are somewhere exciting or new or out of town. These guys might have been very affectionate at the beginning or might become affectionate occasionally when they are having a lot of fun.
Some guys will use affection at every chance they get because that is their personality. These guys typically have upbeat personalities and are extroverted.;
, If he often seems to be absorbed in something else like his phone, games, or his friends while you hang out, he might not be truly interested in you.Or if he seems to be slightly bored or uninterested in the things you say, he is probably not invested in the relationship. Or it could also be the opposite. He might pay you a ton of attention while you are together but this only happens when it is convenient for him to see you. Also, something might feel weird or unnatural to you about the attention that he gives you.


Does he seem to remember the things that you say? If he likes you, he probably recalls the things you have told him easily. If he isn’t into you, he may not remember the things you tell him.

, It can be helpful to think about guys in the past who have been really into you and compare his behavior to the guy you think might be playing with your feelings. Some examples of what guys are like if they really like you are if a guy is clearly excited to be around you, or he might be shy when you talk. He would make a lot of eye contact or less eye contact than normal, and he would hang around you longer than necessary. If a guy likes you, he seems interested in talking to you more than other people, and he asks about what you are doing and tries to see you again. He might seem nervous and forget things around you. For example, if you are talking about music and he forgets the name of his favorite band, this is a guy who is interested in you.


If the guy you are seeing now doesn’t seem very into you, you might be with someone who is using you.

, If you are being played, the guy may seem really excited about texting you one day and pretty aloof for the next few days after that. He will seem to be able to turn his feelings for you off and on without a problem. On the other hand, if you are seeing someone who is interested in you, his emotions are in the game. He will care about what is going on with you and will become upset when you are upset. He will want you to like him, and he will seem excited when you show your feelings for him and upset if he doesn’t think you like him.

, Other people are great indicators of what is going on because they can give you a fresh and outside perspective of the situation. Tell your friends what is going on and ask them if it seems like he is into you. You can analyze a lot of parts of your relationship, but what you should mainly ask is: “Does he seem into me?”. That is the heart of the situation. If they don’t seem to think he is into you, he probably isn’t you the way you are into him.


Tell your friends the stripped down, bullet point version of what has happened and use concrete examples of things he has said or done. For example, you could say “We have hung out for the past 5 weeks, and he usually hangs out with me about every 10 days. We have never hung out on a weekend, and I have not met his friends. He seems to hang out with them all of the time but never says exactly what they are doing and doesn’t invite me. When we do go out, he doesn’t hold my hand or seem affectionate until the end of the night.”

, There may be guys who are not interested in you the same way you are interested in them, and that is okay- it happens to everyone. Unrequited love is hard to deal with, but that isn’t playing with your feelings, necessarily, even if your feelings get hurt. The difference between someone who just isn’t interested in you and someone who is playing you is whether he is transparent about his feelings and intentions. If you feel like he has been honest about who he is, about his motivations, and the about other people he is seeing, then you should treat him well, but distance yourself from him if you feel more for him than he feels for you.


On the other hand, a guy who is playing you is secretive, purposefully vague and tries to keep your attention by playing games. These guys don’t want you to be a real part of their lives, but might hint at having you become a bigger part of his life in the future to string you along. However, he has never comes through and invites you to meet his friends or family.
If it seems like he is seeing other people and he has never told you that but seems to hint (or say) that you are the only girl he sees, he is probably playing you.
You might notice that he is on dating websites or that he gets really ambiguous when talking about the things he does or the people he sees. , Get out your calendar and look at how long it has been since you started to see each other. If it has been longer than a month and you still haven’t met his friends, and he seems either really relaxed or aloof about your relationship, he may not be in the relationship for the same reasons you are. For example, he isn’t asking to see you more, talking about doing things with you in the future, or telling you about his feelings for you. Or he may tell you he likes you, but this doesn’t seem to follow with many of the other signs that he is playing with you.

, If this is just about sex or ego for him, he may only want to see you late at night or when it is convenient for him. He might cancel on you often, push off dates, or seem unsure when he is free next. Try to keep track of how many times he has pushed a date off with you or has said he's busy. Most likely you already know there is a pattern, but it is a good idea to see it on paper so that the facts of the situation sink in more.

, If you have been consistently worrying about what is going on, fretting about whether he likes you or not, and feeling going back and forth between really liking him and really not trusting him, there might be something wrong in your relationship with this guy. If after hanging out you consistently feel unstable, insecure, or confused about his feelings, you may be interested in someone who doesn’t feel the same way about you that you feel about him. People who are infatuated may also feel a lot of up and down emotions, but if you feel like you are going through all of your emotions alone, you probably haven’t found someone who wants to be with you.
If you have had trust issues in the past, are the kind of person who is suspicious in most relationships that you are in, or have problems with persistent insecurity, talk to your friends and ask them what they think. Your friends know you the best and will be able to help you find out if the problem is with you or with him.

, Your intuition about these things is usually going to be right if you have gone through the same patterns and feelings several times in your interactions with this guy. Sometimes your mind can rationalize his behaviors to make them make sense because you want to believe that everything is good between you. If you ask yourself “What is my gut telling me?” and your answer is something like “Not good”, you may need to get out of the relationship before you get more involved.

, Consider who has been the person to initiate getting together. If that person is usually you and you are also the first person to text or call, you may be with someone who isn’t interested in the same thing that you want. Look back over your texting conversations and see who texts more frequently, whose texts are longer, and who starts/ends the conversation to see who seems to be more interested in talking.


If you are reaching out more in the relationship but he seems to be is really into you in almost every other way, you may be with someone who simply isn’t good about phone communication. However, that is less of a possibility now that most people are very connected to and good with keeping in contact with their phones.
He may say that he isn’t good with his phone but you notice the opposite when he is with you.

, If you are getting to a point where you notice that he lies to you about seeing other girls, isn’t straight with you about his true feelings for you, or keeps making excuses for why he is busy, don’t continue to act like you believe him. You should stop the game, and have a talk with him. Make a plan to talk to him, and think about what you want to say before the situation arises. For example, if you think he will probably end up canceling a date with you at the last moment, think about your response in advance. Then when he calls and makes the excuse that “Something came up” respond to him by simply saying “Okay, we need to talk soon.”


Sometimes guys who are players are attracted to girls who don’t put up with their games. Be prepared for this, and if he seems more interested in you than before, don’t give into his manipulation. You don’t want to be with someone who likes you just because you call him out on his lies.
Your response shouldn’t turn into a guilt trip or a fight. Don’t try to make him feel guilty because you won’t be able to change him by calling him out or fighting. Remember that the only person you can control is yourself.
If you are pretty sure that you will crumble if you argue with him, think about how you can distance yourself from him indirectly and quietly. The most important thing is to get out of the situation as soon as possible

, It is tempting to call out the guy you like when you feel like your emotions are being played with. But if you are dealing with a guy who has been lying to you about his intentions already, you shouldn’t ask him about his intentions because he will most likely lie to you about how he feels again when put on the spot. Instead, you should tell him where you are with the relationship and why you want to leave.


For example, you could say something like, “I’ve noticed that I am more into this relationship than you are, and I want to stop seeing each other because I realize I need more.” Depending on how close you were, you can tell him you want out of the relationship over the phone, in a text, in an email message, or in person.
If you are talking to him in person, find a time and place to talk to him in the middle of the day and when you are both alert and clear headed. Ask him if he has time for a conversation and find a table or chairs in a shared space to talk. Don’t try to talk to him about the relationship after a fight or at the end of the night.
An email message can be a good option if you want to clearly explain how you feel, or you don’t think that your relationship was serious enough for an in person break up.

, If he asks you why you want to stop seeing him, tell him that you don’t feel like he has been honest with you, and you feel like you have different feelings than he does about the relationship. Tell him what you feel, and be specific about what he has done that makes you feel the way you do using “I Statements”.Avoid saying things like, “You make me feel insecure.” because that is accusing. Instead, be more specific and using your “I statement” you can say something like, “When you didn’t text me back for a couple of days after we hooked up, I felt insecure because it seemed like you only wanted to hang out with me to hook up with me.”
Be careful not to try to read his mind. Don’t accuse him of being with other girls if you don’t know that for sure, and don’t accuse him of purposefully neglecting you because you can’t read his mind. Additionally, these kinds of accusations will start fights, and it will be harder for you to make a clean break.
Try to be matter of fact in your tone of voice and mature in what you say.

, Don’t let your conversation devolve into arguing or reminiscing about the good times because this kind of conversation could make you susceptible to falling back into being with him. Once you have said your piece and he has responded to you, you should leave the conversation. If you think that he is a good person in certain ways, or you like the way he was there for you at any point, you can say that, and end the conversation on a positive note. You can say something like “I enjoyed our time together, but I have to go.” Or if you feel hurt by him, you can say, “I feel hurt by the way things turned out in our relationship, and I need to move on.”


If you do fall back into hooking up with him again after you have broken up, don’t give up or let that stop you from trying again. It takes a lot of work and courage to end relationships with a guy you have feelings for. Pick yourself up and try again.

Watch how she flirts.,
Note how long she flirts.,
Note where and when she flirts.,
Look into her eyes.,
Observe her posture.,
Read her expression.",How to Tell if a Girl Is Messing with You1," How a girl flirts can give you an idea of whether she is really interested. Watch and take note. How intense is her flirting? Does it seem light-hearted and friendly? This may mean she’s not seriously interested. It could be something more if her attention feels like more than just play, though.Pay close attention the next time your lady is bantering with you. Note her eyes, her face, her voice, her body language, and her general attitude. All of these are clues to solving your mystery.;
, What is your mystery lady’s attention span when you are flirting? This should give you hints, as well. Someone who is really interested – who has eyes for only you – should give you the time of day. Does she check texts and emails while you banter? This could mean the interaction doesn’t mean much to her. Or does she focus entirely on you? A girl’s attention span will be more sustained if she’s interested in you.Keep track of your encounters. Does she stop by your desk once in a while to tease you and quickly moves on? That might not be a good sign. Does she join you in the lunch room several days a week? Do you always seem to run into her in hall ways or at the water cooler? That is more encouraging.

, Some women and men are serial flirts. They flirt with those they’re interested in and with those they’re not interested in. They flirt with everyone. Why? They may like the challenge or the power it gives them. They may have low self-esteem. Or they may just like to flirt, period.Pay special attention to your mystery lady’s general flirting habits. Does she share her favors widely? Does she flirt with other men, or maybe girls? This behavior may indicate that she is a serial flirt.
On the other hand, does she seem to concentrate on you and you alone? If the flirting is mostly exclusive, you can pretty safely assume that there is a reason for it.

, Body language will tell you a lot about what a person is thinking or feeling. Whether it is our eyes, our face, our posture, or other behavior, the way we carry ourselves can unconsciously signal interest or disinterest. Use it to your advantage for your mystery girl, starting with her eyes


Pay close attention to where she is looking. Does she hold eye contact with you? Usually when talking, we hold and break eye contact frequently. If she gazes deeply into your eyes in your presence, it might mean she is attracted.Note how much she blinks, as well. Does she do it a lot when she’s with you? The average person blinks about 20 times per minute. However, our blink rate increases when we’re emotionally excited. If your girl is blinking like mad, it’s a good reason to think that she is interested in you., How is she sitting or standing? Physical posture can be another way to tell if a person is interested in you or just being friendly. This include the direction she faces, whether she leans in or back when talking to you, or whether she points her toes in your direction. Try to notice all of these subtle signs.Does she mirror your body language and gestures? Surprisingly, this unconscious behavior is a sign that she’s noticing you – both what you do and how you do it.
Does she lean in or angle toward you during conversations? What about her toes? Does she usually point them toward you? These, again, are more unconscious ways that our body can signal we like a person., The human face can express an incredible range of emotions, some consciously and some unconsciously. How a person feels, then, including possible interest in you, is often written on their face. Study your mystery lady’s face for signs that she’s into you.


Look also at her eyebrows. One common way the body signals attraction is the raised brow. When someone likes us, their eyebrows rise and fall. This lasts less than a second but is there. Look for it.What about her pupils? Pupils become dilated – that is, slightly larger – as a brain response to physical attraction. If she gets large, doe eyes in your presence, it is a signal that she likes you.See how she smiles. People tend to smile from above the mouth when they are truly happy, in order words, the smile engages the whole face above the mouth. A smile with an open mouth, lifted forehead, and squinted eyes is a good sign that the smile is genuine."

Attend to detail.,
Take note of questions.,
Study how you fit into her other relationships.,
Stop and think.",How to Tell if a Girl Is Messing with You2," A girl’s words should say just as much about her potential interest in you as her behavior. She might flirt, but does she pay attention to you, to what you say, and to who you are as a person? Listening is a key indicator that she is interested. Pay attention to an any details that she drops.For example, does your mystery lady remember things that you say? Does she recall that you really hate banana peppers on pizza but really like anchovies? Does she quote Star Trek at you, because she knows that it’s your favorite movie? What about other likes and dislikes?
Does she remember your birthday? Does she ask how you are if you’ve said that you had a bad day or are feeling unwell?
What about small details? For example, a girl who remembers that you wore a red sweater to last year’s Christmas party – when you have long forgotten – either has a great eye for detail or pays special attention to you.

, While a casual flirt might ask you how you are, how your work is going, or other stock questions, an interested lady will want to know more about you personally. Does she ask questions about you, questions that show a deeper interest? This is a good sign.Questions about your family, friends, pets, hobbies, and other personal details may show that she wants to know more about your personal side.
Does she ever ask you embarrassing things, i.e. the name of your goldfish, the name of your favorite stuffed animal as a child, or other cute but somewhat mortifying questions? This could be a good sign.

, It is a very good sign that a girl is interested in you if she talks about you with her friends or family, or at least hints that she does. This means that she thinks of you are part of her life and wants others to be aware of you. It means that you rank high enough to be included in her other important relationships.


Listen carefully for hints. She will probably not say openly, “I talk about you all the time with my friends.” You’ll have to read between the lines.
Does she lead on that she shares stories about you or things that you’ve done together, perhaps to her sister or mother?
Have you met her other friends? If so, did they know who you were? You can bet that your mystery lady talks about you privately if her best friend said, when you met, “Oh hi! I’ve heard so much about you!”
The fact that she talks about you is not proof positive that she’s interested, however. It may mean that she likes you, but it also may mean that she sees you as a good friend. In that case, your problem may be the tricky “friend zone.”

, After reviewing her behavior and her actions, try to figures out her motives. Add up all of the indicators. What do you think? If the girl is only responsive at certain times – before a big math exam, for example – she may just be using you. However, if she displays all the physical signs, pays attention to you, and seems to care about your interests and feelings, then she is probably interested. The next step is to signal that you are, too.

"

Flirt back.,
Show interest in her.,
Ask her out.,
Respect the outcome.",How to Tell if a Girl Is Messing with You3," Believe it or not, flirting is scientifically effective. In fact, studies show that the most successful people are not necessarily the most physically attractive, but those who shows their availability through confidence and basic flirting techniques like smiling and eye contact.For men, the most successful flirting techniques are quick glances as well as “space maximization” postures – i.e. sitting with an arm extended across the back of a nearby chair. These moves show interest, but also social confidence.

, If you genuinely like the girl, let her know it through your behavior. Don’t just flirt. Notice her. Notice what she wears. Notice what she says, what she likes and dislikes, and what interests her. In short, listen to her.You might be surprised how much these small things matter. If she likes you, remembering that your mystery girl loves to watch Gilmour Girls or has a side interest in astrophysics can go along way.
Ask her questions. Without being intrusive, show interest in her by asking about her likes and dislikes, her interests, or just how she is doing.
Give her a compliment on what she’s wearing. Try something simple like, “Wow, is that a new skirt? You look very pretty in it.” This signals two things: you noticed her appearance and approve of it.

, At a certain point you will need to press the issue to clarify whether or not she is really into you. Ask her out! Yes, this will be stressful, but the worst she can do is turn you down. Then, you will know that she was indeed messing with you.The response that your invitation gets should give you an answer. A yes is obvious: she likes you!
If your mystery girl starts acting weird or stops talking to you, most likely someone else is on her mind and she feels uncomfortable. If she continues your current relationship without any change, on the other hand, it could be that she is simply messing with you.
Give her some space to sort things out if she appears hesitant. An evasive reply may mean that she is uncertain – she may be starting to have feelings for you but is not sure. All you can do is give her some time and space.

, Gracefully accept whatever response you get. It will do no good to continue to pursue her after a clear rejection. She was probably just flirting and didn’t consider you dating material.


In case of a rejection, avoid being obnoxious and move on. Resist the temptation to stick it out. She wasn’t interested and time will probably not change that.
Try to find a girl who is really interested in you. Keep all of the advice here in mind and continuing looking for that special mystery lady.

Reject myths about body language.,
Know the few patterns that exist.,
Accept your own strengths and weaknesses.,
Learn cultural differences.",How to Tell if Your Guy or Girl Is Lying to You1," There is no one universal sign for lying, otherwise no one would be able to lie successfully! Someone’s body language is the result of their current situation, energy level, personality, confidence, and intimacy with you.There are many behaviors that are commonly associated with lying, which then people avoid doing while they are lying to avoid getting caught. For example, it is often believed that looking down is a sign of lying, and so many liars avoid looking down when lying.
Some people develop particular ticks, habits, or responses for certain emotions or situations they’re in. If you know these, you might be able to catch a lie. For example, if you know your son usually smiles when he lies, you can use that body language as an indicator.
If you know someone’s ticks and habits, it is likely that the person knows them too. Most people compensate to avoid body language that might be a cue that someone is lying. For example, if you and your son both know that he usually smiles when lying, your son might avoid smiling during a lie to mislead you.;
, Though there are no universal signs of lies, there are general trends of body language that indicate lying. People who are lying are generally more tense: their pupils dilate, and they are more likely to fidget with their bodies. People who are lying also generally try to look like they’re indifferent.


However, someone may have be fidgeting or look indifferent, and not be lying
The patterns of body language vary wildly from person to person
Pupil dilation can happen for a number of reasons other than lying

, Body language is a “nonverbal channel,” or a way through which you can receive messages from other people that does not involve words or speaking. There are three main channels: kinesics (facial expressions, eye contact, and body language), haptics (touch), and proxemics (personal space).


Generally speaking, you are going to be the most skilled at understanding kinesics, and then proxemics, and then touch.People are usually better at understanding pleasant kinesics rather than than unpleasant. So, that means you will be better at spotting happiness and excitement, in contrast to fear, disgust, or lyingIf you do not understand what proxemics means exactly, do this test. The next time you are in a line for something with strangers, stand in line as you usually would. Now take a whole step closer to the person in front of you. Does the shorter distance feel more uncomfortable? Does the other person adjust according to your own movement? The nonverbal communication about personal space is proxemics.

, Nonverbal messages differ by culture. For example, in Finnish culture, when someone makes eye contact, she is sending a signal of friendliness.Alternatively, in Japanese culture, when someone makes eye contact, the are interpreted to be expressing anger.Remember the cultural context of you, your guy or girl, and the situation you’re in.

Do some personal reflection first.,
Consider why you're craving space.,
Be frank about wanting to talk.,
Use your language carefully.,
Listen to your boyfriend's needs as well.,
Reinforce the positive.,
Compromise on alone time.,
Address any underlying issues.,
Evaluate your motivations.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Want to Be Left Alone," In order to best prepare to talk to your boyfriend about space, you need to do some personal reflection. You need to have clear boundaries you want to set so you can best express your needs and wants to your boyfriend.


Ideally, how much time do you want to spend with your boyfriend? Ideas of what's normal or healthy vary. If your boyfriend thinks spending 5 or 6 nights a week together is important, and you'd rather cut it back to 3 or 4, this is something you two should talk about openly.What kinds of activities do you enjoy doing as a couple? What would you rather do alone? There's no right or wrong answers, but you and your boyfriend might have different ideas of what should be alone time and what should be shared space. You might, for example, find the idea of working out with another person intrusive while your boyfriend might thinking going for long runs is a fun, romantic activity.;
, Asking for space in a relationship can trigger feelings of insecurity in your boyfriend. Try to figure out why you're craving alone time before going into the conversation. The more transparent you can be about your intentions, the better your boyfriend will understand the more successful your conversation will be overall.


Why is the amount of alone time you want important? Oftentimes, when one person in the relationship wants space the other takes it personally. If it doesn't have anything to do with how you feel about your boyfriend, make this clear in the conversation. Maybe you want to spend more time with friends or family members one-one-one. Maybe you want more time to devote to a hobby or activity it's hard to do in the presence of another person. Maybe you simply want some time to yourself to relax and recharge. Whatever the reason, you should know it before you go into the conversation.
If you find there are more serious reasons at hand for wanting alone time, this might be a sign your problems run deeper than different ideas of what constitutes healthy space. If, for example, you find you want to be alone because you're not that attracted to your boyfriend, you're not that interested in him anymore, or there's something he's doing that's hurtful or upsetting to you. If this is the case, you might want to evaluate whether you want to stay in this particular relationship or at least talk to your boyfriend about some of the deeper issues at hand., You need to pick a time to have this discussion. Trying to drop a big relationship talk on someone out of nowhere comes off as an attack. Set aside a specific time to talk with your boyfriend.


Choose a time where there are no external constraints that could prematurely end the conversation. Do not, for example, aim to talk before your boyfriend has to be at work. Instead, have the conversation after work or dinner one night.
Aim for a time when you'll both be relaxed. Having a big talk when there's already something stressful going on is a recipe for disaster. Pick a weeknight where you both have little to do and don't have anything stressful in the morning. It might be best to wait until after dinner or a meal, as you don't want to talk on an empty stomach.

, When you begin having the conversation, phrasing is very important. It's easy to accidentally come off like you're blaming or judging the other person. Proper phrasing can help the conversation go smoother.


Avoid statements that start with ""you"" as this comes off as you forcing external judgment on the situation. Instead, phrase everything in terms of ""I"" and tie it back in to how your feelings affect your ability to function in the relationship.For example, instead of saying ""You don't let me spend weekends just with my friends,"" say something like, ""I like to sometimes just go out with friends Friday nights, and if I was able to do that more often I'd be happier when I came home to you.""Avoid harsh language in general. Words like ""clingy"" or ""needy"" can come off as judgmental. If you feel your boyfriend wants too much of your time, instead say something like, ""I feel like it's hard to meet all your needs all the time, and I don't have energy for myself when we spend all our time together.""Be transparent. Talk about what you discovered while reflecting on the relationship and yourself during your talk. Saying you need space can potentially make your boyfriend feel very insecure, so focus on how the issue is about you and your needs and has nothing to do with how you feel about him., A relationship is a two way street. If your boyfriend has different ideas of what constitutes healthy space than you, the two of you need to address this together. You should listen to how he responds to what you're saying.


Your boyfriend's needs and desires are as valuable as your own, so treat them as such. Remember this as you have the conversation. This is not an issue of one party being right and the other being wrong. It's an issue of differing personal boundaries.If you don't understand, ask for clarification. Something like, ""Why do you feel that way?"" can really help you better understand your partner's needs., At the end of the talk, reinforce your enthusiasm for the relationship so things do not end on a bad note. Say something like, ""Even though I need alone time on occasion, I really do love spending time with you and want to be with you."" It's a good idea to, throughout the talk, throw in positive statements and sentiments. Like, if you discuss spending more nights at your own place, follow up with something like, ""Even though I really do love waking up next to you in the morning."" This can help the conversation sting less for your boyfriend., Once you've had the talk, you need to set new boundaries. Even if your boyfriend is okay with much of what you're saying, you'll still need to compromise on some issues.


You need to make sure your boyfriend's needs are still being met, even if you're spending more time alone or without him. If you've gone from, say, six nights at his apartment to four he might be feeling a little lonely.There are ways to compromise on space without you feeling smothered. If you two end up spending less physical time together, you can try to make that time more valuable. Spend less time on your phone texting or e-mailing in his presence. Be more physically affectionate when you're together. Text or call more often on the nights you're not coming over. All these things can help your boyfriend feel secure even while you two spend less physical time together., Oftentimes, wanting less space in a relationship could be a sign of underlying problems. Talk to your boyfriend openly about any issues on his end.


Not wanting any space is often fueled by insecurity. Was your boyfriend cheated on in the past? Was one of his parents not present in his early childhood? Did he move a lot and, as a result, lose friends throughout his life? These, and other issues, can make someone insecure about losing others. Asking your boyfriend more about his own history can help you better understand his fears.Some people are simply codependent on others. Codependent people tend to put others' needs first, don't really know themselves well, have low self esteem, and have never really learned healthy relationship boundaries. If your boyfriend has had similar issues in the past, you can try to talk to him about dealing with his codependent tendencies to be a healthier, happier person., Once again, you should evaluate your own motivations for wanting space. If you're not interested in the relationship, or if your boyfriend does things that make you uncomfortable or unhappy, you should seriously consider whether you want to stay in this relationship at all.

See a counselor to help you overcome trust or commitment issues.",How to Stop Being Afraid of Romantic Relationships," Even if the emotions you experience seem scary or odd, go where they lead you. We grow from taking chances. Yes, sometimes, the chances we take do not always work out. But, remember that you are braver for having taken the chance. Don’t push away the good feelings you get because of fear. Invite them in. Tons of poems and songs have been written about this beautiful feeling.You may find yourself consumed by new love and this is natural. Have fun with that new “crush” and enjoy the natural high. Do not dismiss the fun part of falling in love, but also be aware that these feelings usually die down a bit.;
, Also, know that that’s not always a bad thing. Love tends to start out all sunshine and unicorns but at some point in order for it to last it needs to change. Long-lasting and abiding love means getting to know another person, flaws and all. It’s completely normal for a relationship to be in the honeymoon phase for many months or even years before you two experience any difficulties.


Getting to know another person and accepting them 100% are two very different things. The initial attraction may fizzle as you figure out your partner does that one thing you can’t stand. It’s OK to know your deal breakers, but it’s also OK to watch a new relationship grow stronger as you find yourself more attracted to the person you are getting to know.

, At first it may be scary so take it at face value. Give yourself time apart to not be vulnerable if you need to. Not every minute together has to be some deep exercise in being vulnerable. You can just enjoy each other but make special efforts to give a potential partner access to parts of your life and past you don’t normally share. Use your judgment for how much is appropriate to share depending on how long or how deep your connection is.
It can be fun to ask a potential spouse to try a new hobby or attend an event that is special to you so he or she can see a different side of you.

, At some point it’s time to stop trying to impress your partner and just be loved for who you are deep down. Part of being afraid of love is not feeling like you are worthy of love unless you are an ideal version of yourself. If the relationship is going to last, your mate has to see the real you.


When you’re true to yourself, it’s much easier for you to behave in ways that allow you to build intimacy with your partner, research shows.Hiding behind a mask makes it harder to forge a deeper connection.
While you should always stay open to change and growth, this means embracing your natural quirks and flaws. Show your partner that side of you that you think is hideous or weird. If he or she is a good match, you will likely be loved all the more for being your true self.

, Then, take a look at all the things you are doing that prevent you from having the relationship you desire. In order to overcome your fear of romantic relationships, you must recognize and stop your self-sabotaging behaviors.One big mistake many people make is looking for love in the wrong places. You may want to date someone who is hard working and stable in their career but you find yourself meeting potential mates at the club on a Thursday night. You are using old habits to get different results, and this just doesn’t work.
Another mistake often made is settling for less than you desire because you feel any partner is better than nothing. Staying in an unhappy situation may actually keep you away from finding one that makes you happy. Understanding the difference between being alone and lonely is huge.

, You may have been hurt in the past or maybe you think you are too old, overweight, or other negative characteristic to find love. Part of finding love is being ready for it and believing you deserve to be loved. Sometimes, the easiest time to find love is when you are happy without it because you are happy with you. If you want to attract a happy relationship focus on making yourself happy first, you would be surprised how attractive a real smile is.
Look around you and recognize the small chances you have each day to flirt and be flirted with. That’s not saying every time someone smiles at you it is love, but practicing accepting a flirt not only builds your confidence but it trains you to look past your own self-doubt to realize you are attracting attention.

, Both positive and negative emotions are essential to personal growth and development. If you work hard to protect yourself from getting hurt, you also run the risk of never feeling happiness.It may seem safer to not even bother taking a chance on love so you never get hurt, but this also closes you off from finding a positive relationship. Yes, it will feel vulnerable to be open to love, but that’s part of the game. Giving your heart to someone means risking hurt feelings for the chance of a lifetime of happiness.

, Perhaps you ruin every relationship you get involved in because you prefer your life to stay simple like it is. Getting involved with someone means making sacrifices and sharing your time and energy. But staying single could be keeping you from finding a person that makes your life all the more meaningful and vice versa., What happened in those partnerships that may have made you uneasy about getting involved again? Looking at your past does not mean you assume all relationships are the same. They are not. But the one common denominator is you. You need to take a look at the behaviors that are not serving you or your personal growth., Fears can be tied to just about anything, and figuring out where yours lie will help to tell you what work needs to be done.If you have been cheated on in the past, you may be fearful of never being enough to keep a lover to yourself. Understanding this fear will help you see that you are enough and you do not deserve that level of disrespect.
Abuse, either physical or emotional, may have been a part of your past relationships. This can be very scary and make the relationship not based on love but danger and fear for one’s safety. Get professional help
You may even be fearful things are going to go too well and you will have to answer tough questions about things like having a family and a future that is not all about you. This can be very scary if you have settled into your single life.

, Some young people worry about getting involved in a committed relationship because it can be the ultimate sign of growing up. You want things to stay the same, not to change. You think avoiding a relationship allows you to maintain the innocence and carefree attitude of youth.


This is a common and warranted fear, but you must aim to move past it. Yes, your relationships with friends and family members may change. This will happen whether you are in a romantic relationship

, Some people think they are incapable of loving others, so they refrain from entering one-sided relationships. For the most part, love is frequently unequal.Love also changes and evolves. You may see times where you feel like you love your partner way more than he or she does you, but then suddenly the situation flips as you question things. It is natural for relationships to change and grow.

, A counselor may be able to help you in ways you cannot help yourself. He or she will also be experienced in helping to find old habits that need to be broken in order to improve your romantic relationships."

Pay attention to if his future involves you.,
Watch if he makes plans without discussing them with you first.,
Think about if he assumes you will accompany him to places.,
Ask yourself if he has secrets from you.,
Notice if you hang out with his friends.,
Determine if his family knows about you.,
Pay attention to if he takes you to his favorite places.",How to Tell if a Man Is Full of It1," Men who are serious about a relationship talk about the future and your role in it. Men who aren’t avoid the subject like the plague. He’s likely not planning on spending too much time with you if he doesn’t include you in the time ahead.


For instance, if he refuses to talk about if he wants children or believes in marriage, he’s probably not in it for the long haul. He’s probably only planning to stick around for the time being, despite what he may tell you.;
, He may tell you he wants a serious relationship, but his actions could prove otherwise. People who consider themselves to be a couple generally check in with the other person before making plans. Or, at least, they let the other person know. Your man may not be as serious as he claims if he doesn’t consider your plans when he’s making his.


A red flag your significant other is full of it is if he goes away for the weekend and doesn’t tell you about it. Or, if he makes significant plans that could potentially affect you and doesn’t inform you of them. You’re not a factor in his mind if he doesn’t consider you when making these plans., Are you his “go-to” when it comes to bringing a date somewhere? If not, there’s a chance he’s not into the relationship as much as you may want. There shouldn’t be any question, particularly in a date situation, that you are his tag along. He’s probably full of it if there is.


You may want to reconsider your relationship if he is taking other romantic interests to functions, especially if you think you are exclusive., People who have nothing to hide are pretty transparent. Those who constantly seem secretive, however, are probably full of it. He shouldn’t have to hide anything, unless he is lying about how he feels towards you.


For instance, if he doesn’t want to tell you where he’s been or what he’s doing when you’re not together, doesn’t want to talk about his friends or social circle, or you find out things he’s done after the fact, he may not be the person you hoped he was., A man who isn’t afraid to bring his romantic interests in front of his friends is someone who is serious about them. On the flip side, if you never hang out or aren’t even introduced to them, you may not be someone the guy wants to be seen with in front of them.


Not meeting his friends could be a sign that he is seeing other people, isn’t serious about you, or is embarrassed of you. You may want to reconsider your relationship if this is the case.This is only true if you have agreed on an exclusive relationship and have been seeing each other for a decent span of time. Your partner may not be interested in introducing you to friends and family if he hasn't known you long enough.

, You may have introduced him to everyone you know, including your family members. He, on the other hand, may have only introduced you to his pet fish. He may not be as serious as you or may not think you are important enough to introduce to his family if he hasn’t already.


Ask him if you are going to meet his family. If he agrees, then he may be the right person for you. If not and if he avoids the subject entirely, it may be time to move on if you are looking for something more serious.Again, keep in mind that meeting the parents (and other family) early on in a relationship is rare. If you and your beau have just started dating, give it a few months before pressuring him to meet the family.

, Everyone has a favorite restaurant, bar, or hangout. In fact, that may be where you first met. He may not want to be seen with you in public or take you to a place he commonly frequents if he doesn’t take you there.


Ask him why he doesn’t want to share his favorite places with you. You could say, “I know you love going to that bar down the street. Why don’t we go there sometime soon?” There’s likely a good chance he’s not looking for a commitment with you if he consistently declines."

Arrange a meeting in person.,
Organize the evidence.,
Calm yourself down.,
Tell him that you know about the lies.,
Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings about the lying.,
Keep the conversation on-topic.,
Give him a chance to explain himself.,
Decide where to go from here.,
Congratulate yourself for sticking up for the truth.",How to Tell a Guy You Know He's Lying to You1," Meeting your partner in person will allow you to analyze important information such as body language and eye contact. This can help you determine whether or not your partner is still lying to you.


Even though lie detection is a hotly debated topic, signs of lying include pursed lips, fidgeting, a lack of cooperation, uncharacteristic terseness or silence, and the avoidance of first-person words such as ""I"" or ""my."" Consider meeting in a neutral location, such as a cafe or restaurant. This will help keep the confrontation from escalating and will also allow the two of you to discuss his lies as equals. If you want to preserve the relationship, try to think of your meeting as a discussion instead of a fight.;
, Whether the evidence that your man has lied is a stray text, an errant email, a letter, hearsay from a friend, or simply your instincts, be sure that you review the evidence carefully before your meeting. You want to be able to discuss the evidence with your partner calmly and rationally. Consider making back-up copies of your evidence, just in case.

, Go into your confrontation from a position of strength and tranquility. Meditate, breathe deeply, take a peaceful walk, or undertake relaxing visualization exercises.Do whatever it takes to ensure that your mind and body are prepared to keep a stressful situation from becoming too overwhelming.

, In order for a conflict to be resolved, you must first define the specific terms of the conflict: in this case, that you are concerned about his lying behaviors.It is best if the accusation is made swiftly and directly to give you both time to resolve the issue. There is no need to beat around the bush. Simply tell him that you know he hasn't been truthful, and that this worries you. Keep your voice level and calm, and maintain eye contact. Rather than calling him a ""liar,"" consider using specific examples of lying behaviors that you find unacceptable. For example, try using phrases such as:


""I have noticed recently that you tell me you are working late, even though you are not answering your work phone. This makes me think that I am being lied to.""
""When you told me that you liked my new haircut, I had the feeling that you weren't being entirely honest.""
""Lately I have been worried about whether you are being honest with me. For example, I have seen you check your texts when you think I am not looking. Is there something you would like to tell me?""

, Even though it might be tempting to blame, insult, or yell at the liar, inflammatory accusations might make it more difficult for you to repair the relationship. Instead, try speaking honestly about how his lies have made you feel.Some scripts you might use include:


""I find it difficult to trust someone who has lied to me.""
""I value truthfulness in a relationship, and I find lies to be damaging.""
""Even if a lie is meant to protect my feelings, I find that my feelings are hurt more by lies than by the truth, whatever the truth may be.""

, Common responses to being accused of lying include changing the subject of conversation, blaming the accuser, stalling, or inappropriately complimenting the accuser.Stick to your message: that you know he lied, that you feel hurt, and that you need the lying to stop in order to remain in the relationship. You have a right to express your feelings, and your partner should hear them. Don't let yourself get distracted or defensive.

, Remember that sometimes people have a good reason to lie. Or perhaps he didn't lie at all and there is a reasonable alternative explanation for the evidence you gathered. It is also possible that he feels sorry for the lies he told and that he genuinely wants to change his behavior going forward. For example, people often lie when they are under time pressure or stress, but they might tell the truth after they have been given some time and space to think.Even if he is a liar, he deserves to have his say. And if you want to repair the relationship, it is important that he be allowed to speak his piece.Remember that people can be easily hoodwinked, especially by a lover. This is known as ""truth bias,"" which can make us believe irrational things about those we care about.Your partner might have had a good reason to lie, but don't let yourself get caught up in unbelievable excuses or outlandish stories. If he says that a stranger who looks just like him happened to steal his phone and use it to send nude photos to your best friend, do not be fooled: he is probably still lying to you.

, Follow your instincts and observe his behavior carefully. Ask yourself if you truly believe that the lying will stop. Depending on how the conversation goes and what your instincts are telling you, you might do one of several things:


Forgive him and move on. If the lie seems to be fairly minor or a one-time mistake, and if your partner is serious about telling you the truth in the future, you might simply leave the past in the past. Be observant moving forward, but remember that everybody makes mistakes sometimes.
Seek counseling. If the lie was a major one and if you have invested a lot in this relationship, you might consider working with a therapist or counselor on how to rebuild trust. This is most likely too much time, effort, and money to be worthwhile for short-term relationships, however.
End the relationship. If you think that your feelings are still in danger or that your partner will continue betraying your trust, it might be best to cut off contact. Even if your original intent was salvaging the relationship, your safety and happiness come first.

, It is not easy to confront a liar, but it is necessary. Treat yourself to a day at the spa or to an evening out with close, trusted friends. You deserve some relaxation and fun.

Listen for less.,
Pick up on the details.,
Notice her/his voice.",How to Tell if Your Guy or Girl Is Lying to You2," When people lie, they are likely to use short responses to questions and elaborate less about their story. They might also pause and take longer to respond. When they do respond to statements and questions from others, people will give fewer rich details.


Try prompting the other person to tell a story that should be long. For example, ask what that person’s plans are for the holidays. Avoid asking questions whose answers could be “yes” or “no.”

, If you listen carefully to the way the person tells his or her story, you can sometimes tell if it’s a lie. Liars use more sense-based words, like “I saw,” “it smelled like,” or “I heard.” They also will probably use other-oriented pronouns and phrases, like “she forgot this” or “something happened to the car” instead of “I forgot this.”


Liars are less likely than truth-tellers to correct themselves while telling a story.
Look out for more far-fetched stories, that seem outside of the realm of possibility.
People who are lying generally use fewer gestures.

, Is the person speaking in a higher tone than normal? Is the person speaking faster than normal? Quieter or louder? The discomfort of lying usually makes people’s voices sound higher, but some individuals may compensate or go another route. If your significant other is speaking in unusual tones, it might be a sign.

Notice when they’re there.,
Check your finances.,
Observe what they do.,
Examine your own relationship.",How to Tell if Your Guy or Girl Is Lying to You3," There may be long periods of time where you don’t know where your partner is. Unexplained chunks of time may be a sign of lying, or your partner is lying about where they are.


Talk to your partner about what they do when you’re not there. Be respectful of the other person’s space, as well as the relationship you have.
You can double-check stories by asking friends, family, or coworkers.j

, Dishonesty in relationships can stem from financial disagreements or troubles, and it is important that you check your bank account, extra cash, and wallet. This step is more pertinent for married couples, but applies to anyone with shared finances.


Look for any charges that are unfamiliar to you.
Don’t root through someone else’s personal financial history without their permission. You can look through your own.

, When your guy or girl is around, they might act differently than they used to. This could be anything from checking their phone more often to kissing you before bedtime. Behavior changes can signify almost anything, including lying. Investigate the cause of a behavior change in case it is that your guy or girl is lying.


One common change is the response to questioning: often, people who are lying do not like being questioned. “Why don’t you trust me?” or “Who wants to know?”
The behavior change might be most obvious in social media, texting, or at work. It might not be the most obvious to you.

, Has trusting your guy or girl been an ongoing problem? Have you caught your partner in a lie before? At some point, the problem is not whether your partner is lying to you: the problem is that you feel like your partner could be lying to you at all. If you suspect your partner is lying to you, look at the overall picture of your relationship with this person. Systemic or serial lying can be a sign that something in the relationship is not working.


If your partner is lying, you must decide if you want to move forward in the relationship and forgive.
For forgiveness to occur, the wrongdoer must accept responsibility, show remorse, and repair the relationship by changing their behavior.You must acknowledge their efforts and reinforce a positive perspective.

Think about why jealousy is an issue.,
Be prepared to address jealousy as a habit, along with related behaviors.,
Place yourself in the other persons position.,
Understand where you come from.,
Remove situations that you have created due to your feelings of jealousy.,
Realize that overcoming feelings of jealousy takes time.,
Assess whether or not you have improved in responding to these situations.,
Wait for the right moment.,
Point out what has currently been bothering you.,
Set up boundaries with your partner on what you consider cheating.,
Adopt an open minded and calm persona.",How to Stop Jealousy in a Relationship," A healthy relationship is when both parties are genuinely happy and elevated from the support they give to one another. Obviously, there are times when a person needs to feel their own identity through socialising with others, committing to hobbies or keeping personal information to themselves. Most importantly, it is important at these points, to respect the other party's boundaries.


It is important to understand that jealousy is merely a feeling in your mind that may or may not signify other problems not necessarily within a relationship. For example, if you don't have enough confidence in yourself or experiences in a past relationship. All of these can distort your ability to commit to a healthy relationship.

, Jealousy can also be, not always, a habit stemmed from either negative thinking or bad gossiping. Wherever it comes from, stopping these other habits may help you to overcome your sense of jealousy.


Even if this article does open with the importance of building a healthy relationship, we need to work backwards in order to remove the first layer of jealousy and then create an open relationship that uses active management skills as opposed to aggressive and passive.

, A childish tactic that is often forgotten. Remember to honestly build a picture. This method really helps you understand what jealousy is doing to you in the face of your partner.;
, If you have confidence issues, there are many articles on wikiHow that can definitely help you. But, in summary, firstly changing your mindset from 'I am hopeless' to something as simple as 'I can be creative, honest and motivating' can be the game changer to improving your overall character. (Tip: Never place another person into the picture, like 'I am better than this person' or 'At least I am not as spoilt as this person'. This won't help you remove the cycle of jealousy nor make you any more mature, as you cannot know every single detail of another persons life.)

, In particular, secretly checking their phones, following them through GPS tracking or feeling mad whenever they are tagged in a group photo with others. You should feel happy for your partner to have friends. Again, place yourself in the other persons shoes.

, When you feel yourself reaching a dangerous point of jealousy. Take a moment to re-evaluate the problem and ask yourself whether it is really worth getting upset over.

, Improvements may become a great confidence booster. If not, take note of this situation for future reference.

, Find time when both of you are free. Find a private space that is secure and comfortable for a face to face discussion. If you both are too busy or can't find such a place, talking over the phone or web chat is another option.

, This could be your own jealous feelings to a situation that falls outside the situation such as secretly checking your partners phone to find it locked. Explain to your partner how these situations are affecting you. However, realise that certain actions such as frequently making secret calls that seem suspicious should be brought up at a later date.

, Tell them what would bother you and tell them to put yourself in your shoes if the situation is reversed would you also be uncomfortable?

, Never blame or speak in a destructive manner such as 'YOU ARE ALWAYS DOING THIS'.

See if he really listens to you and engages in the conversation.,
See if he checks in with you each day.,
Watch if he welcomes your items into his home.,
Watch his behavior when he talks to you.,
Note how he responds when you’re sick.",How to Tell if a Man Is Full of It2," Do you feel like you always do the talking and he is just listening because he has to? Is he skimpy on how much he actually discusses with you? This could be a sign that he’s not really the person he portrays himself to be.


For example, he may only share the bare minimum of what he has to in order to maintain your relationship. He probably isn’t really interested in getting to know you if he doesn’t ask you questions or doesn’t look for your opinion., A guy who is genuinely interested in you wants to know how you’re doing and how your day has been. He wants to hear from you every day, or at least every other day. If he can go a few days or even a week without hearing from you, he may not truthful with how he feels about you., Couples who spend a lot of time at each other’s homes typically leave essential items there. Toothbrushes, hairbrushes, clothing, and other items are usually accepted if the person wants to make room for you in their life. If not, the relationship may be less serious than you want.


Leave something at his place and see how he responds. If he returns it to you the next time he sees you, ask if it’s OK to leave it there. If he says no, he may have other romantic interests in his home all of the time or he isn’t as committed as you are., You can tell a lot about a person by their body language and how they talk. Look at him closely the next time you are asking him a question about the relationship. You may find out a lot just by paying attention.


If he changes his story, looks uncomfortable or nervous, repeats the same question, or is only willing to listen to his side, there’s a chance he is full of it., The way he behaves when you’re feeling under the weather says a lot about how he feels about the relationship. While he may not do the same things you would if he were sick, what he does—or doesn’t—do, can tell you how much he cares.


For instance, if he brings you food or simply just comes over to cuddle with you, there’s a good chance he really cares for you. He may not be invested if he stays away.

Be conscious of timing.,
Identify your priorities.,
Communicate with your partner.,
Make a decision.",How to Tell if a Man Is Full of It3," If your relationship is relatively new, it's not all that uncommon for couples to have goals and future plans that diverge. Similarly, newer couples may still have completely different inner circles of family and friends. When you and your partner develop a deeper commitment to the relationship and each other, this changes.


If your boyfriend is tentative about plans and goals or hasn't introduced you to his loved one, it may not necessarily mean he's not into you. Decide if you have been together long enough (i.e.longer than a few months). It may also help to question if you have labeled your relationship as ""exclusive."", Every relationship requires a bit of reorganizing of the parts to make the whole work. Although your mate may show some of these signs, you might want to ask yourself if they are deal-breakers or whether you can learn to live with them. Ponder what you want out of the relationship and whether your current partner is giving it to you.Make a list of the most important aspects of a relationship from your point-of-view. Then, go down the list and evaluate where your partner stands on each characteristic.

, Relationships are not one-sided, so your decision-making shouldn't be either. Choose an appropriate time to sit down with your partner and share your reservations. He may be able to explain some of his choices or behaviors and put your mind at ease.You might say, ""I'm very concerned that, after three months, I haven't met any of your friends. Can you explain why?""

Listen actively to your partner, giving him the chance to fully share his side of things before responding.

, After you have discussed the issue with your partner, you will need to arrive at a conclusion. Is your partner full of it? Do you think he's serious about you? It's important to listen to your instincts on this one. They could be giving you clues about how to move forward.


You might decide to end the relationship now, or postpone the decision until a later date. For example, if you think maybe your relationship is still young, you might wait a few months to see if some of your concerns work themselves out.

Express your feelings of hurt and betrayal.,
Keep on message.,

Focus on the positives of breaking up with a liar.",How to Tell a Guy You Know He's Lying to You2," Some lies are forgivable; others you cannot simply get over. You are not obligated to ""forgive and forget"" everyone's lies and mistakes. Even if you decide to end a relationship with a liar, it can sometimes be beneficial to confront him to let him know your feelings. In this case, you are confronting him not to encourage him to improve his behavior but rather to empower yourself and regain your confidence after a betrayal. You need to be certain, however, that you truly want to end the relationship. Do not use the threat of a break-up as a way to try to control his behavior. , Sometimes a lie is just a lie. But sometimes lying behavior is linked to other, even more dangerous behaviors and conditions. Narcissists, abusers, overly jealous people, and obsessives are all more likely to exhibit pathological lying behaviors.Consider whether your partner has shown other concerning behaviors of late, such as possessiveness, jealousy, anger, or a lack of empathy. If so, you might not want to discuss his lies at all and instead simply exit the situation.

, Because you are ending the relationship, you do not need to determine whether or not he is still lying to you. You no longer care what he does: this conversation is all about you and your needs. This frees you from having to read his body language or maintain eye contact during an in-person conversation. All you have to do is say what you need to say, however you feel comfortable saying it. You can confront the liar:


In person. It will mostly likely be safest to do so in a public place. Consider telling a close friend or family member where this meeting will take place, so that you have back-up if the conversation escalates. This is a riskier option, but it also gives you the pleasure of seeing his face when you tell him that you know he lied to you.
Over the phone. Consider writing yourself notes or bullet points so that you remember to cover everything you want to say. Remember: this will hopefully be the last time you contact him, so you don't want to leave anything important unsaid. This option also gives you the opportunity simply to hang up the phone if he begins making up silly excuses or yelling.
Through an email. An email will allow you to express yourself clearly and concisely. This option is especially useful if you do not want to see that liar's stupid face again. Consider having a close friend read the email before you send it to make sure that it is legible. If the liar responds, you have the option of reading his reply or simply sending it to your spam folder. Though there might be a stigma against ending a relationship over email, sometimes it is the safest method, especially if your soon-to-be-ex has exhibited other concerning behaviors., Because you are not seeking to repair the relationship, tell him honestly how his lies made you feel. Try not to yell or use profanity, but do emphasize the fact that his behavior was unacceptable and that he is to blame for ruining the relationship. Perhaps your bravery will help him be truthful to his future partners, but his actions are no longer your responsibility. You are not responsible for changing him: you are only responsible for ending the relationship with your pride and honesty intact.

, It is likely that he will try to distract you with apologies or excuses, and he might even blame you for his lies.Do not react in any way to these excuses: keep a stony, silent face, and then resume telling him about your feelings. Soon he will learn that this conversation is about what you have to say, not about what he is thinking or feeling.

, This is not a time to keep your problems to yourself. This is a time to reach out to your close friends and family members. Not only can they give you a more objective perspective on your partner's lies, but their company and fellowship will help keep you from falling back into a relationship with a liar. If you forget that you ended a relationship with a liar for a very good reason, they will remind you that you did the right thing.Indeed, studies have shown that a breakup can cause you to strengthen and develop your friendships, leading to increased happiness. , Breakups are painful, but they can also lead to positive outcomes, especially if you focus on how you've grown because of the experience. Tell yourself that you can thrive more now that you are no longer in the company of a liar.

Consider how this person treats you.,
Notice your own attempts to justify the behavior of your loved one.,
Remind yourself of all the things that get on your nerves and cannot be reconciled.,
Make arrangements to jump from whatever situation you're in now to one that is self-supporting and away from this person.,
Think about how you'll tell this person that you're leaving.,
Get active.,
Delete his or her number from your mobile phone.",How to Walk Away from Love," One of the most compelling reasons for walking away from someone you love is that despite the love, this person is hurting you in some way. Perhaps he or she is manipulative and controlling, perhaps he or she is lying to you or perhaps he or she can't stop having affairs and then asking to be taken back by you. Whatever the reason, if you're constantly hurt, undermined or let down by this person, you owe it to yourself to walk away. Common signs that it's time to walk away include:


Lies: Your love lies about the time of day, his or her whereabouts, his or her income, how much he or she loves you, etc.
Lack of support for you: Your love demands all the support in the world from you but gives none back. Perhaps he or she insists that you do all the housework, earn all the money, buy all the dinners out or take full responsibility for the children without lifting a finger. Whatever the reason, failure to support is not a sign of real love.
Affairs: Any affairs are a reason to question your relationship. More than one and your lover is likely to keep repeating this wheel, to your detriment.
Condescension: If your love acts superior, condescendingly or rudely toward you all the time, puts you down in front of others and causes you to feel like you're worthless, it's time to walk away. No love is worth sapping your own self-esteem for, not ever.
Callous, cold and moody: A love who can't turn off the nasty tap is not someone to stay around lifelong. While everyone gets moody at times, someone who changes moods as quickly as the wind and uses these moods to dominate, inflict fear or treat you badly is someone to walk away from.
Violence: Love is not violent. You need to walk to safety when your ""loving"" relationship is a violent one.
Grown apart, just don't feel the love anymore: Unlike most of the other reasons, this one is down to either both of you or perhaps just you. If you feel that loving feeling has passed on and the romance is past its due-by date, it's very unlikely that anything will salvage it once the rot sets in. For the sake of both of you, it may be time to walk away.;
, If you are making excuses to stay with your love despite any of the reasons cited above, learn to call yourself out on them. It is quite possible that you've fallen into a vicious justificatory cycle that you'll never break free from unless you acknowledge it openly. Realize that being stoic and putting up with a bad situation will only end in faster aging, resentment and feeling like you're putting up with second best. It bodes ill and does not reflect well on either of you to be sticking together when the love has fled.

, All loving couples get on each other's nerves now and then, it's only natural when people live closely together. However, if you find you're constantly irritated by all the little foibles, faux pas and habits, it's possible that you're the one who risks turning condescending and manipulative unless you deal with it. Either have a few very open conversations about making changes or start to think about walking away and beginning anew with someone who irritates you a whole lot less.

, If you're living together or married, you need an alternative when walking away. For those dating, your home is likely already your sanctuary, while for those living together, the hard decision as to who goes needs to be reached. Are you wanting to stand your ground and stay in your shared residence or are you going to leave for a new place? If you do leave, is it affordable, safe and suitable for you? If you're a victim of violence, find out where a refuge is that you can run to when the chance arises.


Consider how your savings will keep you going. If you have tangled them jointly, it's going to be a lot harder to walk away than if you're not yet living together. See a lawyer for advice if you're living with this person.

, You may not even want to, or in the case of violence, you will most likely be leaving in secrecy. But for most people walking away from love, this can be a time of resolution, a chance to get things off your chest or even an opportunity to remind your love what a great person they are as an individual, just not as part of the couple the two of you once formed.


For the faint hearted, leaving a card or note is one goodbye option.

, Find things to occupy you once you've made the decision to leave. You're free and for a while, it may feel unbelievable to be able to do things without having to keep in mind your lovers needs and wants. Consider doing things that keep your mind off too much thinking about your love, like sport, exercise, visiting museums, seeing movies, catching up with friends, getting into hobbies, joining volunteering, reading books, creating your own website. Just do whatever rocks your boat and keeps your mind off things.


You have permission to have fun. There isn't anything mandating that you mope about or look sad all day long. Often people feel compelled to act out sadness at loss of a love long beyond the time that they actually feel able to move on. In fact, many people who institute break ups have already done a lot of their mourning before leaving. You don't have to don grief as your outlook forever.
Hold a letting go ceremony to mark the crossing of one experience of love and to ready yourself for future love. A little like a funeral, letting go ceremonies can help you to establish a point at which you're okay about having walked away and you're ready to move on.

, Delete their email address. Delete them from MSN, Bebo, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter and anything else you are connected on. Stop caring what he or she is doing anymore, it's probably bound to annoy or upset you anyway, so let it go and build your new life.

Reminisce about past events.",How to Show Your Boyfriend that You're not Cheating," If you suspect your boyfriend thinks your cheating, but he hasn’t said anything to you about it, ask if you can have a serious conversation with him. Tell him you think something is bothering him and ask him if he feels comfortable talking to you about it. Tell him you want to be there for him, no matter what’s bothering him, and that you want to help in any way you can. Listen to what he says with an open attitude and try to limit any knee-jerk reactions or judgements.Ask him if there was a specific event or situation that occurred to make him worry you were cheating. If there was, discuss the details of the situation and have him explain why it made him think you were cheating.
Explain to him your perspective of the event or situation. Further acknowledge that you can understand why he may have misinterpreted the event as an indication of cheating and ask what you can do to make sure it doesn’t happen again.
Discuss and agree on a course of action to make sure a misunderstanding like this never happens again. This may include you changing your behaviour towards other men, or your boyfriend promising to raise any situations that have made him uncomfortable. Promise to be more open with each other in the future.;
, Once you’ve had a chance to talk to your boyfriend about his thoughts, you should take a moment to evaluate the specific behaviours or actions you may have had that caused him concern. Is it possible that your actions were to blame? Were you maybe a little too flirty with another guy without thinking about it? Or were your actions completely reasonable and his reaction was irrational?Now that you have a better understanding of where your boyfriend is coming from, you need to make a decision. Is it possible that he’s asking you to change your behaviour to be someone you are not? Or is what he asking completely reasonable under the circumstances (i.e. that you’re not single)?
If you want to make the relationship work, then make a compromise with your boyfriend and alter your actions as best you can.
If you feel your boyfriend is asking too much of you, think about whether this is the sort of relationship you really want to be in. Maybe your boyfriend is too overprotective and you need someone who gives you a little more independence. Or maybe your actions depict your true feelings towards your boyfriend, and you not really happy in your relationship.

, Being capable of cheating on someone requires the ability to betray, lie, and be deceitful. Not a lot of people can accomplish this without some outward signs of anxiety or stress. Not to mention that some people are simply incapable of the extensive lying that would be required when cheating on someone. If your boyfriend thinks you may be cheating on him, ask him to really think about your personality. Is it really the type of personality capable of such deceit? Are you really the type of person who could lie consistently to someone’s face?In many situations, your boyfriend may already know “the truth” deep down inside, but it doesn’t stop him from being a little doubtful or insecure. Giving him the chance to really evaluate the logic of his suspicions may help him get rid of the doubt and insecurity he has.

, Have you recently becomes friends with someone new? Have you been having a lot of fun hanging out with this new friend, and possibly not spending as much time with your boyfriend? It might be this change that has him suspicious. Even though you can reassure him you’re just hanging out with a friend, he might still be in doubt. Since you have nothing to hide, invite him along the next time you hang out with your friend., Relationships where one member is cheating usually have a lot of other signs that something isn't right. One such sign is the lack of communication or excitement between the couple. If you can show your boyfriend you still love hanging out with him, that you always make plans to do things together, that you enjoy quiet time alone, and that you are able to communicate effectively, he’ll realize that it would seem very unlikely you’re cheating on him. Why would you spend that much time with someone you don’t really care about? Why would you be that excited to see him if you preferred someone else?, Couples who aren’t having relationship problems usually have a healthy sex life. They might try new things every now and again, but they’re pretty in-tune to what their partners need and want. Sure, one or both of you may be too tired or stressed out about something else to want to have sex on a specific night, but it doesn’t happen constantly. If your sex life with your boyfriend is great, and you communicate effectively about what you both want in bed, it should help your boyfriend realize you not likely cheating on him.It is possible that your boyfriend is simply insecure. Maybe he doesn’t think he makes you happy in bed, or that he’s done something wrong. His mind might immediately lead him to believe that you might want to seek something better elsewhere. He may need some reassurance that he’s either doing the right thing in bed, or you may need to take the time to tell him what you want.

, Unfortunately, in today’s technology-fuelled world, electronics are often the cause of misunderstandings and suspicions in relationships. It could be anything from suspicious text messages to callers with no caller IDs. If your boyfriend is worried that you may be cheating on him due to something related to your cell phone or computer, ask him to explain exactly what he saw or heard that concerned him. Chances are the specific situation had a perfectly reasonable explanation, but maybe your reaction to the situation made him suspicious.Once you know what specific situation may have caused your boyfriend concern, ask if he’d feel better if you showed him the details on your phone or computer. Would it give him a little security to see a specific text message or email? If so, consider showing him the item that caused him concern and demonstrating what really happened.
This step, however, shouldn’t turn into your boyfriend constantly checking everything on your phone in order to track where you’ve been and what you’ve been doing. Your phone is still your private property and he has no right to see it unless you give him permission. It’s important to draw that line with your boyfriend if you do decide to show him something on your phone. And you need to respect those same boundaries with him and his phone.

, Our gut feelings or instincts usually lead us in the right direction. If we feel something is off, chances are something is off. Ask your boyfriend to take the time to seriously ask himself if he feels — in his gut — that you are cheating on him. He might have developed a suspicion or paranoia about your potential cheating and just hasn’t been able to talk himself out of it, but deep down inside he knows it’s not true. It’s possible he just needs the time to truly think about the situation and consciously come to that realization., Relationships that are having problems usually include couples that fight over the smallest, most minor topic. Relationships that are doing well still argue, but the arguments never end with a complete and total meltdown of both people. As a girlfriend who is not cheating, demonstrate to your boyfriend that, while you guys fight, it’s never the end of the world. If you were cheating, chances are your fights would be significantly more severe., Cheating on someone takes a lot of energy and usually results in feelings of guilt and anxiety. If you were cheating on your boyfriend, chances are you’d be showing signs of depression, anxiety, and guilt. If you’re a calm person who doesn’t appear to be at all worried about your relationship, how can your boyfriend think you’re cheating on him?Ask him if you’ve ever been upset for no reason when he’s asked you something (e.g. like where you’ve been). If you’ve always given a reasonable explanation about your whereabouts, why is he worried?
Ask him if you have weird and unexplained mood changes that have nothing to do with biology or obvious external events (e.g. problems with family or at work). If you’ve never exploded at him for reasons he can’t explain, why would he think you’re harbouring guilt about cheating?

, Someone who was cheating on their boyfriend wouldn’t be trying to advance their current relationship. If you and your boyfriend talk about your future often, or talk about things like how you see yourselves in 20 years, you’re very unlikely to be cheating on him. These aren’t the types of conversations someone who is cheating would want to have. If you were cheating, these are the conversations you’d likely try to avoid or gloss over., One of the last things a cheating girlfriend would do is invite the boyfriend she’s cheating on to family events and show him off. Make sure to include your boyfriend in family events. Encourage your parents or siblings to communicate directly with him, if they want. Brag about his accomplishments to your family members. Suggest your family members friend him on Facebook.The same activities can be applied in the opposite direction. Be excited to meet his family. Develop personal relationships with members of his family (maybe his mom or sister).

, If you were cheating on your boyfriend, you’d probably stop confiding in him about all sorts of stuff. Since you’re not cheating on your boyfriend, make sure you confide in your boyfriend about things that are worrying you. Tell him some secrets you have that you haven’t told anyone else. Tell him about the things you truly worry about, or what frightens and scares you. Show him you trust him completely with these confidential and delicate things about yourself., Maybe this has already happened and it’s the reason why your boyfriend is suspicious. You may have meant it as a joke, but he may have taken it to heart. No one likes being compared to someone else in order to point out their imperfections. Just because someone else is , doesn’t mean your boyfriend has to do the same thing, say the same stuff, or be the same way. If you accidentally did this previously, apologize and promise not to do it again., Everyone loves compliments! Compliments make you feel good because they demonstrate someone else was paying attention to you AND went the extra step to actually say something out loud. A compliment doesn’t have to be only based on big events and activities, it can be small things like a nice shirt, an attractive hair style, a well made dinner, holding the door for someone else, and more. Take the time to compliment your boyfriend for something he’s done at least once a day. Not only will it make him feel great, he’ll know you’re paying attention to both the big and little things he does., Depending on what else is going on in your life at the time (e.g. school, work, family, etc.) your boyfriend will most likely be one of your top priorities. Show him how much of a priority he is to you by taking him into account as much as you can when scheduling events and planning outings. For example, if you and your boyfriend had discussed the possibility of going to a movie on the weekend, but hadn’t made firm plans, check with him before you make alternative plans.If you already have plans, but something really important for your boyfriend comes up suddenly, consider changing your plans so you can be there to support him.

, Every once in a while, hang out with your boyfriend and talk about a past event that you both really enjoyed. Watch videos or look at photos from the event. Laugh and share memories from the events to remind yourselves how important you are to each other. The event can be anything from a specific vacation to a day at a theme park."

Identify what makes you uncomfortable, or what makes your partner uncomfortable. If you want to slow a relationship down, you'll need to understand why it's going too fast.


You might feel the need to keep your partner in check. Perhaps your partner wants to escalate the physical side of the relationship, but you aren't comfortable doing so. Maybe he or she is demanding commitments that you know you can't keep. Perhaps he or she is falling head over heels for you, but you want to let your feelings blossom more gradually.
On the other hand, you might need to slow down your own feelings. It's easy to feel ""freaked out"" if you sense they you're falling too quickly for your partner. Perhaps your significant other has specifically asked you to slow things down, for their sake. In this case, consider how you can respect what your partner needs out of the relationship.;
, Notice the specific actions or situations that make you feel uncomfortable. Look for patterns. Try to understand exactly which circumstances make you feel like things are going too fast.Maybe you've just started seeing a guy, but he's inviting you to go on trips with him or asking you to be his date to a wedding. If this level of implied commitment bothers you, then that's what you need to address.
Perhaps you've been dating a girl for a while, and she keeps dropping hints about marriage and children. If you aren't ready to think about these things, it might be putting a lot of strain on your relationship.

, Evaluate your goals for the relationship, your goals for personal growth, and your goals for the future. Consider whether this relationship is pushing you against your goals, and ask yourself whether the imbalance is something that you'll be able to resolve. Understand that you may just not be compatible.


If your partner wants something different than you, it doesn't mean they're a bad person. It may just mean that you don't have the same goals. Consider whether it's worth building a relationship despite this.

, Speak honestly with your partner about what you're feeling. Tell him or her what makes you so uncomfortable, and try to get to the bottom of your feelings. Make sure that he/she knows that you're still interested – but that you want to take things down a notch. If your partner understands where you're coming from, it will be easier for them to change their behavior and make you feel more comfortable.You may find that open communication makes your relationship much less complicated. You can't expect your partner to act a certain way unless you ask., Two people don't necessarily come into a relationship with the same expectations. Your partner might not even realize that she's making you feel uncomfortable. You may find that you have been living in two separate realities, each making moves and choices that are incomprehensible to the other. The quickest way to fix this is to establish a mutual understanding of where the relationship is going.

, If you can't see eye to eye, it may be time to leave. It isn't fair to force your partner into something they don't want – and it isn't fair for you to live in fear of losing yourself. Sometimes, you need to step back and focus on yourself before you can dive into a serious relationship.


Consider whether the situation merits a breakup. Breaking up with your partner will not only slow things down – it will bring them to a grinding halt. If you feel that this is the only choice, then don't be afraid to make it happen.

, If you find yourself leaping to long-term plans and words of commitment—e.g. ""I love you.""—consider whether you're really comfortable with those things. Try to shift the dialogue to the short-term. Before you decide where your relationship is going to be years down the line, figure out where it will be in a few months' time., Think about the specific things that make you uncomfortable, and find a way to either mange or avoid those things. It may be easy to slow down your relationship if you change the way that you respond to a very specific set of situations.


If you obsess about your girlfriend when you don't see her for a few days: find a way to see her more often, or ask her to communicate a bit more while she's away.
If your boyfriend tries to start something physical every time that you're in a bedroom together: stay away from the bedroom. Don't lie down on a bed with him, and consider limiting your alone time until you're confident that he won't push your boundaries.

, Stay in tune with yourself, and be strong in your convictions. Don't agree to be somewhere in six months' time if you aren't sure what you're doing next week! Some people are more comfortable with setting far-off plans, and some people prefer to figure out their plans as they go along – and that's perfectly okay. If you're in a relationship with someone who's more plan-happy than you are, you'll need to strike a balance between their comfort zone and yours.

, It's easy to feel overwhelmed if you aren't giving yourself the space that you need. This doesn't mean that you need to take a formal break from the relationship; just set aside a bit of time each day to think about your own life and take your mind off of your partner. You might find that the simple act of valuing your ""me"" time makes you feel much more in control of your relationship.Spend time with your friends, and don't bring your significant other. Make sure that you keep the core of your friendships strong, even if you're all dating people. You don't need your significant other to be around all the time., Getting out of town for a few days might give you both the chance to cool your jets and reevaluate what's important. Go camping, or visit a new city, or just take a long road trip. Climb a mountain; jump in the ocean. Find the space you need to clear your head., Try not to spend the night at this person's place, and don't invite him/her back to yours. Sleeping in the same bed can make seems things much more serious – especially when it starts to become a regular thing. The more intimate you become with a person, the more deeply intertwined your lives will be.The same goes for living together. A cohabitation situation—especially one that you haven't explicitly agreed upon—can make things feel as though they are spiraling into a more serious place.Consider whether you need to scale your living situation back a notch.

Decide if you are both committed to saving the relationship.,
Consider the reasons why you are still together with your partner.,
Lean on family and friends for perspective and advice.,
Try to be calm and respectful when you communicate with your partner.,
Be honest and specific about your feelings.,
Practice active listening.,
Be willing to acknowledge your partner’s point of view.,
Seek therapy or counseling when necessary.,
Come up with quality outings together.,
Commit to a once a week date night.,
Surprise your partner with a unique date.",How to Rescue a Relationship," It is important that you are both committed to working together to renew the relationship and make it better than it was in the past. You can both verbally agree to do this as a way to show you are both invested in the relationship. If your partner is not certain about his desire to save the relationship, you may want to reconsider how much this relationship means to him. It may be difficult to save it if both of you are not committed., Before you embark on the rescue of your relationship, you should sit down and ask yourself what drew you initially to your partner and how these qualities have changed or shifted. Taking a moment to reevaluate your reasons for being with this person can remind you why you would like to stay together with him and work to renew your relationship.You and your partner can also do this together. Be willing to engage in constructive criticism and use “I” statements. For example: “I feel like we used to spend more time together. Now I feel we hardly see each other,” or, “I feel like one of the big things I love about you is your energy and zest for life. But I feel like lately you have been depressed and withdrawn.” Focus on the qualities of the person that you value and admire, and look at when or how these qualities became less prominent in relationship.

, Sometimes it can be difficult to get perspective on your relationship, especially when you are so emotionally involved. Talk to close friends and family you trust and who know you and your partner well. Discuss some of the issues you may be having and ask if they have experienced similar issues or problems. They may be able to suggest certain tactics you can try to renew your relationship.Keep in mind that too many outside voices and opinions can end up cluttering your relationship and lead to assumptions or biases between you and your partner. Listen to the advice of others, but take it with a grain of salt. Remember that you will need to focus on communicating openly with your partner, rather than with others around you, to save your relationship from falling apart.

, It can be difficult to maintain a level of respect and emotional control when you are discussing issues or problems in your relationship with your partner.Approaching the conversation with care and respect for the other person will show that you want to try to make the relationship work. Avoid swearing or raising your voice at your partner as you discuss your relationship issues. Instead, try to be honest and clear about your feelings in a caring and loving way.
Before speaking with your partner, use a calming technique to initiate your body's calming response. Deep breathing, meditation, or even exercising before you sit down tot talk can help you stay level-headed during a difficult conversation.

, To improve your communication with your partner, it’s important that you work to avoid potential misunderstandings or miscommunications. One way of doing this is by focusing on being clear, direct, and specific about your feelings and desires to your partner. If you feel your partner is neglecting your relationship, you should be honest and clear about how and why this troubles you.This could be as simple as saying, “I feel like we have not being seeing enough of each other lately and I miss being with you, just us.” You could then suggest that you go out for dinner for a romantic night just the two of you. Your intentions are clear to your partner and you can be assured that you are trying to communicate with your partner.
As well, during a disagreement, try to focus on exactly what is making you angry or upset, rather than trying to discuss all of your issues at once. If you feel you are not spending enough time together, focus the discussion on ways that you can both see more of each other and set aside time for each other. If the disagreement is about household chores, such as taking out the garbage, focus the discussion by suggesting that you both look at why it’s important to take out the garbage.
Avoid letting the discussion about the garbage be about how your partner doesn’t focus on household chores or how your partner is lazy or inconsiderate. Tackle one issue at a time so you are both not overwhelmed and the disagreement does not escalate to a shouting match.

, Active listening means listening and responding to someone in a way that improves mutual understanding. Instead of looking at conversations with your partner as competitions or battles to be won, think of conversations as learning opportunities and ways to understand more about where your partner is coming from. This will show you view conversations with your partner as a way to listen attentively to him, rather than speak at him or disregard what he has to say.To practice active listening, focus your attention on your partner and let your partner finish speaking without interruption. You should then repeat what your partner has said in your own words. Though you do not need to agree with what your partner said, this will show you understand what he said and are willing to discuss his points in a healthy exchange of feelings and thoughts, rather than in a shouting match.

, Actively listening to your partner is only one half of effective communication. The other half is validating your partner’s point of view, reflecting back his feelings, and discussing possible ways to resolve the conflict. This can be an open discussion where you both talk about ways you can adjust your routines or schedules to accommodate each other, or this could be a resolution to the conflict that you suggest and then discuss with your partner. The important thing is to show you respect your partner’s point of view and are willing to work with him to come up with possible solutions to the issue.For example, your partner may have an issue with you working long hours and not coming home until late at night. Once your partner has finished speaking, respond by saying, “What I’m hearing is that you would prefer if I came home earlier at night and did not work such long hours so we can spend more time together. I also want us to spend more time together. I have to work long hours because of this deadline coming up but I would like to take you out for dinner this weekend so we can have a night out together.” This response shows that you listened to what your partner had to say and came up with a way to resolve the conflict. You are taking responsibility for your actions and sympathizing with your partner’s perspective.

, Sometimes, it is necessary to go to a therapist or counselor to help unpack some of the emotions and feelings that are threatening to end your relationship. Look for a couples therapist or counselor that you can trust and feel comfortable being honest around. Often, the act of going to therapy together can be the first step to showing your commitment to saving the relationship.As well, you may consider going to therapy on your own if you are dealing with personal issues that may be affecting your relationship. Examining your own issues may help to release any anger, anxiety, or stress that you are bringing into your relationship with your partner.

, One of the major reasons why couples have issues is that one person feels the other person is not devoting enough time and energy in the relationship. Make time for your partner and make sure he makes time for you by sitting down and coming up with outings and activities you can do together. Focus on creating quality time, where you both have a chance to interact, talk, laugh, and work together in a fun way.This could be something as simple as a special night out at a nice restaurant or a hike together to your favorite outdoor spot. Try to incorporate activities that both of you enjoy doing and be willing to try new or different things together. This will keep the time you spend together exciting and engaging for you both.

, If you are both very busy with your individual careers and schedules, you may want to both choose one day a week that is your official date night. This means that no matter the work event or commitment, you are both only doing something together, alone, on that night. Having a set date night will make it easier to plan outings and activities and give you both a good sense of when you will get the chance to spend one on one time together.Once you agree to date night, avoid skipping or missing date night. Committing to this time means you are willing to put aside other possible activities for your partner and follow through on your agreed quality time together.

, If you are looking to get your partner more engaged in your relationship and renew your commitment to each other, plan a surprise date in a unique setting.This could be laser tag, bowling, or something more extreme, like a boat ride on the river or a dogsledding in the mountains. Think of a date idea that combines something your partner loves with something he may not expect or will be a pleasant surprise.

Give your ex some space.,
Reflect on what went wrong.,
Make a game plan for addressing the problem.,
Work on yourself.,
Enjoy your own company.",How to Win Your Woman Back1," If you want to win your woman back, the worst thing you can do is call her constantly, text her every two seconds, or even follow her around everywhere. Though ""out of sight, out of mind,"" is true to an extent, you should start off by giving your ex some breathing room so she can have some time to reflect, enjoy her privacy, and regain enough emotional strength to want you again.


Knowing that it's important to give your ex some space is a sign of maturity. She'll appreciate the fact that you respect her enough to know not to smother her, and that you're mature enough to do your own thing for a while.
You don't have to cut down on communication completely. You can still check in once in a while, as long as you don't make it sound like you're desperate to hear from her or always around.
If she gets in touch with you, you should respond but don't get back to her the second she calls or texts, or she'll think you're obsessing over her. Just play it cool.
You don't have to avoid her 100% of the time, but you should cut back on visiting your favorite hangouts or hanging out with mutual friends in hopes of seeing her. Think of this as your time to regroup before you win her over again.;
, Every relationship is different, and so is the end of your relationship. If you want to win your woman back, then you have to consider whatever it was that ended things, and to make sure not to go down that path again. Were you too controlling, too distant, or were there some general incompatibility issues? Maybe it was more simple -- you couldn't get along with her friends, or she couldn't understand your love for motorcycles. Whatever it was, it's time to dig deep to find the source of the problem.


Make a list of all of the things that went wrong in the relationship. Then, look at the biggest issues that led to your downfall.
You and your ex may have openly discussed these issues before you broke up, or maybe you thought your relationship ended for one reason, when it was really completely something else.
Once you've pinpointed the main problem, or main problems, make sure that it's something that you can really control. For example, if your main problem was your fundamentally different religious beliefs, or the fact that you live across the country from each other and can't relocate, that may be hard to fix.

, Before you can make a move and start talking to your ex again, you have to think of a way to address the problem. Once you've figured out what it was, you can think about all the things you can do to fix it. If it's relatively simple, then great, but be aware that some problems take a long time to fix.


If the problem was your lack of confidence, then you'll need some time to work on developing a positive sense of self.
If the problem was your jealousy, then you have to work on being more trusting and less paranoid.
If the problem was a quality of your ex, then you have to think about how to be okay with that quality, or about how you can work together to both change.

, Everyone can use some self-improvemnt, and what better time to do it than when you have to win your ex back? While you're backing off from your ex and giving her some breathing room, you should spend some time focusing on becoming a more self-assured, confident, understanding, and mature person. This will help you make a better impression on your ex once you win her over again.


You can't fully address your flaws in a matter of weeks, but you can certainly get a head start.
Make a list of the things that your ex complained about, as well as the things you'd like to fix. See how many of them you can address, or try to focus on the aspect that matters the most to you.
If your ex complained that you were messy, then spend more time cleaning your space.
If your ex complained that you were flaky or always late, then work on sticking to your commitments and showing up on time when you make plans with your friends and family.

, You shouldn't spend all of your ""me time"" obsessing over improving yourself or wondering what your ex is up to. Instead, enjoy your own company by reading, exercising, or just taking the time to pursue your own interests and goals to become a better person. If you're comfortable on your own, then your ex will know it once you reconnect. It's important to be secure by yourself before you try to jump back into a relationship again.


If you're busy pursuing your own interests, your ex may see you doing it -- whether you're going for a run or reading your favorite book in a coffee shop, if she sees you doing your own thing, she'll be impressed.
Doing your own thing will also make you a more interesting person. When you reconnect with your ex, you'll have more to talk about.

Notice if they ever initiate communication.,
Try calling them on the phone.,
Stop contacting them for a little while.,
Decide how you want to approach them.,
Ask them if they’re interested in a casual way.,
Respond gracefully.",How to Tell When You've Been Rejected," Listen for how they respond. If they seem enthusiastic, that’s a good sign. If they sound wishy-washy or annoyed, they may be trying to gently reject you.Keep a positive attitude when you ask to hang out. Don’t assume you’ve been rejected already. You can say something like, ""So, would you like to get together soon?""
If the person says they’re too busy right now, respect that. Even if they like you, they may be too busy to invest time in someone right now.;
, When you ask someone to “hang out sometime,” it’s easy for them to say “yes.” That’s because they probably won’t have to follow through. Try asking the person to hang out at a specific time or place.Suggest something you’re sure they’d enjoy. If you know they love sports, you could invite them to a game. If there’s a movie you’re both excited about, suggest that you go together. If they turn down the opportunity to do something they’d enjoy anyway, they’re probably rejecting you.
Say something like, ""That movie you were talking about is opening on Thursday. Do you want to make plans to go together?""
If they accept your invitation, follow through and confirm the plans. It’s possible they may be thinking of this as simply a friendly hangout, but you can’t be sure yet.
You can send a text or e-mail later that day (or the next) something like, ""So, should we confirm plans for Wednesday? I'm free at 8 if that works for you.""

, This may feel hard if you already suspect you’re being rejected. However, unless you offer an alternate suggestion, you may not be completely sure that you were rejected. You may always wonder if it was simply not good timing.


Keep it simple. You can say something like, ""It's too bad you can't come to the movie on Thursday. I was planning to go to the beach on Saturday, though. Would you be interested in that?""
If they accept your invitation this time, that could be a great sign. It may mean that they are in fact busy, but are willing to make the time for you.
If they turn down your second suggestion or are unwilling to commit to a date and time, chances are they’re trying to reject you.

, There’s no reason to keep putting yourself out there for someone who’s probably not interested. Let them know that they can get in touch with you if they’d like to see you. This puts the ball in their court so that you can move on with your life.Even if you feel hurt and disappointed, keep a positive attitude when you do this. Try not to appear bitter or angry.
You can say something like, “It seems like you’re really busy right now. If you ever have the time and would like together, here’s my number.”
Prepare yourself for the fact that they may not ever call. Just because the ball is in their court doesn’t mean they’re going to pick it up.

, Are you always the one to start a text conversation, or to say hello when you run into each other? Does having a conversation or e-mail exchange feel like pulling teeth? If you’re always the one to start a conversation or to keep it going, they might be trying to pull away from you., Some forms of communication can be easy for a person to respond to even if they’re not that into it. A person who isn’t interested in you may be willing to respond with texts or instant messages. However, if they won’t talk to you on the phone, they may be rejecting you.


Always leave a message if they don’t pick up. You can say something like, “I’d like to get together soon. Give me a call back when you can.”
Avoid calling “just to talk.” This might seem odd, and some people don’t enjoy talking on the phone. Have something specific in mind. You could be calling to invite them somewhere, or to ask them a question.
You can say something like, ""I just saw an ad in the paper for that play you mentioned. Would you like to get tickets to go together?""

, If you can’t tell who usually initiates communication, try stepping back for a week or two. See if they contact you without your suggestion. If they do, that’s a great sign. It probably means they have noticed your disappearance and miss you. If they don’t contact you, it’s possible they may not have noticed, or that they are assuming you’ve gotten the message.


If you have strong feelings for this person, it might be hard to not hear from them for a while. However, you need to take this step to find out if you’re being rejected.

, Asking someone directly whether or not they’re interested in you is scary. You may want to find a time to talk to them in person, or you may want to use text or e-mail. You should choose the method that feels safest and most comfortable for you.Asking via text or e-mail gives the other person more time to respond without feeling put on the spot. However, you’ll have to wait for the response, and that can be nerve wracking.
Asking in person will give you an immediate response, but the person might feel put on the spot.

, Even if you feel desperate for their affection, try to avoid showing it. Ask them in a simple, up front way, and make it clear that you’re open to whatever their answer will be. Try to keep the exchange low stakes. They may not be interested in you, but that says more about them than it does about you.If you’re contacting them via text or e-mail, you can say something like, “It’s been hard for me to tell from your messages whether you’re interested in getting together. If you’re interested, I’d love to find a way to make plans. If you’re not, I completely understand that, too.”
Some people may still be too shy to be honest that they’re not interested. If they say something like, “I do like you. I’m just busy,” you should put the ball back in their court. You can say, “Cool. Well, feel free to hit me up whenever you want to make time to hang out.”
In person, you can say something like, “I really enjoy spending time with you, and it’s hard for me to tell if you feel the same way. Can we talk about that?” This will most likely spur the person to talk about their feelings.

, If the person can tell you that they are in fact interested, that’s great. Let them know that you’d like to take steps to spend time with them. If they aren’t interested, let them know you understand their feelings.If you have in fact been rejected, you can say something like, ""Thanks for being direct with me about that. I really hope we can still be friends.""
Avoid asking them why they aren’t interested in you. This can put the other person in an uncomfortable situation.
Once you are certain that you’ve been rejected, you can confidently move on. It may be hard at first, but there’s no reason to dwell on someone whom you know isn’t interested in you.

Keep communication open.",How to Tell Your Best Guy Friend You Don't Like Him," You should be honest with your guy friend about the fact you do not like him back. Have a sit down conversation with him at a good time and placePick a time when your friend won't be stressed. You do not want to tell him right before a big football game or exam. Instead, wait for a weekend afternoon when neither you nor your friend have big plans or obligations.
As it's just going to be you and your friend, pick a place that does not look like a date. Going out to lunch together may feel date-like, so choose something more low-key. What do you and your friend normally do together? Maybe you like to hang out in the park. This may be a better location.;
, It can be difficult to tell your friend you're not interested in him. In the moment, you may feel nervous. Therefore, try to write down your thoughts ahead of time. This will help you get a sense of how you feel, and figure out the best way to express that.Get a pen or pencil and paper and jot down your thoughts. How do you feel? What is the best way to express this?
From there, write down what you want from the conversation. Do you want you and your friend to work on salvaging the friendship? Do you need some space from this friend so he can sort out his feelings?
You should not read out what you're writing word-per-word during the discussion. This is more of a way to get your thoughts out. By writing out your thoughts ahead of time, you can better express them in the moment.

, You want to try and get a sense of what your friend is feeling going into the conversation. Empathy is important at any point, but is vital to difficult conversations. Your friend may react negatively to the news, and you want to understand why so you do not become frustrated.Try to think how you would feel in your friend's position. Imagine having feelings for someone, and thinking that person may feel the same way. It would be crushing to hear the truth. Your friend will likely feel sad and disappointed, and worried about the harm done to your friendship.
Carry this empathy into the conversation. While talking to your friend, he may react poorly. He may become upset, or even angry. Try to remember your friend is going through something difficult. Remember what it's like to be in his shoes in the moment, and you'll be better equipped to cope with a negative reaction.

, If you go into the conversation with assumptions, this may change how you act. For example, if you expect your friend to get mad, you may go into the conversation with hostility. Conversely, if you think your friend will shake it off easily, you may come off as uncaring.Remind yourself of what you don't know. You cannot know how a situation is going to unfold until it's occurring. Therefore, it makes no sense to make predictions.
Go into the situation calm and optimistic, but with no assumptions on how your friend will react. By keeping your expectations open, you'll find it easier to deal with a range of potential reactions.

, You want to make sure your friend understand you do not want a romantic relationship. You do not want to give a soft answer, that gives your friend hope that you'll change your mind in the future. You should be as honest as possible about how you're feeling.Explain your feelings up front. You can begin the discussion with something like, ""I know you have feelings for me, but I don't have any romantic feelings for you.""
It can help to explain the reasons for your feelings, as this can give your friend closure. However, remember that being honest does not mean being brutal.
If you want to give a reason, be tactful. Maybe you're just not attracted to your friend. Do not say, ""You're a little too short, and that's not my type physically, so I don't think it would work."" You don't want to sound like you're tearing your friend apart. Instead, try something like, ""I just don't feel a physical spark between us.""

, A lot of times, saying, ""Let's still be friends"" can be misinterpreted. People may take this as a sign you may change your mind. Your friend may think you will eventually develop romantic feelings for him. Make it clear you want to continue the friendship, but without the hope of a romantic relationship.Emphasize you value the friendship. Say something like, ""You are one of my best guy friends, though, and that's really important to me.""
Honesty is important when you make it clear you want to stay friends. Don't leave it at, ""Let's stay friends."" Make it clear you only want friendship. Say something like, ""I want us to stay good friends, but I just want to be clear I don't see a romantic relationship developing between us.""

, Your friend may very well be upset or hurt by the conversation. That's understandable. Being rejected romantically hurts. You should listen to your friend's response. Allow him to express himself, just as you did.Your friend may be disappointed and upset. This is understandable. Try to be empathetic as you listen. Remind him that you do still value the friendship.
Your friend may also have some questions for you, regarding your feelings. If you choose to answer the questions, do so honestly, but without being brutal. If he asks why you're not attracted to him, say, ""I'm just not"" rather than diving into specifics.

, It can be very hard to return to a normal friendship after letting someone down. In the aftermath of your conversation, you and your friend may both need some space.You can try setting basic boundaries. For example, you could agree to just see each other at school for a set number of weeks.
However, you may want to have looser boundaries. You could, for example, agree to lessen up on contact, but with no specific rules how. You may find one-on-one hang outs, texting, and calling slow down, but that you still see your friend out in groups.

, A good way to make sure a friendship stays strong over time is showing basic love and appreciation. Even though a romantic relationship is out of the question, find ways to show your friend you appreciate him. This will make it clear you value your friend's role in your life, even if you do not want a romantic relationship.Make sure to genuinely listen to your friend. Show interest in his passions, troubles, successes, and failures. Ask him, for example, how debate team is going. Wish him good luck, or make him a small card, going into a big competition.
However, you may want to hold off on gestures of appreciation for a bit after your talk. You do not want them to be mistaken for romantic interest.

, Being friends with someone who is romantically interested in you can be confusing. Even if you've made it clear that you only want a friendship, your friend may be harboring some hope things will change. Be aware there may be different expectations so you can navigate them accordingly.Make sure you understand there is no right or wrong when it comes to expectations or wants. Your friend may continue to want a romantic relationship with you, and he cannot turn off how he feels.
However, you cannot change how you feel either. This is equally important to remember. You should not feel guilty if you do not return your friend's feelings, nor should anyone make you feel bad about your feelings. It's always okay to feel what you're feeling.

, Going forward, keep talking to your friend regularly. If your friend's feelings do not go away, you may have to have a conversation again in the future. Make sure you and your friend keep communication open between the two of you.Uncomfortable situations can occur if your friend remains romantically invested in you. Feelings of anger and resentment may build, especially if you start dating someone else.
It's important to avoid building resentment. Let your friend know that he can still tell you anything, even if you're just friends. If he's feeling angry or frustrated with you, let him know he should not hold it in.
If you're able to keep talking, and navigating awkward or frustrating situations, you and your friend can salvage the friendship despite this setback.

Let her see you having a good time.,
Get in her friends' good graces.,
Slowly approach her.,
Play hard to get.,
Show how you've changed.,
Make sure she's interested.,
Tell her how you feel.,
Start dating again.",How to Win Your Woman Back2," If you want your ex to want you again, then she has to see you eventually. After enough time has passed -- a few weeks, at least -- it's time to get back into her social circle or just to ""run into her"" at a time when she can see what a great time you're having. If she knows you're sitting at home pining for her, she'll be less likely to want to be with you than if she sees you having a great time, tossing your hair back, and laughing loudly with your buddies.


Go to the places where you know she'll be without being too obvious about it. When you see her, stop and chat to let her know you care, but don't drop everything to go talk to her. Instead, have a great time with your friends and make her want to join in on the fun.
Whatever you're doing, just make sure you have a big smile on your face and that you're laughing or just clearly having a great time without thinking of her.
If you know you'll see her, you should try to look a little nicer without making it too obvious that you made an extra effort.

, Maybe one of the reasons that your relationship ended is that her friends didn't think you made an effort to get to know them, or that they thought you didn't care enough about your ex to make the relationship worth it. So, if you want your girl to want you again, winning her friends over can help you pave the path to her heart. Here's what you can do:


If you see her friends, make an effort to be incredibly nice without suffocating them. Just let them see what a great guy you are, and move on.
You can even casually ask about your ex if you run into her friends. Let them know that she's on your mind.

, Once you've starting ""running into"" your ex a few times, it's time to make the first move. Start talking to her more, asking how she's doing, and taking a real interest in her life and thoughts. Let her know that she's on your mind and that you really do care about her without overwhelming her. Whether you just run into her at the campus bookstore or even invite her out for coffee, slowly find a way to make it back into her life.


Whether you're talking to her over the phone or in person, suggest that you should hang out again. Keep it very casual. When you do meet up, don't be obvious about your romantic feelings. Just make her miss you without telling her how you feel.

, If you really want to win your ex back over again, then you have to play hard to get once you get back into her life. Sure, you've had coffee, maybe seen a movie, or have even gone back to texting each other or chatting on the phone every few days, but that doesn't mean you should be completely available to her. You have to find the balance between making her think that you're at her beck and call.


If you're out in a big group, let her see you talking to other girls -- just enough to make her a little bit jealous. Just don't overdo it! You don't want her to think that you've completely moved on.
If she asks you to hang out, don't agree to hang out as soon as she's free. Make it seem like you have a busy schedule and that you have to squeeze her in.
If you are hanging out, check your phone and send out a text once or twice. Make her wonder who else you're talking to.

, Once you start spending some time with your former flame again, you need to let her see that you're a changed man. Don't do the same old things that used to drive her crazy. You can even laugh and point out how much better you are now if you want to make light of things. If she always complained about how messy your car was, clean it up and say, ""Not bad, right?"" the next time she needs a ride.


Do whatever you can to make her see that you're working on improving the qualities that caused troubles for the relationship are slowly improving.
Just remember not to change completely -- remember the things she must have loved about you and highlight those aspects of yourself when you're together.

, Before you tell her how you feel, you need to know that your plan to win your woman over is really working. You need to be able to read the signs to see that your ex doesn't just want to hang out with you as a friend, but that she shares romantic feelings for you. To do this, you'll have to pay attention to what she does, says, and to study her body language to know that you're on the same page.


Check out her body language when you're together. Does she make eye contact, occasionally look at the floor when she's feeling shy, and lean her body towards you when you speak? If so, then she may want to get closer to you.
See if she gives you compliments on how you've changed, or just points out your good qualities consistently. If so, then she may want to start dating again.
See if she's hanging out with other guys, or if you've heard she's interested in someone else, or if she only seems to hang out with you.
See if she goes out of her way to see you, if she mentions hanging out in the future, and if her eyes light up when you ask when you can see her again.

, If you really do think that she does want to be with you again, then it's time to share your feelings with her. Find a time to get her alone, whether you've asked her out on a date or are hanging out in a more casual but private setting, and turn to her and tell her how much you've missed hanging out with her and that you wish you could be a couple again.


Let her see that you've put a lot of thought into it -- tell her that you're aware of what went wrong and talk about how you're determined not to let it happen again.
Tell her you've spent a lot of time reflecting and working on how to become a better person. Make her see that you've already started to make an effort to be with her again.

, If your old flame does respond to your advances and wants to start dating again, too, then it's time to celebrate -- but not too much. Remember to take things slow, to be a gentleman, and to ease back into the relationship. Enjoy dating, telling each other how you feel, and kissing and cuddling, and take the time to reflect on how much you mean to each other instead of rushing right back into where you started.


Remember to take it slow. Don't start hanging out with her 24/7, but start going on dates or hanging out a few times a week. You don't want to make her feel smothered at the beginning of your new relationship.
Just because you're dating again doesn't mean you should take her for granted. Take the time to compliment her, make her feel special, and let her know how lucky you feel to be hanging out with her again.

Get a fresh start.,
Don't fall back into old habits.,
Don't overthink it.,
Always be yourself.",How to Win Your Woman Back3," Don't look at your time with your woman as the reiteration of your previous relationship. Instead, think about it as starting over and starting to enjoy spending time with each as if it's the first time. Though you can definitely talk about the good times you shared in your previous relationship, you shouldn't dwell on the past or rehash old arguments. Work on building a solid -- and new -- foundation to your newfound relationship and take it from there.


If you spend all of your time obsessing over the past, you won't be able to enjoy the present with your woman again.
Though you can go back to doing the things you loved together, you should also take pleasure in pursuing new interests, checking out new restaurants, and going on trips to new places together.

, Though you should enjoy your relationship as a new one, you should still remember the thing that led to the downfall of your relationship. If you find yourself fighting again, disappointing your girlfriend for the same reasons, or finding yourself feeling the same negative emotions you felt the first time around, remember to check yourself and to work on overcoming those troubling situations.


Find a way to get out of those same bad feelings. If you're feeling irrationally jealous again, tell yourself that you're more likely to lose your girlfriend if you keep feeling that way.

, It's important to avoid falling back into old habits, but don't spend all of your time obsessing about making the same mistakes again, either. Find a balance between enjoying your new and (hopefully) improved relationship and being wary of repeating the same mistakes. If you spend all of your time worrying about all of the things that can go wrong, whether it's in a new relationship or during your second go-around, you'll quickly sabotage your chance at happiness.


Focus on living in the moment while learning to catch yourself if you're falling back into your old bad habits.
Your girlfriend and you can work together. She'll take part in keeping the relationship feeling new while avoiding negative patterns. You shouldn't be the only one who wants to make it work again.

, Though it's important to make the changes that are necessary for improving yourself as well as your relationship, don't go so far as to change yourself completely so that you -- or your girlfriend -- don't even recognize the person you've become. Your girlfriend must have liked many things about you to be in the relationship in the first place, so don't forget to maintain the positive qualities that made you a great guy in the first place.


If you try to change yourself too much, then your girlfriend will be able to tell. She should already know you pretty well and will know when you're not being yourself.
It's okay to address your flaws, as long as you're also emphasizing your positive attributes.

Know when to walk away.",How to Deal with People You Don't Like," Think of ways to make dealing with him or her easier ahead of time rather than waiting until the moment you have to meet.


Rely on logic and reason when dealing with the other person instead of relying on emotion.
Avoid complacency in your interactions. Intentionally deciding to make the best of a situation can help you prevent it from turning worse, but if you let things develop naturally, things are more likely to turn out worse after all.;
, The only feelings and thoughts you have control over are your own. When interacting with people you don't like, stay calm and focus on thinking positively. If you sense your mood turning sour, quickly pull yourself out of it to avoid turning the situation into a major meltdown.


If the issue is important enough to discuss later, giving yourself a ""cool down"" period might give you a chance to analyze what the other person said or did to make you so upset while giving you a chance to figure out how you need to approach that person later to avoid getting quite so flustered.

, Ask yourself why you don't like the people you don't like. You might have a valid reason for not liking someone, or the problem between the two of you might lie entirely on your shoulders. Usually, though, both of you will have some role to play, and you need to be honest with yourself about the truth of the situation.


When analyzing the reason for your dislike, ask yourself specific questions, like:Is the problem the individual or someone else who he or she reminds me of?
Am I afraid of becoming like this person or do I recognize a negative character trait of my own in this person?
Is my dislike for this person due to a prejudice I have against a larger group of people?



, Know how much you are willing to take and don't be afraid to draw the boundary somewhere. Even if you want to be a patient, understanding person, it is perfectly okay to admit to things that make you uncomfortable or unhappy. Figuring out how much you can take before losing your cool can help defuse a situation before it turns explosive.


You're entitled to your own personal space, and if others are invading it, you do have the right to protect that space. Even drawing mental boundaries can help you determine when to take a stand and when to let things slide, and the more willing you are to take a stand for yourself, the less likely you are to clash with the person you find yourself at odds with., Sometimes a person will intentionally pick on you, but in most cases, people you don't like will not be going out of their way to upset you. If the problem between you and another person deals with his or her personality, you need to understand that the other person does not mean for you to take their actions as a personal insult.


A good way to figure out if this is a part of that person's personality or not is to watch how he or she behaves with other people. If the behavior is similar to the type of behavior he or she shows you, you probably don't need to take those actions personally.

, If you do not know how to deal with someone, watch others and see how they deal with that person. In doing so, you have a chance to see what works and what doesn't without having to experiment yourself.


Even if the people you watch cannot deal with a difficult person well, you can still get a good idea of certain actions that will not work when dealing with that person. Viewing the situation objectively can often give you a new and helpful perspective.

, You will very seldom run across someone with no redeeming qualities. Even if the positive qualities a person possesses are buried under layers of unpleasantness, identify at least one or two positives and focus on those traits so that you might come to appreciate the other person better.


By figuring out positive character traits of someone you don't like, you might be able to think of a context in which that person would not be quite as hard to tolerate.

, Even though you should generally try to get alone with people you don't like, if something about a specific individual leaves you feeling threatened in some way, don't be afraid to listen to your gut.For example, if you recognize that a coworker has a habit of stealing credit for others' ideas or work, you would do well to avoid taking on projects with that person. Similarly, if you're a girl and a guy you know frequently intimidates you physically or makes unwanted advances, you would do well to avoid him.

, If you can afford to stay away from someone you don't like, doing just that might actually be the best thing for everyone involved. Try not to be too obvious in your efforts to ignore him or her, though, since any rudeness you demonstrate is likely to be returned later on.


Staying away from someone for a while can also help you become more objective about the relationship between you both since you will not need to directly face the personality quirks that usually make you upset.

, If you have to deal with people you don't like and the conversation is quickly going downhill, find a point on which you can sympathize to stop them in their tracks. Doing so can defuse any hostility building in the other people, thereby making your interaction with them slightly more tolerable.


This point is especially important if the feeling of dislike is mutual and you often find yourself getting into arguments with the object of your hostility. Even if the other person tries to pick a fight, it will be hard for him or her to do so if you are in agreement.

, If someone you don't like has brought up a topic of conversation that annoys or frustrates you, switching topics can minimize the annoyance you feel and make it easier to deal with him or her.


When changing topics, make sure that the topic you change to is happy or neutral.
You also need to make the transition naturally instead of abruptly. Telling someone outright that you no longer want to hear what he or she wants to say about a particular issue will do nothing but make that person even angrier at you.

, It can be a bit tricky, but if you can gradually build up positive experiences and interactions with a person you don't like, you can change your own attitude and make it easier to deal with that person long-term. Even brief positive interactions are better than none at all.


If possible, switch settings to more neutral grounds when trying to create positive experiences. If you continually interact with each other in the same setting, the setting itself could contribute to an overall mood of hostility.

, When all else fails, try letting the person you don't like know what your boundaries are and politely coax them into abiding by those boundaries. If someone crosses the line, firmly but kindly ask him or her to stop. Chances are, if the person does not mean to be malicious, he or she will be willing to ease off some if you ask politely.


There are tactful ways to go about this. For instance, if you do not want to sacrifice a lot of time dealing with someone you don't like, you can let that person know at the start of the conversation that you only have 5 or 10 minutes to spare.
If someone you don't like does not respect the boundaries you set, you have the right to be firm about telling him or her to back off. Offer a gentle reminder at first, and if that does not work, seriously remind them and take action to show that you are serious. For instance, if that person keeps talking after you told him or her you no longer have time, repeat yourself and walk away.

, Try not to lose your temper, even if the other person intentionally pushes all your buttons and tries to work you into a fury. The moment you cave into the temptation to put that person in his or her place, you give that person the upper-hand by demonstrating a behavior that can be used against you and in his or her defense.


If your behavior is always calm, respectful, and polite, other people are more likely to believe your side of the story if a major conflict ever erupts between you and the person you have trouble with.

, Oftentimes, people are hard to deal with just because of a conflicting personalities. When you don't like someone because he or she bullies you, though, the entire situation changes. Do not let yourself become a total pushover. Push back, but just enough to communicate that you will not stand for abuse and not enough to start a conflict on your own.


Escalating the situation by becoming argumentative or defensive can make things worse. If, on the other hand, you calmly put your foot down and refuse to back down when someone tries to bully you into something you don't want, the situation may result in bad feelings on both ends, but the person in question might lose interest and stop pestering you.

, You can try every trick in the book, but sometimes, there is nothing you can do to make interacting with people you don't like any easier to tolerate. If they refuse to respect you or try to agitate you further, the best thing you can do for everyone is simply to remove yourself from the situation.


Try to be polite about it. Instead of abruptly walking away or saying that you can't stand to be around them any longer, excuse yourself and claim that you are tired or have something you need to attend to that requires you to leave early.

Let it go.",How to Deal With People Who Treat You Like a Child," Some family members may not even realize they're still treating you like a child. It's hard for older adults in your family to let go of the thought of you being ""little girl"" or ""little boy,"" even if you're well into adulthood. Therefore, you need to broach the topic with them and help them understand what you're feeling.Start with your feelings. That is, use an ""I"" statement to describe how you're feeling instead of a ""you"" statement that puts the blame on them. Blaming someone will put them on the defense. For instance, don't say, "" You always treat me like a little kid."" Instead, say ""I feel upset when you still treat me like a child. I've grown up.""
Be specific by talking about particular statements or behaviors that bother you. For example, you could say, ""I love that you help with the kids, but I don't like when you contradict the rules that I've made."" You could also say, ""I respect your rules when I'm in your house, but I don't like being asked where I am every second of every day.""
Tell them what you expect. For instance, you could say, ""I would really appreciate if you would respect the rules I've set for my kids."" or ""I would appreciate it if you would treat me like any other adult who stays in your home."";
, If you're telling your mom a story, tell her what you expect from her upfront. For instance, if you're just telling her the story to give her information and you don't really want advice, let her know that.You could say, ""Mom, I need to tell you something, but I want you to promise me that you won't offer your judgment at the end. I feel like you need to know this information, but I don't want advice on my choices.""

, That is, often in communication, people are trying to maintain control. It's a power struggle. Often, this type of communication pops up between a parent and an adult child, or even another type of relationship, such as an aunt and niece or nephew. The ""adult"" still wants to control the adult child, even if that person doesn't realize it. If you're the adult child, you may want to struggle to ""win"" in this situation. However, often letting go of the power struggle can lead to a healthier relationship.This type of power struggle can make people defensive. You probably feel defensive when another adult in your family, whether it be a parent, aunt, guardian, or grandparent, does it to you.
However, by truly listening and letting go of the power struggle, you can cut through some of that defensiveness and both parties can feel more heard and valued.

, Sometimes, parents and other family members have trouble respecting boundaries because they still see you as a little kid they have a right to rule over. In that case, you need to politely but firmly set boundaries with them because you have your own life now.For instance, say your parents tend to just show up at your house unannounced. You could say, ""We love having you here, but we'd appreciate it if you gave us some advanced notice. Sometimes, we have our family time planned, and we need that time to strengthen and grow together.""
Another way you could address an issue is to say, ""I understand that you are concerned about when we're having children. However, it may be some time before we decide to do so. I will definitely let you know when we're thinking about it. Until then, I would appreciate it if you stop asking about it.""

, Often, parents, guardians, and other adults still treat teens like kids because they can't see how you've matured. One sign of maturity is being honest with your family members, both about big and small things.Partly, that means that you are upfront about things. Don't lie by saying you're going to the library when you're going to your friend's house. Don't fib about how much homework you have. Every lie, no matter how small, cuts down on how much your parents trust you.
It also means opening up about your life. If you can talk about what you're thinking and feeling with your parents, that can help them see how you've matured and what your priorities are.

, If you're growing up, that means you can have an honest talk about trust. If you feel like your parents or other adults who are responsible for you don't trust you, it's a good time to ask them why they don't trust you or if you did something to break their trust.Ask the person or persons for a good time to talk. When you sit down, just get it out in the open. Say something like, ""Sometimes, I feel like you don't trust me. I've grown up a lot in the last few years, and I feel like you still think I'm a little kid.""
Ask what you can do to earn their trust. They may have specific guidelines you need to follow before they really trust you.

, If you act like a little kid, they'll treat you like a little kid. Kids break the rules. Adults are mature enough to respect their parents' or guardians' wishes and rules when living in their house.For instance, when you have a curfew, make sure to be home on time.
Make sure to do what chores they've laid out for you and your homework. If you want to be treated older, you need to realize that comes with responsibilities.

, Another way to prove to the adults in your family that you're mature is to show how responsible you are. Being responsible means doing what you say you're going to do when you say you're going to do it. It means the adults in your family can depend on you to be as good as what you promise.Make sure you follow through when you say you're going to do something.
It can also help to take on responsibilities without being asked. Do the dishes without your mother nagging you. Mow the lawn before your dad has a chance to.
Take care of the things you need to take care of. For instance, get your homework done, brush your teeth and shower without being asked, and take any medications or vitamins on time.

, The reasoning behind this step may not seem so obvious. Your friends are your friends, right? Well, not always. When you pick friends that are a bad influence, such as ones who don't like school, are into drugs, or just mad at the world, your parents and family notice. Your friends have a big influence on you, so when you choose friends who aren't as mature, it can bring you down. Your family knows that, and they may treat you more as a kid when you're exhibiting this behavior., When you cry and scream, that tells your family members and guardians you're not ready to be treated as a young adult. An adult can sit down and have a reasonable conversation. Of course, everyone gets upset sometimes. However, when you get upset, you need to learn how to calm yourself down and have an even conversation with the person you're upset with.Sometimes, just taking a break can help calm you down. If you feel yourself getting angry, ask the person you're talking to if you can take a few minutes for yourself to calm down before you move on with the conversation.
You can also channel your feelings. Put those feelings into your art or writing instead of into yelling at other people.

, Apologizing is hard for everyone. No one likes to admit they've been in the wrong. However, when you've broken someone's trust, such as your parents' trust, it's important to apologize to them of your own free will. Apologizing goes a long way to rebuilding bridges and showing that you've matured.Start by acknowledging what you did wrong. ""I know going out last night without your permission was wrong. I know you just worry about me and want to be safe.""
Apologize without trying to explain away your actions. For instance, say ""I'm sorry for doing that."" NOT ""I'm sorry for doing that, but I was just so mad you wouldn't let me go to the party.""
Be sincere. People know when you're not being sincere. Make sure you can be sincere when you offer your apology.

, Some people are just condescending. They don't necessarily mean to be, but it may come across to you like they're treating you like a child or a novice in the field. One way to combat this type of person is to actually listen to what they're saying, as well as listen to what's under the words.Listening to what the other person is trying to convey and then helping them know that you've truly heard that can open the door to more fruitful conversations.
One way you can show you're listening is to ask insightful questions that are relevant to what the other person is saying.
You can also nod and use your body language to show you are hearing what the other person is saying.

, In many cases, any advice they may be giving you or the way they treat you may be about them. In other words, the things they say to you in a patronizing tone are really meant for themselves.When you find you're being treated like a child, try to take a step back. Take a deep breath and ask yourself if what they're saying has some merit or if it's more about the other person's strengths and weaknesses.

, Sometimes, tone is hard to convey, especially in an email or text message. If you feel like someone is being condescending, consider whether it could be taken another way. If it can, maybe let it slide this time.Try to push for communication in person. That way, you're less likely to misinterpret the person's tone., At work, this step can be tricky, but if the person you're communicating with is generally amenable, you can give it a try. The person may not even be aware that they are doing it, so calling them out gives them a chance to fix their actions.Be polite and unemotional. Address what you think the issue is without trying to blame the other person.
For example, you could say, ""I appreciate you explaining that to me, but I already know how to do it.""
Another way you could confront the issue is to say, ""I don't like wasting time, and since I already know how to do that, can we move on?"" or ""Thanks for the email. You've explained that to me in the past, so I understand perfectly.""

, Another way to move past people who treat you like a child is to prove your maturity. In a job, that means proving that you are one hundred percent capable of getting the job done well and on time. In other situations, it may just mean ignoring the person treating you badly and then dealing with the task at hand.That means learning the skills you need to learn, even if you must put in extra hours.
It also means being on time to work and being on time when turning in your work.
In other situations, such as volunteer situations or at school meetings for you kid, you may need to just ignore the person and do what you need to do.

, Sometimes, when you're in public, someone may use a condescending tone or drop a ""dear"" at the end of a sentence when talking to you. If you run across it in public, start by being polite. In other words, don't rise to the bait. Simply go by your own rules of politeness, and move on with the conversation.Most of the time, the person probably doesn't even realize they're being condescending or treating you like a child. Snapping at them won't help the situation.

, Sometimes, you may find yourself in a situation where you should be the one having the conversation with the ""expert,"" but instead, that expert is having it with someone else right in front of you. A prime example of this situation is when a mechanic addresses the husband about the wife's car when the wife is standing right there and should be the one in the discussion.The best way to deal with this type of situation is to ask a question that the person has to directly address, meaning the person needs to talk to you.
For example, you could ask, ""I understand what you're saying about the timing belt, but don't you think my spark plugs also need to be changed? They were last changed 20,000 miles ago.""

, If someone is being patronizing, it may be that they have just gotten into a rut of explaining things to everyone who walks in the door, especially in technical jobs or fields. One way to change the conversation is to use a little humor to jostle the person out of their standard explanation.For example, when someone says, ""You need to make sure you change your oil every 3,000 miles,"" you could say, ""Just like going in for tune up at the doctor, right?""

, Sometimes, when it's a stranger who's treating you like a child, you just have to let it go and move on. You'll probably never see that person again, and holding on to that anger isn't helping you at all."

Consider whether the email is meant to be rude.,

Consider the root.,
Enlist the help of a friend.,
Acknowledge their rudeness.,

Delete it, if necessary.,
Continue to be productive.,
Set small goals to keep your momentum.,
Distract yourself.,
Consider reporting them, if necessary.",How to Deal with Rude Emails," It can be difficult to tell whether or not someone is being rude over email, especially since you can’t see their facial expressions or hear the tone of their voice to help you decide. Before your react to an email that seems rude to you, consider whether the rudeness might be a miscommunication.


Try asking the person directly what they meant by talking with them face-to-face or over the phone. This may help to head off a problem due to a simple miscommunication.;
, Though it can be tempting to immediately begin stringing together a slew of mean or hurtful words in response to this email, avoid doing so at all costs. You will likely regret it later. Instead, step away from the email, close your browser, and take a few moments to collect your thoughts.Take a walk for a few minutes until you feel calm.
Take a few deep breaths and drink some water.

, Another way to get out some negative energy constructively is to draft an email to the person, but don’t send it. That way, you can begin collecting your initial thoughts, no matter how intense, while also giving yourself time to later refine, hone, and add to them.Pull up a separate email and type a response without ever having inputted a recipient so you don’t accidentally send it out. Or you can list your own email as the recipient.
Think of all the times that you have reacted to something immediately and then later regretted all of the clever or thought-provoking things you could have said. This will give you time to develop such and prevent regret.

, In reading the email, you might have construed it as rude because part of it is true, and the truth can hurt. Though this does not relieve them of their guilt in the situation, it does give you some space for self-improvement and for honesty, both with yourself and with the email sender.For instance, perhaps your boss sent you a rude email about being late for work. Though the wording did not need to be rude, you should acknowledge and rectify your lateness.

, When someone is rude to you, it can be all too tempting to return the favor. Again, refrain from responding negatively, but also refrain from passive aggressive or rude behavior should you see them in person before you respond. Don’t give them dirty glances or ignore them if they speak to you.Instead, practice kindness. Say hello to them and keep walking.
Don’t spend time around them unless necessary but don’t actively avoid them, either.

, Sometimes, a rude email has very little to do with you or the circumstances surrounding it. Lashing out at someone is never okay, but sometimes the person who sent the email might be going through a bit more than they can handle and could have sent you that out of frustrations that don’t involve you. They may not even realize they have been rude. This does not excuse them, but understanding a person’s current state and motivations can help in taking steps forward.For instance, if they are having marital problems or if someone in their family has recently died, this could explain their rudeness.
It is also possible that they are just having a bad day.

, Friends or coworkers can be particularly helpful in helping you craft a response to a rude or nasty email, and they can also provide a second opinion on the situation. During this time, refrain from asking your friends who are hotheaded to assist; reach out to those instead who are calm, clever and solution-focused.If possible, ask to see any past responses to rude emails that they have sent.

, When you are drafting your email, it will be necessary for you to acknowledge how rude they were. It could be that they were unaware that their words would come off as callous, but regardless, you should bring attention to it.Say something like “before I begin with a response, I do want to acknowledge the rudeness displayed in your email, particularly surrounding your accusatory and insulting remarks.”
Being direct is helpful for you and for the other person and it can help to prevent a reoccurrence of the same situation.

, Though their email was rude, perhaps their frustration was coming from a very real place. If so, acknowledge that frustration and express understanding, if only marginal. This will allow them to feel less of a you vs. them mentality and move you both towards potential peace-making.Say something like “Your email indicated that you are frustrated.”
Be sure to focus on what their email said and not them personally.

, Sometimes, however, you may be completely clueless as to why someone has decided to send you such an email after much self-reflection and consultation of others. In this event, you should ask the sender a simple ‘why’ so that you can gain understanding and better address the issue.You might say “I have thought carefully about your email and am still a bit confused at your rationale in sending it, so I would like to know what prompted it.”

, Once you have addressed some of your preliminary concerns and points in the email, you should begin seeking solutions and responding to their concerns, if those are present. Let them know what you are willing to do, explore areas for compromise, and express your willingness to work through this.Setting up a meeting could be beneficial as well. People tend to be kinder in person than when hiding behind a computer screen.
You might say something like “you expressed anger that I came back from lunch 15 minutes late yesterday, but I had to pick up my sick daughter from school. Though I can certainly try to make it back on time in the future, there will be times like this that are unavoidable.”

, After you have successfully offered solutions, it is now time to establish some ground rules for any continued conversation. Let them know that you will not tolerate such rudeness in the future and doing such will make it very difficult if not impossible to continue to work together cooperatively.Tell them you will not accept insults or inappropriate accusations.
Ask them to come to you with concerns and with kindness before jumping the gun.

, You might find that you read and reread the email over and over and are getting caught up in negative feelings about it. However, this will not help you to move forward and will likely only make you more mad and frustrated. If absolutely necessary, delete the email from your inbox so that you don’t have access to it.If you think you might need the email again in the future, then send it to someone you trust but delete it from your own inbox.

, Though this email may seemingly have ruined your day, do all within your power to disallow that. Continue on with your routine, make a to-do list, and complete all necessary tasks. Don’t let one blip derail your day or your progress.Keeping yourself busy will help you to stay focused on what is important to you and avoid ruminating on one email.

, In keeping your routine, set small, achievable goals that you can commit to that day. Completing them will help you feel more accomplished and subsequently less affected by the rude email that you received.Consider setting goals like “respond to all other emails” or “go to the gym.”

, Sometimes, in order to move forward from something, you need a bit of distraction. Take a break to listen to music, have lunch, or call a friend to chat about something other than the email. Getting your mind off of things can give you a very necessary and cathartic break.

, At the end of the day, sometimes the best way to move forward is to handle the issue permanently. If the email contained any threats or any insults that could be considered as hate speech, then report this person to the right people, which could be the HR Department at your job or Student Conduct at your school. You can also block them from sending you emails in the future.


Report them to the authorities if they are making physical threats against you.

Plan for an apology if you realize you've done something wrong. Even if this person should have given you some type of courtesy, it is always better to take the upper road.
Practice different meditating techniques if it is hard for you to reflect.;
, Invite her into a conversation. If she is trying to ignore you and you invite her into a public conversation, she might feel obliged to participate. Not many people want to be revealed in public as ignoring someone.

, If she sees you making an effort, she may speak to you again. Acting rudely towards her will only create a larger, convoluted feud.

, Plan on a time where you know that both of you are free. If you pick an inopportune time, she could get more frustrated.

, Sometimes people don't even realize they are ignoring someone. Life can get overwhelming. Being upfront and direct to this person should give you some information. Don't be overly rude when confronting her.

, This could be hard for some of you, but to open yourself up to this person could solve everything. Exposing your feelings is a vulnerable process and could potentially hurt you. Reveal yourself, but don't tell her everything.

, Some people just need time away from you. It can be helpful to avoid an argument and instead have a relaxed conversation.

, Creating a tense confrontation will only lead to a longer period of turmoil with her.

, Try to convey your message through somebody else. Sometimes you just can't get through to the person ignoring you. In some situations, it helps to have an outside party help resolve the issue. Choose a person who is friends with both of you, but stays neutral. You could also use a friendly acquaintance to help settle things if they are willing.

, Take the power out of their rudeness, by not showing that it's affecting you.Make it their problem, not yours.

, Think of him as a metaphorical wall that isn't necessarily in your way, but it's there.

, If he doesn't want to associate with you for any number of reasons, then don't associate with him. By ignoring him, he might take notice of your actions. This is also a good way of keeping your cool. Even if it is tearing you up inside, this can be an effective solution over time.

, Some people simply need space from their friends. It might not seem justified, but a lot of people will ignore you if they feel like it. It can be the most painful and frustrating seat to be in, but just give it time.

, You can't always change someone's mood to being polite if they want to be rude.Sometimes it's the best option to let him figure out what he needs to figure out on his own.

, Try to spend time developing three lists: your strengths, your achievements, and something you admire about yourself.You might want to get a trusted family member to help you with this. Keep this list in a safe place, and read it when you're feeling down.

, Make sure you are taking care of yourself. Pay particular attention to your hairstyle, your nail length, and your teeth., You'll be surprised how much of your mental health can strengthen from a clean living situation. Focus on your room itself. You could even ask someone to help you rearrange the furniture in your room., Get involved with an activity like: painting, music, poetry, or dance.Engaging yourself with artistic activities will improve your self-expression and strengthen your sense of mastery. This will translate to more positive interactions with others., Participating in a volunteer organization within your community can be a very positive experience. Making a difference builds your positive opinion of yourself., A lot of insecurities about other people arise from our self-esteem. Try to separate your feelings from the reality of the situation. This won't be easy because we're typically emotional beings, but try to see the circumstance from an unbiased opinion. You could try different writing exercises to help your ideas flow.

, If you are having a hard time being ignored there are people who can help. Therapists or school guidance councilors advise people in your position all the time. You may want to try a school guidance councilor first because they won't cost you anything.

, The friends you had before you started being ignored are probably still your friends. If things feel awkward because you've been more involved with other friends, then just be honest with them.


Do an activity that you both use to enjoy.

, Share your fears, flaws, and insecurities.Being vulnerable is a difficult feeling to experience with someone, but it can create a close bond between people. You could even go back and forth telling each other difficult things from your past.

, The more avenues you have for communication, the better.It can be difficult in today's world to stay on top of all the ways we communicate. Keep a regular scan of your social media sites and your phone for your friends.

, It is okay to call your friend just to call your friend. Try asking for serious advice or simply share something meaningful that happened to you recently., If your friend is going through something, then you should make time for that person. No one likes a one-sided friendship. If you have plans, then try to work around them or let your prior obligations know that something important has come up.

Listen.,
Try to understand where the other person is coming from.,
See if you can agree on something.",How to Deal With People Who Strongly Disagree With You1," Though tensions may be high in a disagreement, and you may chomping at the bit to explain your side, listening to the person explain their point of view will help keep the conversation calm. You will also be better able to understand their side.


Focus on what the other person is saying instead of planning your response to their argument.Ask questions. Probe deeper to understand their beliefs. You could ask, “How did you come to feel that way?” or “Did your parents have the same opinion?”
A significant part of active listening is nonverbal behavior. Maintaining eye contact, nodding, and squaring your body toward the person communicate both interest and respect toward the person.;
, People often have different points of view because they have had different life experiences that have shaped them. If you can put yourself in the other person’s shoes, you may better be able to understand where they are coming from.Practice empathy. Think about how it would feel to be the other person and try to understand how they came to their point of view. For example, your friend may be against expanding welfare benefits because his mother worked two jobs, providing for them so they wouldn’t need to rely on food stamps. Your friend has the experience of seeing how it was possible to succeed without relying on welfare, and that has shaped his point of view.
Paraphrase. Repeat what the other person told you, using slightly different words, to show you are listening to them, as well as to help clarify what you are hearing. For example, if they say, “I grew up poor, and I did just fine without help,” you could say, “It sounds like you were really self-reliant.”

, Consider if there are any points in the other person’s argument that you have in common. Let them know what they are to build common ground.


For example, you may be against abortion and you are talking to someone who is pro-choice. They may say they wish there was better sex education in schools so that kids understand the risk and impact of teen pregnancy, and you happen to agree. You could say, “I agree with you that we need to do a better job of teaching teenagers about the dangers of unprotected sex and the risk of pregnancy.”

Stay calm.,
Be respectful.,
Acknowledge you value the person, just disagree on ideas.,
Use facts instead of emotions.,
Try to not take it personally.,
Ensure you are speaking only for yourself.,
Believe in yourself.,
Agree to disagree.",How to Deal With People Who Strongly Disagree With You2," Look at the disagreement as a discussion to exchange points of view, rather than an argument to win. Resist the urge to raise your voice. As soon as things become heated and emotional, people become more entrenched in their corners and be less likely to agree on anything.The secret to staying calm is maintaining normal breathing and relaxation in the body. Breathing deeply with your diaphragm (so that your belly expands when you inhale, not your chest), can trigger your parasympathetic nervous system, which is calming. Avoid holding or shortening your breaths, pacing, or clenching your hands or jaw (or any other forms of muscle tension).
When a discussion becomes an argument, there’s no more logic or reasoning, it just becomes a fight to win. If you are trying to convince someone of something they don’t believe, arguing with them will not help anything. They will only become more convinced of their own position.Ask the other person to lower their voice if things become heated. You could say, “Michael, would you mind not yelling? We’re just having a disagreement, I don’t want it to turn into a full-scale fight.”

, Just because somebody doesn’t agree with you doesn’t mean that they are inferior to you, or that they don’t deserve to be treated fairly. If you find yourself struggling to respect their point of view, consider how they may have arrived at this opinion.


Don’t name-call or demean them. Don’t hit below the belt and escalate to an emotional argument. Stay civil.
Respect their ideas. Acknowledge that their ideas include valid points, though you do not have to agree with them. You could say, “I think you made a good point when you said…” or “Your comment definitely gives me some food for thought.”, In situations where you still need to interact with a person following a disagreement (family gatherings, work discussions), you may find it helpful to maintain a civil relationship by pointing out that your disagreement is not person-based but issue-based. Try to articulate this during your discussion. It will help both of you refrain from getting emotional.


You could say, “John, I want to say from the outset that my disagreement on how you handled this project isn’t about your work. You’re a hard worker and I value your contribution to the company. I do feel like you took this report in the wrong direction, and I wanted to get your point of view.”
Another way you can communicate this is by showing an interest in this person that is outside of the topic of the argument. Ask them about their day, their work or family, etc.

, An emotional argument is a weak argument. “I don’t like him because he’s mean,” is based on a feeling and not a fact. “I don’t like him because he bullied me on three separate occasions” is concrete and helps you further your argument. Make sure your facts are well-sourced. Not all websites created equal. When pulling facts off the internet, make sure they come from credible sources. One method is to see if you can find the same information from three separate sources.

, In many cases, an argument is not about who you are as a person, it is about an opinion or belief. Try to distance yourself (and the other person) from what you think and feel about an issue. It’s only one aspect of who you are, it is not your whole self.Disagreements will not necessarily damage your relationship with the other person, especially if you debate respectfully and don’t let it get emotional.Of course, things are different if someone is arguing with you about who you are — your sexuality or your religion, for example. This is a personal attack and likely not something you want to engage in. You could say, “I’m not defending my faith to you, it’s very personal and not something I am arguing about.”

, When you argue your opinion, make sure you are using “I” language, not “we” language. Even if you know others in your community agree with you, the use of “we” may feel that your opponent feels ganged up upon.For example, you may be active in the LGBTQ community, and you are discussing transgender youth with someone. While “We believe that trans youth are marginalized and need extra support,” may be a true statement, it might sound better to say, “I know that the trans community is working hard to reach trans youth, because they need so much support.” When you have familiarity with a community, it is better to draw on them for expertise rather than a silent “we” army to back you up.

, Believe in the integrity of your opinion. Don’t back down just because someone disagrees with you. While it can sometimes be extremely difficult to speak up for what you believe in, don’t be afraid to share your truth. Take a deep breath and be brave.Don’t bottle up your feelings for sake of politeness. You may be the type of person who doesn’t want to rock the boat or stir the pot, but it is good to express your disagreement from time to time. Otherwise, it’s likely that all that frustration will come out all at once in a big blow-up.Acknowledge it is difficult for you to speak up, and people might give you more space to express yourself. You could say, “I usually don’t contribute to discussions like this because it’s hard for me to express myself sometimes, but I wanted to say….”

, If you seem to be going in circles (or nowhere), you two might want to let it lie. Let it go with a smile and change the subject.


You could say, “Well, it’s been interesting having this debate with you, but I don’t think we’re making any headway here. We could run for office with this kind of record!”
If the other person seems insistent on continuing the discussion, you could say, “Could I take a rain check? I think we’ve got ourselves going in circles right now. Maybe another time.”

"
"
Change the subject.,
Pick your battles.,
Set limits.",How to Deal With People Who Strongly Disagree With You3," You don’t need to argue for your point of view all the time. You might be tired, or feel like the discussion with this person never gets anywhere, so you can decide to change the subject and not engage the contentious topic.For example, your conservative uncle wants to pick apart your liberal beliefs for the umpteenth time, and it is never an enjoyable discussion. You could say, “You know what, Uncle Bill? Let’s talk about something other than politics today. I heard you’re remodeling your kitchen. How’s that going?” Most of the time, people get the hint that you don’t want to talk about it.

, You don’t always need to jump into every argument. If you are at a family dinner and someone states an opinion you disagree with, for example, you don’t need to engage it. Just let their opinion lie there and move on.Pay attention to your surroundings and environment. Notice if you are engaging in a heated argument at an inappropriate time (like in front of children at a family dinner) or in someone else’s space, or are there bystanders who may be being forced to bear witness to the argument and may be uncomfortable.
If you are talking to someone one-on-one and they bring up a contentious issue, you can just let them talk about it without arguing back. Listen politely and nod. If they ask you what you think, and you don’t wish to engage, you could just shrug and say, “Oh, I don’t know.”, If the person is berating you or making offensive statements, end the conversation immediately. Do not let it escalate into a fight.


If you are uncomfortable with the language the other person is using (for example, using too much profanity, or using racist/bigoted language), you could say, “Look, I’m happy to debate this topic with you, but you need to stop with the swearing.”
If the argument escalates to a place that is too uncomfortable for you, you could put your hand up and say, “Okay, I think we need to end this conversation. I’m going to walk away now before things get worse,” and get some space between you and the other person.

Try to empathize with someone who treats you poorly.,
Take deep breaths and stay calm.,
Try to maintain relaxed body language.,
Be a good listener, to a point.,
Stay away from the person who treats you poorly.,
Pick your battles.,
Use humor.,
Change the subject.,
Be proactive, rather than reactive.,
Get help from others if the conflict gets out of control.",How to Deal With Nasty People," Though this may be difficult to do, showing empathy towards the person can help to turn a potential conflict into a more friendly discussion. Rather than react with anger or annoyance, you can try asking the person questions that are empathetic. Showing concern toward the person could be disarming and make them feel they actually have someone they can talk to, rather than simply be mean to.For example, you may be around a person who asks hurtful, pointed questions at work. They may do this to you or to others. Rather than get upset or angry at them, you may pull them aside and ask, “Are you okay?” or “What’s going on with you?” Getting sincere attention and concern from someone could be what they need to actually open up and be less aggressive or mean.;
, If you are around someone who treats you poorly on a constant basis, then try to learn techniques for maintaining your cool around the person. Take deep, cleansing breaths when you start to get annoyed or frustrated. Focus on staying calm because getting upset or angry may give the unkind person more motivation to be mean.You may try doing five minutes of silent meditation in a quiet place at home or in your office to relax and calm down.
Or, you can try deep breathing. Close your eyes and take a deep breath from your diaphragm for a count of five. Then, exhale slowly for a count of five. Repeat this several times until you feel calm and refreshed.

, Focus on maintaining relaxed body language when you are around someone who treats you poorly. Getting tense and anxious around the person will only make you more upset and unsettled.Keep your hands at your sides and stand with your shoulders rolled back. Also, try to maintain eye contact with the person, though you may not want to stare or pay too much attention to the person. Maintaining eye contact can cause the person to engage with you for a longer period of time.

, Make an effort to be a good listener when the mean person speaks. Showing attention to the person could help to avoid a conflict by showing them that you are interested in what they have to say. However, if the person continues to be nasty toward you or toward others, you may eventually decide to keep your distance and tune them out.For example, if the person makes a mean comment about someone or complains about their day, you may ask, ""Why do you feel that way?"" or ""Is there anything that went well during your day? Tell me about it.""
Set limits and boundaries around how often you listen to someone who treats you poorly or engage with them. You may have a particular subject that you are sensitive about and choose to leave the conversation if the person who treats you poorly starts being mean or unkind about that subject. Or you may tune out once the person starts to speak unkindly about someone you know.

, Perhaps the easiest way to avoid conflicts with someone who treats you poorly is to make an effort to stay away from them. You may avoid them by taking a different route to school or by spending time in a different lunchroom at work. You may also keep your door closed at home if the person who treats you poorly lives with you.If you cannot simply stay away from the person on a daily basis, make an effort to keep your distance. Putting some space between you and the person could reduce the likelihood of you having to deal with the nasty person.

, You should also take a moment to consider if it is worth having a discussion with the person before you launch right in. Picking your battles will ensure that if you do end up in a conflict with the person, it feels worthwhile and important.Ask yourself, is what the nasty person all that important, in the grand scheme of things? Is it worth confronting the person over this issue? If the answer is “no” to these questions, you may be better off avoiding the conflict all together.

, Humor can help to diffuse and disarm a conflict with someone who treats you poorly. Making a joke to lighten the mood can force the person to pause and consider their actions. It can also relieve any tension in the room due to the presence of someone who treats you poorly.You may tell a joke to respond to the person in a light, funny way. Or you may tell a funny story if the person who treats you poorly asks a mean question in a group or says something unkind. Humor can act as a distraction and a deflection, especially around people who treat you poorly.
For example, maybe the person makes a snide or rude comment about a co-worker to you. You may then use humor to deflect the poor attitude of the person by saying, ""Well, I think we all have a rough time on Mondays"", or you may simply make a joke about yourself to diffuse the situation by saying, ""I know I struggle with clients, especially the quiet ones.""
Be careful not to direct the humor at the person who is treating you poorly. This may cause the person to feel threatened and lash out at you.

, You can also diffuse conflicts with the person by quickly changing the subject or discussing another topic. Avoid getting defensive or angry at the person’s remark. Instead, shift the conversation to a new topic or ignore the person and discuss a different subject with someone else in the group. Ignoring the person will deny them the attention they are seeking and signal to the person that their behavior is not acceptable.For example, if the person who treats you poorly asks you a pointed question, such as “What is up with your hair today?” or “Your outfit is a mess”, you may ignore them and turn to the person next to you. Doing this will signal to someone who treats you poorly that you do not wish to get into a conflict with them and do not appreciate their attitude towards you.

, Rather than get upset or angry at the person, a reactive response, consider how you can be proactive about the situation. Being proactive can give you more power in the situation and show the person who treats you poorly that you are not rattled by their attitude. You can be proactive by standing your ground in an argument or conflict and letting the person know you are not okay with their tone or attitude towards you.For example, if the person who treats you poorly starts to analogize you with mean comments or questions, you may say, “I am not going to put up with your tone of voice or your attitude. I don’t appreciate being spoken to in a nasty way. Let me know when you are able to be civil and we can continue this discussion then.”

, If the person who treats you poorly continues to be mean or unkind to you, or to others around you, you may need to reach out for help from others. You may need to enlist the help of other co-workers, other peers, or other family members. You may also reach out for professional help, such as a counselor at your school or a family therapist. Getting help will ensure you have the support you need to deal with someone who treats you poorly in a healthy way.For example, you may decide to talk to your co-workers about a worker who is acting nasty or mean. You may say, ""Have you all noticed that Barb is acting inappropriately?""
You may also lodge a complaint about the person with your company's HR representative so you can get support and help when dealing with this person.

Decide if you should care.,
Take a look at yourself.,
Disengage.,
Let go of the need for approval.,
Focus on the positive things.",How to Deal With People Who Don't Like You1," Not everyone who crosses your path is someone you should seek out as a friend. If a coworker or someone you aren't invested in dislikes you, it may not be pleasant, but you can decide if it's worth it to try to build the necessary bridges and win them over. Not everyone is worth your effort, especially if they are really difficult and you lose nothing by avoiding them., Did you make a mistake? Does the person have a legitimate reason to dislike you? It might be worth it to apologize and try to set the record straight about your behaviors if you think they might be justified in not liking something you did or are doing.Admitting a mistake is different from beating yourself up about it. Everyone makes mistakes. It's important to forgive yourself, even if the other person doesn't.

, Don't be afraid to say goodbye if the person is actively trying to hurt you. It's okay to prioritize yourself in these situations and remove yourself from the crosshair. Sometimes people rub each other the wrong way and there's nothing to be done but avoid each other, especially if the situation is getting out of control and you are getting hurt.It can be tempting sometimes to stay and fight, but disengaging is its own form of power. You are standing up for yourself and telling the person that you refuse to be bullied.
Disengaging might be avoiding them when it's acceptable to do so, like if you're coworkers but you aren't collaborating on anything. It might also be removing the person from your social media feeds so that you aren't tempted to interact with them.

, How important is it that this person likes you? Are there other people who do like you? Friends and family? Avoid worrying about one person who has a problem with you, which could be about their own issues rather than anything to do with you.Some people will dislike you because they envy you. Don't let people bring you down because of your successes.

, If you're feeling down about someone disliking you, do something to help yourself feel better. If you love working out, go to the gym to get your mind off of things. If you have friends who appreciate you, spend time with them to remind yourself of your self-worth. This doesn't have to bother you if you don't let it.If you know why the person dislikes you, ask yourself if it's really important that they like you. Does it really matter what they think? Do they dislike a lot of people? You may not be ""special"" in that case.
You can also try reframing the criticism to make it positive. If someone says you're always late or always asking people for favors, try to think of ways you could improve in those areas. Alternatively, if you think the person is wrong, try to think of all the times you're not late and the times you do favors for other people.

"
"
Ask questions.,
Avoid getting defensive.,
Hear the person out.,
Take a break.,
Communicate your feelings.",How to Deal With People Who Don't Like You2," If the relationship is one you want or need to improve, start by asking the person why he or she doesn't like you. There could be a huge misunderstanding behind everything, and you could receive valuable information about how the person perceives you (which isn't necessarily how you actually are).


Try asking in a way that isn't confrontational. Instead of saying ""what's your problem?"" you can say ""did I do something to make you dislike me?""

, It's natural to want to fight fire with fire, but if someone is expressing frustration with something you are doing, it can be helpful to take a pause and do your best to respond to the situation calmly, rather than making things worse by charging into battle.Avoid snapping at them or returning the criticism. You can probably think of things that you dislike about them as well, but being mean to them won't resolve the situation. Criticizing the person will only cause the conflict to get more intense.
Practice deep breathing while they are talking to keep yourself from getting upset and firing back.
It's okay to take a temporary time out and come back to the person once you have cooled off, as well.

, If you talk to them, let them finish their thoughts before you jump in. You may not like what they are saying, but if you want to repair the relationship, you will need to know what you are dealing with, and you will gain their respect if you respect them enough to listen before you respond. You may even gain some valuable constructive criticism in the process.You can say ""I understand that there's something about me you don't like. I'm genuinely interested to hear what that is and see if we can move past this issue together.""

, Sometimes people get on each other's nerves because they are spending too much time around each other, for example coworkers or friends of friends. If you work with the person, do your best to limit contact for a while. If you spend a lot of the time around the same people, try to see other friends or catch these friends while the other person isn't around. Time apart can help people reset, and they may like you more when they see you again., A good way to correct misunderstandings is to let the other person know how you feel. Try to do this in a respectful and emotionally neutral way. Clearing the air may be just what the situation needs to get the person on your side, rather than stewing in their dislike of you.Using ""I statements"" is a good way to communicate without making the person feel like they are being attacked. You can say ""I feel hurt that you don't like me and I'd like to know what I can do to make things better between us.""

Prevent the situation from spiraling out of control.,
Check in with friends.,
Try to win the person over.",How to Deal With People Who Don't Like You3," If someone dislikes you, they may gossip about you to mutual friends or try to hurt you in other ways. If it's a coworker, sit down with your boss and explain that you are having a disagreement with the person, so your boss will be on the lookout for attempts to sabotage your standing at the job. If it's a mutual friend, explain your position and try to get them to see your side of things. Avoid bad-mouthing the person!, If someone dislikes you, they may try to find out your secrets in order to hurt you. Be careful what you say to someone who dislikes you. Avoid gossiping about other people around them, because they might use that information against you. Protect yourself by keeping your cards close to your chest and not allowing them to use anything you say to hurt you. If it's a coworker, try to avoid messing up on the job around them, which may come back to bite you.If the person who dislikes you is a former friend, they may already know a lot that could hurt you. If you think they are going to share something that could make you look bad, you can always share the information first, if you would rather have control of how it comes out.

, Sometimes it's worth it to apologize to someone who dislikes you, especially if you've done something to offend them. Even if you think you didn't do anything wrong, it may be helpful to apologize in order to keep the situation from getting worse. You can do it for you, rather than for them, although you never know how it might affect their opinion of you in a positive way., If the person is causing you to doubt yourself, ask your friends what they think about the situation if they know the person. Getting a second opinion, especially from people you trust, can help to prevent you from taking the perspective of the other person and being really hard on yourself. Being disliked can make you wonder if they are right about you, so it's important to be aware of how it's affecting you. Don't let your mental health suffer from it., Sometimes all it takes to repair a friendship or working relationship is to show the person your good will. Going out of your way to do something for people has a lot of benefits. Kindness reduces stress and promotes longer, healthier living.Additionally, if you are kind to the person in spite of their dislike toward you, it may inspire them to change their mind about you.


Watch out for people who will manipulate your kindness, however. Some people feed off of using people who are not willing to protect themselves against aggressive or manipulative behavior. If they accept your kindness and then return it with selfishness or rudeness, it may be best to avoid them rather than try to win them over."

Keep a level head.,
Accept yourself.,
Avoid confrontation.,
Respect homophobes, even if they don't respect you.,
Accept that not everyone is going to come around.",How to Deal With Homophobes1," Don't feed intolerance; don't let sharp words poke holes in your spirit. Maintain your own balance, and keep your mind unclouded by anger, fear, and hate. You cannot always change what others think of you, but you can always control how you react.


Let homophobic rhetoric defeat itself. If onlookers see that you can remain calm in the face of adversity, the homophobic person will start to come across as the crazy one.;
, Realize that this is the way you work. You can't ""pray the gay away."" You are a human being who feels love and/or sexual attraction to someone of the same gender, or you are a person who identifies as a gender other than the one assigned at birth – and that is 100% okay. Love is love, and you are worthy of all the love you can handle. Love yourself, and keep telling yourself that it's okay to be yourself, even if some days you don't believe it.


At times you feel particularly down on yourself, take time aside from the chaos. Go to a bathroom. Look in the mirror and say ""I am valid. My name is ______, and I am ___(sexual orientation, gender, whatever is in question)___. And I am valid."" A little reassurance often helps, even if it comes from yourself.

, Don't engage the homophobe, and ignore the offences until you can get away. If you are a member of the LGBTQ community and you come across someone homophobic, it may be best to pretend as though you haven't heard anything. Go about your business as usual, and don't feed the negativity. Do not hesitate to take action, however, if this person is harassing or hurting someone else.


You have every right to stand up for what you believe in, but some homophobic people may behave irrationally towards the subject. Feeding a confrontation may not do either of you any good.
If avoiding a confrontation is not viable, remember to keep calm. As the tension rises, the homophobe may act angry or say things that don't make sense. Try not to resort to basic insults; instead, back up your points with reasonable facts or opinions.
Be especially careful if you live with homophobes. Fighting back can get you getting kicked out, or put you in a dangerous situation. If you feel uncomfortable in your home, try to find a more accepting place to live.

, Be the bigger person. Whether you are LGBTQ yourself, or an ally, try to find your center in a respect for all human beings. Treat everyone with courtesy, regardless of what they say. Respecting someone does not mean that you accept their opinion as fact – it only means that you grant them their right to hold an opinion. Some people will try to take away your right to your feelings and opinions, but treating them in the same way will not restore balance.Empathize. Remember that many people were raised homophobic. Homophobia is a knee-jerk reaction for those who haven't thought through their feelings, and it can be hard to escape this sort of ingrained intolerance.
If you know that someone is a homophobe, but they don't do anything to harm or harass you, try to treat them like everyone else. If someone wants to believe that you're going to hell or that you're living a morally-repugnant lifestyle, that is their right – as long as it doesn't interfere with your right to live your own life.

, It takes time for systemic intolerance to fade, and there is only so much that one person can do to turn that tide. Try to let go. If someone won't give you the respect that you deserve, it may be time to leave this person behind and carry on with your life."

Talk to your friends and family.,
Be patient.,
Try not to put people on the defensive.,
Consider leaving toxic people behind.",How to Deal With Homophobes2," If your loved ones are expressing homophobic thoughts, consider confronting them. Have a heart-to-heart about tolerance. Explain why homophobia makes you uncomfortable, whether or not you are LGBTQ yourself. Try to help them understand why their actions might be intolerant, uninformed, or unjust.Wait for a time when they'll be receptive to what you have to say. Don't start this conversation when these people are distracted or focusing on something else. Give your words the chance to be as impactful as possible.
Be warned that this tactic won't work on everyone. Trying to educate people may only lead to more frustration. Ask yourself whether it hurts to try.

, Give people a chance to understand where you're coming from. You may have had a hard time coming to terms with your sexuality, and your family and friends might also need some time to get their heads straight. Try to remain open and non-judgmental through this process. If you are close with these people, there is a good chance that love will prevail over any discomfort. Give them time, and never stop showing love for them. You don't have to take their insults, but make sure they know you will be waiting if they change their mind., Don't say ""You are homophobic!"" even when someone is acting really homophobic, because they'll be on the defense. Instead, try saying ""What you said sounded homophobic because X implies Y. Is that really what you meant to say?"" Often, when someone gets their words put back into their faces, they will back off – or at least see how you're interpreting what they said as homophobia. Sometimes people just honestly don't know how to act around gay people because they haven't done it much.

, It's rarely easy to cut friends and family out of your life. However, at some point you may need to ask yourself whether a person's negative influence in your life outweighs their positive influence. If someone you love simply won't accept you (or won't accept someone else that you love), it may be healthier to turn your energy toward more welcoming people.


You don't need to make a big deal of removing someone from your life. All you need to do is create distance between yourself and the intolerant person. Over time, if your values diverge, your paths may diverge as well.

Learn to defend yourself.,
Report homophobic threats and violence to trustworthy authorities.",How to Deal With Homophobes3," As hard as it may be: keep your head held high, and keep on walking. The words of homophobes do not at all reflect who you are – they speak to the intolerance of the homophobe. You don't need to meet anyone's standards, and you don't need to try to be someone you're not. To conquer the haters, you must believe that you can, even though it may seem impossible at times., Homophobes can be bullies. When a homophobe is acting aggressively, you cannot show that it hurts you. All they want is a reaction. If you show a bully that they hurt you, they'll keep going because that's the reaction that they wanted in the first place. It may hurt to hear the things that they say or see the things that they do. However, if you stay strong and don't let the bully see that they've affected you negatively, there's a good chance that they'll back off., If someone shouts something homophobic at you, don't let it get to you. Try smiling and blowing a kiss at them. Don't act how they want you to act. If your reaction makes them uncomfortable, you may find it easier to laugh about the situation. Laughing off intolerance won't necessarily change the situation, but it may make it easier to carry on with your life.

, Surround yourself with friends who are accepting and unprejudiced. Standing up for what's right can be a heavy task, and it can be very draining. Make sure you have a solid support system of friends to whom you don't need to justify yourself. At the end of the day, we all need a safe place to let our guard down.

, If you don't have to see this homophobe often, or if you're feeling particularly daring: come out to them. People may try to retrace their steps to undo the intolerant things they've said. You may even change their mind. Remember that doing this may put you in danger or in a very uncomfortable situation. Consider the potential outcomes of coming out.

, Consider taking a self-defense course or studying a martial art so that you are better equipped to deal with violently intolerant people. This is especially important if you live in an area that is known for violence towards homosexuals. You never know when your self-defense knowledge might come in handy.

, If someone is legitimately violating your rights or someone else's rights, you may need to reach out for support. If you're at school, consider speaking with a teacher, a counselor, or any adult who you respect. If the situation gets bad enough, don't be afraid to involve law enforcement. Harassment is a hate crime.


For instance: if a server at a restaurant won't serve you and your significant other, tell their manager and get the owners of the establishment involved. Most places want to keep customers happy, and there are laws against discrimination. Know your rights!

Learn to say “no”.,
Don’t engage in dependent relationships.,
Create boundaries.,
Limit your contact.,
Avoid getting pulled in.,
Be honest.,
Be nice.,
Compromise.",How to Deal With Needy People," Saying “no” is empowering and allows you to be in control of your life without trying to please other people. So why is it so hard to say no? Saying no takes some practice, so start noticing when you’re fearful to say no and practice saying “no” in the mirror to get more comfortable with those words. When saying no, make it clear that you are saying no to the request, not to the individual.Don’t feel obligated to commit to something on the spot. Say, “Can I have a moment to think this decision over and get back to you?”
If someone is being pushy, be just as resolute at saying no. Say, “I know you won’t give up easily, but I am not going to change my mind.”
Know that people ask you for favors or to do projects because they believe in you. Always say “thank you for thinking of me”, even when you politely decline.;
, You may continue to have this person in your life because there’s some benefit in it for you. This person may be a romantic partner whom you live with or share finances, or you may need that person to boost you up when you feel down. You may feel fearful of this person leaving you and have a fear of abandonment, even if you’re unhappy in the relationship.Ask yourself what benefits you receive from the relationship, whether they be physical (companionship, monetary needs, sex), emotional (someone to talk to, a sense of belonging), and related to feeling dependent. Ask yourself, “Is this relationship fair to this person? Is it fair to me?”
If you have fears of abandonment, do some inner work and resolve the trauma of abandonment. You can also Find a Therapist.

, You may need to discuss appropriate boundaries with this person. Decide what boundaries you want to enforce, and ask yourself how each boundary will benefit you and the relationship. Thinking of the benefits will help you commit to keeping the boundary and not feel guilty about enforcing it.Affirm each boundary with positive statements. “Even though this person may be unhappy with this boundary, I have the right to decide how to spend my time, energy, and resources.”
You may be with a partner who always wants to hear that she is beautiful, that you love her, and that you only have eyes for him. If you’re not emotionally open or ready for that kind of relationship, let him or her know. Say, “I am not in a position to give you all of the things you want.”
Remember that you have control over your life. If someone drains you, it’s time to create some boundaries.

, While you may not be able to allow this person to exit your life (say, if it’s a co-worker or family member), you can limit your contact. Make yourself less available to this person (via text, phone, email and social media) and communicate that you would rather not spend all your time “plugged in.”


Say “I have just a few minutes before I need to go”, and politely disengage when time is up. Politely decline any time you don’t want to spend with this person. Don’t lie or make up excuses, but do communicate your position by saying “I’m unavailable” or “I’m not interested in that activity.”
If this person texts or calls you incessantly, let her or him know that it’s too much contact. Gently tell this person you don’t like to communicate at all times and would like more space.

, This person may go to you to fix his or her problems, or always seem to have some sort of crisis. If you don’t want to take this on, don’t. If you hate getting caught up in gossip or “woe is me” stories, communicate this need tactfully. Especially if you give advice and this person tends to go against it, let it go. Allow the person to make his or her own decisions without you being a factor.Say, “I don’t want to have this role in your life.”
Avoid offering solutions. Instead, offer words of empowerment, such as, “I’m sure you’ll be able to work this out on your own.”, If asked, “Why don’t we hang out anymore?”, don’t lie. There’s no use creating a lie that you will have to keep up, and it is more respectful to the person and to yourself to remain in honesty. You may feel like you are protecting yourself or the other person, but ask yourself whether there is any real benefit from lying.However, there’s no need to tell the person all the things you perceive as negative. Instead, put the focus on your own needs.


Say, “Sometimes I have difficulty being involved in the drama of other people’s lives when I have so much of my own already.”
You can also say, “It can feel really draining to be so closely involved with other people that I often need an emotional and physical break.”

, You may choose to avoid this person, not respond immediately to texts or phone calls, or slowly cut this person out of your life. Whatever you do, do so in a way that you would want to be treated if you were on the other end.There’s no need to be mean, catty, or vicious in your approach. You make these actions because you want to reclaim your life, not because you want to stir up drama or make someone feel bad.


While your decisions remain yours alone, there’s no need to tell other people about your decision to cut this person out of your life by gossiping.
Don’t “ghost”, or suddenly cut all contact without explanation. Many people find this confusing and disrespectful. You may want to tell this person that you need some space and that you will be taking a step away from your phone or e-mail.

, Find a happy medium where you feel respected and the other person also feels respected and getting his or her needs met. Compromise allows both people to find common ground in a situation.Compromise is especially important when you are dealing with a person that plays a major role in your life such as a romantic partner or family member. Communicate your needs clearly, and allow the other person to communicate needs clearly. Once you both reach a place of understanding, create compromises that can benefit both of you.


Perhaps you don’t like speaking on the phone, but it means a lot to your grandmother. You may compromise from daily phone calls to twice a week.

Name-calling
Exclusion/ostracism from a group
Threats or violence
Discrimination based on a marginalized identity (racism, sexism, ableism, etc.)
People distancing themselves from you or disagreeing with you is not mistreatment (unless they are disagreeing with your human rights).;
, Are you discussing your beliefs as a personal choice, or are you openly criticizing people's beliefs/identities? Are you allowing for the fact that people with different lifestyles from you can still be good people?

""I'm an atheist"" or ""I'm a Democrat"" are personal beliefs. ""Meat eaters are evil murderers"" or ""disabled people should not exist"" are beliefs that directly criticize others for their beliefs or identities.
Voicing beliefs that target marginalized people (women, people of color, LGBT+ people, religious minorities, etc.) can cause serious harm, and people will react to that. You can get fired for this, and people may distance themselves from you.
You are allowed to criticize others' beliefs; there is no law against it. However, if you want to do so, be prepared for pushback. This is not automatically mistreatment, although it can be if it goes too far.

, Is there a chance that they are upsetting you by accident, such as teasing about something and not realizing you dislike it? Or, are their actions malicious?

A well-meaning person will listen when you tell them how you feel, such as ""I feel upset when you poke fun at me for being a vegetarian."" A person who does not mean well will dismiss, ignore, or relish your hurt feelings.

, If you feel confused or uncertain about what's really going on, you may find it helpful to talk to a person who has good judgment. Look to a mentor who is a good listener.

There is a chance that the person will be wrong. If you don't feel heard, take time to think about why and what the problem is, or ask another person who listens better.

, If they don't seem to realize that they're upsetting you, you can express your feelings with ""I"" phrasing. Using the format ""When you _____, I feel _____"" can help you express how you feel in a clear, non-blaming way.

People who are intentionally upsetting you are not going to stop because you say you're upset.

, Keep a journal stating the facts of what happened, and how you felt. Write the date, what happened, and your reaction to it.

Be specific and factual. For example, instead of ""Bethany is a raging ableist jerk,"" write ""Bethany called me the r-word and teased about the noises my wheelchair makes. I tried to leave, but she was blocking the ramp. I wanted to curl up and stop existing."" This is clearer, and will help keep people from thinking you are name-calling and thus contributing to the conflict.

, Bullies are going to keep mistreating you, no matter what you say, so talking to them is not going to help you.

Some people like to pretend that bullying is not a big deal. If an authority figure is not taking you seriously, find another one.

, You are under no obligation to put up with their negativity, so if you can spend less time with them, do so. See if you can rearrange your schedule to cut them out of your life as much as possible., Bullies want to see a reaction from you, and if they see one, they will get even worse. Avoid name-calling, snark, or hitting. Stay polite, and use scripts like ""Please let me be"" or ""I'm not interested in talking."" Keep repeating them if you're ignored; the bully can't keep pestering you without looking like a massive jerk.

If authority figures see you retaliating, they may decide that you are equally at fault, even if this is not the case. It's unfair, but it's the way things are.
This doesn't mean that it is your fault for getting upset. It's natural to be sad or mad.

,

Tell yourself ""I'm okay, they're mean.""
Use a redirection technique, such as pretending that they complimented you, pretending not to hear, or agreeing with them. It can help to make it into a game (which the bully can't win).

, You are not responsible for the actions of other people; they are the ones who chose to be cruel.

It's okay to feel upset about being treated badly. It's their fault for behaving badly, not your fault for feeling bad about it.

, Consider friends, family members, mentors, and other people you care about. If you are getting too upset, try spending time with someone who makes you feel better., It's hard to be mistreated, and there are emotional costs. If you are having a hard time coping, look for a counselor who can help you through it., Spend more time at the mosque, get together with your vegetarian friends, or attend a pro-choice event. This can help you remember why your beliefs are important to you, and remind you that it's okay to believe in what you feel is important., It may mean quitting robotics club, no longer attending family reunions, or ending a friendship. However, if the attacker adds a lot of negativity to your life, it may be worth it, because you'll be free of them. Carefully consider your next steps."

If you don’t know why they hate you, ask them calmly and nicely.,

Or it could leave you in embarrassment. If they are nasty to you or start swearing or being violent, walk away and don’t bother trying to talk to them again until they start being civil. Some people can be given second chances to realize that you aren’t really a bad person and they have nothing to hate you for. But some people just won’t like you in life, so don’t waste your time fretting about why they don’t like you.;
, Holding grudges against people and not apologizing can sometimes seem like the reasonable thing to do but in the end, if its your fault, only you can fix it. Apologize to them seriously, and if they don’t accept it, there isn’t much more you can do than ignore them.

, This will show them that you are friendly and kind. Give them compliments and try not to sound hurtful, don't judge them if they say bad stuff back. And if these things don't work out, just tell your friends and they can cool you down, and take a deep breath and try again. Never be offended, but if did, try not to lose control. ""Control"" is important, when things gets messed up, control yourself, or make excuses to get out of the situation instead of losing your mind trying to settle things.


Treat your ""enemy"" well and see if they respond in a reasonable way. If not, others will see that you have tried and some (perhaps most) will respect you for trying. The other people are the people whose respect is worth having.

, This only contributes to them taking advantage of your kindness. Do not give enemies one ounce of your energy. By helping anyone, especially enemies, you may be giving something to someone who doesn't ""deserve"" it. Your best bet is to ground out their energy (return it to Earth/heaven/God/etc) and forget about it. Don't worry- they will get exactly what they deserve that way.

, They are probably only insulting you because they are jealous. No matter what they say, it can’t offend you unless you let it. Just remember when they say something nasty to you, they want you to react. So pretend you didn’t hear it. Don’t acknowledge them or give them any attention for it. If they continue insulting you or bothering you in any way, walk away from them. Don’t look at them or talk to them; just walk away. After a few times of you doing this they will probably get bored and stop picking on you.


Once you have tried everything to solve, turn them over to the universe and walk away (mentally, if you can't actually leave).
Always remember that you can't please all the people all the time. It's impossible. Doing the best you can at the time is all you should expect of yourself or others.

, If they still carry on, you will have to learn to stop being upset by their comments and realize that whatever they say is probably a lie.

, These people will make you feel more confident about yourself and you should realize that it doesn’t matter what haters say as long as you have good friends by your side.

Listen and respond with kindness.,
Politely ask them to stop.,
Set boundaries.,
Spend less time with those who criticize.",How to Deal with Criticism About Your Career Choice1," If someone close to you, like a friend or family member, has concerns about your career choice, try to put your ego aside for a moment and listen. Then, respond to them in a kind way. When someone feels that they have been truly heard, they are more likely to put their criticisms to rest.Perhaps your parents bring the subject up at dinner, or maybe a close friend broaches the subject over drinks.
May eye contact and nod as they speak.
Then you might say, “I hear you. I understand that there are risks involved with this choice. But this career is making me happy.”
You might say, “I will try keep everything you said in mind as I move forward, but ultimately, I really hope you can respect my choice.”;
, Listening to this criticism once (or maybe twice) is the right thing to do. But you should not have to hear this again and again. If someone in your life will not let up with the criticism, even after you’ve tried to listen and explain, you have every right to ask them to stop.Let's say a family member makes a critical comment every time you see them, or a friend cracks jokes about your career all the time.
You can say, “This is my life. This is my choice. I need you to understand this and stop bringing it up.”
You might add, ""It isn't funny.""

, Setting healthy boundaries requires you to think about your limits and what you will and will not accept in your interactions with other people. If criticism about your job is causing you discomfort or even resentment, it is important you communicate this to the person and set a boundary — you will not discuss the topic if they continue to criticize you. You can also tell them that there are consequences to violating your boundaries, perhaps that you will need to take a step back from the relationship.For instance, you could say, ""I know you are concerned with my choice. I don't mind talking about this, but not if you are going to criticize me. From now on, please keep any critical comments about my career choices to yourself.""
It is possible the person doesn't realize they are upsetting you with their comments. Setting a boundary makes it clear to the other person that you will not accept their behavior and gives them the opportunity to change.
Setting boundaries can be scary, but it is an essential skill that will help you have healthy relationships and practice self-care. Be kind, but assertive.

, If someone in your life still cannot let up, you may need to create some distance between you and that person, at least temporarily. If a friend or family member continues to relentlessly criticize your career choice, they may not be a healthy person for you to be around.When someone in your life is not treating you with respect — even if this a family member or longtime friend — you have every right to take some space for yourself.
You can say, “Hearing this constant criticism is not good for me. I need to take a little space for a while.”
You can say, “We can hang out again when you’ve found a way to respect my choices.”
If you’ve already tried to talk to this person with no success, you may not need to say anything else. Simply take the space you need.

Be grateful for all the smart people in your life (including you!).",How to Deal With Dumb People," This one is tough, but very important. Part of the reason that you may find yourself constantly frustrated by the stupidity in the world is because you have unrealistic expectations. Different people may have different backgrounds, different opinions or different priorities in their life. Remind yourself that the ""average"" person isn't going to meet your high expectations of how a person should think and act, and lower your standards accordingly.


If you don't expect people to be sharp, respectful people, then you'll be pleasantly surprised when they are -- instead of being constantly disappointed when they don't meet your expectations.;
, Another way to change your approach to the persons who are frustrating you is to consider the situation from their points of view. Sure, you may think that there's only one way to view gun control, or that you just have to be right about being a vegetarian, but before you get set in your ways, make sure you have a reasonable grasp of the argument from the other side, and try to see that there really may be another side of the story.


Also, seeing where the person is coming from can help you understand his or her world view -- if he grew up in a very conservative area while you grew up in Berkeley, then yeah, you're not going to see eye-to-eye on all of the issues.

, Both genetics and opportunities can make a difference to overall ""smarts."" One of the reasons some people appear smarter than others may be that they came from a loving home, got or are getting a good education, and that they haven't been stuck having to take care of family members, working a part-time job in high school, or taking on other responsibilities that kept them from spending so much time becoming a smarty pants. When a stupid person frustrates you, just ask yourself if the person had all of the best opportunities -- chances are, you'll see that this is not the case.


Intelligence is not determined by education or family or wealth or love. However, development of skills and knowledge can be influenced by one's life experiences and opportunities.
Reminding yourself to take each person on a case-by-case basis will make you less frustrated, because you'll stop constantly asking yourself why this person isn't acting just like you are.

, As Albert Einstein once said, “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” This means that you should consider the fact that the person you're dealing with isn't really dumb, though he or she may be dumb in the one or two areas where you expect him to be smart. The person next to you in your math class who can't add may be a wonderful poet; the person who can't get your latte order right may be a killer musician. Stop thinking that there's only one way to be smart or dumb and you'll start to see that people are capable of more than you think.Think about it: if people can be only smart or dumb in one regard, then there may be people out there who don't think you are very smart. And that can't be true, can it?

, This is another important point to get before you get yourself mixed up with people you disagree with, especially if they are close-minded. You may think that reason or sheer facts will win out every time, and that the other person will walk away thinking, ""Wow, I never thought of it that way..."" after you've given him or her a double-dose of your logic. However, this is not always going to happen, and you may get frustrated over this.If you realize that, while you may have very valid and reasonable opinions, you won't be able to convince the person of your point of view very easily, then you will stop trying. And if you stop trying to make the other person see your point, then you will be much less likely to get frustrated.
Remember that your goal is not to make the close-minded person agree with you; it's to make yourself stay calm and sane while dealing with him or her.

, Knowledge is power. Especially when you're dealing with people who don't have any. If you want to deal with dumb people to the best of your ability, then you should get your facts straight. Read as much as you can, listen to informative podcasts, watch and read the news, and make sure you have a firm grasp of a concept before you start arguing about it. The more facts, statistics, and talking points you know, the easier you'll be able to shut a stupid person down.


Though your goal shouldn't necessarily be to prove that you're right when you're talking to a dumb person (what's the point, anyway?), the more the person sees that you've done your research, the less likely he'll be to engage with you.

, If you want to deal with dumb people in the moment, then you should avoid anything that can upset them, make them angry, or make them start a crusade to prove that you're wrong. If you know that this person is pretty stupid and has pretty stupid opinions, then why bother talking about something serious -- which may mean a lot to you. Just stick to the pleasantries, (""Hi, how are you?"") if you have to be around the person on a regular basis, and don't bother getting into the highly-debatable topics.


Even if you know this person has stupid opinions on controversial topics and you just want to ""get him,"" avoid the temptation. It's not worth it -- not for you or your blood pressure.

, If a person is acting exceptionally dumb, then chances are, being nice to that person may be the last thing on your mind. Which is precisely why you should act as nice as possible. If you're as nice as possible, then the behavior will disarm and possibly confuse the dumb person, leaving him or her with little to do but be nice back and to stop being so darn stupid. If you're rude, condescending, or even mean, then that will encourage the person to continue to be as dumb as possible. Just grit your teeth and be nice, no matter how much it hurts, and the dumb person will start to annoy you much less.


Remember that it's much easier to be kind and polite than to be mean and nasty. Being mean is bad for your spirit and stress levels, and you're doing your own mental well-being a favor by being as nice as much as you can.

, This is related to avoiding controversial topics. If the dumb person happens to bring up a controversial topic and proceeds to share his particularly dumb opinion on the matter, resist the urge to jump in and prove that person wrong. Be polite, say something like, ""You're entitled to your opinion,"" or ""How interesting,"" without mentioning that you completely disagree. Then, change the topic or excuse yourself.


There's absolutely no point in engaging in a debate with a dumb person, even if you think it'll make you feel temporarily relieved.

, Stupid people are professionals at making other people upset or enraged. But from now on, you won't let stupid people get to you like this -- there's simply no point. If you want to be the dominant person in the conversation, then you have to keep your cool; being in control of your emotions is smart. You don't want to end up looking like the stupid one just because you couldn't stay in control of your feelings.


Be patient. It may take a little longer for a dumb person to get it. Don't get angry and frustrated right away -- give the person a chance.
If you feel yourself getting upset at something the person is saying, just chant this person is stupid, this person is stupid, this person is stupid in your head as much as necessary until you realize there's no point in caring so much about what this person is saying.
If you find yourself getting angry, count backwards from fifty, count your breaths, or excuse yourself to go for a walk -- do whatever you can to calm down before you have to face the person again -- if you have to face the person at all.
Don't give a dumb person the satisfaction of knowing that he or she can have so much power over you. If he sees that he has such a strong effect on you, then he will feel like the smarter person.

, If you're really frustrated with a dumb person, then you can make him or her stop talking by asking him to support his opinion. It's likely that this person has a lot of silly ideas that he or she can't back up. Asking him or her to do so will often stop him in his tracks and will keep the conversation from escalating. Here are some polite things to say to make the person stop talking:.""Oh, really? Where did you read that?""
""Are you basing your ideas off of the article in the New York Times last week? Because it actually seemed to say the opposite...""
""How interesting. Do you know what percentage of people are actually like this?""
""How fascinating that you have such strong opinions on California. How much time have you spent there? You must have lived there for a while to form such a compelling perspective about it.""

, Though ignoring people is pretty rude and immature, there are some cases where this is the best option. If you're in a group, for example, and don't want to leave the social interaction just because of one dumb person, you can just act like the person isn't there, or not respond to any of his comments. Chances are, if his opinions are really so stupid, that someone else will step up to bat -- or better yet, that other people will ignore him, too.


If the person addresses you with a dumb comment, just smile and act like he said something pleasant instead of engaging with him.
Though ignoring a dumb person isn't exactly taking the high road, it's a great way to keep a dumb person from talking to you.

, Walking away is a fantastic option whenever it's possible. Of course, you can't just walk away from a dumb boss unless you want to put your job in jeopardy, you can certainly walk away from a dumb person who is yelling at you at the grocery store, or leave a situation where a dumb person is just trying to annoy you. Walking away is also a great way to make yourself calm down if you're starting to feel yourself getting angry.


Just say, ""Excuse me, I have to get going,"" if the dumb person is more reasonable, or walk away without saying anything if there's no point in explaining yourself.

, It may be nearly impossible to not take something really stupid personally, especially if it was intended to hurt you. However, if you really want to deal with dumb people the best way possible, then you can't let them get to you and have to learn to let whatever they say roll off your back. If you take it personally and feel hurt, then you're giving them a power they don't need to have. Just remind yourself that these people are dumb, and their opinions shouldn't matter to you.


Your self-worth cannot be dictated by the opinions of a person whose intelligence you don't even respect. Just remember that the next time you let a dumb person make you feel small.

, Trying to be positive and giving the dumb person the benefit of the doubt is another great tactic for not letting a dumb person get to you. Sure, maybe your boss isn't so great at communication; but think about how much good he has done for your company overall. Maybe your second cousin is a ditz when it comes to not revealing your personal information in public; but she's awesome when it comes to making you feel better when you've had a bad day.


Remind yourself that most ""dumb"" people aren't all bad, and they do have some positive qualities, too. This is a great thing to remember if you want to stay sane around dumb people, especially if you're dealing with a person you will have to see a lot, like a classmate or a co-worker.

, Sure, your co-worker or frenemy might have said something so amazingly stupid that you feel the urge to tell the ten closest people in your circle of friends all about it. You may even want to send a mass email or text about it, going into all of the details of exactly how stupid this person is. But what good will that do? Sure, people will agree with you and agree that the person is stupid, but in the end, that will only make you feel more riled up, angry, frustrated, and annoyed.


And worst of all, that will give the stupid person even more power -- if you really know that the person is stupid and annoying, then you wouldn't spend so much time fretting over what he or she said, would you?
If the person really upset you, you can discuss it with one close friend, but don't let it become an obsession or let it ruin your day.

, This may seem impossible in the face of sheer stupidity, but that is precisely why you should be as respectful as possible to a person who is utterly stupid. Treat the person like the Queen of England or the CEO of your company if you have to. Treating the person like a human being who deserves it will let you take the high road -- and will encourage the person to act in a more dignified manner in the future.


Resist your first impulse. Sure, you might have thought of the perfect comeback or snappy remark, but remind yourself that it will get you nowhere before you say it.

, Dealing with stupid people on a regular basis will make you feel even more grateful for all of the calm, rational, and intelligent people that you know. If you're constantly upset by dumb people, then it's likely because you have a very intelligent group of friends and family members and that you have high standards when it comes to the intelligence of others.


Instead of being frustrated by the dumb person in front of you, remind yourself that you're lucky to have such a smart significant other, best friend, mother, or circle of friends or colleagues. This will make you more grateful for the positive people in your life, instead of letting those dumb people get the best of you.

Remove yourself from the criticism.,
Laugh it off.,
Ignore the criticism.",How to Deal With Harsh Criticism1," Take time to reflect, absorb the criticism, and to get away from the tense situation. It’s important to note the criticism is likely about actions rather than you as a person.Leave the room. Remove yourself from the critic’s presence and close the door behind you.
Take a brief walk. Give yourself an extra few minutes to really think about what was said.
Disengage from the critic by avoiding them. Avoid their attention and maybe the criticism will cease.;
, Laughter is virtually a 100% positive endeavor that interrupts your brain from negative feelings.Taking the criticism too harshly could very well be a misunderstanding of intent or degree, and it could affect you psychologically. Find the humor in the critic’s demeanor or unfounded criticism, and you’ll feel better about the situation.



Make yourself laugh by thinking about how the criticism relates to a difficult or embarrassing time for you.
Reflect on the encounter with the critic in a different outfit, hair-style, or other modification that makes them look goofy.
Be introspective and realize you may have just been completely misguided, and the criticism may be warranted for a legitimately boneheaded mistake.
Reimagine the scenario with you dishing out the criticism and the critic receiving it.

, Some criticism is misplaced, wrong, or just ridiculous. Outright dismiss what is being said if the criticism is unwarranted. Some criticism is easier than others to outright reject:


If the criticism is from someone you do not respect, it is much easier to dismiss. Irrational criticism is part and parcel of our lives. We can't live like normal humans without criticizing others and receiving criticism. When too much emotion gets involved, we often go beyond what can be a civilized way of criticizing.
Criticism containing lies or blame incorrectly attributed to you is destructive and not worth accepting. Dismiss the criticism and inform the critic of the mistake."
"
Determine the source.,
Recognize that people will always find something to criticize.,
Realize that sometimes your biggest critic is you.",How to Deal with Criticism About Your Career Choice2," It may help you reflect a bit on the “source,” or underlying cause, of the criticism. If it is coming from your parents, it may stem from worry about your financial future. (Although it may also be mixed up in their own desire to be “good parents.”) If it is coming from a friend, it could stem from jealousy or insecurity. If you can uncover the source of the criticism, it may hold less power over you.Try to think about what this person has to ""gain"" by telling you this.
Does their opposition come from a place of moral disapproval?
Could it be that they are worried about your financial security? (Do they fear you will come to them for help?)
Is it possible that they are jealous because they did not have the tenacity to follow their own dreams?

, Critical people will always find something to pick at. If it wasn’t your career, it could be your marital status, your lifestyle, where you live, how you dress, or how you spend your money. When you can see these comments aren’t really even about your career, you can begin to take them less personally.Even if you chose the career road your friends and family wanted you to choose, there would likely be some other element of your life that they don't agree with.
Perhaps they would pressure you to have more (or less) children. Perhaps they would encourage you to move closer to home. Perhaps they would try to tell you how to spend (or save) your money.
There will always be something that you are not doing ""right."" You'll be most happy if you do what you want.

, It is easy to get worked up about outside critics, but the truth is that the most powerful critic in your life is probably you. Often we take comments from others, magnify them with our own fears and insecurities, and create an internal storm of criticism. Although the words of others may echo in our ears, it is our own personal worries that actually hold us back.Let's say your aunt told you your career ""isn't worthwhile."" For the next week, perhaps your find yourself replaying this in your head. Then when an opportunity comes up, you don't take it, thinking ""Maybe Aunt Rita was right.""
Instead, try to recognize that you are the one replaying this comment. You are the one who chooses whether or not jump on that opportunity.
Recognize that the moment of outside criticism has already passed.
You have the power to move on at any time.

"
"
Focus on the importance of your field.,
Keep your eye on the prize.,
Recognize praise.",How to Deal with Criticism About Your Career Choice3," If negative comments are getting to you, shift your focus to why your field is important, or what drew you to it in the first place. Remind yourself of your own values and that they may differ from the values of others. Some people judge certain jobs to be less respected or needed based on their own values and worldview. Recenter on your own values as a way to remind yourself why you chose this path.Consider posting an inspirational quote where you work that reminds you why you chose this path.
For instance, if you’re a teacher, remember that your job is the most fundamental and necessary of all jobs in the world. You might post: “Without teachers, there would be no other jobs.”
If you are a musician, remember that your job is as old as mankind. You bring joy and rhythm to the world. You might post: “Where words fail, music speaks,” by Hans Christian Anderson.

, The best way to tune out criticism is to stay focused on your goals. What dreams do you have for your career future? What advances do you still wish to make? When you make these dreams and goals your primary focus, the negative comments will fade into the background.Chances are, there is still some promotion, award, or career advance that you've had your eye on.
Let the heat of negative criticism light a fire in you to succeed! Make a plan and get to work.
You can use this famous quote as your mantra: “Ignore the boos. They usually come from the cheap seats.”

, Studies have shown that we are way more likely to remember negative comments than positive ones. (In fact, they say it takes about five positive events to make up for one negative one.) Is it possible that a handful of negative comments are eclipsing all of the positive ones?Perhaps your co-workers often tell you they appreciate your work.
Maybe your boss has given you a raise, or asked you to take on more responsibility.
Often these instances of positive praise can be inadvertently ignored.
Try writing it down every time you get positive feedback or have a positive experience at work.
Return to this list of “positives” anytime someone tries to put you down.

Listen to the criticism.,
Repeat the criticism.,
Rephrase the criticism.,
Acknowledge wrongdoings or errors.,
View the criticism as a learning opportunity.,
Ask for advice in place of criticism.",How to Deal With Harsh Criticism2," Many times people spend time devising comebacks or arguments instead of actively listening to another. Use your listening skills twice as much as your desire to talk, and honestly absorb the intent., By repeating the criticism, you placate them by displaying the fact you heard their opinion, respect it, and are willing to work on the reason for the criticism.Try the following strategies to get their attention and gain their approval.


Replace the pronouns, repeat their words, and provide an affirmation. If they say, “You're doing it slowly!” reply with, “I’m doing it slowly. Got it.”
Write the criticism down while it’s being given to you. You’ll have their words verbatim and there will be no confusion about what they desire.

, If the criticism is directed at your actions but delivered harshly, try not to internalize the negativity of it. Try rewording what was said to you to get to the actual meaning. A few examples:”Your laziness is ruining the timeline of this project!” – “Put in some overtime.”
”You don't have a clue, do you?” – “Your training is inadequate.”
”Do it my way, because you’re screwing up!” – “I’m more in tune with company vision – follow my lead.”

, Nobody is perfect. Owning up to the reason for the criticism – particularly if it’s warranted – could very well defuse the situation and appease the critic., There is a distinct possibility, despite the acerbic nature of the criticism or your antipathy to it, the criticism may be helpful. Take it all in and see if you can use the criticism to your advantage.There is a distinct possibility the criticism possesses a fresh perspective you hadn't considered. Try to soak in the criticism and implement the new approach.
Picture the critic as someone you respect or love, like a parent or church leader. If the criticism were from them, you may receive it differently.
Imagine the criticism is from someone with vastly superior knowledge and skill than you.

, There is a fine art to giving praise instead of criticism, and many lack the subtlety. Disarm the source of criticism by asking for opinions on what you should do, how you should improve, or any other recommendation on your actions.


”Could you show me how to fix the issue?”
”I need your expertise to work through this the first time.”
”I’d appreciate your advice and input on this difficult challenge.”

"
"
Subdue the critic.,
Clarify your position.,
Engage in meaningful dialogue.,
Avoid overreaction.,
Suggest alternate means to the criticism.",How to Deal With Harsh Criticism3," Ask the critic to clarify their position. Once they have clarified, continue to be inquisitive about their position. Communicating in such a manner shows your curiosity, your desire to understand, and it may help the critic refocus their intent. Try one of the following approaches for a good start:""I don't quite understand your point. Could you demonstrate exactly what you mean?""
""That doesn't quite make sense to me. Could you repeat that in a different way?""
""Please give me a few examples to clarify your point.""

, Do not deflect onto the person delivering the criticism. Attempt to explain the factors that have led to criticism, and how the person criticizing you can help to either remove them or correct them.


""Maybe I didn't make myself clear. Allow me to explain my point in a different manner.""
""No offense, but I don't believe you understand my perspective. Please let me explain further.""
""I chose my words poorly. I'd like another chance to demonstrate why I don't deserve criticism.""

, What is more helpful in practicing meaningful dialoguing is to listen the complete viewpoint of the critic, be certain they understand your side of the issue, be patient, remove your ego, and have enough emotional control so that nothing is taken personally.


Ask open-ended questions. Instead of allowing the critic to be abrupt and harsh, gain a deeper understanding of their perspective without allowing for “yes” or “no” answers.
Critique your weak points and ask the critic for pointers on how to improve.
At any point the dialogue becomes aggressive or nonproductive, it’s probably not meaningful.

, Oftentimes criticism and feedback are confused for one another. It may be feedback. If someone else is telling you something that focuses on improvement, is about your behavior rather than personality, is encouraging, and is not coercive, it’s likely feedback., Inform the other person of their delivery or tone if unappreciated. Suggest a more helpful approach next time they plan on criticizing you.

Determine if the person's disrespectful behavior is unintentional and impersonal.,
Determine if the disrespectful behavior is unintentional yet personal.,
Determine if the disrespectful behavior is intentional yet impersonal.,
Determine if the disrespectful behavior is intentional and personal.,
Don't automatically jump to negative conclusions.,
Do your best to empathize with the other person.,
Ignore the disrespectful behavior, if possible.,
Decide what you cannot tolerate.,
Don't lash out.,
Be direct, yet polite.,
Deal with the offending person directly, if possible.,
Kill them with kindness.",How to Deal With Disrespectful People," Disrespectful and rude behavior is always annoying and at times can even be intolerable. However, not all rude actions are the same, and so your strategy for dealing with the disrespectful behavior should vary depending upon whether or not you judge the offending act to be intentional and/or personal.


For example, perhaps your coworker drives you nuts with her constant gum snapping, or maybe you work from home and your partner's whistling makes it impossible for you to focus.
You may be about to lose it at what you take to be their disrespectful behavior, but it's more likely the case that they are engaged in “uncouth habits”.These bad habits negatively affect others (in this case, you!), yet the offenders probably don't realize what they are doing, and they almost certainly are not doing it with the express intention of disrespecting you. You just happen to be the unfortunate bystander who is bothered by their behavior.
You'll want to keep this in mind as you decide whether or not, and how, to respond to them.;
, With this type of offense, the person who is offending you does not intend to be rude, but their actions are nonetheless directed specifically at you.


For example, you may be about ready to drop your self-centered friend: she invites you to coffee every week to “catch-up”, but then spends the entire time talking about her problems without ever asking about you.
Her behavior is indeed egocentric, and it is disrespectful. Her behavior is personally directed at you (she's not considering your needs and wants and is using you for her own purposes), but it's probably not the case that she is intentionally trying to ignore or hurt you.Most likely, she's not even aware of the fact that the conversation is one-sided.

, These sorts of offending, disrespectful behaviors are classified as “norm violations”.In these cases, the offending person knows exactly what they are doing, and they most likely know that there is a general taboo against their behavior (or they know that others consider it to be rude). They either don't care about the rule, or aren't fully thinking about how their behavior negatively affects others.


If someone's disrespectful behavior is intentional and impersonal, it means that while they intend to act as they do, they aren't necessarily trying to offend or hurt you specifically.
For example, the person who cuts in line at the supermarket intends to do so, and is most likely aware of the social norm against doing so, but is not specifically directing their behavior at you. They aren't cutting in front of you because they don't like the looks of you; They either think the rule is stupid, or perhaps they think that their immediate needs are more important than yours.
Yet another example would be someone who smokes in front of the entrance to a public building.That person obviously knows that she is smoking and that people are passing by (and surely knows that many people don't wish to be exposed to second-hand smoke), but either doesn't care to respect the social norm against smoking near others, or has convinced herself that her smoke isn't bothering anyone.
In either case, she most likely is not specifically trying to blow smoke in your face as you walk by.

, In these cases, the offending person knows exactly what they are doing, and you are indeed the intended object of their behavior. Depending upon how they are willing to describe their behavior, they may even be willing to admit that it is rude or disrespectful.


For example, does your mother criticize your food choices every time you come to visit? This sort of disrespect is outright rude, and is indeed intentional and personal: it's personal insofar as it is specifically directed at you, and it's intentional insofar as your mother intends to say what she does.
Keep in mind, though, that even in these cases, the person may not specifically intend to offend you. Your mother hopefully isn't commenting upon your second dessert because she wants you to feel bad, but she does clearly intend to offer some sort of criticism (though she'll probably describe it as “loving concern”).

, Completing the above steps will help you begin to understand why the other person is being so rude or even disrespectful, but it's not always so easy to judge whether or not someone's rude behavior is intentional or personal. In these cases, we may be tempted to assume the worst about the other person. Doing this, though, will only increase our own frustration and anger, whereas the point is to try to diffuse our negative feelings.


Indeed, even if we are willing to admit that the person who jumped line, for example, wasn't trying to inconvenience us specifically, it's hard for our first thought to not be “What a jerk! That guy must not think about anyone but himself.” Of course, it's completely possible that that guy is a jerk, but it's also possible that he didn't see you.
The person who cut you off while driving was certainly being careless and dangerous, but before you flip them off consider the possibility that they may have just received terrible news and are rushing to the hospital.
Your coworker may drive you nuts with her gum-snapping, but before you judge that she's completely self-centered, consider the possibility that she's chewing gum to help her stop smoking or to deal with an anxiety issue.

, Just as you should try not to assume the very worst about people—even those who are being exceptionally disrespectful—you should also try to empathize with them. Do your best to put yourself in their shoes in order to try to understand their behavior.For example, the server at your favorite restaurant may be short and rude when taking your order, but take a look around the restaurant: is it busier than normal? Do they seem to be short-staffed?Even if you don't see any signs that would explain the waiter's rude service, keep in mind that he is in a stressful, demanding job, where he's required to multi-task and balance the demands of many people at a time, usually for relatively little pay.
We're not saying that recognizing why your waiter, for example, is being rude justifies the behavior, but obtaining understanding and empathy will help us move past the offense.
Even when you are certain that the other person's actions are intentional and personal (like your mother criticizing your food choices), the situation will be helped if you try to understand and empathize with the other person. Your mother's criticisms are hurtful, and that shouldn't be underscored, but if you try to imagine why she is making her comments, you might find that your own anger is tempered.
For example, if your mother has struggled with her weight, body-issues, or self-esteem, then you may come to conclude that she is misdirecting her own insecurities towards you.

, At this point, you may have determined that the disrespectful behavior that was troubling you was unintentional and impersonal, for example. If that's the case, you may decide that there's no real point in confronting the person; after all, you've decided that they aren't trying to offend you personally and that they may not even be aware of what they are doing. However, even in cases of more egregious disrespect (such as the intentional, personal disrespect) there is good reason to think about ignoring the person.


We may think that it's always important to stand up for ourselves and confront bad, rude, or offensive behavior; we may have been told that it's a sign of self-confidence or that to sit back and take it is a sign of weakness or low self-esteem. We may even think that if we fail to confront the offender, then our our own frustration will build.
To the contrary, though, there is compelling reason to ignore disrespectful behavior it at all possible in order to preserve our own mental health. Recent research suggests that study participants who were able to ignore rude people, rather than interact with them or confront them, were later better able to perform cognitive tasks. It seems as though distancing yourself from and ignoring disrespectful people is a good strategy for protecting yourself and maintaining your overall peace and calm., Not all disrespectful behavior can be ignored. It's easy enough to avoid the rude bank teller's line, but if your coworkers' tendency to loudly gossip outside of your office door, for example, interferes with your ability to meet deadlines, you are going to have to develop a strategy for confronting their behavior.


Think carefully about whether or not there are any minor changes you can make to avoid the offending person. For example, if your partner's whistling is bothering you while you are trying to work at home, is it easy enough for you to move to a quieter location or wear earplugs?
You shouldn't be the only one to have to change, but keep in mind that it's easier to change ourselves than others. The biggest part of learning to deal with disrespectful people is learning how to handle it on our end—there is no guarantee that we'll be able to effect change in other people.
Thus, if we can learn to not be bothered by others or can easily remove ourselves or change our environment, the situation may be remedied more easily.
Nonetheless, this is about striking a balance: you shouldn't be the one who has to continually make all of the concessions, especially if the disrespectful behavior is coming from a friend, loved one, coworker, or indeed anyone that is part of our regular circle whom we don't want to, or can't, cut out of our lives.

, Now that you've decided to confront the disrespectful person, it's important that you approach the situation carefully. Lashing out in anger will only make the other person respond defensively and will increase the tension.


Once you've decided to talk to the other person, avoid using accusatory language. Instead of responding to your mother's criticisms with “You are such a judgmental shrew,” try framing your complaint with “I-language”: “Mom, I feel judged and down about myself when you comment about how much I eat”.It should go without saying that you should avoid name calling. You might think that your rude waiter is a jerk (or worse), but calling him that serves no good purpose and only makes you look like a jerk.

, When you decide to confront the offending person about their troubling behavior, don't beat around the bush or engage in passive-aggressive responses. Clearly identify the problem, and explain specifically what you need from the other person.


Your co-worker might eventually pick up on your annoyance if you sigh loudly and repeatedly every time he walks past your work-space whistling off-key, but she may think that you're just frustrated with your work (or be so engrossed in the whistling that she never notices).
The situation will be resolved much more quickly and efficiently if you calmly and politely explain your frustration in as non-accusatory of a manner as possible: “Honey, I'm not sure if you're aware that you're whistling, but I'm having a hard time focusing on my project. Would you mind keeping the symphony contained to the kitchen and living room?”
If your coworkers are once again convening for a gossip-session outside of your office door, slamming your door in frustration may get them to move, but won't go far at all to improve your work relationship with any of them.
Instead, pop your head out the door and try the following: “Hey guys, sorry to be the party-pooper, but I've a client on the line; it would help me a lot if you could relocate to the break-room. Thanks!”

, Whether you are frustrated with a waiter, your coworkers or a sibling, it's always a better idea to try to resolve the situation directly before moving up the ladder. If you go over people's heads to complain, you risk increasing the hostility, inadvertently opening up the other person to harsher punishment than you had anticipated, and becoming subject to blow-back yourself.


You may be thoroughly offended at your server's rude attitude, but before demanding to see the manager, (and after deciding that the behavior does indeed need to be addressed), do your best to resolve the situation with the server directly. For example, if she drops your plates in front of you without a word, try the following: “You seem upset. Have we done anything to offend you?”
She may just be a lousy server, but she may not have realized that she was taking her frustration with another difficult table out on you. If you go directly to her manager, you risk that she'll be subject to a harsh punishment or may even be fired.
Similarly, if you head straight to your manager to complain about your coworker's gum-snapping, the offending behavior may stop, but if you haven't yet talked to your coworker yourself, you'll likely look petty in front of your boss, and are painting yourself as someone who is incapable of handling her problems herself. Furthermore, if the complaint can be traced back to you, you will have fostered bad feelings between you and your coworker.
Of course, not all disrespectful behavior can be directly addressed, and you may eventually need to enlist the help of superiors. When you do discuss your issues with the offending person, be sure to keep a record (create time-stamped memos or emails to yourself documenting the discussions) in case the situation escalates.
If the other person responds with hostility or if the offending behavior does not stop, don't hesitate to have a discussion with a higher-up (a manager, your boss, etc.).

, The Golden Rule tells us to treat others as we want to be treated ourselves. It's a good rule to follow for more than one reason: it commands us to treat others with respect and kindness, which is good in itself, but it's also a good guide for our conduct insofar as we'll be more likely to get what we want. When we are kind to others, they in turn tend to be kind to us. If you're trying to respond to someone who is being rude and disrespectful, instead of lashing out or meeting their aggression, try responding with a smile or a kind word. Quite often, this unexpected response will shock the person out of their nastiness.


For example, if your colleague can't be bothered to acknowledge you every morning when you ride the elevator together, make a point to flash him a friendly smile as you say “Good morning, John!”.
Who knows—maybe he's not a morning person, or actually suffers from social anxiety, or he may just be an unfriendly jerk. He may start to warm up and be friendlier as you greet him warmly, and if not, then his disrespectful behavior is highlighted whereas your virtue shines.

Think about why it happened.,
Consider talking to your friend.,
Talk to your friend about rules.,
Stop crying, they are not worth your tears.,
Start a new life.,
Show those who don't appreciate you that you don't need them to have a wonderful life!",How to Deal with Your Friend Taking Your Boyfriend or Girlfriend," Write down whatever comes to mind. Do not think, ""What could I have done to change that they are together now?"" You've done what you could! The harsh truth of the matter is that he or she did not like the real you and you should never change who you are for someone else. It is important to stay true to yourself. Someday you will find someone who loves the real you.;
, Have you talked to either of them since? If not, talk to the one who was your friend first, not the boyfriend or girlfriend, but the friend (do the talking outside so it won't be awkward to leave their house, or to kick them out of yours). Likely you'll be angry with the girlfriend or boyfriend, but your friend knew that you loved him or her, and should have been able to walk away for your sake! So talk to your friend, and ask why, and figure out whether you're still friends. Most likely, the friend that took your boyfriend or girlfriend was not a true friend; otherwise they would not have taken your boyfriend or girlfriend but would have found someone else to date.


A true friend would have discussed the matter with you personally and told you how they felt about the person you're dating. A true friend would also have discussed this matter with your boyfriend and girlfriend and told them that they cannot date them because they respect and care about you as their friend.
If you made a deal to go meet up with your ex and you are very nervous and about to back out, think about this: He or her is still the same person, and they are probably as nervous as you are, and if you have kissed them, they are still the same person you kissed. The only thing that changed is his or her status with respect to you. Plus, you will finally get the apology and explanation you truly deserve! If they still argue and do not think that they've done anything wrong, dump them. They're not worth your time.

, This might sound a bit weird or weak right now, but you do not want to see those two making out in front of you. You set the boundary line for them around you, if you're still friends with the one who took you boyfriend/ girlfriend. If you're no longer friends, you are still free to ask them to not parade their betrayal around you.

, Talk to your parents. They can help you. They have probably also been through tough breakups and they know what kind of ice cream is your favorite flavor! Also, talk to your other friends. Maybe they don't understand you or your decisions but they are trying to understand and they are listening. Also, you can complain to each other about the two new love birds... Even talk to your school counselor. It's always good to have people to talk to and support you. though it will be hard, you'll realize that neither of them are worth your time. If they were truly you friends, they wouldn't have done what they did.

, This is a life lesson. Right now you are slowly rolling down that big iceberg and it is first when you get down you can get up on your feet and climb that mountain one more time! But this time you have more equipment to hold tight to the mountain and not fall off!


If you have a hard time building a new life on these experiences, build on the old one.
Become better friends with your other friends, or start in a new activity that you haven't thought of trying before.

, However, don't bottle up your emotions either. If you're not okay, say so. Don't pretend that everything is peachy when it isn't. That could cause more problems for you. Just go with the flow and take each issue as it arises. But really, don't worry about your friend or your ex. If they're so careless as to hurt you like that, they aren't worth it. Move on!

Keep calm.In communicating with a condescending person, try not to lose your temper, since this can make the situation worse.,
Be honest.,
Watch your tone of voice.,
Practice non-defensive communication.To deal with difficult people, you have to choose your words very carefully.,
Determine what kind of relationship you have with the person.If you are dealing with a person who has a consistent habit of saying condescending things to you, stop and consider your relationship with that person in general.,
Recognize emotional blackmail.Sometimes, people will use condescension to manipulate others into doing something for them.,
Nod and smile, when all else fails.Sometimes, the quickest and easiest way to deal with a condescending person is just to move on.,
Seek professional help, if necessary.",How to Deal with Condescending People1," Before replying to the person, pause for a moment and take a deep breath. Tell yourself something like “I’m trying to point out a problem, but I’m going to stay calm and be civil.”;
, If someone says something to you that is condescending, even in an offhand kind of way, don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself.Let the person know that you feel talked down to, and that the condescension was uncalled for. Being honest is crucial if you want to deal with the situation. Otherwise, the person may not even realize that he or she is being condescending.

, Condescension is often primarily about one’s tone of voice.In other words, it’s not always what a person says, but how it is said that matters. Be careful not to reply to a condescending person with more condescension. This means avoiding sarcasm, muttering things under your breath, raising your voice, etc.

, Avoid saying things that are defensive, since that can validate the condescending person and ruin the chances of resolving the situation. Luckily, you can usually turn defensive statements into more constructive ones. For instance:


Suppose someone says something condescending to you, such as “Well, if I were you, I’d just settle on a career and move on with my life.”
You might be tempted to respond with something like “You’re wrong! And stay out of my life.”
Instead, try saying something more productive, like “I understand you see it that way. Let me explain why it’s more complicated than that…”

, Try to determine why it is that you find the remarks condescending, based on the kind of relationship you have. With this knowledge, you will be able to communicate more effectively.


For instance, if you have a relationship where you feel like you owe a debt to the other person, the pressure of the debt may cause the feelings of condescension. Settle the debt, or be open with the other person about how you feel.

, If a friend or partner says belittling things to you, for instance, he or she might actually fear losing you. The condescending comments would be meant to make you feel inferior and therefore dependent on that person. If you recognize this kind of behavior, communicate calmly and openly communicate with your friend/partner about it.

, If you can stand the condescending comments long enough to get away from that person, just grin and bear it and avoid that person in the future.

, If someone’s condescending comments are causing serious damage to a relationship that you value, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Marriage and family advisors, for instance, are trained in helping to mediate between people who are experiencing relationship problems.

Include this person in the planning.,
Be understanding.,
Set expectations.,
Seek out affordable or free things to do.,
Be a generous gifter.,
Avoid going out with this person.",How to Deal With Cheap People1," Whether you’re planning an outing, a group trip or going in on a gift for someone, make sure to include this person from the beginning. If they are a part of the planning, they’ll be able to tell you what their budget is and what they are able to contribute. For example, let your cheap sibling be the first to know if you’re thinking of doing a group gift for your parents. If they want a less expensive option, they are able to suggest ideas themselves.;
, If you had an expensive gift in mind that you’re set on, realize it may be a priority to you, but not to the other people involved.Understand that they may not be willing to contribute as much financially to the gift, but allow them to put in what they can and help in other ways (like organization and communication).
Understanding lessens feelings of resentment for everyone involved.

, Sometimes, people are unaware that they are doing something wrong. Maybe they assumed an invitation out meant an offer to pay as well. Make sure when you plan to hang out with this person that you set clear expectations from the beginning.If you're eating out together, ask your server for separate checks at the beginning of the meal.
If you're going out as a group, let everyone know in advance that the bill will be split equally per person.
If you're hosting a ""bring your own "" party, let the person know everyone is expected to bring something.
If they’re prepared upfront, they don’t have an excuse for cheap behavior.
If expectations have been set, and the behavior continues, you may have to confront the problem directly.

, If the cheap person you’re dealing with is a good friend or family member, avoiding them isn't an option. It’s not about what you’re doing, but who you’re doing it with. Plan low or no-cost activities with your cheap friend.Take a hike or some other physical activity.
Watch a movie at home.
Go to a park.
Cook together.
Look up free things to do near your city.

, If you want to do something with this person that you don’t think they'll be willing to pay for, consider giving it to them as a gift. This gives you the opportunity to enjoy time with your loved one without money becoming an issue.Let’s say you’ve always wanted to take a trip with this person, but you know they won’t include it in their budget. Treat them to a short getaway for their birthday. This takes the pressure of money off of both of you.
It is important that you don’t expect an equivalent gift in return. Your friend can give you a thoughtful gift without spending the same amount of money. Don’t let yourself get too hung up on price tags.

, If the cheap person is a colleague or an acquaintance, your best option may be to avoid going out with them altogether. You’ll be a more pleasant co-worker if you’re not carrying resentment.


Suggest bringing your lunches from home and eat together in the breakroom.
Tell them you need to save money, and aren't able to go out.

Set up a meeting with a manager if your employment is in jeopardy.",How to Deal With Backstabbers," Things expand in translation as others spread rumors and maybe you're over-reacting to something that hasn't really happened the way it was told to you. If it is true though, proceed.;
, If you're in front of people you don't know, don't spread rumors. You may be tempted to be helpful by telling a newcomer all the terrible things about a teacher or a boss, but you never know who they might tell. If you can't resist gossiping or complaining, try to do it only in front of people who have never met the person you're talking about.It's fine to listen to gossip and rumors from anyone, so long as you don't contribute anything yourself. Try to listen more and talk less if you can't give up gossip.

, Try to be friendly and positive, even when dealing with people you don't know. Even if someone turns on you anyway, others will be less likely to side against you.


If you're at work, treat everyone with respect, not just immediate coworkers and bosses. If you're too focused on those relationships, you could carelessly give a receptionist, intern, or lower level employee a reason to hold a grudge against you.

, The longer a backstabber is allowed to spread lies or sabotage you, the harder it will be to repair the damage. If you can spot signs of backstabbing early, this can help you to head the acts off before they increase. Look for the following warning signs:


False rumors reach you about what you've supposedly done or said.
You said something in private, and now everyone knows you said it.
People stop entrusting you with information, assigning you tasks at work, or asking you to events that they once did.
People act cold or unfriendly toward you for no clear reason.

, Make sure you're not making a mountain out of a molehill in assuming that someone is a backstabber. Some poor behaviors, such as being persistently late, sloppy, or selfish are a sign of a thoughtless person, not necessarily a scheming backstabber. The occasional minor slip-up, such as canceling lunch at the last minute or neglecting to return a phone call, is not a sign of backstabbing either.

, As soon as you suspect backstabbing might be occurring, start documenting the events that make you suspicious. Write down what happened, as well as the reasons you think someone might have hurt you intentionally. This makes your experiences easier to examine, so you can figure out whether the incident is part of a larger pattern or just a misunderstanding.


If you think you're being sabotaged at work, keep a business-like record of how your work was adversely affected. In this record, include details of the work you accomplish, positive feedback you receive, and other concrete evidence that you can use to defend yourself if the sabotage gets serious.

, Once you've noticed signs that someone may be sabotaging you, examine people's behavior and action to narrow down the culprit. Observe the suspects several times at least before you leap to a conclusion, as rude behavior could just be the sign of a bad day. Here are some ways a backstabber might behave:


If someone gives you insincere compliments, or acts as though a criticism is a compliment, she may be hiding jealousy or anger.
Someone agrees with you when you're alone together, then sides with other people when you talk about the same subject in a group.
The possible backstabber recalls all their past grievances and slights without missing a beat. This person probably holds grudges for a long time and feels entitled to take revenge.
The suspect treats you with disrespect, ignoring your opinion or failing to change her behavior when you ask her to stop.
Besides these signs, keep in mind who is able to betray you. If someone keeps repeating what you said in private, it has to be someone whom you confide in. If a project you're working on is being undermined, the backstabber has access to the project materials.

, Don't assume someone is sabotaging you. Ask for a friend's honest opinion, and describe why you are suspicious. Find out if other people think the idea is reasonable, or if you're reading too much into things.


Talk to someone you can trust not to gossip, and tell them to keep the conversation private.
If you suspect a specific person, talk to someone who knows him but isn't his friend. If you don't have any trusted friends who fit that description, talk to someone who doesn't know him, and describe his specific actions and behavior, not your opinion on his character.

, You might be tempted to take revenge on your backstabber by hurting them in the same way. Getting sucked into this behavior will likely make the problem worse and make you more upset and emotionally involved.It also won't do any favors for your reputation, so even if you drive off the backstabber (which is unlikely), you may have the same problem.

, Sometimes people do nasty things, and sometimes this results in betrayal. Reacting with outrage won't fix the situation. It is better for you, both now and in the long run, to remain calm and focus on practical matters. Don't ignore the situation, but go about your daily life without obsessing over the outrageous behavior.

, Being nice to the backstabber is probably the last thing you feel like doing, but if you are calm enough and sincerely agree with some of their points, this could fix the situation. Many passive-aggressive people, backstabbers included, feel they have to use devious and hurtful methods because their direct contributions aren't valued.Invite her to join you in activities. Do something fun and distracting that will make the backstabber feel welcome again.

, Approach the backstabber privately, using text or email if you can't talk to him in person. Politely tell him that you would like to talk about recent occurrences. Set up a private conversation.

, Describe the incidents that have been bothering you, and how they have affected you. Ask the other person to confirm the facts, such as whether she sent a particular text.


Avoid starting sentences with ""you"", which can make the backstabber feel accused and defensive.Instead, use sentences like ""I heard there have been some false rumors about me.""

, Your friend probably doesn't want to stay mad at you forever. Let her say her side of the story without interrupting or getting angry. It's always possible you were mistaken, or that the situation is more complicated than you thought.

, Even if you think your friend was mostly at fault, examine the situation from his perspective. Apologize if you misunderstood your friend or accidentally hurt him, even if you were only responsible for one of the many incidents.

, If you want to rebuild your friendship, you need to forgive each other for your mistakes. Even if you can't repair the relationship, forgiveness can help you move on and stop stressing over the betrayal.

, Be honest and open. Have private conversations whenever you feel like something is wrong. If one of you feels unhappy about specific behavior or repeated patterns in the relationship, let the other person know how you feel.

, As you tell each other about problems in the relationship, you each need to be prepared to change in order to improve your trust and happiness. You may need to find a different activity if your usual way to spend time together makes your friend uncomfortable. If your friend says something you say often makes her uncomfortable, be aware of it in conversation and try to avoid the nickname, tone of voice, or habit that bothers her.


Mistakes will happen, especially when trying to break old habits. Apologize when you make them and forgive when your friend makes them.

, Sometimes, you can't recover the trust the betrayal cost your friendship. If you've made an honest effort and it's not working out, you'll need to figure out how to move on.


At this point, you've probably had at least one conversation about the betrayal and your friendship. If your friend was unwilling to repair the situation, just stop talking to him.
If both of you have made an effort to rebuild the friendship, but haven't succeeded, the friend probably already knows why you're upset. Calmly let the friend know that it's not working out, and cut off contact with her.
Sometimes, you can let the friendship fade naturally. Invite him to fewer events, and don't pick up the phone every time that friend calls. Ignoring him completely could hurt him, but gradually letting go achieves the same result with less pain.

, Focus on the work you can do without the coworker, and don't let your anger get in the way of other work relationships or responsibilities. Don't give anyone else reason to be angry or disappointed in you.

, Most backstabbing coworkers aren't sociopaths, but people who think underhanded tactics are the only way to get ahead. Make an honest effort to recognize the coworker's positive contributions, and encourage those behaviors instead.


During a meeting or conversation, ask the backstabber for input on topics she knows a lot about.
Back him up when he makes contributions and suggestions you agree with. Only do this when you sincerely agree, and don't go overboard and flatter him.
If the backstabber treats these gestures rudely, stop and move on to other methods. Some people are not interested in changing their behavior, and there's only a limited amount of effort you can be expected to make.

, Describe the incidents that have upset you privately, in person or via email. Bring the problem into the open and see if the other person is mature enough to discuss it.


Avoid sounding like you're making accusations. Use passive statements such as ""I noticed the project wasn't completed in time"" instead of active statements such as ""You didn't complete the project."", As described under Protecting Yourself, you should be prepared with detailed information on the incidents that occurred. If the coworker denies these events ever happened, show them the email or other document that proves it did.


If the backstabber still denies it, get a witness to confirm.

, If the backstabbing threatens to have serious consequences, and talking to the person responsible was unsuccessful, ask to meet with your manager, or a manager from Human Resources. This is especially true if there are rumors about you violating workplace policy, or committing other actions that are grounds for punishment.


Come prepared with as much information as you can. Documents, emails, and anything else that shows concrete evidence of sabotage will help your case. Positive feedback and a record of the work you completed can help put to rest rumors of laziness or unprofessional behavior.

Know that you are not alone.",How to Deal With Your Mother's Abusive Boyfriend2," There are many ways that a child or a teen under the age of 18 can be abused. It is possible that your mother's boyfriend is abusing you in ways that you are not aware of. There are five types of abuse that happens to children or teens:Physical abuse. This type of abuse consists of hitting, punching, slapping, pinching, kicking, choking, shaking or pushing. Offenses may leave marks like cuts or bruises.
Sexual abuse. This happens when an adult or someone much older touches your private body parts (e.g. breasts, buttocks, penis, vagina). The abuser may touch your private parts or tell you to touch his. No matter if you are curious or it doesn't hurt, sexual touching from an adult is not okay.
Verbal or emotional abuse. This kind of abuse happens without a touch. You may be verbally or emotionally abused when someone calls you names, makes you feel bad about yourself, or makes threats to leave or send you away.
Physical neglect. This happens when you are not having your most basic needs met. If your mother's boyfriend refuses to see to your basic needs, such as bathing, eating, and having a warm bed to sleep in.

Isolate the source of stress.,
Make a priority check.,
Deal with stress together, not as individuals.,
Work on your communication skills.,
Face financial problems together.,
Remember that work shouldn't take over your relationship.,
Learn to cope with illness as a couple.,
Listen.",How to Deal With Stress in Relationships1," This could come from either outside your relationship (work, family, financial issues) or from within. If the source of stress is not the relationship itself, don't let stress spoil your private life. Learn how to manage so that it doesn't seep into conversations with your partner.When stress comes from outside the relationship, the best solution is to nip the problem in the bud. For example, if your dissatisfaction with a job is putting strain on your relationship, consider getting a new job instead of letting it affect your well-being.;
, If your relationship matters more to you than the source of stress or the fact that you're stressed, then you should focus on your own and your partner's well-being.


Make it clear to your partner that your relationship is still more important than anything else. For example, you can say: ""I'm sorry I'm going through a difficult time at work, and that this is putting a strain on us. You know you're what matters the most to me.""

, See you and your partner as a team facing a difficult time and looking for a solution together. Put your ego in a corner and think through problems by asking yourself ""What can we do?"" rather than ""What can I do?""If the stress is due to your partner's dealing with a hard situation, sympathize and show your active encouragement. As part of a team, you're called to play the role of helper and comforter.Make it clear that you are committed to the relationship no matter what problem you and your partner are dealing with. Stress tests the strength of any relationship. If you want to stay together despite the hardships, state it clearly., Most relationship problems have their origin in the partners' failure to express their concerns and emotions straightforwardly. The first skill a couple needs as a team is to speak clearly, honestly and respectfully.Don't hold back your feelings. Silence is another source of strain in itself, and will only build up tensions. Express all your concerns and emotions, but do it in a way that is sincere and not judgmental. Go for positive statements like ""I'm feeling..."" or ""I think that..."", rather than questions (""Why did you...?"") or negative sentences (""I didn't like..."").Humor is a great for relieving tension. Making a joke about a difficult situation, or seeing its funny side, will give both of you a positive outlet for your stress and help you put things into perspective. However, make the joke on you or the difficult situation, not on your partner., Money is one of the first causes of stress in a relationship. If debt, unemployment or related issues are putting a strain on your life as a couple, you should be open about it and look for a solution together.


Look for professional financial advise without feeling ashamed. It is an adviser's job to help people through difficult times: you situation is just one of many they've dealt with.
Don't blame each other for being in dire straits. Accusing your partner of spending money on a night out instead of saving it for more important stuff will only increase tension.
Don't hide anything from your partner and make sure he or she is just as transparent. Discuss honestly how money loss has changed your life and how this is making you feel.

, Jobs take up a large part of everyone's life and energy. However, work-related stress can often affect a couple's well-being. This doesn't mean you have to keep it all to yourself. Share it with your partner and find stress-relieving activities together.


Don't ever use your job as a term of comparison with your partner. You might have similar or completely different occupations, but it's never a good idea to measure your professional success or failures against your partner's.
Allow yourself and your partner some quality time off work. You can actually cheat on your job, every once in a while, as a sign that what you truly care about is not in your office., Chronic pain or an unexpected disease can put a lot of strain on a relationship. If this happens, remember that illness can change your habits but you're still the same people as before. Deal with the change together, and don't forget that partners are there to help each other especially in this case.


If you're in pain, don't hold back. Let your partner know how this is affecting your life and making you feel. You can't expect your partner to read your mind: express yourself clearly and don't be afraid to ask for help.
Keep having sex, if your own or your partner's condition still makes it possible. Being ill doesn't mean you should give up on life as a whole. Make the most of what you can still enjoy!, In stressful times, you might tend to focus on your own problems and feelings. This can make you forget that your partner can help you only if you let him or her speak.


Don't dismiss what they say: think their advice through and show gratitude for the effort."

Stop being too good to be true.,
Do not ignore the first sign of abuse.,

Do not suffer alone.,
Raise children in an abuse-free environment.",How to Decrease Your Chances of Being Abused in an Intimate Relationship," When you, through your gestures and attitudes show that you are the kindest, the most obedient, the most caring and humble person in the world, an abusive person is likely to take advantage of your goodness in a negative way. Avoid being compliant in this manner, to avoid being taken advantage of. Stand up for yourself and make it clear that you won't tolerate any breaches of your personal safety and dignity.;
, Never ever ignore the first signs of abuse and related signs. When you let abuse go, by offering excuses for the bad behavior, it tells the abuser that you won't do anything about it, allowing the abusive behavior to intensify. When you accept the first abusive demands, he or she will take it for granted that this situation will be maintained and that he or she can get away with anything. The more abuse you tolerate, the more difficult it becomes to put an end to it.


At the first sign of abuse, signal your disapproval by stating clearly that it is unacceptable. If possible, pack an overnight bag and go and stay with someone you trust. If this is done the first time a fist is raised in anger or you are harmed in some way, it tells the abuser that you won't hesitate to take action to protect yourself. If you feel that it is unsafe to return, do not do so unless someone accompanies you (such as to collect your things).

, When you are in an intimate relationship, set clear limits, boundaries and values to follow. By indulging bad behavior in a relationship blindly and setting no boundaries on what is, and what is not, acceptable, you risk opening wide the doors for ""anything goes"". Show the other person that you are there for him or her if they respect you but that you will withdraw and protect your own needs if they cross a boundary that you have clarified as unacceptable. If you fail to do this, abuse can creep in and may become more severe over time.

, Being abused is not a form of martyrdom; there are people available in all societies to take you in, shelter you and defend you from ongoing abuse. The trick is to be willing to reach out to such people, even if you don't yet know them. When you realize that you are being abused by your partner, talk to your friends, family or supportive social workers and institutions about seeking help to get out safely. Even if you feel that your family won't be supportive, there are people who will be able to give you this support and help you to work around cultural preferences that sometimes hinder help and keep abuse silent. Remember, It is not a private matter anymore; once you have been abused, it is about violence that needs to be dealt with appropriately.

, Even if you feel that you can tolerate the abusive atmosphere and actions in the home environment, realize what this is teaching your children, who witness it all the time. Abusive language and actions in the home environment destroy the emotional health and well-being of children. Remove yourself from the abusive situation for the sake of both you and your children, so that they can grow up with a healthy mindset and learn the right way to interact with other human beings.


Do not use abusive language in front of your children, whether in the form of abusive beliefs, thoughts, or attitudes. Research shows that children who are exposed to abusive environment are more likely to become abusive partners in their adulthood."

Isolate the problem in your relationship.,
Give responses, not reactions.,
Discuss rough reactions openly.,
Respect your partner and expect respect in return.,
Trust and accept your partner as he or she is.,
Be open to negotiation and surrender.,
Talk to a relationship coach if needed.",How to Deal With Stress in Relationships2," If the stress comes from difficulties in your relationship, make a distinction between such problems and the relationship itself. You shouldn't let one single difficulty affect the entire relationship.


Find out what doesn't work in the relationship and address this specific issue by using what does work as a point of strength., What makes a reaction different from a response is its intensity and emotional subtext. Think your answers through. If one implies anger, sarcasm, accusations, it's a reaction. This will only turn communication into a table-tennis match where the goal is to win rather than to find a solution. However, a team always plays on the same side.Don't phrase your comments as judgments or blame your partner out of spite. This can only lead to further stress and misunderstanding.You can do this by focusing on future objectives rather than past actions. If you were disappointed at your partner's not doing the dishes, seize the next occasion to ask them to do the dishes, without mentioning the fact that they didn't in the past.
Don't invalidate your partner's opinions just to win an argument. Proving yourself right might be good for your ego, but it never makes a team stronger.Understand that, when we're angry, communication follows war patterns: aggression and defense. You should avoid both, and try to bring the conversation back to equal terms. Express ideas as positive statements, without using them as weapons or shields., If your partner's tone becomes aggressive or judgmental, point it out gently and ask what was behind the message. What we say is usually not as important as why we said it. This will help you address the original source of stress, instead of spending time arguing over a harsh reply.Be tolerant if your partner has a bad reaction. If this happens repeatedly, point out this is not a useful discussion. It will never lead to a solution but only further stress., This is the golden rule of any relationship. Showing each other respect through what you say or do will decrease the level of stress, whether the source is external or internal.Respect means having equal power in a relationship. What you say or do is just as important as what your partner says or does. Stress, instead, always derives from a power imbalance. For example, one of the two partners might be overly controlling or submissive., Stress can also come from failed expectations. If that is the case, the problem is in what you expected rather than what your partner failed to provide. You chose your partner with all his or her faults and weaknesses, not as a fixer-upper. Love rests on acceptance and confidence.A consequence of acceptance is forgiveness. Your partner might have done something wrong. If your relationship is what matters the most, however, you should let go instead of holding grudges.

, Every relationship calls for continuous rearrangements and resolutions of conflicts. If communication is smooth and equal, negotiation happens as a natural process. This also means you should know how to lose or give up an argument, if that's not what matters the most to you.


Surrendering doesn't mean passively fulfilling all of your partner's wants. It is an active choice to downsize your desire to be always right or in control. However, this must also occur on a mutual basis. If you're the one surrendering all the time, there is a power imbalance that needs to be worked out., If you think stress has had too much of an impact on your relationship and that you and your partner cannot solve the problem on your own, discuss with him or her the possibility of seeking professional help. A counselor will offer an objective point of view and help you focus on strategies to attack the problem.If your partner doesn't want to join you, you can still meet with a counselor or therapist on your own. This will provide an external outlet where you can take out your stress and get professional advice on how to deal with it."

Take some time off from your partner.,
Find alternative ways to decompress.,
Exercise.,
Share problems with your family and friends.",How to Deal With Stress in Relationships3," A relationship can often feel like a 24/7 job. However, it's perfectly natural to feel like spending some time on your own every once in a while, especially if you're under pressure. Find activities you can do by yourself without fearing that this would hurt the relationship.


If you're stressed because you feel you've lost your own self in a relationship, try to reaffirm your individuality and what makes you a unique person.
In fact, enjoying some independence will make you go back to your partner as a stronger individual. Missing each other is good: it helps you realize why your partner is so important and cherish the time you spend together.

, Especially if stress comes from outside the relationship, you should find external outlets so that you can unload the burden before being with your partner.


This depends on what way is best for you to decompress: sport works for many people. However, you might prefer reading, going out more often, walking or meditation.

, There is no better way to take the burden off your chest than shake it away with physical activity. Even if you're not exactly the sporty kind, you can be sure that sweating out stress will lessen its impact on your relationship.


The kind of activity depends on what you find most effective as a stress relief. Cardio activities like jogging, swimming or cycling can give you a chance to clear your mind. Or, you might prefer kickboxing or martial arts if you need to take out nervous tension. Yoga can work best if you wish to combine sport and meditation.

, Your partner shouldn't be the only person you unload your stress with. Talk to close friends or family members about your concerns and ask for their advice and sympathy.


If you talk to someone in your family, make sure they would be supportive. You don't want family issues to add more stress to what you're already going through!
Friends who care about you but are personally uninvolved in what's causing you stress could be the best people to talk to. For example, if stress comes from your job, look for support from a friend who's not linked to it.

Address the concern as soon as possible.,
Talk to your family without your spouse present.,
Advocate for your spouse.,
Get your family’s point of view.,
Use “I” language.,
Avoid nitpicking your family’s behavior.",How to Deal With Family Members That Dislike Your Spouse1," If your spouse has complained to you about your family, you want to work to solve the problem as quickly as you can. Ignoring or delaying addressing the issue can result in a resentful spouse.


Ignoring the problem will make your spouse dislike being around your family even more, and it will also start to impact your relationship.
Let your partner know how and when you plan to address the issue. For example, you could say, “I’m going to bring this up when my mom and I have lunch next week.” Having a concrete plan of action will ease your spouse’s mind and will hold you accountable to follow through.;
, Bring your concerns to a family member (perhaps one who could share the information with other family members as necessary) on behalf of your spouse. Your family has more experience in relating to you than your spouse. You also understand your family’s dynamics better than your spouse, and you have a better idea how to interact with them.Have a conversation with your family member over the phone or in person.
Let them know how your spouse feels. Listen to your family member’s perspective. Keep in mind, your family member may have no idea that their behavior has hurt your spouse.
Ask for suggestions on how your family member thinks the situation could improve. For example, “What do you think we could do to help Carlos feel more included?”

, Explain how your spouse views the situation. Share your spouse’s feelings and give any background information you think is important.


Present a united front and indicate that this is causing you pain as well.
For example, “Lena feels that you don’t like her after you said she wasn’t a good mother for not taking more maternity leave. She called you out on it, and both of us think you have been cold to her ever since. Did you know she only got two months of paid leave? It hurts both of us that you said that about her. It is not true, and we feel it was mean-spirited.”

, Find out if there is an issue you might need to address with your partner. Your spouse may not be an innocent party to this problem, and you may need to confront their behavior and/or encourage an apology.


Ask your family for specific instances where they felt hurt or angered by your spouse’s behavior.
Do not get defensive, just listen and let them know you will talk to your spouse about it.
Bring it up with your spouse privately and decide on a course of action together.

, When bringing up frustrations you and your spouse feel with your family, focus the conversation on your emotional reactions to the situation (or your spouse’s). Your emotions are not able to be disputed--you feel what you feel--but they will become defensive about their behavior.Say you and your spouse are upset about how your spouse was treated at a recent family event. Instead of saying, “You guys were really rude to Ryan at dinner,” try saying, “Ryan was upset about the dinner conversation. He felt hurt that he wasn’t included in the conversation, and he felt that you and Mom would talk right over him whenever he tried to speak.”
You could say, “It upsets me when I see you not make an effort to include Monica in the conversation” instead of “You don't include Monica.”
Avoid “always” or “never.” These are absolutes and very unlikely to be true, and are very likely to escalate an argument.For example, “You’re always telling Lindsey to lose weight,” would be better phrased as, “Lindsey and I can think of several times you have commented on her weight. The most recent time was last week at the ice cream shop.”
Be specific about the upsetting situation. Say it happened “at Greg’s birthday party and again at the restaurant last week” instead of “it happens all the time.”

, If you see an overall pattern of disrespectful behavior or rudeness, for example, it’s okay to call them out. But one-time oversights and slights may not be worth getting into. Make a mental note of what you see and determine if it is indicative of a larger pattern.


For example, it’s not worth getting into a fight with your family if they forgot to set an extra place setting at dinner for your spouse one time. “Forgetting” your spouse time and time again, however, is worth bringing up in conversation.

Beware of H.A.L.T.,
Hold off a conversation until your emotions are under control.,
Practice emotion regulation by self-soothing.If you notice that your feelings continue to cloud your judgment, you need to get them under control first.,
Write it down.,
Practice active listening.,
Use ""I"" statements.,
Attend to the present moment.,
Address the behavior, not the person.,
Sit side-by-side.,
Use humor.,
Respect individual differences.,
Celebrate each battle you overcome together.,
Seek counseling for particularly difficult issues.",How to Deal With Conflict in Relationships," Recovery and self-help groups use an acronym, H.A.L.T., to determine certain conditions that could make you emotionally vulnerable.This acronym can be useful for all individuals to know when you are low on resources and cannot effectively deal with stressful situations like an argument with your boyfriend.


Sometimes, it is better to attend to your most basic needs before trying to resolve relationship conflict. Assess yourself before trying to communicate with your partner. If you are hungry, angry, lonely, or tired, it may be best to delay the discussion until those needs have been met.;
, Gaining control of your emotions is the first action step of any conflict resolution plan. Allowing anger, frustration, or rejection to overcome you clouds your better judgment and can result in you saying or doing something you later regret. When you are in control of your emotions, you can hold a discussion that is productive for the relationship.

, Gain control of your emotions with regulation techniques like:


Practicing deep breathing with the 4-7-8 method. Inhale through your nose for 4 counts. Hold the breath for 7 counts, and then release the air through your mouth for 8 counts.
Practice mindfulness meditation by attending to the bodily sensations you are experiencing. While deep breathing, try to label what emotion you are feeling and look for sensations that support the emotion (e.g. clenched fists, tight shoulders, etc.)
Phone a friend to vent or take your mind off what's troubling you.
Take your dog for a walk.
Listen to soothing music.

, Journaling can be a great way to relieve stress, understand what you are thinking, and gather your thoughts after a disagreement.Journaling can be used as an emotion regulation technique or as a form of problem-solving, or both.


Grab a pen and pad and freely write about the problem you are having with your partner. Describe in as much detail as you can what you're thinking, feeling, and wanting to do. Writing out the problem can help you better understand both sides of the disagreement.
You can even use your journal as a role-play tool for what you would like to say to your partner after a disagreement. You might start an entry out as ""Dear, boyfriend/girlfriend..."". The process of writing out what you are feeling can help you clarify your thoughts and decide what to do.

, Communication is the key that unlocks the door of conflict. Effective communication requires careful and attentive listening to your partner, and vice versa. Many problems arise during communication when you are listening to reply rather than listening to understand. Try these active listening tips:Eliminate distractions---turn off the TV and put your phones on silent.
Turn and face your partner. Lean forward towards the person. Make eye contact.
Hear your partner's entire perspective before speaking.
Paraphrase what you heard by saying something like ""It sounds like you're saying...""
Try to empathize by looking for something about your partner's perspective that you agree with.

, When it's time for you to share your own perspective be sure to speak effectively. A great combination is to use ""I"" statements in conjunction with ""X, Y, Z"" statements.Using an ""I"" statement allows you to take ownership for your own thoughts/feelings and minimizes your partner's defensiveness. The ""X, Y, Z"" part helps your partner see specifics.
For example, you might say ""When you come home(X) and immediately go to bed(Y), I feel very ignored(Z)"". The statement can become even more effective when you start with ""Z"" or the ""I"" statement: ""I feel very ignored when you come home and immediately go to bed"".

, Many times a small issue becomes amplified when one or the other starts bringing up past issues. Always try to focus on the present moment and the problem at hand.When you bring up past issues, your ability to work through them becomes even more difficult. If this happens, one of you can easily point out, ""Hey, sweetheart, let's not bring up the past. Let's figure out what can we do about the here and now. Ok?""

, Another potential roadblock to effective communication occurs when one or the other partner attacks the person rather than the issue. If one of you goes into a long rant about the other's personality traits, defensiveness and anger will probably pop up.


Talk about a specific behavior, such as leaving dirty laundry strewn across the floor instead of calling your partner ""messy"" or a ""pig"". Your partner will be much more willing to work on one behavior if you don't insult who they are as a person in general., Tense discussions are difficult to maneuver without taking eye contact into consideration. When bringing up particularly difficult topics, relationship experts suggest starting off in a side-by-side orientation.


Research shows that men especially respond better when doing shared tasks like housework or walking the dog.Once the tense, awkward topic initiation is over, you two can face one another and talk one-on-one.

, A great way to manage a tense disagreement is to introduce an aspect of playfulness or lightheartedness. A conflict between lovers can be more swiftly resolved and the tension can be diffused when one of you uses humor.Humor must be used at the right time--ideally, when you are laughing with the other person and not at her.
Research shows that affiliative humor, that is, inside jokes that connect people, is most useful during conflict.For example, if your girlfriend tends to go to sleep with the TV on, you might joke with her and ask whether she's still tuning in to her favorite show in her dreams. This joking nature can help her become aware of the issue (leaving the TV on), while keeping the discussion lighthearted.

, Many argue that respect is equal to love in fostering growth and strengthening the bonds of a relationship.Your relationship will only continue to flourish when you make your partner feel respected. Respecting your partner's differences means:


Demonstrating an understanding that his/her opinions, thoughts, ideas, and beliefs may be different from your own
Showing an interest in his/her unique opinions
Validating his/her opinions even if you do not agree with them

, Use the conflict that you and your partner face as a tool that deepens your bond. If you do this, you will come to welcome conflict because you see it as a way to bring the two of you closer.Once you have hashed out your differences and come to a mutual agreement about an issue, don't hesitate to turn up the dial on laughter, affection, and warmth. Rejoice in the idea that you successfully overcame conflict.

, If you and your mate can't seem to come to agreement or even agree to disagree about a problem, it may be wise to seek professional counseling.This would be an option for an issue that one or both of you deems significant to the health of the relationship. One that, if not overcome, can create long-term discord between you.
Seeking professional help can equip you with the appropriate communication and problem-solving skills to handle bigger issues that arise in your relationship over time.

Identify toxic relationships.,
Brainstorm solutions.,
Think carefully about the costs of severing a relationship.,
Come to terms with the consequences of not cutting ties.",How to Detach from Dysfunctional Relatives1," Think about your current family relationships. Identify the ones that are toxic, and distinguish them from the ones that are simply difficult.You may want to work with a mental health professional if you feel comfortable with this. A mental health professional can help you to identify toxic relationships.


Abuse, constant negativity, and manipulation are several indications that a relationship is toxic.
The line between a difficult relationship and a toxic one can be blurry. Trust your own judgment and keep in mind that some people may try to minimize what you are experiencing. However, if you know someone is abusive, then do not accept other people’s excuses for them.;
, Think about whether you can find ways to deal with dysfunctional family dramas without cutting relatives out of your life. Consider skipping certain family gatherings, standing up to bullies, or ignoring conflicts instead of arguing with your relatives.Finding a simple solution may not always be possible. However, de-escalating negative situations is often less stressful than cutting ties completely.
Look into ALANON, which is a group that started as a way to help and support the family members of people with substance abuse. However, this organization has expanded to help people in all sorts of situations.

, Before you detach yourself from a relative, think about how the action may affect the rest of your life, including your other family relationships. Make sure you’re prepared to deal with the potential negative consequences of cutting ties.For example, you might choose to cut ties with one sibling who has toxic tendencies and your others sibling may see this as an affront. As a result, you lose two siblings. You will have to weigh the costs of whether the toxic person is worth keeping around to preserve other relationships.
Try making a pros and cons list to help you determine if severing the relationship is worth the benefits and costs. Keep it somewhere that you can read over it often. You may also want to ask a friend or family member to help you with making the list because they might think of some things that you would not.

, Just as breaking away from dysfunctional relatives will cause emotional pain or discord, it might also bring you peace. This is especially true if your relatives tend to muddy your life with their toxic behaviors.For instance, if you have family members who steal, lie, cheat, bully, or abuse drugs and alcohol, they likely cause you more stress than joy. Your mental health and peace of mind will benefit from stepping away from these people.
Look over your pros and cons list if you have already made one. If not, then make a pros and cons list to help you understand the costs and benefits if you decide not to cut ties. Read over your list often and ask a friend or family member to help you add to it.

Have conversation starters ready.,
Discuss an exit strategy ahead of time.,
Leave if it gets hostile.,
Limit contact.",How to Deal With Family Members That Dislike Your Spouse2," Give suggestions to your spouse and/or your family ahead of time to help pave the way for better relations. Suggest “safe” discussion topics to both parties.Tell your spouse or your family about common interests. For example, “John, I’m not sure if I mentioned that you and my brother both love skiing.”
Bring up each other’s interesting hobbies. Perhaps your grandmother has fascinating travel stories she loves to share, or your spouse coaches soccer on weekends.
Make sure to mention what kinds of conversation topics to avoid as well. As a general rule, politics and religion are bad to discuss unless you are sure everyone is on the same page with their beliefs., If your spouse struggles to get along with your family and finds family events stressful, have a plan in place to leave if needed. You may decide to:


Give your family a departure time when you arrive. For example, “We need to leave by noon. We have to pick up a friend from the airport.”
Have your spouse send you a text message when they are ready to go.
Have your spouse give you a prearranged signal, like a gesture or a phrase that means they want to leave. For example, your partner could stand behind you and rub your shoulders to indicate they want to go, while you are still around your family members.
Let your spouse know acceptable ways to check out for a bit, if leaving isn’t an option. For example, “In my family, no one cares if we’re all sitting together and someone is reading a newspaper or magazine. You can do this if you feel like you need a break and no one will question you.”

, If a fight breaks out in the middle of a family event between your spouse and your family, or if your family is consistently treating your spouse poorly, enforce a break and leave with your spouse.Try not to let your partner leave the event alone. You want to indicate to your family that you are supporting your spouse.


For example, you could say, “I think this situation is getting to be stressful for everyone. Kate and I are going to leave now. I’m sorry to disappoint you, but I am getting upset and we need to take a break.”
If you are at an event where you can’t get away easily (for example, on vacation), call a timeout for a few hours or the remainder of the day. In the meantime, get as much physical distance as you can between you and your spouse and your family.

, If the relationship between your family and your spouse continues to deteriorate, consider limited their exposure to each other, perhaps confined to holidays or important family events.Discuss with your spouse how much family time will be acceptable to both of you so you have a plan ready when the next invitation comes.
You may wish to reveal the reasons that your spouse is no longer accompanying you to family events, but you do not have to. You can make an excuse for your spouse (for example, they have to work), if you feel that will be a better way to keep the peace.
You may find that a cooling off period is all your family or your spouse require, and they may be able to move forward after a break. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, after all.
You may also find your family or your spouse more willing to make an effort after a significant life change, like the birth of a child, a death in the family, or a move.

Support your spouse.,
Teach your spouse about your family.,
Give your spouse effective strategies in dealing with your family.",How to Deal With Family Members That Dislike Your Spouse3," Whether or not you see the problem in your spouse’s relationship with your family, be supportive of your partner and be sure to stand up for their feelings if you need to. You may need to put your marriage ahead of your family of origin, and your family should recognize the importance of the bond between you and your spouse.If you have a hard time understanding where your spouse is coming from, consider that they probably want to keep the peace just as much as you do. Most people understand that family is a sensitive topic and do not wish to rock the boat.
You might not see your spouse’s concerns as a big deal, but consider how you would want your spouse to react if the roles were reversed, and you had a problem with your spouse’s family. Show empathy towards your spouse.

, Let them know what to expect so as to avoid any surprises. Share your family’s background, jobs, personalities, or whatever information you think would be helpful to your partner.


Address any potential conflict points before your spouse and your family see each other. For example, “Uncle Bill loves to talk about gun rights. I know you don’t like guns, so if he brings it up, it’s okay to try to change the subject or walk away.”, Families are like little cultures all their own, and what might be acceptable in one family is not in another.Let your partner know how your family handles communication and conflict. Since you likely know both your spouse’s family and your family, you can compare the two and address differences.


For example, your spouse may be from a noisy family where you have to shout to be heard at the dinner table. Your family may be much quieter. Let your spouse know that yelling would be considered very rude to your family.

Stop trying to change the dysfunctional person.,
Avoid blaming yourself or others for your relative’s behavior.,
Create healthy boundaries.,
Distance yourself.",How to Detach from Dysfunctional Relatives2," Accept that your relative will never start behaving differently unless they want to. Don’t try to talk them into changing or make them understand how you feel. Instead, take a step back and make a conscious decision to prioritize your own well-being instead of theirs for a while. If your relative is self-destructive, understand that you cannot save them from themselves. You may even be inadvertently encouraging their behavior by giving them the attention they want.
Do not feel like you have to explain your choices, especially not more than once. Also, do not get pulled into a conversation where you end up defending your choices.

, Your family member is completely responsible for their own actions, no matter what they might say to the contrary. Don’t make excuses for them or let them tell you it’s your fault.Passive aggression is a favorite tactic of toxic people. If your family member becomes passive-aggressive with you, recognize it for the manipulative tactic it is, and don’t let it get under your skin. It is best not to respond at all, and then vent about it later to a trusted friend or therapist.

, Decide which situations and behaviors you’re no longer willing to deal with. Let your family members know what they can expect from you and what you need from them. Be firm about your boundaries. Don’t back down or apologize for them.Make a list of the behaviors you will not tolerate. Share this list with your family. You might say, ""I lent out a great deal of money to Jeff, and he never bothered to pay me back. For this reason, I won't be lending money to family anymore.""
Asserting your boundaries may take time and practice if you’ve let other people push you around in the past. If someone tries to convince you to violate a boundary, say something like ""We've already discussed this. I'm firm on my decision."" If they continue to push, then it is okay to ignore it. Hang up the phone or end the conversation when they start to push against a boundary.

, Whether you’re planning on severing the relationship or not, create some distance between yourself and your dysfunctional family member. Avoid visiting them, talking to them on the phone, or attending family gatherings where they’re present. Notice how you feel when your relative isn’t an active part of your life.Distancing yourself can create a sense of guilt, especially if you’ve been in a codependent relationship with your relative. Don’t feel obligated to break your silence before you’re ready.
Getting some time and space away from your relative can help you gain perspective and decide whether to cut ties for good.
Decide what you will say to other family members who ask about your decision to distance yourself. Make sure to keep this brief and firm and don’t open it up for discussion. For example, you might say something like, “I decided that getting some distance was the healthiest thing for me, and so far it has been.”

Give yourself permission to take care of yourself.,
Feel your emotions.,
Spend time with supportive people.,
Get outside help.",How to Detach from Dysfunctional Relatives3," If you have healthy family relationships, nurture them. Emotional support is especially important when you’re having family problems, and often, your other family members will understand what you’re going through better than anyone else.Because of their inside perspective on your situation, your other family members may have good advice for how to handle your dysfunctional relatives.

, If you’re used to putting other people’s needs and feelings first, you might not be in the habit of practicing good self-care. Work on achieving a healthy balance between fulfilling your responsibilities and taking care of your own well-being.Don’t feel guilty about taking care of yourself. Remember that you’re just as worthy of care as anyone else.
Make your health a priority by getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising.
Set aside some time every day or every week to do something you enjoy.
Try appointing an accountability partner who can point out when you start putting other people’s needs ahead of your own needs.

, Instead of suppressing your emotions, find healthy ways to acknowledge them and let them out. Try writing in a journal, venting to someone you trust, or going for a long walk.Experiencing your emotions is the only way to work through them.
It’s common to feel angry after living through a dysfunctional family situation, particularly if your parents were the dysfunctional ones.
Keep in mind that loneliness is a common emotion for people who are going through this process, even if you are spending time with supportive friends and family. It can be sad to lose someone who was a significant figure in your life. Just keep in mind that you will begin to feel better as you continue to heal.

, You can’t choose your family, but you can decide which friends to surround yourself with. Work on developing the positive, mutually beneficial relationships in your life. Seek out the people who make you feel loved and who are there for you when you need them., Distancing yourself from dysfunctional family members can bring up emotions that are hard to deal with alone. If you’re struggling to cope, make an appointment with a counselor or therapist.Support groups can also be helpful in dealing with feelings like guilt and anger.

, If you feel like your partner has all of a sudden changed (especially for the worst), consider that your partner always had these traits, but you’re seeing him or her differently now.

You may not want to immediate blame your partner for the changes and instead, recognize that your perception may have changed.if you’re really bothered by something your partner does, recognize that it’s your own annoyance that is bothering you, not your partner. Find ways to cope with your feelings of annoyance or upset, such as learning to tune out behaviors or taking deep breaths.

, Don’t take differences in views or beliefs personally.Just because you and your partner have different views doesn’t mean that one is attacking the other. It doesn’t mean that your approach is lesser than and there doesn’t have to be a “best” and “worse.” It just means that you disagree, and it’s okay to accept those differences.


It’s okay to call some topics “off limits” if you know that they bring conflict with no resolution. Things like politics or religion can cause major disagreements with no obvious resolution. Agree not to discuss certain topics together.

, If the change causes confusion or strong emotions, take some time away from each other and away from arguing.Make sure that you agree on the amount of time and that you use the time to think about the problem. Simply taking time away from each other will not solve the problem.


For example, you might just need to take a 15 minute break in separate rooms, or you might agree to take a week to think things over separately and then meet to resume the discussion again at a set time and place.
Do some digging and ask yourself why this change affects you so much. Is there something the change is triggering? Are there fears or worries? Figure out what is upsetting you or filling you with fear.
For example, if you used to agree on having kids and now you disagree, take some time to figure out why your position is so important for you. Where are the fears from? Why is it that you feel so strongly? You may want to journal your thoughts and feelings.

, Changes can be hard on both people in a relationship. Even if you’re struggling, reach out and support your partner. Let your partner know that he or she is important to you and that you care about the relationship.Give affection, care, and respect, and express yourself through thoughtful words and gestures.


Say, “This is hard, and I’m struggling. Yet, I want you to know I care about you and I want this relationship to work. I’m here and willing to support you.”

, Talk about how big changes affect each of you separately and how they affect the relationship as a whole.Let your partner express his or her feelings completely. It may not be an easy conversation and may extend to several conversations. However, it’s important to communicate clearly with your partner when big changes occur.


Be honest about how you feel. Use “I statements” to convey your feelings.For example, say, “I feel nervous and anxious about you starting night school. I feel like I’ll see less of you, which makes me feel sad. At the same time, I’m proud of you and want you to pursue what makes you happy.”

, While you may want to express your thoughts, needs, and feelings to your partner as soon as change comes up, take a step back and ask your partner about how he or she is experiencing the change.Listen intently and let your partner communicate his or her thoughts, feelings, and needs. Show your partner your care by being available to listen.


Improve your listening skills by reflecting and restating what your partner says.For example, say, “I hear you saying that this change is hard on you too, and that you feel it’s important to go through with this, even though it’s difficult.”
Validate your partner’s feelings.Say, “I can tell it’s really hard for you to talk about your father’s death, and you feel depressed. I can understand why this is so hard for you.”

, When faced with changes, remind yourself how much you value your partner and your relationship.How much are you willing to let the changes affect your relationship? For example, if your partner gets a new job across the country, you may feel upset with him or her. Keep in mind your relationship and respond in ways that show that you are prioritizing your relationship.


If you’re upset, ask yourself whether it’s worth making your partner “pay” for the changes, or whether it’s better to keep things in perspective and value your partner.

, When you are faced with changes, it is impossible to know what might happen and trying to identify and think about every detail of a situation can be paralyzing. Instead, prepare as well as you reasonably can for a situation, and then take a step back. Deal with the challenges that come your way one at a time and be flexible enough to adapt as needed.

For example, if you and your partner have to spend some time apart because one of you gets a job that requires lots of travel, then you might anticipate some challenges. However, don’t try to identify every single possible challenge ahead of time and work out solutions to each one in advance. Instead, work out solutions to a few of the big challenges that you might face and then focus on other challenges as they arise.
For example, you could come up with a plan for known challenges, such as child care, managing household tasks while the other is away, and communicating. Having a plan for known challenges that you both agree on can help both of you feel like you have some structure even as you head into unknown territory.

, You may come to a point where you realize that your relationship needs intervention and therapy may be necessary to deal with the changes.A couples counselor can help you and partner improve your communication, and state your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs in truthful and meaningful ways. Especially in periods of transition and change, therapy can be an invaluable tool for getting through challenging times.


You can also work on emotional avoidance and dysfunctional behavior in the relationship., Touch can provide support on physiological and psychological levels.Maintain touch with your partner through times of change. Hold hands, put your arms around each other, and show that you want to be close together.


Maintain your sex life and prioritize having sex together.Scheduling sex doesn’t sound sexy, but it can help you connect regularly.

, If you’re feeling disoriented by change, bring something old and familiar back into your relationship.Maintain a sense of normalcy (or nostalgia) by doing something you used to do together once again.


Perhaps you enjoyed watching old episodes of “I Love Lucy” together when you first started dating. Invite your partner to watch an episode with you. Re-create a date you both enjoyed or eat a treat you have fond memories of together.

, Find an activity that both of you want to do and do it together. Even when change might feel bad, do something new that feels good. Doing something new together can ignite feelings of excitement and emotional intimacy.Go ice skating or spelunking. Try a new activity together such as golf or painting. Whatever it is, make it fun and appealing to each of you.

, Plan time to spend time together, just the two of you. This can be a great way to reconnect and enjoy time together on a regular basis. Keeping your dates consistent can give you something to look forward to and a way to know that you can spend time meaningfully connecting.Avoid topics like finances and focus on reminiscing about when you were first dating, fond memories of your kids, and other pleasant memories.

, You may want to take some time off from experiencing changes and have some time together, just the two of you. Take a weekend and go somewhere nice where you can spend time together, be affectionate, and enjoy each other’s company. It can be nice to get away from pressures and deadlines and changes to just having time together.Get out of the house and away from the to-do lists. Go somewhere that brings you peace and calm and inspires connection with your partner.

Know when to call it quits.",How to Deal With a Player," If you’re positive that you have a living, breathing player on your hands, then the first thing you need to do is to decide if you really want to engage. If you’re sensitive, looking for true love, and want a man you can spend a lot of your time with, then you should not engage. However, if you’re okay with being with a guy who sees other people, and with seeing other people yourself, then you can go for it, but you should know what to expect before you start the relationship.


Of course, before you decide if you want to play, you have to make sure you’re dealing with a player first. Don’t use reputation alone to make your decision, and see for yourself. Check to see if the guy really does see multiple girls at once or if he’s just a flirt; there’s a big difference.;
, One way to keep yourself from getting hurt is to not expect the world from the player. He can take you out to dinner, he can kiss you passionately in the moonlight later, and he can whisper sweet nothings in your ear all night long, but he won’t be there to pick up soup for you when you’re feeling sick or to meet your mother. As long as you know what the player is good and isn’t good for, you’ll be able to deal with him without a problem.


If you’re looking to find Mr. Right, then he may not be it. Though some players do change and settle down, this is not the norm.

, If you’re the jealous type, then there’s no sense in trying to get anything going with a player. If you find yourself getting jealous when you’re dating completely monogamous, totally committed guys, then dating a player is out of the question for you. However, if you’re okay with more casual flings and don’t care who else is texting your man — and don’t care if he knows who else is texting you — then you’ll be able to deal with the player much more easily.


If you express jealousy, then the player is likely to back off, since he won’t have the patience to deal with it. As soon as you start getting suspicious or antsy, he’ll begin to suspect this isn’t the right thing for him. Then again, if you really are upset because he’s seeing other girls, then back out.

, Players aren’t there to take the big relationship steps with you. There’s no sense in trying to get a player to really commit to you, whether you want him to move in with you, meet your sister and friends, or take a weekend hike with you. If he’s not into all that, then trying to force it will only make him more cautious around you. Of course, wanting commitment from a man is perfectly natural, but it’s not likely that you’ll be getting it from a player.


Instead, let things go at their own pace. In an ideal situation, things just reach a natural progression, and you’ll both takes to grow closer when the time is right. If you feel like you’re always pressuring him, then it’s a sign that you want something more and that you should move on.

, Another way to make sure you don’t get too attached to the player is not to take him too seriously. Don’t read into every little phone call, text message, or Facebook wall post that he makes, thinking that it means something big for your relationship. Be more lighthearted about him and you’ll see that you’ll be saving yourself a lot of stress in the process. If he shows up late to your date, you can school him a little, but you can’t let him ruin your night. After all, a player sticks to his own schedule.


Being with a player is all about having fun, and you should enjoy the carefree benefits of the relationship. If you hold the player to the same standards as a serious boyfriend or a husband, then you are bound to be disappointed.

, The best thing you can do with a player is not let him get into your head or your heart. Don’t think about taking vacation with him next summer. Don’t think about what a great dad he’ll be, or how sexy he’ll look with some gray in his hair. Don’t sit around twirling your hair thinking about what he’s up to, either. If you start getting attached to a player as if he were a responsible, committed man, then you’re bound to set yourself up for heartbreak.


If you find yourself lonely whenever you’re not with him or wondering what he’s up to or when you’ll get to see him next, then you have already gotten attached. It’s perfectly natural to get attached in a relationship — but if you get attached to a player, you’re setting yourself up to fail.

, Another thing you can do to manage your expectations, as well as the expectations of the player, is to let him know early on what will fly and what won’t. If you’re not cool with him disappearing for hours with no explanation, you can say so. If you’re not down with him checking out other girls in front of you, then let it be known. If he thinks he can get away with anything around you, then there will be no stopping him.


Another thing you can do is let him know if you’re not okay with the late-night booty call. If he texts you or calls you asking to hang after midnight, tell him you want a date first so he knows what to do, next time. If you let him get away with these antics early on, then it’ll be harder for him to break the habit.

, If you really want to date a player, then you can be a playerette, if that’s your thing. If he’s seeing other girls while dating you, then what’s there to stop you from hanging out with a few other guys you’re crushing on? If he goes out late without saying what he’s up to, you’re free to do the same. Contrary to popular belief, not every single girl out there is looking for a stable relationship, kids, or a white picket fence. If you want to be a playerette, too, then go for it; of course, if that’s not your thing, don’t feel compelled to beat him at his own game.


However, if you were dating a player without realizing it, that’s a different story. If you found this out the hard way and you’re much more into monogamy, let him know that he really hurt you, but don’t feel compelled to fight fire with fire if it’s not in your nature.

, Another way to get a player’s attention is to play hard to get. If he thinks you’re at his beck and call, then he won’t have any incentive to chase you down. To play hard to get, don’t be there to answer the phone every time he calls. Don’t be available if he asks you out the day-of, or even the day before. Flirt with him, but don’t make him think he has you in the palms of his hands. Let him see that you’re worth the chase.


Don’t tell him how much you love him all the time. Just be flirty and give him a few compliments while teasing him and keeping things light instead.
Make him work for it. Show him that you still expect to have nice dates, go dancing, or do whatever you want to do together if he plans to roll with you.

, Don’t let a player get to know exactly who you are. You can reveal things to him, but don’t pour out your heart and soul to him, or you’re bound to be disappointed. You don’t have to lie or pretend like you don’t have feelings, but you don’t want to be completely vulnerable around the player unless you want to get burned. If he starts opening up to you a bit, you can follow suit, but make sure not to give too much up at once.


Letting your guard down can be tempting, especially if you’re with someone you’re really starting to like. However, the more you reveal to him, the more you’ll regret later when your relationship is over. You can tell him what’s on your mind, but avoid telling him your deepest, darkest secrets may lead you to cringe later.

, If you want to date a player, then you can’t spend all of your time at his side. You have to continue to be an independent woman and to enjoy the time you spend with your friends, doing the things you love, from yoga to writing poetry, and to maybe even look out for other guys while you’re at it. If you start doing all of the things the player does and losing interest in your own hobbies and your own lives, then a red flag will go up for him.


Don’t ever forget about spending time with your girlfriends. They will center you and will remind you of who you really are. If you ditch them for the player, then they won’t be there when you come crawling back to them.
Pursuing your own hobbies and interests can help you develop your identity and to stay centered. Don’t give up the things you love to do on your own to spend time with the player all the time.

, Don’t count on a player for too much quality time. Though you can go out once or even twice a week, he won’t be the guy who watches TV in his pajamas with you all day, and he won’t be free to meet up for lunch or brunch whenever you’re missing him. If you’re co-dependent or the type of person who loves spending 24/7 with whomever she’s dating, then this player is not for you.


Instead, fill your schedule with time with your friends, as well as time to be on your own to decompress and do your own thing, and you’ll be better off.

, If he’s a true player, then his friends may not take the time to really get to know you because they’ll be seeing you as the latest Flavor of the Week. Still, if you start coming around more often, there’s no need to be less than nice or even cold to his friends; work to be friendly with them and to show that you want to get to know them a bit without butting in to their conversations too much. At the end of the day, a player cares what his friends think about his girl, so it’s important to leave them with a good impression.


You may not think his friends are the greatest people in the world, but nothing is stopping you from saying hi and asking how they’re doing when you see them. Make it easier for yourself to get along with them, and your time with the player will be more enjoyable.

, If you want to date a player, then you can’t let him make all the calls. He may think that he can tell you where to meet him and what you’ll be doing all the time, but it’s up to you to show him that you have other ideas. He can pick when and where to hang out, sometimes, but you can do the same. You don’t have to hang out around his schedule, either; he can hang out when it’s best for you. Staying in control of the relationship will make the player see that you’re a force to be reckoned with.


If the player feels like he has you under his thumb, he’ll be much less intrigued than he’d be if you’re behind the steering wheel.

, That’s right. If you want the player to stay interested, then you can’t put all your eggs in one basket, either. Make it known that you’re open to seeing other people, that you’re not closing down your walls just for him and that you’re just as free-spirited as he is. If you’re looking for something more serious and know he’s not it, it’s cool to keep hanging with him while looking for something more, if he knows the score. Don’t feel restricted to just hanging out with the player if he’ll be doing his own thing, too.


Plus, if you’re looking for something more than a player, keeping your options open can lead you to find that special guy you were looking for. If you’re bogged down with a player all the time, you may be missing out on the perfect guy.

, If you want to keep a player interested, then you’ve got to keep him feeling alert, and like he doesn’t know exactly what to expect from you. You can challenge him, show him that you’re not afraid of proving him wrong when it’s necessary, and avoid letting him “teach” you how to do everything, from playing pool to mini-golfing. Let him see that you’re watching him and you expect his A-game, too.Show him that you’re capable, too. If he teases you, respond with a quick comeback. If he spouts off his baseball knowledge, spit out a few impressive facts. Show him that you’re ready to play ball.

, A player doesn’t want a girl who puts it all on the line. You don’t have to let him know exactly who you are and what’s on your mind. If you’re stepping out to meet a friend, you don’t have to say who it is. If you moved around a lot as a kid, you can leave it at that instead of giving him all the details. If you show up late, you don’t have to say what held you up all the time. You don’t need to lie to shroud yourself in a bit of mystery.


Though you don’t need to wear black sunglasses or an edgy hat, you can work on being less completely open so the player will have to do more work to get to know you.

, You can talk to the player, but avoid calling him every day or texting him every night to check in or to say that you’re thinking of him. You can call him first when you feel like it, but make sure you take turns reaching out to each other. Don’t feel compelled to send him an email or Facebook message with a link to an article that made you think of him; you can save that for your future boyfriend. Limiting your communication will show him that you have better things to do than to worry about him all the time, and he’ll be even more intrigued by you.


As a rule, you should text each other about the same amount. If he’s calling you a lot, then you should call him at least a few times to keep things fairly even.

, If he’s a player, then you can play on. Dance it up with some other guys, and if you’re in an open relationship, let them take you out to dinner, too. You shouldn’t do this just to make the player jealous, but if there are other guys you like and you and the player are okay with doing your thing, then you don’t need to be secretive. Show him that you’re okay with doing your own thing, too.


Just make sure that it’s not the case that you and the player actually like each other and that you’re just using other people to make each other jealous. That happens, too.

, Though dating a player can be a fun way to pass a summer or a boring cold winter, there will come a time when you need to cut the player loose. There can be a number of reasons for doing this, but the one that comes up the most is that you find yourself getting too attached without getting anything back. Be honest with yourself and make sure not to prolong the relationship if you find yourself really wanting something more.


Trust your gut. If you suspect that you’re starting to feel some heartache, then that’s probably the case. If you think your feelings are too strong and the player isn’t going to be there for you, then it’s time to say your goodbyes.

Seek out support.",How to Deal with a Passive Aggressive Husband," It’s important to identify and understand passive aggressive behavior and not jump to conclusions about your husband’s behavior. The biggest denotation of passive aggressive behavior is a mismatch between someone’s actions and behaviors, especially around anger, and passive aggressiveness can be thought of as a covert way of showing anger.Understanding the behavior can be helpful in identifying what is underlying your husband’s words or actions, and how you can respond to what underlies the passive aggression, and not just respond to the behavior.


Passive aggressiveness is different than the occasional defensiveness or lateness. A passive aggressive behavior is purposeful and often becomes a pattern.It’s easy to get sucked into this type of interaction, then feel blamed or at fault when this can be a tactic of manipulation.;
, Someone who is passive aggressive refuses to take responsibility for his behavior. Your husband may lie or blame you to skirt acknowledging that he hurt you (or someone else). Methods like rationalizing, making excuses, and minimizing may be ways of denying his behavior or the impact his actions make.Your husband may “forget” to pick up the dry cleaning, or say you didn’t remind him to get the kids after school.
He may pretend that he didn’t do something when there’s obvious evidence that he did.

, Somehow, no matter what, he finds a way to make everything your fault and not his. He may blame you for his anger and making him explode or hit you. He finds ways to evade responsibility and blame for hurting other people.Does your husband find ways to twist the truth in order to escape blame? Do you find him constantly blaming you for things that go wrong, even if you had nothing to do with them?

, Instead of articulating his wants and needs, he may walk off in the middle of an argument, stop talking to you or try to put an end to a discussion by saying, “Why should I even bother responding? You’re always right.” He may also withhold things like money, sex, or other items as a way to hold power.If your husband gives things away that are yours or throws away things that are important to you, this is also a form of withholding.
Does your husband try to exert power over you by withholding emotions? What about withholding things?

, It’s a way to say, “This isn’t important to me” or “what I’m doing is more important than what you planned.”


Do you find yourself often waiting for your husband to get off the computer or turn off the tv when you have something planned? Does he make excuses about being caught up at work or blaming traffic, more often than not?

, Doing tasks or chores half-heartedly can be a form of passive aggressiveness. He may procrastinate doing tasks, and then apply minimal effort so that you have to do it over for him afterward.Doing tasks in this way may be his way of saying, “I don’t care about this (or you), and I’ll make it obvious by not doing a good job.”


Does your husband often not complete tasks, find ways to put them off, or make excuses for why they were done poorly?

, Your husband may start being subtly passive aggressive without him even noticing it. The trick is to pick up on the behaviors before things spiral out of control. You may notice him slipping in his responsibilities ever so slightly, procrastinating more than usual, or finding excuses for things.When you notice these signs, you can disengage from the conflict before more overt passive aggression comes forth.

, While your first reaction may be to nag him or explode on him for his behavior, resist the urge to do so. You may turn into a parent role, which won’t go well for you or your husband.It’s unlikely you want to parent your husband, and it’s unlikely he wants to be placed in the child role in your marriage.


If you feel yourself about to react, stop yourself and take a moment. Think about the way you feel and what thoughts are going through your head. Take a deep breath before saying anything.

, If you start in on the passive aggressiveness, then you will cycle the behavior until both of you are utterly unhappy. Instead, approach him in saying, “We have a problem that we need to work through.”


If he is chronically late, say, “We have a difficulty getting out of the house in time when we have places to be. What do you think would be helpful in ensuring we get places on time?”

, Don’t let these tactics work on you any longer. If he says, “I’m not mad” but clearly is, make a request for him to be honest with you and share how he is feeling. If he says, “I was only joking”, make sure you communicate that those kind of jokes are disrespectful and not appreciated.


If he says, “Why are you so mad?” Communicate clearly that his behavior is upsetting. “When you don’t communicate with me, it’s really frustrating. I’d like to know what’s going on that feels challenging to you.”

, Instead of getting on his case, be diligent with your own needs and expectations. Don’t make any assumptions about your expectations. If you request him to do something, make sure you make it clear what needs to be done and by when it’s needs to be completed.Get in the habit of writing things down that need to be done. Don’t leave any room for ambiguity. The clearer you are, the less he is likely to find the wiggle room.

, Blaming and shaming your husband isn’t going to get you anywhere you want to be. So, hold off on the accusations and instead, let him know how you are feeling. Tell him what is bothering you, how it affects you (and the relationship), and what you would like to work toward.Instead of saying, “I really hate it when you don’t do the chores I ask you to do, I can’t believe you’re so lazy” say “It really bothers me that I feel I can’t count on you to do chores. It sets things back in the home and makes me feel stressed. Can we find a way to work together and make sure things get done in the house?”

, It’s likely your husband feels resentful or angry and doesn’t feel like he can voice his concern. It’s much easier to make it someone else’s problem instead of his own. He may intend to make you explode in anger so that more blame falls on you than on him.Recognize this pattern and decide whether you want to engage it or not.


When both of you are calm, have a real discussion about your feelings. Talk about what is and is not working for you, for him, and for you both as a married couple. Find ways to express your own resentment or anger and encourage him to do the same.

, Spend some quality time each week listening to each other, empathizing, and supporting each other. These are skills that may need to be built up, so you may not be an expert yet, but make an effort to do so. Show your husband that he can be emotionally expressive around you and that you will support him. And allow him to take this role for you, too.


Practice active listening by repeating or summarizing what your husband says.“I hear you saying that you had a rough day, and would rather not talk about finances tonight. Is that right?”
When your husband includes emotional content, empathize with the emotion. “I can see that you’re frustrated” or “Wow, that sounds really stressful, I would feel overwhelmed, too” are ways to communicate that you understand the emotion.

, If you are struggling to share compassion with your passive aggressive husband and find that fights continue to escalate, consider reaching out for help from a therapist. You can see a marriage therapist or an individual therapist. Therapy can be beneficial in modifying dysfunctional behavior, improve communication, and decrease emotional avoidanceRemember that you cannot change your husband, however, you can change how you react to him. A therapist can help you work to respond differently, even if your husband never changes.

Talk to your partner about your anxieties.,
Trust your partner.,
Be confident.,
Remind yourself of who you are.",How to Deal with Sexual Performance Anxiety1," Let your partner know what you're experiencing, and work together to find a way around those problems.Allow yourself to be vulnerable. When you see time and again that your partner does not think less of you in your most vulnerable state, you may begin to build trust in the relationship and confidence in yourself.;
, Some health professionals believe sexual performance anxiety may have some roots in social anxiety. All of the thoughts typically associated with sexual performance anxiety, whether of feeling self-conscious or feeling un-masculine/feminine, boil down to a fear of other people's judgment. Though it will take time and effort, counseling for couples or individual counseling may help you let go of your fears about yourself and allow you to trust your partner., Focus on the things you love about yourself and your body. Whether you feel insecure about your weight, your appearance, or any other physical factors, specialists agree that the first step to overcoming issues of self esteem lies in accepting yourself as you are: a wonderful human being who deserves to be happy.You are more than a sexual creature. Think about the positive qualities you have that your partner sees in you, and let yourself feel good about those qualities., One of the frequent causes of sexual performance anxiety is feeling guilty or otherwise bad about the things that pop up in sexual fantasies. The fear is that these kinks will come to define the person, and that he or she will end up acting them out in reality. Experts agree that fantasizing about a particular act or even a particular person does not necessarily mean that there is any real desire to actually act it out in real life.Be open and honest with your partner about what you like and don't like, and ask your partner to do the same.It's okay to have sexual fantasies and desires. You and your partner can act out your fantasies safely, through role playing or other strategies for couples."

Describe your feelings.,
Discuss the behaviors you feel are unacceptable.,
Explain your needs in your relationship.,
Discuss your commitment to your relationship.,
Include him in plans with your friends.,
Give your relationship time to heal.,
Be realistic about whether your relationship is worth fixing.",How to Deal With a Possessive Boyfriend1," Your boyfriend may not know he’s behaving in a way that feels possessive to you. Maybe this is his first relationship, or maybe his last girlfriend had a personality different to your own. He may be going through an event in his own life that is causing him to pull you closer than you’d prefer. Talking about your wants and needs in the relationship is always a good place to start.


Try beginning with examples: “When you call me multiple times when I’m with my girlfriends, I start to feel like you don’t trust me” or “It really troubles me when you don’t talk to me after I hang out with my guy friends.”
Provide specific instances of when you felt he was being possessive: “I felt really upset when we were at the football game and you gave me the silent treatment after I played horseshoes with my college friends.”
Avoid calling names; for instance, don’t call him “possessive.” Instead, you may want to say that you felt like his behavior was overly possessive and you felt suffocated. Calling names can result in an argument, but expressing your feelings should not.;
, This should be an explicit and private discussion in which you can openly talk about the types of behaviors that you do not want to tolerate in a relationship. These should be limited to issues that you are not willing to compromise on. Here are some examples of behaviors that you may feel are unacceptable:


Asking you to stop hanging out with your friends, especially male friends, without a good reason.
Telling you what to wear, or making comments if he feels you are wearing something “inappropriate.”
Calling or texting you repeatedly while you are away from him.
Going through your phone, email, or personal belongings.
Requiring explanations for your every move throughout the day.
Making you feel guilty for needing to change plans for a legitimate reason.
Giving you ultimatums or making threats if you aren’t making enough time for him.

, Your boyfriend may not know your unique needs in your relationship, so it is important that you communicate with him. This may help to alleviate his possessive behavior.


Explain your need for independent lives. Tell your boyfriend that even though you love spending time with him, it is important for you to be able to spend time with your friends and family as well. Having a life outside of your partner is a very important part of a healthy relationshipEncourage him to spend time with his friends and family without you, too.
Communicate your desire to be trusted. Just as you trust him, he should be able to trust you as well. This is the cornerstone of healthy relationships.
Negotiate some rules for your relationship: for example, both of you should be allowed to have and spend time with friends of the opposite sex; however, complete honesty, loyalty, and monogamy are to be expected.

, Possessive behavior is most commonly rooted in low self-esteem and insecurity.

If your boyfriend’s possessive behavior is mild, it may be worth it to remind him that you are committed to your relationship and he has no need to be concerned about your intentions.

Verbal affirmations are a powerful way to reassure your boyfriend. A simple “I love you and only you” can often do the trick.

, Often, his possessiveness will come from jealously as well as insecurity.Involving your boyfriend in some of your friend group’s activities can help him feel more comfortable about the life you lead when he’s not around.


In particular, it may be helpful to have your boyfriend meet your male friends. He may feel uncomfortable about other males with whom you spend time. However, this is not a reason for you to stop spending time with them; instead, invite your boyfriend along to show him that there is no threat to your relationship.

, After you’ve had a talk in which you explain negative feelings you’ve been having about your relationships, both of your emotions may be running high. This is a good time to take some time apart and reflect on what you’ve discussed, before coming back together and attempting to have a happier and healthier relationship than before.


Be aware that progress takes time. Your boyfriend will not change overnight. You must be willing to put in time and effort to help these changes in his possessive behavior take place.
Don’t be afraid to point out when he relapses into his possessive ways. Don’t let him get away with it when he does. Instead, call him out on the behavior immediately and explain to him how it makes you feel.
Encourage him when he’s loving without being possessive. When he behaves in a way that you appreciate, tell him. This will make him want to do it more often.

, If your boyfriend wants to change his behavior and is willing to respect your feelings and listen to your wants and needs in your relationship, you may be willing to give your relationship another shot. However, if you are feeling depressed, scared, anxious, or fearful, you should leave the relationship.


Remember that as much as you want him to change, you cannot change him. He must be willing to initiate and follow through with the change in his own behavior.

Try cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).",How to Deal with Sexual Performance Anxiety3," Sexual performance anxiety manifests itself in a number of different ways. It's important to identify how the anxiety is affecting you—both physically and psychologically—before you can learn to deal with it.

Prepare to break up with your possessive boyfriend.,
Go through with the breakup.,
Prepare yourself for potential backlash.,
Get support from friends and family.,
Get professional help if you need it.,
Give yourself time to heal.",How to Deal With a Possessive Boyfriend2," If your boyfriend’s possessive behavior is escalating, or is already at a concerning level, it is important to recognize that you probably cannot change him (at least not without professional guidance). His desire to control his partner may be a part of his personality, but it is one you should not have to put up with. It is then time to break up.


Plan what you want to say. Remember that your opinion matters and that you deserve to be listened to. Do not let your possessive boyfriend turn the guilt back around on you- remember that you are the one ending this relationship, and you are doing it for a valid and legitimate reason.

, Breakups are never easy, and they can be especially hard if you were the one being controlled in a possessive relationship.


Pick a place and time to break up with your boyfriend. While breaking up is usually best done face-to-face, a possessive boyfriend may behave in an overemotional or abusive way.

A well-populated public place may be the safest for a breakup if you feel in any way concerned about the possible reaction of your boyfriend.


Share your intention to break up with your possessive boyfriend with a trusted friend or family member. Ask this person to hold you accountable for going through with it.
Make him let you speak. You should be able to tell him what you want to tell him without being interrupted. As long as you do it in a controlled and civil way, he should listen.
Don’t linger. After you say what you need to say, and give him a chance to respond, remove yourself form the situation. Give it time to settle down before you are in contact again.

, If your boyfriend was possessive while you were dating, he will likely carry this behavior through your breakup. Being prepared for this can help you deal with it when the time comes.


Beware of his attempts to guilt you into staying with him. This may come in the form of “Do you remember that one time we walked on the beach at sunrise?” or it may come in the form of a more serious threat (such as to end his own life). The important thing is that you recognize that this is emotional manipulation- do not tolerate it!

If your ex-boyfriend is threatening harm to himself or others, it is essential that you let someone know immediately. Call 911 if you believe he or anyone else may be in immediate danger.


Stick to your guns. Regardless of your boyfriend’s reaction, remember that you made the wise choice to end an unhealthy relationship.

, You should ask for help or support from your true friends and family in whatever capacity you need. You might need them to reconfirm your choice to end your relationship, or to remind you of some of the concerning behavior of your now ex-boyfriend.


Reconnecting with the people that you may have lost during your relationship with your possessive boyfriend can be a helpful part of moving on from that unhealthy relationship.

, Removing yourself from a possessive relationship can be challenging. However, fear of being alone is not reason enough to stay with someone who you feel is controlling you. A counselor can help you deal with any negative feelings that you have and can help you deal with the pain of ending a relationship.


Talking through your relationship can be a healthy way to come to terms with the fact that the behavior of your partner was wrong.

, Whether it was good or bad, ending a relationship is never easy. Taking time alone before beginning a new relationship is advisable. When you are ready, here are some things you should do to begin to move on from your relationship with your possessive boyfriend:


Reflect on the ups and downs of your last relationship. It is important that you recognize that there were good times in addition to bad times. The time you spent in this relationship was not wasted; instead, it served a purpose: it taught you what you DON’T want in a partner.
Learn to recognize the signs of a possessive boyfriend early on. Next time, you will be more familiar with the warning signs of jealousy and possessive behavior. You will be more aware with the next person you date.
Remember to love yourself. If your relationship took away any of your self-esteem, confidence, or love for yourself, take some time to get that back. Spending time with friends, learning a new hobby, or seeking some solace in a favorite place are good ways to reconnect with your inner self.
Enter into your next relationship with care and caution. Take the lessons that you learned in this relationship and apply them into building a happy and healthy relationship with the next person when the time is right.

Consider what you might like to be remembered for.,
Be confident.,
Nurture specific interests.,
Embrace your personal eccentricity.,
Eliminate self-doubt.,
Dress to fit your personality.,
Relax your social filter.,
Exhibit positive body language.While you're ultimately trying to make yourself stand apart from the rest of the crowd as much as you can, there are certain protocols that should remain a constant regardless how weird you are.,
Assert yourself socially.,
Express gratitude.,
Accomplish something bold and significant.,
Flaunt your achievements.",How to Be Unforgettable," In the majority of cases, the impression you're going to leave on most people will be summed up by a single trait or role. You'll already be unforgettable to the close friends, family and loved ones in your life, but the window of opportunity to impress others will be narrower. Chances are you'll have to narrow your role down accordingly. Focus on a couple of your best traits and emphasize them as much as you can.


Write up a list of your most distinctive traits. If you've got a razor-sharp wit, you can leave a lasting impression on people with that alone. If you're really physically adept, you could excel in athletics and leave a similarly vivid image in the minds of those around you.;
, You probably saw this one coming already. Confidence nonetheless is one of the essential building blocks in making a good impression on someone. Learning to love yourself, and knowing why you should be loving yourself are necessary steps towards being unforgettable. If you are confident, you will naturally be a closer approximation to the real you than you would otherwise.


If you're having a really hard time building confidence, you should approach friends and ask them to list their favourite things about you. Try to take what they say to heart-- they're not just saying that stuff to make you feel better!

, Given the tendency of people to remember your boldest traits and forget the details over time, you'll stand the best chance of being remembered if you get very specific and exceptional with what you do. Pursue your interests with intensity, no matter how unfashionable they may seem. Passion is a universally appealing trait in someone, and you'll be remembered all the better for it.

, Let's face it; no one ever made a permanent impression on someone without being at least a little weird and off-key. Even if you're a paragon of averageness, there's almost certainly a subset of yourself you would usually prefer to hide away from the world. In that case, you should do everything you can to bring that part of you to the forefront.


The best way to unlock this side of yourself is through placing yourself in unfamiliar situations. Without habits to fall back on, you may find yourself acting in ways you never thought plausible before.

, With confidence and some healthy eccentricity in place, it's time to remove any doubt from the equation. No matter how sure of yourself you are, there is always the chance when heading off the beaten path that you'll doubt what you're doing. If you're looking to be truly unforgettable, you'll be carving out a unique path for yourself in the process. It will be natural to have reservations, but it's important to keep your sights set on the goals ahead of you.

, Dressing well is important for most every situation, whether it's for work or a first date. As it happens, the way you dress and physically present yourself has a crucial impact on the way you are manifested in someone's memory. In most situations, it is recommended you dress cool but casual, and to fit your body type.


If you're looking to be truly unforgettable however, you may want to go a step further. For instance, wear an otherwise respectable outfit, then throw a neon-coloured boa scarf around your neck. Everybody likes an oddball.

, There is certainly a strange side to you; it's just a matter of trying to bring that side to the forefront. Relaxing your social filter when interacting with people, if only slightly, will make you stand out in their minds much more easily. Got a weird or off-kilter thought on your mind? Don't be afraid to speak it! Most of the time, you'll find people are at least pleasantly amused, if not enthralled by a fresh idea or opinion.


On the other hand, try not to be too crude, unfriendly or vulgar with your weirdness. It may still make you unforgettable, but probably not in the ways you're looking for.

, Among these, welcoming body language is a universal form of communication, and will innately make people feel more drawn to you.


Remember to smile! Smiling is your best physical asset If you're not usually prone to smiling, try smiling a lot more. In time, it'll start becoming a natural reaction to things that make you happy.
Make plenty of eye contact. With eye contact, you'll keep someone focused completely on you. Even if you're having a great conversation without looking at each other, you can communicate a lot below the surface simply with your eyes. Make use of the opportunity.
Assume good posture. Posture is one of the strongest physical indicators of confidence. You'll attract the most attention if you're standing as tall as you can.

, The most remembered people aren't always the loudest, but they do find ways to make themselves stand out from the crowd. Even if you're naturally introverted, you can manage this by getting out of your comfort shell and taking charge of the social situations you're a part of. This is obviously easier said than done for many people, but it is possible, and even necessary if you're looking to be unforgettable.


In the conversation's you take part in, try saying everything you would normally say with greater confidence and volume. This is an easy exercise to build confidence and assertiveness with time.
Exercising good posture and eye contact will naturally boost your social morale.

, Saying 'thank you' whenever it applies to your situation is a cheap, simple way of getting in someone's god books, as it demonstrates you are genuinely appreciative of the things they have done for you. not surprisingly, that gratitude will make them that much more likely to do nice things for you in the future.


Dole out compliments frequently. It's like they say-- people may not always remember what you did, but they'll always remember the way you made them feel.

, The people who are remembered most in this world are those who realized their passions actively in some way, whether through arts, science, politics or business. To be truly unforgettable, you have to think big. What are you really interested in? What do you want your legacy to the world to be once you have passed from this world? If, for example, your goal is to write a book someday, there is no better time than today to start. Invest your inspiration and the entirety of your excess energy into making your dream a reality. People will take notice.


Get as ambitious and idealistic as possible, provided having a far-fetched goal isn't going to keep you from pursuing it to the fullest. Consistency and hard work are the most important elements of achievement, whether you're going to med school or pursuing a career in avant-jazz composition.

, Once you've dedicated yourself to accomplishing something, other people will start having a big reason to notice you. In order to leave an active impression in the minds of others however, you'll need to forego any modesty. Stand proud with what you have, and don't hesitate to show others what you've accomplished thus far in life.


There is a fine line between pride and shameless arrogance. Don't try to compliment yourself; show off what you've done impartially. Let others judge for themselves.

Avoid arguing.",How to Deal with a Partner's Aggressive Driving2," There are some situations when you should point out your partner’s aggressive driving and other times when you might want to leave it alone. If your partner is not posing danger to you or other passengers in the car, just try to remain calm. But if you feel unsafe or threatened by their driving, speak up.For example, you might not want to argue about how they stole a parking spot, but you should point out if they nearly hit another driver.

, Instead of criticizing their driving or telling them how to drive, inform your partner how their driving makes you feel. Tell them if you are nervous, scared, anxious, or worried about their driving habits.


You might say, “I’m a little nervous right now. Would you mind slowing down?”
You might also try stating something like, “That sudden turn back there startled me.”

, If you think your partner is distracted or upset about something, confront them. Ask them why they are so aggressive on the road. It may cause them to think about their driving habits more carefully.


You might say, “Is there something bothering you?”
You might also state, “Is there a reason why you’re getting mad at the other drivers?”

, Your partner may be stressed about driving in traffic or arriving late. In a gentle tone, reassure them that you will still arrive at your destination. You might reinforce that being late doesn't matter to you.


You might say, “Try not to worry about the time. We’ll get there when we’ll get there.”
If you have reservations or an appointment somewhere, offer to call ahead to let them know you will be late. You can also call friends or family members that you’re meeting.

, Arguing in the car can make the driver angrier or more distracted. If you feel as though an argument is brewing, try to drop the subject until the driver has parked.After the drive, you might say, ""Hey, can we talk about what happened on the road today?""

If you are traveling on a highway or major road, you may want to look up traffic reports before you leave to see if there are any delays.

Create an exit strategy.",How to Deal with a Partner Who Thinks You Are Always Wrong," It's important to discuss the issue with your partner, as they may not even realize that they always assume you're wrong. You may be inclined to avoid the issue, but that will only continue to drive a wedge between you and your partner. It's best to confront the issue head-on if possible.Plus, if you avoid the problem too long, you may find that you start having bursts of anger at your partner, which puts a strain on your relationship.;
, It can help to take a few moments and think about what you'd actually like to say to your partner. You don't want a typed-out speech, as that will distance you from your partner. However, having a general idea of what you what to say is good, particularly choosing a few phrases that can get your point across without making your partner feel horrible., It can be helpful to give your partner a head's up that you want to have a discussion. That way, your partner won't feel ambushed with what you have to say. Additionally, it gives you both a chance to pick a good time together.For example, you could say, ""I'd like to have a discussion about the way we argue, particularly the way I feel like I always end up being in the wrong. When's a good time for you?""
If your situation differs a bit, you could say something like, ""I'd like to have a discussion with you about how I feel my opinion is often not valued. When can we talk?""

, When discussing the problem with your partner, the most effective way to talk about is to use ""I"" statements. That is, talk about what's wrong starting with ""I,"" focusing on your feelings, rather than starting with ""you,"" which sounds like you're blaming the other person. Using ""I"" statements is generally more effective at opening a dialogue.For instance, you might say, ""I feel like that most of the time I end up being 'wrong' in an argument or discussion. I get upset because you're insistent that you're correct, and I end up giving up on the issue.""
Alternatively, you could say, ""I feel like you don't respect my opinion or expertise in most situations. It makes me upset to always be in the wrong.""
On the other hand, ""You always think you're right and I'm wrong"" isn't a good way to start the conversation.

, If you go into the discussion planning a monologue, that won't be effective. You have to be able to listen to what the other person has to say, as you are trying to communicate back and forth about a problem, so you both need a chance to be heard.Your partner may surprise you with what they have to say. For instance, you may find that they feel the same, that you always think they're wrong. Once you realize that you both feel that way, you can work towards having better communication in the future.
To get your partner talking, make sure to give them an opening in the conversation. For example, you could say, ""Now that I've said my spiel, I want to hear from you. What are you thinking and feeling?""

, After listening to what your partner says about this particular topic, consider what's behind the words. How your partner ends up responding could indicate they're willing to work on the issue and the relationship. On the other hand, what they say may indicate your problem runs deeper, and you may want to seek counseling or end the relationship.


For instance, if your partner says, ""Well, that's just stupid. You are wrong most of the time,"" that's not a very supportive or open response.
On the other hand, a response such as, ""I hadn't realized that I made you feel that way. That is a problem. Let's figure out how we can work together to resolve this issue,"" is a supportive response that shows they are willing to work with you. From there, you could say, ""I'm glad to hear you say that. Here's what I think a good solution would be:""
Listen to how your partner responds. If your partner cannot reciprocate the ""I"" statement or if they start blaming you again, it might be a sign that they are not willing to work it out.

, Once you've both had your chance to speak, discuss how you can both do better moving ahead. Discuss ways you think could solve the problem, and ask your partner to come up with ways they think the problem could be solved.For example, maybe you could have a safe word to halt an argument and evaluate who's feeling like the other person is saying they're ""wrong."" Just stopping in the middle of an argument to evaluate how each of you is feeling can help to bridge the communication gap.
Alternatively, you could agree that you'll point out to your partner when you think that they're not valuing your opinion or expertise.

, If your partner seems receptive to change but you can't figure out how to move forward, consider seeing a professional. Find a counselor in your area who can help you work through your problems. If you're not sure who to see, consider asking close friends if they have any recommendations.

, Your partner blaming you could be a part of a larger problem. They could be trying to manipulate you, gaining power over you and the relationship. If they do that consistently, it's likely emotional abuse, and you need to think about whether you should stay in the relationship or not.If you decide to stay, you need to start to stand up for yourself by asserting yourself in the relationship.


That is, think about whether your partner uses tactics like thinking and telling you that you're always wrong to change the way you act or to gaslight you (convince you that what you know to be true is wrong).
In other words, say you go to a movie, and you think that the main character was rude. Afterwards, your partner tries to convince you that you're wrong, saying things like, ""The character wasn't rude; he was just standing up for himself. You just don't know how to stand up for yourself. You're weak, which is why you couldn't get along without me.""
Your partner is using emotional abuse to convince you that what you think or feel is wrong, with the intention of gaining control over you. In this situation, you could say, ""I disagree, and I have a right to my opinion. That character called his wife a dirty name with no remorse. That's rude.""

, Telling you you're wrong is one way of manipulating you, but you may find other ways your partner is doing that once you start looking. That is, your partner may be trying to bend you to fulfill their needs.Just identifying the ways your partner manipulates you can help you to start changing the relationship. However, once you identify those times, you can start resisting that manipulation.


For example, your partner may make you feel guilty, even about things you should be enjoying. If you decide what movie to go see, your partner might say, afterwards, ""Well, I'm glad you're happy, but that wouldn't have been my first choice. I mean, obviously that other movie would've been better, but you had to see that one, so I guess it's okay."" You could reply, ""You're not going to make me feel bad about seeing that movie. I enjoyed it, and I'm glad we went.""
They may also make you feel bad because of the insecurities they hold. Maybe you decide to go out one night with your friends, and your partner doesn't like it, saying, ""I'm sorry, but I don't like you going out with your friends. I should be enough for you, right?"" You could say in return, ""It sounds like you're feeling a bit insecure about my other relationships. I do value our relationship, but I also value my friendships. I can value those friendships without devaluing our relationship.""

, Your partner may also make you take the responsibility for the way they feel. They might say, ""It's your fault that I'm angry. You didn't do this the way you should have."" The only person who should be responsible for their emotions is that person. Try to refrain from apologizing for the person's emotion. Instead, you could say, ""I hear that you're upset. I'm sorry I didn't do this the way you wanted, but I did try. Your anger seems misplaced. What are you really mad at?""

, Another way a relationship can be toxic is if your partner turns your own insecurities against you. They can use the way you feel about yourself or the world to keep you under their thumb, always staying because you feel like you're not good enough.For instance, your partner might say something like, ""It's a good thing you're with me because you're getting kind of chubby. No one else would have you."" You could say, ""That's kind of rude. I'm proud of my body, and I won't let you shame me for it.""
While you can try to counter this type of talk, you should consider whether it's worth the emotional pain to stay in the relationship.

, When you're with someone, it should be give and take. You both should be giving to the other partner things that they need in terms of support. Now, think about your relationship. Do you receive as much as you give? Are you getting the support you need out of the relationship? If you're not, it may be time to think about ending the relationship.You can discuss this with your partner. You could say, ""I feel like I give more to this relationship than I take. I have needs that aren't being met.""

, Since your partner always thinks you're wrong, there's a possibility that they may think they're superior. That is, if your partner feels superior to you in every way, they are more likely to to try to convince you that they're right and you're wrong.Does your partner make statements that could indicate they feel superior? For instance, they might say (in seriousness, not jest), ""Well, you know I'm smarter, so obviously I'm right.""

, A narcissist literally thinks the world revolves around them. They expect to go to dinner where they want, watch what they want, and show up when they want without consequences. The problem is, they hold you to a different standard.That is, a narcissist has no problem showing up very late (even an hour or more) without an apology. If you do that, you may find you're expected to apologize and never do it again.

, Narcissists often have very high standards. Because they have trouble seeing outside themselves, they can't see how certain expectations may be too much. They also don't see all the hard work you have put into doing something. That's why it will likely seem like they always expect more than what you have to give. Also, they'll be much more likely to remember the things that haven't gone right than to remember the good things you've done., This advice may seem counter-intuitive, but often people's narcissism or borderline narcissism stems from insecurity. That is, many narcissistic people feel like they aren't good enough, and they compensate by being extremely egotistical. In turn, one way you can work with a partner who is narcissistic is to try to understand their insecurities and help the person work through them.For instance, maybe you notice that your partner becomes particularly narcissistic when you decide to go out with your friends. In turn, that may indicate that they feel like they aren't enough for you. You can help reassure them.
You could say, ""I'm going to go out with my friends tonight. That seems to bother you sometimes. Can you tell me why?""

, If the person is a narcissist, they may have a hard time figuring out what you need because they have a difficult time getting out of their own head. If that's the case, you may need to clearly state the needs you have in your relationship, so your partner has an idea of how to respond.For instance, you could say, ""I feel like you always assume that I'm wrong. Can we work on that together?""

, If your partner is only borderline narcissistic, you may be able to make a relationship work. However, if your partner is more than borderline, you may find it difficult to make a relationship work. For one thing, you will start to lose your sense of self as you continually give in to your partner. Consider whether staying in a relationship with the person is really a good idea.If your partner refuses to see your point of view or if they are frequently manipulating you, do not hesitate to make plans to end the relationship. Counseling can help you with this process.

, It may not be possible to change your partner's habits without a professional intervention with a counselor. If your partner manipulates or verbally abuses you, you should have a plan in place to end the relationship in a healthy manner.

A counselor or therapist can help you develop strategies to help you end the relationship.
If you are married, you may want to start talking to attorneys to consider your options for divorce.If you live with your partner, start thinking about where you can stay after you break up. Can you live with friends or family? Are you prepared to move into a new place on your own?
Set goals for the future. Where do you want to be in a year? Focus on your goals, and you may be able to leave a narcissistic partner in the past."

Oftentimes, people have trouble tolerating opinions that threaten their worldview. Being more comfortable with yourself, and how you see the world, can lead to more positive interactions with people different than you.Really consider your opinions on a variety of issues. Do some research using reputable sources rather than relying on knee-jerk responses you have. You can, for example, read a number news stories and editorials that present both sides of a topical issue before deciding how you feel. It is a good idea to learn about both sides of an issue to make sure you are well-informed. Look into an issue like immigration reform and decide your opinion for yourself.
It's okay not to have opinions on certain topics, or to be drawn in two directions. Do not feel like you have to be opinionated. If you're not sure, try to accept this. For example, many people are torn on the issue of abortion. If you are not sure how you feel about this issue, you can say something like, ""I honestly don't know my opinion. Sorry.""
Try to remember that your attitude towards yourself defines your attitude towards the world. If you feel well informed and confident, you'll be less likely to be threatened by other people's opinions and input.;
, Sometimes, it can be difficult to separate how someone feels about an issue from how they feel about you. People disagree about hot button issues all the time, such as religion and politics. However, for most people, disagreements are about the issue. They are not a personal slight or attack against another person.Think about things you have strong opinions on. For example, maybe you're very in favor of universal healthcare. Do you have friends or relatives who have a different opinion? How do you feel about them? For example, your cousin may feel healthcare should remain private, while you believe in a single payer system.
Chances are, you don't harbor any negative opinions about people who disagree with your perspective. Therefore, it's safe to reason those who disagree with you do not judge you as a person based on your opinion. For example, do you judge your cousin for their opinion on healthcare? Probably not, and your cousin probably does not judge you either.
It's easier to be tolerant of opinions if you're able to see them objectively. Try to see someone's opinion as separate from how they judge you and your character. This will help be able to disagree with people but tolerate these disagreements.
Remember that everyone is an individual who is entitled to their opinions and beliefs. Even if they differ from your opinions and beliefs, it is still important to respect that other people have different perspectives than you do.

, Oftentimes, a difficult to tolerate other people's opinions is a reflection of unreasonable expectations. Do you expect everyone to get along all the time? Do you expect people to agree with you most of the time? If so, your expectations may not be realistic.Not everyone agrees on everything. Even best friends and married couples have places where their views differ. If you're surrounded by people with similar views to yours most of the time, you may sometimes accidentally assume people agree with you. However, even likeminded people do not always agree.
Try to keep this in mind going into a situation. While most of your friends and family members may vote Democrat, for example, keep in mind roughly half the country disagrees. Going into new situations, do not expect people's views to align politically with your own.

, How would you feel if you expressed an opinion and someone judged you? This would probably make you feel hurt. Try to follow the Golden Rule and treat others the way you wish to be treated. Just as you wouldn't want to feel judged or attacked for an opinion, do not judge or attack others.Remember, people are not their opinions. While someone may disagree on an issue that's of personal importance to you, try to pause and think about that person's perspective. Maybe they had unique experiences that formed how they feel, which may be different than your own.
Whenever you feel intolerant to another person's opinion, pause and reflect on the Golden Rule. Just as you would expect someone to consider your perspective without judging you, extend this same courtesy to someone else.

, When you encounter another viewpoint that is not in line with your own, you may get frustrated or upset. Therefore, it may be helpful for you to develop some coping mechanisms to make dealing with this kind of frustration easier for you. You can try including some deep breathing, yoga, or meditation in your daily routine, or get into the habit of asking yourself some questions whenever you encounter a viewpoint that upsets you. Some questions you might ask yourself include:


What is it about the topic that makes me feel so passionate about my opinion?
What do I really want the others with opposing views to know about my side? What do I want them to understand and comprehend?
Am I having a rational emotional response to this? Or am I bringing in prior emotional experiences that may not be relevant to this particular situation?
What emotions am I feeling right now related to this topic?
What are some ways I can approach my point of view in a non-threatening way and reduce the possibility of offending others?

, In some situations, changing the subject may be the best way to deal with a disagreement about a sensitive topic. You would especially want to use this strategy when dealing with a disagreement in the workplace, but you can use it in any situation.


For example, if a coworker brings up gun control and you disagree with their point of view, then you could change the subject by saying, “Yeah, that’s tough. Hey, are you going to the company picnic next weekend? Sounds like it’s going to be a fun day!”
If the person persists after you have tried to change the subject, then you can kindly say something like, “I am not comfortable talking about this subject. Can we talk about something else?”

, Most people have some common ground with one another. Even someone who's vastly different from you may share certain core values. When dealing with disagreements, try to find a place where you can both agree. This can help you figure out how to smooth things over and talk out your differences in a calm, mature fashion.For example, you and a friend disagree about abortion. Try to find some common ground.
While you do not agree on the moral issues surrounding abortion, think about shared values. Maybe you both agree women need access to healthcare to help carry a baby to term. Maybe you both feel people should have access to contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Try to bring these issues up to find places where you agree fundamentally about supporting women and children.

, When you're talking out a major disagreement, negative body language may accidentally slip in. If things get heated, you may do things like roll your eyes, sigh, or cross your arms. Negative body language will only make the other person feel hurt and frustrated. Be aware of what your body is doing and try to use attentive, respectful body language.Try to maintain eye contact when speaking and listening to show you're paying attention. Keep your facial expression relaxed as well. Avoid furrowing your brows or frowning. Aim for a neutral, relaxed facial expression. Nodding is also a good way to indicate your attention.
Sit facing the person and try to avoid having obstacles between you. Sit in a reasonably close proximity to the person for talking, such as next to them on a sofa or across from them at a table. You can also lean in to indicate your interest.
Maintain good posture. Don't cross your arms because this can make you seem like you are resistant to or rejecting what the other person says.

, It can be hard not to personalize something. Oftentimes, when talking over disagreements, you have the urge to win an argument. Try to stay calm and look at the situation objectively. No one is trying to win. You are trying to better understand someone else's perspective.Remind yourself someone's opinion is not personal. Try to focus on the objective facts. How and why do you feel strongly about this and how does it affect you? This is what you're trying to convey.
Focus on facts over feelings. For example, don't say, ""It's hurtful that you don't believe in providing contraception because I rely on it."" Instead, say something like, ""A lot of women, myself included, do rely on contraception. That's why it's so important to me.""
Try to remember an emotional reaction will not help you gain insight and understanding of someone else's perspective. Even when you strongly disagree, respect the person enough to remain calm.

, You should always listen to someone else's side. Do not interrupt when someone else is talking. Ask that they not interrupt when you take your turn. Truly listen to what another person says and try to understand where they're coming from while you're listening.You can also try briefly paraphrase what someone is saying to make sure you understand. For example, ""So, you feel that the government is not responsible for paying for birth control?""
Remember, listening to someone else does not take away from your own opinion. It is productive to understand the opinions of others. If you understand why people feel the way they do, you will find it easier to tolerate others opinions.

, Look for a place where you can both agree or at least agree to disagree respectfully. Deeply held opinions sometimes do not change. However, you can at least strive for mutual respect.For example, say something like, ""I see we're not going to agree on contraception. But I understand your opinion more and you understand mine more. I think this was still productive.""

, If you're going into a situation where you're likely to disagree, or where hot button topics may be brought up, prepare statements that won't spark controversy. At things like work events, for example, it's often best to keep opinions on sensitive issues to yourself. Try to think of some casual comments to make instead of discussing politics.For example, you're meeting with co-workers after a recent election. The election will certainly be a topic of discussion, but try to think of more neutral things to discuss. Bring up, say, a ballot that passed without much resistance instead of a heated race for senator. Remember also that it is best to avoid talking about politics or other sensitive subjects with co-workers.
You can also try directing the conversation elsewhere. You can talk about traffic on Election Day and then try to steer the conversation to a general discussion about the morning commute.

, In certain places, you may want to avoid politics altogether. If you're going to a family dinner where you know you disagree with others, for example, try not to bring up heated political issues. Talk about what's going on with family members instead and leave politics out of the discussion.However, while you can try to avoid a topic like politics, remember it's okay to plainly say that you don’t want to discuss it. You can do so in a tactful way, and then change the subject if things get heated.
For example, say something like, ""I don't wish to talk about this topic at this time.""

, Religion is another sensitive issue. At professional settings, or even family events, it's often best not to bring it up. Try to steer the conversation away from topics regarding religion, especially current events. These issues are deeply personal and people may have trouble not taking opinions as a personal slight.However, close friends and family members may disagree with you. You also may disagree with your spouse on topics like religion. You should discuss major issues with those you are close to, but remember you may not always agree.
It may be important for close friends and family members to know your opinion, especially if the issue may come up. If you're an atheist, for example, it's important to let people know so they don't invite you to church or push their religion on you. You can, however, agree to disagree at times. Keep in mind that this will not be a good idea in all situations. For example, it is a good idea for your significant other to know these things about you, but a cousin or grandparent probably does not need this much information. Try to avoid the topic with anyone who you do not think will be tolerant of your views.
For example, if your aunt invites you to mass on Christmas, you can say something like, ""Thank you for the invitation to go to mass Aunt Lilly, but I will have to respectfully decline."" There is no need for you to explain your reason and doing so may lead to conflict. Keep it simple and respectful.

Think about why your partner's decision upsets you so much.,
Find a quiet, private space to talk with your partner.,
Use “I” statements to discuss the issue.,
Encourage each other to be active listeners.,
Come to an agreement or resolution.",How to Deal with a Partner Who Ignores You on Social Media1," Before you address the issue with your partner, you should sit down and consider why you get so upset and emotional when your partner ignores you on social media. Are you worried they are speaking to individuals that they shouldn't be, such as a former partner or ex? Are you feeling a disconnect between your partner's online presence and your partner's real life? Do you worry you are being left out of online conversations or discussions your partner is having that you want to be included in?


Thinking about why you are upset by your partner's decision to ignore you on social media can help you address the issue with them in a clear, decisive way. You can also speak about your feelings more honestly and clearly if you know what they are and why you are upset.;
, When you decide to address the issue, start by finding a time where you can be alone with your partner. If you live with your partner, choose a quiet, private area in your shared space, such as the living room, the bedroom, or the kitchen. If you do not live with your partner, you may invite them over to your place to talk to them so you have privacy and can talk freely.


You may set up the conversation by telling your partner, “I need to talk to you about something” or “Can we meet up and talk? I have an issue that I want to discuss.”

, Once you and your partner are alone, express your concerns using “I” statements. Be specific about how your partner ignores you on social media and why this bothers you so much. Using “I” statements will ensure you are speaking from your perspective and being clear about how you feel.For example, you may say, “I am upset that you ignore me on social media because it is important to me that we talk online as well as in real life” or “I am bothered by how you ignore me on social media because I want us to stay connected in real life and online.”

, You and your partner should work on communicating with mindfulness and honesty. Encourage each other to be active listeners, where you pay attention to what you both have to say and respond with thoughtful questions. Being active listeners will help you both share your thoughts and avoid getting into an argument or disagreement.For example, you may allow your partner to respond to your concerns and listen closely to what they have to say. Ask thoughtful questions, such as “Why do you feel uncomfortable with being connected on social media?” or “Why do you prefer to ignore me on social media?”
Try to listen to each other and respond by acknowledging what the other person said before you respond. For example, you may say to your partner, “What I am hearing you say is that you do not think it is a big deal that you ignore me online.” Then, once they have confirmed you have heard them correctly, you can respond in kind.

, Work with your partner to come to an agreement or resolution on the issue. You may need to have several conversations with your partner or suggest a compromise so you can both come away with what you want.For example, you may ask your partner to acknowledge your posts on social media as a first step. Or you and your partner may agree to both chat more on social media moving forward. You may say, ""Let's start by commenting on each other's posts on social media and go from there.""
You may also suggest that your partner communicate with you over email so you still have some contact online. If you want to share animal videos with your partner, you may send one to them over email so you are both still connected.
Keep in mind you and your partner may not come to an agreement on this issue. They may not feel it is important that they pay attention to you on social media, though you may think otherwise. You both may need to agree to disagree if a resolution does not seem possible.

Go for a walk.A walk through the woods is one of the most recommended ""healthy distractions"".,
Take your friend out for a wild night.",How to Distract Someone1," A lot of ""healthy distractions"" revolve around meditation and therapeutic breathing. Sitting someone down and guiding him through a meditation session is a good thing to try, especially if you're trying to distract your friend from physical pain.By focusing your friend's mind on something as arbitrary as breathing, his brain will have less resources available to focus on the thing that needs distracting from.


Sit down and close your eyes. From there, you and your friend should focus on taking long, unrushed breaths, focusing in on the sound and the sensation of inhaling.;
, Watching a good TV show is a great thing to do if you're sick or in need of a good distraction for a while. In particular, ""binge watching"" shows multiple episodes at a time helps someone become more and more invested in the programme they're watching. Media outlets like HBO are chock-full of great shows to watch in this fashion. Because TV shows favour a serialized format, it's easy to throw yourself into a show.If you need to distract someone, suggest the two of you watch a show together.


Popcorn and snacks are a therapeutic addition to an activity like this as well.

, Clickbait refers to a type of online web article that serves little purpose other than to distract. Sites like Buzzfeed and Clickworthy specialize in this sort of aggregated media. Although clickbait is often worthless and should be avoided, it's a perfect thing to link or show someone who needs their mind drawn away from real-world matters. Some clickbait even self-refers to its role as a potentially therapeutic distraction., Video games are a great way of stepping out of your own life for a time and jumping into another world. There are lots of video games out there that are best when played together. Video games require a lot of concentration. In this manner, they're arguably even better than a TV show for the sake of distracting someone.

, If you suggest doing it with a friend, it opens up a lot of opportunities to talk and bond. Being out in the open together can be a lot of fun, and the experience of simply being outdoors is great for the soul.

, Although drinking to excess or partying isn't recommended as a long-term way to be distracted by something, the loud stimulation of a night out on the town can be perfect for distraction. Make sure your friend is likely to have a good time, and try to stay clear of anything that might remind him of whatever it is he needs distracting from.

Put yourself in someone else’s shoes.,
Identify your own emotions.,
Be an active listener.,
Paraphrase the speaker’s statements.,
Reflect back.,
Collect stories.,
Find common ground.,
Share your story.",How to Develop Social Awareness1," Empathy helps you understand someone else’s perspective. Being empathetic is vital for authentic relationships, genuine communication, and problem-solving. Because we are social creatures, we constantly find ourselves in situations where we could be more empathetic (or empathic - the words mean the same thing). Consider these situations:Think about being in line at the grocery store. The cashier is taking forever because he is new to his job. While you may be frustrated, you may also understand that when someone is learning something, they do not go as fast. You might picture yourself as the cashier, who is probably very stressed out that people are frustrated and grumbling. Because you are using empathy, you may decide to be patient and understanding.
Imagine your friend just found out her parents are getting divorced. Maybe your parents are still married and you have no experience with this. But you can consider how it would feel to hear this news, and respond how you imagine you’d like someone to respond to you, if you were in your friend’s shoes. You might say, “I’m so sorry to hear this. How are you doing?”;
, You can’t understand what other people are feeling until you learn and label your own emotions.It isn’t always easy to figure out what you are feeling, though. Here are some basic ways to help identify your feelings:


Talk to someone. Sharing feelings out loud with others helps you get feedback, and also helps you sort through them as you talk.Write in a journal. Write down what’s going through your mind and help process and name your feelings.Think about your thoughts. For example, if you are thinking, “I have so much to do! The house is a mess and company is coming!” you might be feeling stressed out.Carry a list of emotions with you. If you are new to identifying your emotions, then carrying a list of different emotions may help you to identify what you are feeling.

, Active listening helps you develop empathy because you are fully listening to the person talking (with your eyes and body language as well as your ears). You will also echo back to the person what you are hearing them say.Be focused on the person talking. Put down your phone or other distractions and point your body in the direction of the speaker. Make eye contact with the person.

, Paraphrasing is using your own words to describe what you just heard the other person say. This often helps both of you gain greater understanding.


For example, if your coworker says, “I am never going to get this project done! It is never-ending!” you could say, “Wow, you sound really overwhelmed!”
If you are off-base in your paraphrasing or reflecting back, the speaker will generally let you know with simple disagreement. For example, “No, I think I have control of the project. It just seems like it will never get done!”

, Let the person know how what they are sharing with you makes you feel. This helps you move towards further understanding about how the person is feeling.You can say, “I am so frustrated after hearing this story about your boss.” The other person will likely either agree with your statement (“Yes! She’s driving me crazy!”) or point you more toward how they are truly feeling (“I am so angry after our last meeting”). Either way, you further understand what this person is experiencing and feeling, thus building empathy.

, Learning other people’s stories helps us develop empathy for others, because we have been given a glimpse of what it is like to be that person. Human beings seem to be hard-wired to retain and learn from stories.Many powerful stories tend to resonate with us long after they are told.


Listen to other people’s stories.Be curious about people and ask them about their lives. Most of the time, people are willing to share about themselves, particularly if you are engaging in empathic behaviors and active listening.
Read more books. Books help us become more empathic because we are often reading the character’s own thoughts and motivations. For the most empathic bang for your buck, read works of literary fiction, where the relationship dynamics and character psychology are often more developed than other types of books. , Look for common interests with another person. This can be a stepping stone toward a deeper understanding.Maybe there is a new kid at your school who is from another country. You don’t know anything about his culture, but you are both on the tennis team. You could use the common sport as a starting point for conversation. From there you could talk about tennis players from his home country, then how his culture is different from yours.

, Sharing your own vulnerabilities helps grown connections.Letting your guard down with someone can inspire them to share their own deeper feelings, where you are more likely to make a connection and build empathy.Sharing deeper feelings needs to be done in an appropriate setting and after some initial connection has been made. Don’t run up to a person on the street and announce you want to share what it was like for you when your mom died. Get to know the person, and share deeper conversations in quieter, private settings--like driving in a car or playing a game one-on-one, not in a noisy arcade or while others may be eavesdropping.
Think of a conversation as a spiral. You start at the outer loop with more superficial conversation. As you progress in your conversation and build empathy with the other person, you move closer in toward the center of the spiral and it becomes more appropriate to share those innermost, core feelings.
Make a connection with the other person’s story. For example, you could say, “When you told me about how you feel like nobody understands you, I got where you were coming from. I feel like that a lot, too. Sometimes I feel like I will never meet anybody who really gets me.”

Have a look around with your friends and see which shops you’d all be interested in checking out. You could fill up an entire day just exploring all the different storefronts in a shopping mall.


Having trouble finding a place to start? Most shopping malls have a directory board placed near each entrance to familiarize shoppers with the stores in the vicinity. Take a look and see what interests you.
If you’re in a large group or have a limited amount of time to wander around, have each of your friends pick one store they want to visit and hit them all in order.;
, The mall is synonymous with fashion. There are a multitude of stores where you can find the biggest name brands and hottest modern looks if you’ve got some money to shell out. Think about what clothing items your closet is missing, or what would make you feel especially stylish, and go on the hunt. It’s one-stop-shopping for all things chic!Take the season into consideration and stock up on clothes that will keep you looking and feeling great, like shorts, halter tops or sandals in the summer and eye-catching boots and jackets in the colder months.Try on outfits and have your friends tell you what they think. Friends make some of the best fashion experts!

, In addition to clothing boutiques, shopping malls are also a treasure trove for all forms of entertainments. Browse the bookstore for an engrossing title to pass around, or hit up a DVD or record shop for something new to binge watch with your crew or listen to on the ride home. You can also find all the major home entertainment necessities at the mall, like cutting-edge TVs, media players, gaming systems and even luxury furniture for your home theater.Plan a movie party with your friends for when you get home.

, Most malls have specialty kiosks lining their corridors, and you can usually find some pretty interesting things there. Some of these include designer jewelry stands, people selling exotic beauty products and novelties of all types. Go through with your group and pick out a gift for a mutual friend.Have all of your friends go in together on a pricier gift for a friend. That way, you can get them something nice without any one person having to spend too much.

, You don't have to spend a single penny to get your kicks at the mall. Create your own informal games with your friends while browsing the vast selection of shops, like a scavenger hunt for items that can be found in the mall. Have everyone in your group help compile a list of particular objects or things to look for, such as a red tea pot or t-shirt bearing a picture of a cat, then send them off to search. Not only is a this a good way to get your daily walking in, it will also force you to keep a sharp eye and be more observant of the environment around you.Give everyone a blank sheet of paper containing the items they must look for and a space to record where they found it, or have them take a picture of the item on their phone to show the group later.

, If there's enough of you, take turns hunting each other in a mall-wide game of hide-and-seek. Agree on a limited number of stores to stick to that can serve as legal hiding places, or confine the game to one particular wing or location within the mall, like the arcade or shops around the food court. Then, give one person a minute or two to find a hiding place and send the group after them!You can seek individually if there's only 3-5 friends in your group, or divide up into teams if there are more players.
When playing games like hide-and-seek in the mall, be sure to abide by mall rules. Don't run around or act like a nuisance somewhere where something might be broken or annoy others.

, There are few better places to people watch than the mall. All sorts of people come and go constantly, and there’s a strange fascination in watching their interactions. Simply post up with your pals and step outside yourselves for a moment to see what’s going on in other people’s lives.Try not to let anyone catch you staring, and don’t be too obvious about laughing or talking about the people you see passing by. There’s observing and then there’s being rude.
If you get bored, play people watching games: subtly mimic conversations of people talking in the distance, keep count of the number of people wearing socks with sandals or try to predict how many of your acquaintances you’ll run into throughout the day., If nothing else, shopping malls provide you with lots of things to see and a reason to get out and walk around. Even if you don’t end up buying anything, you and your group of friends will have an interesting place to wander about. There’s a lot of ground to cover, and moving continuously through a crowded mall while dodging slow walkers, baby strollers and other obstacles is a workout on its own.Walking is one of the best activities you can perform to keep your body healthy; you won’t even feel like you’re exercising if you’re simply navigating the mall.Wear a pedometer to track the number of steps you take during a day of shopping. Add to that the weight of all the shopping bags you’re carrying and you may be burning some serious calories.

, When your stomach starts growling, pop into the mall food court. There, you’ll find a huge diversity of restaurants all available to help put your hunger to rest. These are different depending on the mall, but some of the usual highlights are pizza, burritos and Asian food—enough options to satisfy you and your friends’ individual tastes!Get everyone to visit a different restaurant, then you can all share the food that you bring back.
If you’re unsure about where you want to eat, make a lap around the food court and see if any of the restaurants are offering free samples. If something tastes especially good, give that place a shot. Sometimes you can even fill up just trying samples!

, Assuming you don’t feel like crowding into the frantic food court, check the mall’s directory board again and see if there are any full-service restaurants attached to the mall. At one of these restaurants you and your entourage can be treated to a delicious dining experience without the claustrophobic chaos. A sit-down restaurant might be the perfect place to eat and unwind for a while after a busy day of shopping.Some chain restaurants are partnered with shopping malls, putting their eateries at the outside entrances of the mall where they can be accessed easily by people going in and out.

, Maybe you’re on a shopping spree and don’t feel like stopping for long enough to eat. In that case, be on the lookout for food vendors around the mall. There are usually snack shops where you can break to get a hot dog, pretzel or cinnamon roll without dropping a lot of money. You can even eat it while you’re on the move from one store to the next.Be considerate of stores that don't want you eating inside if you've settled for something portable to eat.

, Have your friends get together at the mall cafe if shopping isn’t your main priority. Catch up on each other’s affairs over a latte, or just sit and regroup somewhere away from the hustle and bustle of aimless shoppers. Coffee shops are an ideal place to grab refreshments, relax and enjoy some social conversation or just kill time.


Coffee shops also make a great rendezvous point for your group should anyone become separated, or if you all need to meet back up at a certain time.
Free wi-fi and wall sockets for charging dying phones can be found at most cafes.

, Talk over what movies that you and your friends would like to see. Catch a matinee showing while you’re there for an afternoon shopping session, or come back in the evening after the crowds have died down. Between the stores, the restaurants and the theater, you don’t even have to leave the mall to enjoy a full day’s worth of fun.Shopping mall theaters always show the most recent blockbusters, and in some cases keep them running longer than standalone theaters to give people more chances to see them.

, While arcades don’t enjoy the same appeal as social hubs that they used to, you can still find them around at most malls, and you might be surprised how much fun you and your friends can have playing games, winning prizes and challenging each other. A good arcade will have all the classic staples, like skee ball, but also boast newer games and attractions. Head down to the arcade on your next trip to the mall and feel like a kid again!The playful competition of multiplayer titles, like racing and dance-off games, will have you and your friends having a blast for hours.
Pool all the tickets you’ve won at the end of the day to cash in for one big prize.

, The mall can be a stressful place; getting a convenient rubdown while you’re there may be just the thing you need. Salons are always an option for those looking for the traditional manicure/pedicure, but take a look around for Chinese acupressure and water massage places as well. Get off those tired feet and receive the spa treatment without ever having to book an appointment.Though they don’t always allow for the same level of privacy and quiet, salons and massage parlors at the mall tend to be much more affordable alternatives to overpriced, overbooked day spas.
Some department stores will do makeovers at the cosmetics counter for anyone who is interested. The next time you and the ladies are out at the mall, get your nails painted, your makeup done, and your hair styled as a group."

Tag your partner in your social media posts.,
Share content with your partner on social media.,
Call out your partner on social media.",How to Deal with a Partner Who Ignores You on Social Media2," If talking to your partner is not an option, you can try using social media to get your partner’s attention and get them to start responding to you online. One way to do this is to tag your partner in your social media posts. Doing this could be a not so subtle way of getting your partner’s attention and forcing them to click on your posts.


You can tag your partner on social media sites like Facebook and Instagram by using the @ symbol in front of your partner’s username on social media. This will tag them in your posts and they will get a notification letting them know you have tagged them. This could force them to then look at your tag and your post.

, Another way you can get your partner’s attention is to share content with your partner on their social media pages. You may post a link to a video they might enjoy on their Facebook wall or you may write a funny comment on their Instagram post. Sharing content with your partner can make them notice you online and put them in the position where they have to at least acknowledge your social media presence.


You may try sharing content with your partner that you think they might find interesting or engaging enough to comment on. Look for videos, articles, and memes online that your partner may like and post it on their social media to get their attention.

, You may resort to this option if you have tried tagging and posting on your partner’s social media to no avail. Only go with this option if your partner is ignoring you due to carelessness or to hurt you, and always try discussing the issue in person with them before resorting to online tactics. Keep in mind calling out your partner online will be public and seen by everyone they know on social media. You do not want to bully your partner online in front of others or shame them. Instead, take on a friendly tone and call them out in a light, fun way so they do not get upset.For example, you may post on your social media, “My partner likes to ignore me on social media because he thinks he’s too cool!” Or you may post a message to your partner on their wall like, “Remember me?”
Try to keep the call out message light and fun. Your partner may get freaked out if you start calling them out a lot online and see it as shaming them into paying attention to you. These types of postings will likely only lead to a fight or a conflict with your partner.

Interact with them via technology.,
Tell a good story.,
Amuse him with humour.,
Avert the conversation from possible triggers.,
Recommend a good show or book.",How to Distract Someone2," Technology has been proven time and again as the number one distraction in the modern world.Although this is usually thought of as a bad thing, it can work to your advantage if you're trying to keep someone distracted.


For instance, you should try linking them to a funny video on YouTube.
Text messages are a great distraction.
There are plenty of online games you can recommend someone play.

, Everybody loves stories. Stories allow someone to step out of their own lives for a short while and experience life in someone else's shoes. A funny anecdote about your own life can be all you need to effectively distract someone. Humour is important in a story, especially if you're trying to get the other person's mind off of something serious.A good story can be found just about anywhere in your life. It's usually best if the story actually happened to you. That way, the interaction will feel more like a bonding experience between the two of you.


Try to keep your story to the point. Offer details when you think it helps the person get a better idea of what's going on, but make sure you don't stay in one place for too long., While humour and laughter are a great source of enjoyment at the best of times, they are also the best possible coping mechanism. It is highly recommended as a healthy distraction, as it's simple, effective and usually inexpensive.Depending on the existing relationship you have with the person you're trying to distract, humour may come easily o may be more difficult.


If you're really stumped for humour, you might try reciting a few jokes beforehand. That way, if nothing comes naturally to you, you'll at least have something to try with.

, If you're trying to distract someone from something in particular, you need to be wary of bringing an association of that thing to the person's mind while you talk. While you shouldn't let your caution get in the way of proper conversation, it's recommended you keep the thing you're distracting him from in your mind while you talk. Try to think of things that may trigger an association in that person's mind and avoid them accordingly.For example, if your friend was recently in a traumatic car accident, you may want to avoid talk of anything automobile related, even if it's something as innocuous as going to a drive-in movie.

, Chances are you won't be able to give your undivided attention to someone over a longer period of time. Recommending something your friend should check out on his own helps to open up a window for him to distract himself on his own time when you're not around. Shows and video games are great distractions, but books are great too. The mind is easily distracted if it's being bombarded with interesting material.

Be confident.,
Switch up your tactics.,
Understand the placebo effect.There has been a lot of research done into the role of placebos and 'false distractions'.,
Catch up on the issue later on.",How to Distract Someone3," Confidence is a necessary part of keeping someone's attention for a longer period of time. If you struggle with having confidence in yourself, it will no doubt manifest itself in the way you act and talk. Having confidence is essential in succeeding with most social interactions. Make a habit of stomping out any negative thoughts you may have towards yourself, and try to replace them with positive thoughts. Even if you don't believe the positive self-affirmations at first, simply thinking them will have a noticeable effect on the way you feel.Make a list of the things you like most about yourself. Now's not the time to be modest! Whether it's something you like about yourself or something you've done you feel proud about, there's already a ton you could fill up a page with. At the end, you can look at the list and know you have reasons to feel confident.
Comparing yourself with other people won't get you anywhere. If you really want to distract someone else, you can't be thinking negatively about yourself while you're at it.

, Eventually, even the best distraction will run out of steam. To keep up with distracting someone, your best bet is to switch up your plans. If you've been doing something like playing a video game for example, it's a good idea to do something else once you think the other person is beginning to get restless. Even the most enjoyable activity will become less stimulating over time.


You can always go back to something that really worked at a later point if the distraction needs to span the course of days.

, The power of belief is strong, and a person's perception can be changed if they are led to believe in something. Understanding how powerful and therapeutic a distraction can be a strong motivation if you're trying to help out a friend.


By understanding the role of placebos, you should also know that they don't work if the person is aware that you're consciously trying to distract them. If they think you're saying or doing something purely to keep their mind occupied, it's not likely to be successful.

, Even a while after the need for a distraction has ceased, it's a good idea to check back and see what the person's experience was. Sometimes, you may find that the other person was simply buying into your activity because he thought it was what you wanted. Other times, you'll find the distraction worked. It's not recommended to tell the person you did those things purely with the intent of distraction, but it is good to reflect on the experience and whether you think it worked out.


You should approach a follow-up carefully. Without making it obvious that you were intentionally trying to distract the person, you could say something along the lines of ""How do you think you managed in hindsight?"" Don't reference yourself in any part of the question. This will make it seem like you had some active role to play in the distraction.

Watch body language.,
Listen to tone of voice.,
Watch facial expressions.,
Examine physical distance.,
Watch how people react to what you say.",How to Develop Social Awareness2," Watch people’s body language in different situations. Notice how much people communicate with their bodies through gestures, posture, or head movement.Consider that the same gestures can mean different things. For example, think about someone shrugging their shoulders. This often means “I don’t know” or “I don’t care.” Or consider what it means when someone crosses their arms in front of them. Sometimes it means they are wanting to pull away from the conversation (think of it as a “self-protective” type of gesture), sometimes it can express anger, or sometimes it is because the person is cold!
Imagine you had a mute button and could turn off the sound: Do you think you could figure out the context of the conversation by watching how people move?

, You can say the same words, but change your tone of voice, and the words will take on different meanings. A person’s tone of voice conveys the emotion behind the words.For example, think about how “I’m fine” sounds when someone is saying it in a friendly tone of voice, versus saying it in an angry tone of voice.
Test out your tone of voice by repeating a sentence, imagining you are feeling something different each time. How does “You scared me!” sound when you are pretending to be happy, shocked, angry, or sad?

, People have very expressive faces. Even when we try our best to conceal our emotions, they are often present on our faces anyway.


Look in a mirror and act out how you think you look when you are bored, happy, annoyed, or excited.
Facial expressions can often be very subtle, and it can sometimes take a while to discern them. For example, when people are genuinely happy, they smile with their eyes. You can see their eyes get crinkly in the corners. In a less genuine smile, the eyes don’t change as much, and oftentimes the lips remain closed.Consider how the similar facial expressions often indicate different emotions. A frown can indicate sadness or anger, for example, or an open mouth can indicate fear or surprise. If you can’t figure out what the person is feeling from their facial expression, look for other nonverbal clues, like their tone of voice or body language.

, Watch how close or far apart people stand from each other. You can tell a lot about a relationship by the space between two people. Pay attention to your own physical distance as well.


People who are in an intimate relationship may stand with no distance at all between them, while friends may stand closer together than work colleagues.If you are standing too close to someone, then you might notice that they keep moving away, turning away, leaning back, or crossing arms or legs. If you are too far away from someone, then you might notice that they are leaning in, squinting, furrowing their brow, or looking around and showing only mild interest in the conversation.

, People’s responses can help keep you aware of your behavior. Watch their nonverbal cues and listen to what they say.


For example, a person who says, “That’s great!” while slowly backing away probably does not want to have a conversation with you right now.
A person who is leaning toward you, smiling and making eye contact, is probably genuinely interested in what you have to say, and you can take that as a cue to continue.

Search for volunteer opportunities.,
Educate yourself about different people and their concerns.,
Travel abroad.,
Travel to a new part of town.",How to Develop Social Awareness3," Connect in your community. Take your empathy skills to the next level by understanding what other people experience as a group or culture, for example. This will help you be socially aware at a community, or perhaps even global, level.Find a volunteer opportunity that requires you to listen to and tend to the needs of another person or group. For example, you may wish to work at a food pantry or soup kitchen to understand the needs of people in poverty. You may wish to visit homebound senior citizens experiencing loneliness. You may wish to help new immigrants learn the language of their new country.
Explore service opportunities in schools, cultural centers, political organizations, religious communities or neighborhood activities.

, Meet people in the population you are interested in. Read books written by people in this group, or listen to podcasts with a host from this group. This will give you insight into their lives and increase your awareness of problems they face.

, Immerse yourself in a different culture. Step out of your comfort zone to experience unfamiliar groups. Exposing yourself to diverse cultures and ways of life will expand your thinking and view of the world. Being immersed in different belief systems, cuisines and lifestyles is useful for expanding your social circle and building tolerance for diverse viewpoints.If you are a student, spend a semester or do coursework abroad.
Talk to people on your travels. Many people will be friendly and willing to share their country with you.
To really learn about a country, venture out of tourist areas and into local neighborhoods. This gives you a better opportunity to see day-to-day life unfold.

, If you can’t afford a trip out of the country, consider local opportunities to learn about other cultures. You may be surprised at the variety of people who live near you.


Visit a local museum devoted to an ethnic group or culture.
Spend a day in an ethnic neighborhood in your community (or perhaps nearby larger city). Walk around the neighborhood and try a new food for lunch.
Attend a religious service of a faith different from yours.

Thank people for their actions toward you.,
Give thanks for criticism.,
Stop apologizing to yourself.",How to Be Thankful Instead of Sorry1," Instead of apologizing for your less-than-ideal actions toward others, thank them for their understanding actions toward you. If you were late, for example, say, “Thank you for being patient while I was running late,” rather than simply apologizing.This lets others know that you not only understand that your actions had consequences on them, but allows you to acknowledge and appreciate that others went out of their way to accommodate you.
Giving thanks should be sincere, just like an apology. Truly consider what you appreciate about someone else’s actions toward you in a situation where you feel the need to apologize. Then, thank them for that action.
Understand that there are some circumstances where an apology may be more appropriate or where both an apology and expressing gratitude may be appropriate. For example, if you spill your coffee on a stranger, then you might say something like, ""I am so sorry I stained your blouse! Thank you for being so understanding and kind about it."";
, In many cases, such as at school or work, criticism is often intended to be constructive. Even if the person criticizing you does not deliver their message in the most constructive way, try to thank them for their feedback.When someone criticizes you, tell them, “I am thankful for your feedback and will try to apply it going forward.”
Do not be afraid to ask questions when someone critiques you or your work. Especially in a workplace environment, the more you understand about why a person is critiquing you, the more you can do to work on the problem.
Know that you do not have to take all criticism to heart. When someone offers you non-constructive criticism, thanking them and then letting the issue go shows strength and confidence.

, Instead of thinking critically about yourself, try thanking yourself for what you did do right, even in situations that did not go as planned. Think about the situation, and let yourself know, “I’m thankful that I made this decision in this situation because…”Even if you did not make the best choice or take the best action in a given circumstance, you can still be thankful for your choice because it provided you with the opportunity to reflect, learn, and improve in the future. Try to remind yourself that you are a work in progress and that mistakes are opportunities for you to learn and grow.
Talk to yourself in the mirror or write a letter letting yourself know why you are thankful. Even if it seems silly at the time, communicating with yourself helps reaffirm why you are thankful.

Be honest with yourself, always.,
Be Happy.,
Avoid trying to be popular.,
Develop your interests.,
Have an opinion.",How to Have a Great Personality1," Awkward situations are always uncomfortable. Don’t try to be someone that you aren’t. If you meet some new people don't worry about not having anything in common with them, just make light conversation, be friendly, and ask questions. For example, say you're at a party that you came to because you wanted to make friends. Say you're talking to someone you really don't enjoy talking to. Just be polite and end the conversation! You don't have to be fake.;
, Try to always look on the bright side, be positive and smile. No one can resist a happy person. This doesn't mean be fake, or feel you have to hide your feelings. If something's really bothering you, never feel you have to fake a smile. Just make sure you try to see the best in things and show people that you're a happy person. , If it looks like everything you do is with the goal of getting other people to like you...well, you're not going to try to come off very well. The most important thing is developing a dependable group of friends who you care about and who care about you. Don't rush into having lots of friends just for the sake of numbers. Choose the people that you really enjoy hanging out with. If that ends up being a lot of people, great! If it's only three people, that's fine too.

, One essential part of having a good personality is having interesting things to talk about. That doesn’t mean you need to study astrophysics – you just need to have interests. If you are excited about something you probably will be able to tell other people about it in an interesting way. It really doesn’t matter what you like to do! Try to read something everyday. Watch movies. Look for new hobbies. Just try to experience what the world has to offer!

, This is similar to developing your interests. When you talk to people you want to have things that matter to you that you can talk about. Develop an opinion on politics or sports or animals or parenting or anything like that you are interested in. Don’t worry about agreeing with the other person as long as you can converse civilly. People will appreciate the personality of someone who is able to express their opinions about things. Having an opinion will help you talk to people and make your conversations more interesting. If you meet someone and they say something you don't agree with, don't be afraid to respectfully state your opinion. They probably will think you are more interesting than if you just agree over and over again.

Recognise that sometimes the person you are speaking to may not find you boring at all!,
Refrain from building one conversation into a generalization.",How to Know if a Person Is Getting Bored of You," If you keep getting the same answers or comments, such as ""Yeah"", ""Mmm"" or a disinterested, ""really, right"" chances are the person you are talking to finds you, or your topic of conversation boring.;
, A person who is bored might simply respond with one- or two-word questions such ask ""When?"" or ""For what?"". An interested person who isn't finding you boring will ask you more complicated questions, such as: ""When did that happen?,"" or ""Was it a good experience?"" and will normally ask for more details.

, If you are being asked more and more questions, then the person you are talking to is probably really interested in your conversation; if they are not they won't ask many questions at all.

, Do you get interrupted when you are talking? Do people try to change the subject when you're in conversation with them? Do people talk over you and appear not to be really listening to you. For example:


Wiki- Last night I watched that show it was really cool and
Wiki(2) - But listen..
Wiki- And those peoples were dancing.
Wiki(2)- OK so.

, Bored people will not express an opinion on what you are saying and may try to change the subject and offer their opinions on unrelated subjects.

, If a person is changing the topic, like if you are talking about your pet, and the person suddenly asks a question like, ""Did you saw Jackson's performance?"" then, could be you they are getting bored with you or your conversation.

, People with a good connection generally turn to face each other. A person who is partially turned away isn't fully embracing the conversation.

, Are they making less eye-contact?

, If they make quick response (maybe after five seconds) then the person isn't getting bored but if the person takes longer, then he/she might be getting bored.

, Remember, though, not everyone finds everything interesting. Hopefully you have developed some passions in your life that others will find interesting. Figure out your passion or explore something new.

, Thinking twice is a good habit, but try not to think too much. Just think twice. It's okay to just say what you first think of some times, ideally, think twice, make sure what you're going to say makes sense, and say it! Try not to stand there thinking of twenty different ways to say something before you say it, especially if all you were planning on saying was, ""We have to do this, right?"" So, the point is:


Try more to say what comes to mind first in conversations. This leads to more energetic and spontaneous chats.

, Be happy. Laugh sometimes. If you pride yourself on your ability to be “realistic"" don’t get your hopes up, view life as it’s nothing to be proud of.

, Tease people, joke and be cool. Often shy and socially insecure people try to be “perfect” socially so no one has a reason to criticize them. Some people could find this boring.

, Don't talk too much. Listening should be there too. In Short, talk and listen. Do both equally or, some people believe the reason why we have one mouth and two ears is so we talk half as much as we listen!

, Don't look down and talk to your boots! If you lack good eye contact people assume you aren't really interested in the interaction.

, Being interesting is what being real is. Our unrealistic beliefs about ourselves cause us to create meanings that aren't true. In other words, you believe you are boring so your mind finds “evidence” of this even when it doesn't exist.

, They may just be really struggling to understand you and being a little lazy about making any effort to get you to clarify what you are saying.

, Don't believe that a person who finds one conversation with you a little on the dull side, thinks that you yourself are a boring person.

Take inventory of what you have.,
Write a journal.,
Practice mindfulness.",How to Be Thankful Instead of Sorry2," Being grateful has been suggested to improve happiness and build stronger social bonds.Start finding what you are grateful for by taking inventory of what you have in your life that you enjoy.


Write a list of things you appreciate in your own life so that you can look back and reflect when you are feeling down. You can also invite friends and family members to help you create this list by adding their own items to it. This may help you to see things that you might not have considered.
Consider everything you have, from larger or more conceptual ideas such as the opportunity to earn a living or pursue a quality education down to the little things that make every day better, like your favorite snack.
Include people such as friends and family as well as pets if you are appreciative of them in your life.
Look online for lists others have created talking about what they are grateful for to help give you ideas., Journaling is a particularly effective tool for times when you need to work through sorrow to a point of being thankful. Take some time and write about what you currently feel sorry about, but also find some specific moments in your day for which you are thankful.Try to avoid expressing gratitude toward the same things every day. Instead, challenge yourself to find a few new and specific things each day for which you are thankful.For example, instead of saying you are thankful to have a friend in your life, instead cite a specific reason you are glad to have that friend, such as noting how they brightened your mood when they told a joke that day.
When you are feeling sorry, read over your journal to remind yourself of what you have to be thankful for in your life, even when times are rough. Another option is to post your gratitude list somewhere you will see it every day. This can help to keep you focused on the things you are grateful for.

, Mindfulness is a practice by which one tries to be fully aware of the present instead of focusing on the past or future. Practice mindfulness by taking some time each day to simply sit and observe the world around you. Put all of your focus and energy into knowing what is happening around you, rather than giving in to worries about the past or the future.When you practice mindfulness, it allows you to notice what you have around you. You focus less on what you are lacking, and start to build gratitude toward the world around you.
Start practicing mindfulness by setting aside small amounts of time, just ten to fifteen minutes a day, to notice the world around you. To get started, close your eyes and focus on what you hear, smell, and feel around you. Then open your eyes and try to see if you notice anything you have never noticed before. When you catch your mind wandering, gently bring it back by focusing on something happening around you.

Allow yourself to grieve.,
Talk to someone about how you are feeling.,
Find out if there is something you can do to make amends.,
Try meditation.,
Find one benefit.",How to Be Thankful Instead of Sorry3," If you truly have something about which you feel sorry, do not ignore the emotion. Instead, allow yourself time to reflect and feel sorry. Set aside a period of time each day where you allow yourself to simply feel sorry and cope with your emotions.If you feel yourself being overcome by sorrow outside of this period, try to remind yourself that you will have time to properly cope with your emotion.
Outside of your designated grief time, work on your thankfulness. Try to find the positive in time not specifically set aside for your sorrow.

, Talking to a trustworthy friend or family member may help you to process your feelings. Try calling up someone who will be supportive and a good listener. Share honestly about how you have been feeling and listen to what your loved one has to say about it.

You can start by saying something like, “Lately I have been feeling really sorry about _____ and it has been having a negative effect on me.”

, Making amends for the thing you are feeling sorry about may help to make you feel better and make it easier to forgive yourself as well. Try asking the person what you could do to make it up to them, or consider the situation and what might be an appropriate response.

For example, if you broke a treasured trinket that belonged to one of your office mates, then you might make amends by purchasing them a new one.

, When you feel overcome by sorrow, try meditation to clear your head. If you are new to meditation, pick one thing completely unrelated to your sorrow on which you can focus. Close your eyes, relax your body, and focus on that one thing to move your mind away from the sorrow.You could focus your attention on a mantra such as, “I can positively handle any negative emotions that come my way,” or on a mental image that makes you happy or thankful, like that of a close friend or special pet.
You may opt to meditate when you are feeling especially down or sorrowful, or you may choose to make meditation part of your daily life to help keep sorrow away.

, When things get rough, it is important not only to allow yourself time to recognize your sorrow, but also to find something positive to help you move forward. Take a look at your situation and look for one positive aspect, even if it is small.For example, if you receive bad marks on an exam or a poor performance review at work, you can assure yourself that you have the benefit of friends or family to help comfort you.

Ask questions and take interest in others.,
Show your confidence.,
Remain humorous and lighthearted.,
Try to be nice.,
Remain cool, calm and collected.,
Remain open to new relationships.",How to Have a Great Personality2," This is an incredibly easy and rewarding habit to add to your personality. People love to talk about themselves and if you are a curious and insightful person you should always be able to find something interesting about the person. Imagine a metal detector on a beach. Keep asking questions until you get closer and closer to the topic that they like talking about the most. For many people it’s their work, or their family, or their children. Find out what makes them tick and you’ll end up having an interesting and valuable discussion.


For example, if you meet someone try to find out what makes them interesting. It doesn't have to be a constant stream of questions but balance talking about your own experiences with what they say. Maybe you really like mountain biking and you notice they have a mountain bike. Don't start talking about how good you are at mountain biking - ask them a lot about what they enjoy.

, You don’t have to be someone you aren’t, but confidence can take many forms. Being confident doesn’t mean you have to suddenly be extremely extroverted and talkative. Reassure yourself everyday that you are amazing. Just be confident in the personality that you have and other people will be drawn to you. There’s no use faking it. People are attracted to those that are real. , People will thank you for bringing some fun into their world. Don’t make jokes at other people’s expense. Just keep a generally positive outlook on the world. When you encounter a problem try to laugh at it with other people rather than mope and complain. Everyone will appreciate this part of your personality and you will probably be happier for it too.

, This is the most important step. No matter who you are, if you are nice, the only reason a person can dislike you is if they are jealous of you. Never be rude to people. If someone is being unkind to you, try to imagine what might be causing him or her to act this way. Maybe they are going through a really difficult situation in their life and in reality they are a very good person. Try to assume the best in people. You don’t have to be naïve and it’s okay to remain skeptical, but that doesn’t mean you ever have an excuse to treat anyone poorly. , You always have to remember to keep your cool. This will earn you an enormous amount of respects, especially if you keep calm in situations where everyone else panics. Just try to take things as they come and don’t get too high or too low. This is something that you can do consciously and people will really respect your ability to keep everything together.


For example, try to find a way to make people feel comfortable and less tense if something bad happens. If your teacher moves your paper forward a week don't moan and complain - make a joke!

, Don’t pass judgment on anyone too quickly or assume you already have all the friends you need. Even if someone seems like they would be the type of person you normally really dislike, give them an opportunity. That’s what you would want, right? It’s the golden rule – treat other people the way you would like to be treated. You don’t need to try to make friends with people who are more popular than you or people you think can help you get ahead. Just deal with the people you meet on a case-by-case basis and surround yourself with the people you really enjoy. Always remain open to new friends and new relationships. "

Finish your tests way too early.",How to Irritate People," Talking too loudly is a time-tested way of annoying people in public almost anywhere you go. You can talk loudly on the bus, on a plane, or especially in a coffee shop while people are trying to get work done. It's especially annoying if you talk loudly on the phone, acting like no one else is around. If you reveal personal information, or just make really obnoxious comments, then you are guaranteed to annoy the people around you.


If someone asks you to be quiet, you should nod vigorously and apologize, and continue like before.;
, Ah, the phone. Probably the most annoying device you have in your possession. If you're at work or school, or even just having lunch at a cafe, leave it on, preferably with a very annoying song that comes on whenever it rings. Think something like, ""Taking Care of Business"" or ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" so that when your phone rings, everyone is utterly distracted. You can even make this sound your alarm, so it sounds like someone is calling when no one is. Bonus points if it takes you forever to find your phone so everyone gets to hear the entirety of the annoying sound or ring tone.


It's also pretty annoying to put your phone on vibrate. You may think that this is almost the same as putting your phone on silent, when in fact, everyone can hear your phone vibrate and can get annoyed by it, especially if you're in a particularly quiet place. This is perfect when you're having a long textual exchange with a friend, so that your phone will go off every few seconds.

, Though you should avoid approaching someone who may lash out at you or get very angry, if you really want to be annoying, then you can try to strike up a convo with someone who is obviously very busy, whether that person is studying for a test, working on his novel on his computer, or just reading with intense concentration. Act like you're completely oblivious and are just looking to chat someone up. When the person answers in one-word answers, ignore this and try to keep the conversation going.


You can say, ""What are you reading? I heard that book was pretty lame,"" or make other offensive comments about what the person is doing as an opener.
Talk on and on about yourself, making eye contact so the other person would feel bad about turning you away.

, This is another way to be pretty irritating in public. Repeatedly drop your books, spill your coffee, or just generally act like a mess who can't keep track of his or her stuff. The more you spill, the merrier. You can also bring shaving cream and when someone gets up to go to the bathroom you can poor the shaving cream all over the persons seat and this will really drive the person nuts and spill it all over the persons laptop. Make as much racket as you can so people feel forced to look up and maybe even to help you out. If you spill or drop your stuff in a way that crowd's someone else's personal space, then that will be even more annoying.


It'll be even more annoying if you don't apologize when this happens! Or, if you apologize way more than necessary so people feel sorry for you.

, Staring at people is another solid plan for irritating them. Just pick a stranger and stare at him or her for a prolonged period of time. You can even leave your mouth gaping open as you do this. When the person stares at you, scratch your head and continue to stare. Act like you're trying to win a staring contest and try to avoid blinking for as long as possible. Just be careful — try to stare at someone who seems nice and who wouldn't get too angry about this. Remember that your goal is to irritate the person, not infuriate him or her.

, Being nosy around strangers is another great way to irritate people. Let's say you're in line getting coffee and you hear two women talking in hushed tones about one of their divorces or another personal subject. Butt in and say, ""I couldn't help but overhear..."" and then offer an annoying opinion on something you know nothing about. If you really want to be annoying, you can even try to argue with the people about the topic.


Act like you're not being nosy and that butting in is your right. This is guaranteed to be irritating.
You can also be nosy and irritating by asking a stranger a person question. You can say something like, ""Do you know a good gynecologist around here?"" or ""I was just wondering, where do you get shoes that look so ratty like that?""

, Act like you've just been blasted out of the past. Wander around and act amazed at every little bit of technology you see. If you see someone using a phone, you can say something like, ""Oh my God, is that a telephone? Like, you can actually talk to someone through that thing? Jeez."" If you see someone on his or her laptop, you can walk up to it and say, ""You can communicate with the future on that thing! How absolutely fascinating!""


The important thing is not to break character. If the people see you smiling, then they'll get really mad. Otherwise, they are liable to think you're a little crazy and won't know what to do with you.

, This is the perfect way to irritate your friends. If you want them to get tired of you, fast, then you should try to copy and mimic everything your friend says and does. You can either be totally obvious about it, and just repeat everything your friend says, word for word, or you can be a bit more subtle, and copy your friend's gestures and movements instead. The obvious route will be more annoying, but your friend will tire of you faster. If you mimic everything your friend does, then it'll take longer for your friend to catch on.


Act like a mirror. Do everything your friend does but in reverse. If your friend asks you why you are mimicking him or her, act like you have no idea what your friend is talking about.

, Another great way to annoy your friends is to complain as much as you can. Everyone hates a whiner or a person who complains just for the sake of it. It's even better if you complain about completely pointless things, like the weather or something you saw on TV, so your problems don't sound all that serious. If you repeat the same complaint over and over, that is also likely to be pretty darn irritating.


It's best if you whine with an annoying look on your face and an annoying whiny sound to your voice. Make your own company as unpleasant as possible.

, People who are narcissistic or just plain obsessed with themselves are extremely irritating. When you're with your friends, make sure you use the word ""I"" as much as you can and to talk about your own problems and what you have going on as much as possible. When your friends try to talk about themselves, change the subject or say you suddenly have to go. This will irritate absolutely everyone.


This act will be difficult to keep up for long. Your friends will run far and away!
It's most effective if you tell long, boring stories about yourself without letting anyone interrupt you. If your friends have heard the story before, then all the better!

, Another perfect way to irritate your friends is to promise that you'll be somewhere and then completely flake on them. It's best if you act totally sincere, like you are absolutely set on going to the movies or giving your friend a ride to a party. Then, at the last possible second, make up a lame excuse for why you can't go, so you leave your friend hanging.


If you're really determined to be completely irritating, then you should not get back to your friend until hours later, so your friend is left wondering where the heck you are. Then, give some dumb excuse like, ""Sorry! I got sucked in to a Buffy marathon!""

, Another way to be extremely irritating is to invite yourself over to hang out with your friends when they obviously want some time away from you. If you hear your two friends talking about how much they want to catch up, then ask what time you can be there. If your friend was just talking about how much she needs alone time, ask if you can crash at her place for a bit. Act completely oblivious about not being wanted.


If you see your friends talking in hushed tones about something that is obviously serious, just walk right over and say, ""What's up, guys?""

, This is another extremely irritating habit that you can adopt. Ask your friend if you can borrow her favorite sweater, her favorite book, or a piece of jewelry that you think will be perfect for your new outfit. Then, keep promising to give the thing back without actually doing it. This is guaranteed to irritate your friends, and even to help you lose the item.


If your friend's things have sentimental value, then losing them will be extra irritating.

, One of the most irritating things you can do is to spill your friend's secrets. If your friend tells you something that is meant to be private, then you can try to let other people know. Obviously, use your discretion — if it's something truly personal, then it's best to back off, but if it's just something a bit embarrassing or silly, then you can ""accidentally"" mention it in front of your other friends or even on your Facebook.


If you want to be really irritating, act totally oblivious when your friend calls you out for doing what you did. Say something like, ""I thought everyone knew!"" Or, ""I didn't know it was such a big deal. Jeez!""

, This is one guaranteed way of irritating your sibling. If you have an older sister, help yourself to her clothes and jewelry. It's extra irritating for you to show up to school wearing her things without her realizing it. You can also use your brother's video games or sports equipment, and even bring them over to a friend's house. When your sibling gets mad at you, you can act like you didn't know you did anything wrong. Say something like, ""Ooops, sorry, I thought that was mine!""


If you want to be really irritating, then when your sibling brings home his or her favorite treat, try to eat as much of it as you can.
When you shower, try to use up your brother or sister's favorite shampoo.
Use your brother or sister's hairbrush, trying to leave as many strands of your hair in there as you can.

, There's nothing a sibling hates more than being bothered by another sibling when his or her friends are over. So, if your sibling is having a sleepover or just having a few friends over, you should try to be around as much as possible, bug your sibling, make ridiculous comments, or just ask if you can play, too. If your sibling keeps telling you to go away, find excuses to be around, like pretending you're looking for something in the room where your sibling is, humming to yourself loudly as you do this.


You can also embarrass your sibling by bringing up embarrassing stories or saying things like, ""Hey, where did you put your retainer?"" Or, ""It's so nice that you finally found some friends.""

, Another classic way to irritate your sibling is to tell your parents every wrong thing he or she does. It can be really minor, like not washing the dishes when he or she said she would. Do it was often as possible and make your sibling feel like he is constantly being watched by you. If you keep this up, you are likely to irritate your parents, too!


It's even better if you convince your sibling to do something bad or even do it along with him and then tattle on him, saying, ""It was all his idea!""

, Siblings hate living with messy brothers or sisters, especially if they share a room. If you're lucky enough to share a room with your favorite brother or sister, then you should leave your clothes all over the place and make sure to be so messy that it makes it hard for your sibling to find his own stuff. You can also squirt some toothpaste into the sink, leave your food all over the place, or just do whatever you can to create chaos in your sibling's orbit.


Of course, this may not last for long because your parents will ask you to clean up, but it will be very irritating for as long as you can pull it off!

, Nothing is more annoying than whining and acting like a big baby until you get what you want. If you want to really drive your sibling crazy, then the next time you want something, whether it's to have a bite of your brother's pizza or to use your sister's computer, you should whine, complain, or even cry until you're so irritating that you just have to get your way.


There is no age limit to this one. Crying and whining when you're 16 can be even more irritating because your sibling will feel embarrassed for you!

, This is another great way to completely not respect your sibling's privacy and to cause as much embarrassment as possible. The next time you know your brother will have his girlfriend over, you should try to be around as much as possible, being loud and annoying, and making comments like, ""I'm so glad you finally found a date. Remember when you were crying about how no one would go out with you?""


You can even sing the K-I-S-S-I-N-G song or just keep asking your sibling and his or her special someone when they're going to kiss each other. This will be especially irritating if they haven't done it yet!

, There are times when nothing can be more annoying to a teacher than rolling in to class a minute or two late. This is most annoying if you apologize with a dumb smirk on your face, or just walk in looking cool and collected, like you couldn't care less about how your teacher is actually feeling, or like the class is your absolute last priority.


It can also be pretty irritating if you show up just as the bell is ringing so the teacher can't actually say anything.
If you shuffle through your things and take a long time to get settled after you show up late, that will be even more irritating!

, Another way to really irritate your teacher is to ask questions that are so obvious that they make it clear that you haven't been paying attention at all. If you're in an Algebra class, ask something like, ""What does X mean again?"" Or another question that makes the teacher have to go back to the beginning, or just to get annoyed that you haven't been paying attention.


You can also wait until you go over something in depth, acting like you're not paying attention. When the lesson is almost over, ask a question that shows you haven't been paying attention at all. You can even say something like, ""Sorry, I must have totally zoned out!""
You can also ask really silly or irrelevant questions like, ""What color was Ben Franklin's hair?""

, Some teachers get the most irritated by students who act like know-it-alls. Let's face it. It's pretty likely that your teacher knows more about the subject material than you, and if you act like your teacher is wrong, ask her to prove what she said, or even try to look up some facts from class on Wikipedia to show how wrong they are, then you are guaranteed to irritate your teacher.


It's also annoying if you try to quote a different teacher or your parents to show that your teacher is wrong.

, Teachers absolutely hate it when their students sleep in class. If you want to be very irritating, then you should try to do this as much as you can. Bonus points if you can snore or make the other students giggle. Sleeping in class won't help your grade any, but it will definitely irritate your teachers. It'll be extra irritating if you wake up out of sleep just long enough to ask an obvious question.

, It's bad enough if you're determined to be annoying on your own, but if you bring other students into the equation, that will be even more irritating for your teachers. Pass notes to the other students, crack stupid jokes, or just get them involved in conversation. Be so funny and goofy that other students can't help but pay more attention to you than the teacher. This is bound to be exceptionally irritating, especially if you get students who are normally well-behaved to start acting out!


Show other students a hilarious YouTube video. This is bound to be irritating for at least a few seconds before your phone gets taken away.

, Another way to irritate your teachers is to finish your test way too early so you make the other students nervous. Wait a reasonable amount of time so that it could possibly seem like you might have breezed through the questions, but not so long that other people may be almost done. Once you ""finish,"" say ""Done!"" or even, ""That was easy!"" Turn in your test with swagger, slam down your pencil, and maybe even kick your feet up. Do whatever you can to be distracting and irritating and to make the other students nervous.


This is bound to drive your teacher crazy, especially if she spent a lot of time preparing students for the exam!

Quit labeling yourself as shy, timid, nervous, antisocial, etc.,
Don't be too talkative!",How to Keep People Interested in You1," Labels, just like on objects and items, keep you stuck in that one place until you're taken out. You're not an object, and as long as you're convinced you're antisocial, only you can remove yourself from this negative label.


Speak more. Introduce yourself to people you see daily but don't talk with often, and you'll see how quickly your amount of relationships grows. You can also do this by presenting more; whether you're answering a simple question or reading an essay in front of a large audience, people will get to meet you and talk with you if you present.;
, Think talking with a person, and not to them. If you're talkative, escaping the curse can seem nearly impossible, but that's a mental barrier. Overcome this by asking people questions about himself or herself more, putting you aside as much as possible. Don't be completely guarded over yourself, but don't talk too much at people.


Self-assess and find out why you're talkative. If you're filling a void, maybe feeling trapped and alone in home or at school or work, or crave the attention, consult a professional therapist for help overcoming these issues. These are often too deep to penetrate yourself.

"
"
Don't disclose too much information about yourself.,
Share interesting moments through gossip.,
Don't say ""uh"" or ""um"" too much - save that for text talk!",How to Keep People Interested in You2," If somebody asks you questions, give him or her simplistically vague answers. This makes people want to learn more, perhaps giving them more of a reason to talk to you.


If somebody asks something personal, such as, ""What do you do for your birthday?"" answer with something such as, ""I'm always with my family and we have a small tradition. Sometimes friends get to come if they're close, otherwise I have a birthday party. We do something different each year."" This will leave people wanting to know 1) what the tradition is, 2) why the friends who come to the family celebration get to come, and 3) what happens at the birthday parties. They'll have to talk to you more to find out.

, Don't gossip about others unless the person(s) give you explicit permission to do so or you only share within a close social person the other is in as well. Tell about yourself and experiences, but still be vague.


Let's say you're a girl and you met a boy at your friend's party at a roller rink who chatted you up about maybe hanging out. You could say, ""I was at a party someplace and met a cute guy. He suggested going somewhere, but I don't know if I'm busy.""

This leaves the people you told it to wanting to know 1) whose party, 2) party where, 3) who the guy was, 4) what he said to you, and 5) why you might be busy. Being vague can't be stressed enough.



, Saying these small words mean the difference from being seen as confident and casual to nervous and an over-thinker. Unless somebody gives a particularly hard question, limit the usage of the conversation-breakers. You want to be quick while still understood.

"
"
Have social networking.,
Go places.",How to Keep People Interested in You3," Get a Facebook and a Kik at least, and a phone number, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram if you feel necessary. Ask for peoples' mobile contact information once you deem it appropriate. They might not have a lot of it (especially if you're in school), so ask in parts combining multiple social networks.


An example of a double multimedia conversation would be, ""We should chat more! Do you have a phone number or Kik?"" If the answer was to be no, continue with, ""Maybe a snapchat or Facebook?"" By now, if they haven't had any, they should tell you that they either 1) don't have any social network accounts, or 2) have a different social network account and will proceed to give it to you.

, If you're in school, invite friends to come over to your house to do homework and hang. In most social settings, you can invite people to go to a diner, a park, a coffee shop, mall, skate park, movie, etc. Conversations have an odd spark when in a setting other than the usual. If you see the chance, take it.

"
"
Be unique!,
Be funny.,
Have your own style.,
Share stories.",How to Keep People Interested in You4," If you're into art, make art for others and show it off. If you play an instrument, join the orchestra, band, or form your own musical group. Take your unique talents and show the world what you can do with them!

, People are naturally attracted to those who are funny, and this is the #1 way to make ""unspoken friends"" - where you're obviously friends, but it just happened one day with no real conversation needed. Join in or add on to jokes, crack one when appropriate, and laugh things off.


Make sure you can take things seriously. Laughing or being funny too much can ruin relationships and bring your social status down a few rungs on the ladder. If somebody is going through a hard time, it may be okay to tell a joke to cheer him or her up, but not a joke about the situation.

, Like an Indie artist, nobody has heard of? Go ahead and listen to it with some friends, and enjoy it yourself. Obsessed with a certain snack or drink? Let others try! Wear bright colors while the rest of your environment is a bit more monotone? Heck, if it looks good, why wouldn't you?


Don't constant flaunt these different features. There's a huge difference between sharing your interests and forcing something down others' throats. Like what you like, but don't show them around like they're any more important than the mainstream.

, Once again, be vague in them, but go on and share them. Something funny at a birthday party, a strange experience on New Year's, dealing with an ex on Valentine's Day, or perhaps an odd gift for the holidays can all be shared.

Leave an interaction with a touch of praise.",How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing with People," Humans trade things of value for other things of value. People who don’t involve themselves in a fair trade may lack confidence or leach confidence from others.;
, However, you can learn to deal with people of all types. You may find more success in dealing with people than in trying to develop meaningful relationships with them.


Although this is more relevant in a business setting, it may be something to take away from certain friendships as well.
This process can also help you have more meaningful relationships with family members and friends who you do want to be close to.

, As many experts believe, if you want to rise to a high level in business or the community, you will have to try to build confidence in yourself first before you can lead others., Giblin believes these things are admiration, acceptance, approval and appreciation.

, Dealing with people is about giving them respect in any interaction. If you don’t think other people are important, they are unlikely to respect you in return.

, Notice people and listen to them. Take note about what is important and exceptional about them, and tell them when appropriate.


Avoid sarcasm. This is a way to undercut people before they feel the admiration that they crave. Positive methods are better than negative methods.

, Journal or think about your worth. Do things that bring you more in touch with what is valuable about you.

, Just like 12 steps advocates, you should accept the things you can’t change, and you may find you have more time to affect things that can be changed.

, Instead of being self-deprecating, thank people and accept their compliments.

, In other words, give thanks for what you have. Avoid being ungrateful of what others contribute to you.

, This is a central part of the process in dealing with other people. First, feed your hunger for acceptance, approval and appreciation, and then feed that hunger for other people.Another way to say this is that you need to accept your own need to feel important and be liked. Then, you can accept that other people are looking for the same thing.

, You should ideally spend half your time listening and half your time talking, so that you can address the other person’s needs as well. People are likely to mirror this attitude.

, People will also mirror your attitude. Understand that the attitudes you have influence other people.

, They are likely to appreciate the respect, admiration and appreciation this act gives them. Nod, acknowledge the importance of the topic and smile.


Body language is extremely important. Don’t cross your arms in front of you or frown at someone as they talk.

, Don’t volunteer personal information, but be ready to speak about yourself when asked.

, Enthusiasm is better than sarcasm.

, This is a way to express admiration and approval. Asking advice at the right time is a great way to deal well with people who might otherwise object or be confrontational.

, Remember to stay calm, respect your opponent’s turn to speak and speak your own side with confidence.It creates an environment of mutual respect that will help you deal with the most demanding people.

, It is likely to stick with the person, because you are feeding their need for approval. This leads the way to influence.

Pay attention to how others react when you talk about the relationship.,

I want to know if I talk about my relationship too much. Do you think I do that?”
Don’t get defensive if they answer yes. Remember, you are trying to figure out if you do this.;
, If you talk too much about your relationship, the people in your life will let you know. They will make comments about how much you talk about the relationship or share, or they will act bored or leave if you start talking about it.Watch how people react when you start talking about your relationship.

Ask yourself if you should share what you do.,
Assess how often you talk about your relationship.",How to Know if You Talk About Your Relationship Too Much2," There are some things that are acceptable to talk about regarding your relationship.

Personal details about your partner, intimate details, and information about conflicts are things that should not be discussed with anyone but a few close, trusted friends - if at all.Sharing too many details of your relationship can cause problems with you and your partner. It can also make others uncomfortable and reflect badly on you.

These may be indications that you talk about your relationship too much and for the wrong reasons.

, Another way to decide if you talk about your relationship too much is to evaluate everything you say about it. Are you sharing interesting and important details, or are you just talking about your relationship for no reason? Are you sharing personal or intimate details you shouldn’t? Be honest as you assess what you say.Remember, just because you think it’s interesting doesn’t mean everyone will. Are you sharing things that deserve to be talked about?

, Figure out how often you talk about your relationship. Do you do it every day? Do you find a way to bring your relationship into each conversation? Taking an honest assessment of how often you bring it up can help get a clear picture.


If you can’t remember how often you talk about it, you can start paying attention to how often you bring it up or want to bring it up.

Ask your partner if they are comfortable with how much you talk about the relationship.,
Discuss how much is appropriate to share with your partner.,
Admit if you are sharing things said in confidence.",How to Know if You Talk About Your Relationship Too Much3," Your partner can be a good gauge for how much you talk about your relationship. Find out if your partner is uncomfortable with how much you talk about the relationship and how much information you share. If they want you to hold back more, you probably are sharing too much.If your partner is a private person, talking about the relationship with people can make them uncomfortable. They may think that anything you say about the relationship is talking too much about it.

, If you talk too much about your relationship, you should talk with your partner about it. Together, set boundaries about what is acceptable to talk about and how much is acceptable.Tell your partner, “I think I have been talking too much about our relationship. I want to set boundaries about what we feel comfortable sharing and how often we feel comfortable talking about our relationship.”

, Even if you are sharing with your closest friends, telling them something that your partner told you in confidence is not right. This is considered talking too much about your relationship because you are sharing things that should remain private between you and your partner.Trust is key to your relationship. By telling others things that were told to you in private, you are violating your partner’s trust.

Let others save face.",How to Influence People," Having a friendly, outgoing personality goes a long way when it comes to having an influence on the people around you. People respond to people who are comfortable in their own skin, and are more inclined to follow their lead. But don't treat them like they are lower than you. Treat everyone like a friend, not like a younger sibling. People don't like when you are full of yourself.


Smile. People are drawn to a friendly smile. It makes you seem approachable and trustworthy.
Ask questions. Engage other people in conversations. Show an interest in them and they will become more open and responsive. Another way to start a conversation is simply asking for a pencil or helping them with something they seem to be struggling with.
Plan activities. Take the initiative and organize a group trip, for example, hiking or to a concert. This will help you make them friends and show them that you like them and include them.;
, In order to make a good impression, you need to show an active interest in the person you're talking to. Listen to what they are saying. A good listener learns a lot about people.


Ask stimulating questions about the other person's interests and opinions.
Respond to their questions with a sense of the topic. For example, if it is an upsetting conversation about sickness, don't tell a joke. Responding correctly will generate a sense of trust and create a bond between you.

, People are more likely to respond when they hear their name, as the use of their name makes your message more personal to them.


By remembering to use someone's name, you will seem like an interesting person who pays close attention to details. It is the same as remembering their birthday, so take notice in what they have to say about themselves.

, Building a relationship with someone is a two way street. It's about response and trust. You shouldn't use a conversation as a vehicle for forcing your ideas and opinions on others, without letting anybody else get a word in edgewise. Equally, you shouldn't check out of a conversation either, nobody wants to feel like they're talking to themselves.

, Encouraging someone to talk about the things they are passionate about is another great way to demonstrate an interest in others. It is also one of the best ways to get to know someone, a vital component in building a relationship. Even the shyest person will open up if you get them going on a topic they love.


If you find out that someone likes reading, ask them about the best book they've read lately, or ask them to recommend something for you.
If they're interested in something like rock climbing, ask them how they first got involved and see if they'd be willing to bring you along sometime.
Try not to overpower the other person by talking about your own interests too much. Remember, the aim is to make them feel interesting. Of course, if they're genuinely interested in hearing about your recent skydiving experience, don't refuse to talk about it!

, It is important to always respect other people's opinions, even during a disagreement. You do not need to agree with the other person, but you should allow them to express their opinions and beliefs without contradicting or belittling them. Relationships are built on trust and mutual respect, so it is important to recognize and accept your differences.


If you really have to disagree with someone, recognize that although you don't agree, what you hear is not unreasonable. “Yes, I see where you're coming from, however, . . .”
Make generous use of the metaphor of perspective. “Yes, but if you look at it from a different point of view,. . .”
Never tell another person that their opinions are crazy, stupid or worthless., Establish your place within a social circle by becoming friends or respected acquaintances with as many people within that circle as possible. This will increase your influence and power over that circle as a whole.


Don't just tag along and look bored if your friend introduces you to a new group of people. Seize the opportunity. Interact with them and try to get to know them, you don't know who you might meet!
Speak to people within the circle you don't normally hang out with. Try to become friends with them for their own sake, not just because you know them through someone else.
Host a party or group activity of some kind and invite as many friends, acquaintances and friends of friends as possible, then work the room!

, If you are wrong, be sure to admit it quickly and emphatically. The quick way to generate animosity is by failure to admit your mistakes when you are obviously at fault. So if you want to build credibility and respect, be sure that you are quick to admit your errors as soon as you realize them. People will admire your honesty and honesty inspires trust.

, If it is necessary to point out someone else's mistakes, make sure to do it in a constructive, positive way. The last thing you want to do is make another person feel small or stupid. If you are humble and matter-of-fact with your correction, you will find that your comments are more likely to be heard and taken to heart.If you are helping a person to avoid further embarrassment, try saying something like ""Hey, Tony. I noticed you were using your dinner fork for your salad. It doesn't matter that much, but you might start on the outside and work your way in. If you want, you can watch what I do."" Helping someone avoid further embarrassment is honorable.
If you are helping someone by reviewing a paper or report they wrote, try starting out with a compliment before pointing out some places they can improve: ""Hey Sally, great job on the paper! It was really interesting, but I've highlighted some information I think you should double check, I'm not sure if it's 100% accurate.""
Avoid correcting people in a curt, condescending, blunt, rude, abrasive, or exasperated manner.
Never correct someone in front of another person. Keep it between the two of you.

, If you have extensive knowledge on a given topic, it is worthwhile making this fact known, especially if that knowledge could potentially be used to help someone else. Don't brag about your knowledge or talk about it endlessly. This will make you seem like a know-it-all and will discourage people from asking you about for help. Make your expertise known and let people know you are happy to help, if needed.


If you let it be known that you are a financial whiz, your friends can come to you for monetary guidance or advice. They might feel more comfortable coming to someone they know and trust.
If you are a fluent second language speaker, let people know that you would be happy to tutor them before an upcoming exam or vacation.

, If you want to influence people, it is important that you live the kind of life that people can respect and look up to. You need to live life to the full and be the best person you can be. Some ways to achieve this include:


Holding a good job.
Taking care of your appearance.
Eating healthily and staying fit.
Avoiding drug and alcohol abuse.
Having interests and hobbies
Respecting others.

, Although having firm opinions and beliefs is an admirable trait, it is also important to keep an open mind and to be willing to try new things and learn from your experiences.


Strive to broaden your horizons. Engage in stimulating and thought-provoking discussions, read books and newspapers, travel as much as possible.
Be a yes person. If somebody offers to teach or show you something new, take them up on it.

, Always begin in a friendly manner if you are trying to influence others to your way of thinking. Avoid being bossy or demanding. Start by asking questions that they will quickly say yes to, in order to get cooperation.


Try something like ""Hey, I'm running out to the store to get some groceries. I'd love some company, would you please come with me?""
Or something like ""Gosh, I'm tired. Wouldn't it be nice to stay in and watch a movie tonight?""

, Try to understand where the other person is coming from. Ask yourself, what motivates them to do certain things? Again, it's about reciprocity; if you respect others' beliefs, they will appreciate you and your beliefs as well. By sympathizing with beliefs that you disagree with, you can help establish an air of open-mindedness which will help increase your influence.

, People are more likely to change their behaviors, if the change will benefit society as a whole, rather than just you.

, Never give orders (even with the word please). This makes the other person feel like you don't respect them or care about their input and might lead them to deliberately ignore or do the opposite of what you want. Instead, ask questions or make subtle suggestions.


For example, instead of saying ""You can't smoke in here, go somewhere else"" say something like ""Isn't it a nice day outside? Wouldn't it be nice to smoke outside instead?""
Instead of saying ""Take out the trash"" say something like ""Would you mind taking out the trash? I did it last night.""

, Praise is the best motivator for behavior, so be generous with your praise. However, don’t give praise just to give it, this will come off as being insincere. It means more to the recipient if it’s about something they recognize as praiseworthy.

, This is very important to influence others to your way of thinking. People can be critical of others' ideas, but if it's their idea, they will be much more in favor of it. You can do this by:


Using reverse psychology to encourage a person to do the opposite of what you say. If you're trying to convince someone to go clubbing with you, say something like ""Oh well I didn't think there was any point in asking you, you're not much of a party animal are you?""
Talking around an idea. Give the other person lots of hints and clues, but let them reach the conclusion themselves. If you want your partner to take you away for the weekend, make comments about needing a break from reality, wanting to spend some quality time together etc. And maybe leave some appealing brochures littered around the place, just for good measure.

, Helping others to save face is a good way of building trust. By saving them from an embarrassing situation, the other person will feel grateful towards you and might even feel like they owe you a favor. You can help others save face by:


Pretending that nothing happened. If somebody trips or calls someone by the wrong name, you can avoid causing them embarrassment by pretending you didn't notice.
Help to deflect attention away from the person after an embarrassing occurrence. For example, if somebody says something they're not supposed to or accidentally causes offense, you can help by quickly changing the subject.

See if she speaks negatively about many other people, including all her ex boyfriends.,
Be on the lookout to see how she treats others.,
Ask her what are her top values in life, and ask her to be specific.,
Behave in a casual relaxed manner.,
Make note if she is the kind of person who is able to apologize and own up to making a mistake.,
Pay particular attention to how she behaves when she is under stress.,
Listen very carefully when she speaks, because most people give away their personalities very quickly without realizing it.",How to Judge a Woman's Character,"  If she only has bad things to say about everyone else, chances are she won't think fondly of you after a while either.  On the other hand, if she tends to focus on the positive about people, she will probably be a much better girlfriend for you as well.  ;
,  For example, if you two are out at a cafe, restaurant, or coffee shop, how does she treat the employees, waiters and waitresses?  Is she abusive or is she sensitive? Kindness is free, so there is no excuse to be a miser with it.

,  If she focuses on things that are purely superficial, like fame and wealth, chances are she won't stick it out through the rough patches in life with anyone when she is in a relationship with them.  On the flip side, if she values loyalty, honesty, trust, and health, chances are she will appreciate a good man who treats her well.     

, This is important, because in order to get a woman to reveal her character, it's essential that you don't make her feel judged for being herself.  So try to be as relaxed as possible when interacting with a woman. Asking her about her values must be done in a way where she does not feel like there is a right or wrong answer. Don't come across as being too serious, or she will only present to you her ""formal"" self which is more of an act, rather than who she really is naturally.  

,  If she is not able to do this, she will be a horrible person to have a relationship with, for her ego is so big that she can't admit her mistakes or learn from them.

,  If she is still behaving in a way that is kind and honest and sensitive, she is proving to be an amazing woman.  However, if she becomes spiteful, hateful, or abusive, this is an indicator of how she will be in the future when under any type of stress.  And life definitely will have its stressful moments, so you can be sure such a woman will behave badly again in the future.

,  This is because most people don't consciously try to behave badly, so they all think they are great even if in fact they are abusive or cruel.

Everyone wants to live like they don't care what others think, so when they see someone actually doing that they are impressed.;
, Take responsibility for your actions but also take on responsibility. Being the ""adult"" in the situation, ready to be in control and handle the consequences, is impressive to others.

, Tell people your polite but honest opinion. Be open about biases you may have and be willing to tell someone when you think something won't work (even if it's your own product). When you make a promise or assurance, keep it. Over-deliver on things that you promise if you can. You want to be someone that people view as very trustworthy. This is seem as a rare trait and is admired.

, Be someone who can turn a terrible situation into a useful lesson without batting an eye. Always keep calm in tough situations. Don't be a complainer: just quietly confront problems and move on. People like people who can handle situations without becoming overwhelmed.

, Be respectful to your peers and superiors, but most importantly be respectful to people who others might view as ""below"" you. A great man once said, ""If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals."" That said, be kind to the poor, the homeless, your employees, etc. They're more your equals than you might like to admit.

, A humble nature is actually very impressive to most people. The commonly accepted idea that acting like you're the best gets you treated better doesn't really hold true in practice. People don't like a showoff and it's likely to earn you more rival than anything else. Be humble about your accomplishments and people will be truly impressed.

, The most basic thing you should do to impress people? Do something. Anything. Getting up off the couch is the most basic step. This is something that is really hard for people, and when they see you going to the gym, taking your girlfriend on exciting weekend dates, and traveling every summer, they'll be impressed. What's even better is if you pick up new skills, either for fun or for work.

, Whatever you do to get yourself up and actively living your life, get really good at that thing. Practice. Become a pro. This is incredibly impressive to people, even if your skill or passion is a bit niche.

, Of course, most people think they're working hard. If you're one of those, work harder. If you're of the opinion that you should get everything you want without really working hard at all, then we need to talk because that is a terrible way to go through life and it will not make people very impressed with you. People like someone with a strong work ethic. It makes you look more capable, even when you're not.

, Someone who is generous is also impressive to most people. Find ways to help others, especially by doing things like volunteering. You should also clearly be offering your help for the sake of helping, not for personal gain. This means helping even when you think no one is paying attention. Believe us, it'll come back around.

, If you want to impress someone with a trait you are proud of, you need to do it in a productive way. You don't want to seem like that mid-life crisis guy that thinks he's impressing people but really just gets pitied.


Show off your wealth. If you want to show off how much money you have, don't do it by buying a bunch of stuff you don't need. Instead, give money to charity or bunch lunch for the homeless guy outside your building every day.
Show off your strength. If you want to show off how strong or manly you are, do it by protecting those that can't protect themselves.
Show off your intelligence. If you want to show off how smart you are, do it by offering to help people with assignments, using your intelligence to make things, or even by just admitting when you don't know something (but offer to help them find out).

, A strong moral conviction is impressive to a lot of people. Do the right thing, especially when it's hard, and you'll find people patting you on the back before you know it. This can be complicated in a work place, but sometimes it's for the best.

, Be willing to be the first one to offer when your boss asks ""Would someone be willing to..."". Be ready to act when decisions need to be made. Basically, be willing to take control in a situation, especially if no one else wants to. You boss will love you for it.

, Even if you don't care all that much about your job or your industry, get yourself invested in researching it. Keep updated on the latest innovations. When you see something that you think is really relevant or could significantly improve your workplace, bring it up to your boss. This is a type of taking initiative and your boss will still love you for it.

, Identify problems in your workplace (inefficiencies, things that break, things that could work better, etc). Now, find creative solutions for how to fix those problems. Talk to your boss about your solutions and then help get those solutions in place. This is one of the best ways to impress your boss.

, Dress nicer than what is required for your work place. This shows your boss that you place an emphasis on professionalism and think that making your company look good is worth the extra effort. It shows you're invested in what you do. This is an easy way to impress your boss.

, Try or stick with lots of extra curricular activities (while maintaining good grades). This is something that easily impresses people because they'll see you as someone who's good at everything.

, Be unashamedly yourself. Be who you are. And love what you love. Pursue and get better at the things that make you happy. This is a great way to look confident, even when you're not. You peers will be really impressed.

, It might seem like the catty behavior of the popular crowd is what makes people like them, but it's not. If you're known for gossip, back-stabbing, and petty behavior, people are going to worry about what you'll do to them and no one will be impressed. Instead, be nice to everyone (even the people that other people don't like).

, Don't act like you're too cool for school. If you spend all your time doing drugs and blowing off your work, everyone (your peers included) knows you're going to be standing on the other side of a McDonald's register before too long. Even if you're not great at academics, at least try.

, The most basic trick is to actually talk to people. Sitting in the shadows isn't going to do you any favors.

, Keep a good story to tell, about pretty much any topic as long as the story is funny or entertaining, and tell it when the right context comes up. Lulls in the conversation or awkward moments are a good time to tell a story. Just don't make story-telling about stealing someone else's thunder.

, Instead of just constantly talking about yourself, take an interest in what other people do too. Ask them about themselves. This will impress them, as people love to talk about themselves at parties. This is especially handy if they are popular but quiet.

, You can always try some magic tricks or sleight of hand (YouTube will show you how to do a number of these). However, in a post-internet world, lots of people know how to do these tricks and it's less impressive than it used to be.

Consider the communication style.,
Pay attention to body language.,
Notice the energy in the room.,
Decide if you can trust the person.,
Handle someone who is not nice.",How to Judge Character1," Maybe you are interacting with a new person. Or perhaps you are trying to get a better sense of someone who is already part of your life. Judging someone's character can help you understand them, and noticing how they communicate is helpful.Pay attention to the amount of talking that is being done. Is the person you are evaluating speaking more than anyone else in the room?
If the conversation seems very one-sided, it is possible that the person you are observing is not a very good listener.
Controlling the conversation could also be a sign that the person is somewhat domineering. These might not be traits that you enjoy being around.;
, A person's body language is a good indicator of some personality traits. For example, maybe you notice that very little eye contact occurs when you speak to that person. That can indicate a few different things.Refusing to make eye contact might indicate timidity. It could also indicate dishonesty or insecurity.
You can also use a person's handshake to evaluate their personality. A firm handshake indicates confidence.
A handshake that crushes your hand might indicate a need to dominate. A very weak handshake can indicate lack of interest.

, Pay attention to how other people react to the person you are evaluating. The energy level in the room can help you figure out some key things about someone's character. Observe how the vibe changes when the new person enters the room.


Does the room suddenly seem quiet and uncomfortable? It might be that the person makes others somewhat uneasy.
Perhaps the room seems lighter and happier. Maybe the person you are observing makes others feel at ease. That could indicate kindness.
Does this person seem to give energy or to suck it in? It is always better to add to energy rather than deplete it.
Ask yourself if you would be comfortable taking a long car trip with this person. That can help you figure out how you feel about him or her.

, Trust is an important part of any good relationship. This is true for personal and professional relationships. When you are judging someone's character, take some steps to figure out if they are trustworthy.Take a look at their track record. Past performance is sometimes and indicator of future actions.
For example, maybe you are considering dating someone who you know cheated on an ex. Mistakes do happen, and people often deserve a second chance. But keep all relevant information in mind when forming an opinion.
Do you have a co-worker who is routinely late? If you cannot rely on someone to be on time, you might not be able to trust them with greater responsibility.
Give people a chance to prove you can trust them. For example, if you have a new friend, see how she reacts when you tell her some sensitive information. If she's kind and a good listener, she could be trustworthy.

, Unfortunately, you will sometimes have to be around people who do not have good characteristics. You might have to figure out how to deal with someone who is dishonest, or just plain rude. Learning to cope with people who aren't nice can help you feel more comfortable about those interactions.Keep in mind that you can control your reactions. Just because someone else is mean does not mean that you have to behave in kind.
For example, if a co-worker makes a snide remark about your cluttered desk, just say something non-committal. Try, ""Yes, I guess I've been so busy I haven't had much time to straighten up.""
Look at the reason's behind someone's bad attitude. Does your sister continuously belittle your choice to not have kids? It's possible that she is jealous that you can take a vacation whenever you want.
Remember that compassion is always a good choice. Try to be kind, even when others are not.

Get to know about her life.,
Try to cook for your mother-in-law (specially her) sometimes.,
Plan some outings with her.,
Try shopping therapy.,
Praise her.",How to Impress Your Indian Mother‐in‐Law," Talk to her a lot and the topic of conversation should be her life, her dreams, her childhood. Every person likes talking about themselves and having somebody to listen to these talks is the most happy thing for them. This will strengthen your bond and is the first step to blossoming a sense of friendship between both of you.
, Know about her taste and favourite dishes (enquire about these dishes, either from her or from some other member of the family). Food is a way to the stomach but sometimes can be the way to a person's heart too.

Your cooking (whether you are good at it or not) will really not matter, but your effort to cook for her do matter to her.

, Days when both of you are free or when she is a bit blue, go out with her. You can go out to the market, cinema, or some other place where she likes to go or is willing to go.

Take her for long drives, it may refresh her.

, Take her shopping, whether it's shopping for her or your own shopping, you can take her with you sometimes. It can be fruitful in cheering her up, and she will certainly notice your affection through doing this.

Buy her gifts, dresses, books or accessories she likes to have.

, While this can be difficult, try to praise her for her qualities or her expertise in cooking or some other act where she is good at. The third law of motion ""every action has a equal and opposite reaction"",If you praise her, she would also not hesitate to praise you in front of others."

Compliment her.,
Flirt.,
Show your interest through light touching.,
Treat her friends well.,
Make her laugh.,
Remember to be polite and respectful.",How to Interest a Girl1," Everyone loves to be complimented. It makes them feel good, and it shows to the woman you're talking to that you're interested in her. While you're talking to her, don't be afraid to pipe up and compliment her if you notice something you find interesting or attractive. Try not to focus exclusively on her looks, however.Saying something about her eyes or skin can be charming when the mood is right, but chances are she's heard it a hundred times before. A better compliment is something that reflects her personality.


For instance, say something like: ""You know, we've only been talking for a little while but it's obvious you're one of the smartest people in the room right now.""
It's very important to keep your compliments genuine. Most insincere compliments come off as forced or even insulting. Even if the girl believes you, you still want to be saying things you believe. Any following relationship would be built on a weak foundation otherwise.;
, Flirting is an umbrella term for all of the subtle ways someone can show their romantic interest in somebody else. It requires being in the moment and having some confidence in your social abilities. Although there's not a step-by-step way to go about flirting, the basic idea begins with teasing. Smile lots, and make light jabs at something you observe about her. Work compliments into the conversation you're having with this girl, and keep the mood light., Light touching is a tried and tested way of showing interest in a girl.Lightly placing your hand on a girl's arm or waist during a conversation implies you want to have physical contact with her. There is a certain level of plausible deniability in this sort of light touching as well. Although touching a face makes your feelings obvious, a touch on the shoulder or hand can be shrugged off easily if it doesn't go well.


While you shouldn't force any kind of flirting, it can be interesting to see how the girl reacts when you first do it.

, Girls tend to highly value their friendships, even more than guys do. With that in mind, you wouldn't be doing yourself any favours by not treating a girl's friends the way she hopes you would. Her friends' opinion of you will factor into her own judgement.Although she should be your first priority, don't be afraid to make friends with them too.


Be careful not to get the wrong impression across with your kindness or compliments. Friendliness is a good thing, but don't let it look like you're romantically interested in her friends. This will make it look like you're trying to play the field, and nice girls don't like that at all.

, Humour is a man's best friend when it comes to getting a woman attracted. Even if you're not the best looking guy in the room, being able to tell a good joke can mean just as much, if not more to the way she sees you. Humour in this case is best when it's mixed in with flirting. If you notice something cute about her, try to make a light tease out of it.Make sure she knows you only mean it as a joke.


For example, if the girl you're talking to just sneezes, you can smile and ask: ""Do you need a tissue?"" Smile widely and touch her lightly while you say this. This will distinguish the tease from a neutral question.
It's easiest to be naturally funny if you're feeling comfortable with yourself. Don't let yourself get consumed by inner thoughts, and don't try to force yourself to be funny.

, The way you treat a woman when you meet her can say a lot about the relationship the two of you could have. If you're acting like you care more about your own feelings than hers, she's probably not going to be interested in you. When you first meet someone, it's important to treat her with total respect. Even if it's not someone you're personally interested in, you never know who is watching. Being arrogant and bullheaded around fresh acquaintances isn't going to get you into anyone's good books.


Don't confuse this with being a pushover.Contrary to what the pickup artists say, it doesn't actually hurt to be nice, but there's a difference between that and letting yourself get taken advantage of.

Observe interactions with strangers.,
Evaluate consistency.,
Look for red flags.,
Appraise the honesty level.,
Keep your best interests in mind.",How to Judge Character2," Paying attention to the way someone acts can help you figure out some key things about their character. It can be very interesting to watch how someone interacts with people they don't know. Pay attention to this in a variety of situations.Maybe you are out on a first date. If your companion treats the waiter rudely, that can be a negative sign.
People who are rude to strangers might also be rude to people they know. There might also be issues with a superiority complex.
Perhaps you are in a taxi with a new co-worker. Observe how he or she treats the driver.
If your colleague refuses to answer questions or make small talk, that can reveal some negative things about character. It might indicate an unwillingness to be kind to others.

, Make sure to observe the person in several different situations. You want to be able to see how they react in a variety of scenarios. You don't want to judge character based on one interaction.Look for patterns in behavior. Is this person consistently rude to the other mom's at your son's school? She may not be a nice person.
However, you might see that most times your new neighbor behaves kindly. Just because there was one rude remark about your loud music, that doesn't necessarily mean they are a bad person.
Remember that everyone has bad days and good days. The key is to try to observe the person in a variety of settings.

, Reading people can be hard. Unless you know someone well, you may not really have a good grasp of their character. Fortunately, there are some signs you can look for to help you figure it out.Notice whether the person seems very quick to anger or likes to talk about violence. This can indicate some anger issues.
Pay attention to a tendency to blame others. For example, maybe your co-worker always passes the blame if a client doesn't like the proposal. That can indicate some character flaws.
Be wary if the person seems to lack compassion. If you have an acquaintance who never gives up his seat on the bus to an elderly women, that is another warning sign.

, Lying is generally an indicator that someone has some character flaws. But how to tell if a person is honest? Fortunately, there are some signs to look for.A person might be lying if the tone and volume of their voice radically changes. For example, if you are talking to your neighbor and you mention that a package went missing from you porch, be wary, if your neighbor practically shrieks, ""I don't know what you're talking about!""
A person who continually proclaims their honesty may have something to hide. For example, if your brother's new girlfriend regularly proclaims how honest she is, she might be covering something up.
For example, if she regularly says, ""I am a really honest person. You can ask anyone!"", you might start to wonder why she regularly feels the need to say that.

, Sometimes it can be difficult to tell if someone means well, or if they are intentionally trying to hurt you. This is an important distinction. Someone with good character will not try to intentionally cause you to feel uncomfortable or upset.Think about your best interests. Ask yourself if the person in question is also thinking about your best interests.
For example, is your mom constantly trying to fix you up on blind dates? It is likely that she just thinks you'll be happier in a relationship.
But what if a friend regularly belittles your spouse? That is likely not something that is being done with your best interests in mind.
Ask yourself questions such as, ""How does this person make me feel? Am I happier when I am around her?""
You can also think, ""Does this person care about my feelings?"" If the answer is no, then your best interests are likely not a priority.

Consider your own emotions.,
Be a good listener.,
Look for the positives.,
Accept differences.",How to Judge Character3," Before you rush to judgement, take a moment to reflect on your own feelings. Maybe you have a sense that the new woman in your yoga class is unfriendly. But are you actually projecting?Think about your own state of mind. Are you frustrated because you had a bad evaluation at work? You might be letting your bad mood color your perception.
Does your new co-worker seem like a know-it-all? Take a moment to think about your own role at the company. Are you actually just nervous that you won't receive a much-wanted promotion?
Your own emotions definitely impact how you view the world. And that includes how you judge character. Make sure to keep that in mind.

, When you are judging someone's character, it is important to keep an open mind. That means thinking about your own biases. And it means that you need to be a good listener.Maybe you've always assumed that your upstairs neighbor is just rude and cranky. If you actually have a conversation with her, you might discover that she's upset because she is coping with the loss of a loved one.
Limit distractions. Maybe you've always found your brother-in-law annoying. Instead of texting your friends about your dislike, put down your phone.
Take time to actually listen to others without distractions like phones or televisions. You might discover that there are some parts of their personality that really appeal to you.

, When you are keeping an open mind, try to avoid focusing on negative personality traits. Instead, make an effort to concentrate on the positives. Shifting your focus might help you arrive at a more positive judgement.For example, maybe you have always noticed how impatient your co-worker is. But have you taken the time to notice that she is always willing to help someone who is struggling to meet a deadline?
You can also avoid anticipating negative outcomes. Maybe you've never had a positive interaction with your landlord. Keep an open mind and allow your next encounter to be more positive.

, Keeping an open mind means that you are comfortable with people being different from you. Maybe a new person in your social group has a very dry sense of humor. It's okay if you two laugh at different things. It doesn't make one of you a better person than the other.Keep in mind that you might come from different backgrounds. People who are have different experiences might react differently to the same situation.
Be willing to accept that people are different. Just because someone has different personality traits that does not mean they have poor character.

Attend to regular hygiene.,
Get proper sleep.,
Express confident body language.A girl will usually be interested in a guy who looks like he carries himself well.,
Exercise regularly.,
Smile.A smile is the most natural and straightforward way of showing a range of positive feelings.,
Dress your best.",How to Interest a Girl2," Hygiene is a no-brainer if you want to look your best and interest a girl. Even if you're otherwise great looking, not keeping up with the basics ill make you look like a snob. Remember to brush or comb your hair, trim your hair and nails, wash your hair with shampoo and keep your skin reasonably moisturized.It's not necessary to go overboard with any of this, but you want to get the impression across that you care about the way you look.

, Sufficient sleep has its effect on just about every part of life. If you're not sleeping enough, it's going to hurt the way you look and feel, not to mention your social graces.Most adults require between 7 and 9 hours, but you may need more or less depending on how strenuous your daily living is.


It's also a good idea to try to sleep at the same time each night. Try to be awake for as much daylight as possible. This will make a considerable impact on your mood.

, This includes having strong posture and good physical presence. Make eye contact with whomever you're talking to. Jut out your shoulders while you're walking, and keep your back straight whenever you're walking, standing or sitting. All of these will draw more eyes (and interest!) toward you.

, Exercise has a major effect on someone's appearance.If you have any issues with weight, making exercise a priority can help a lot. Whether you're aiming for cardio or weight training, any sort of exercise has the potential to vastly improve the way your body looks. What's more, exercising regularly will make you feel more confident and happier. When it comes to getting a girl interested, this has a huge effect.

, Even if you're not saying anything to someone yet, you can show her how interested you are by making eye contact and smiling at her. The only thing to keep in mind is to make sure that it's natural. A contrived smile looks weird and creepy, and you're likely to scare people away with it.

, Dressing well doesn't necessarily mean following fashion trends and whatever else. Instead, you should be focusing on the things that make you look great personally. Take some time to carve out a bold style for yourself. You can still be casual and make the most of the body you have. Look online at particular outfits and try to see which styles appeal most to you and your unique personality.


It's also a good idea to dress to match the occasion. You'll stand out in a bad way if you're the odd one out in a crowd.
While a lot of men overlook the importance of shoes, women don't. Don't forget footwear when it comes to redoing your personal style."
"
Develop confidence.,
Develop a go-getter mentality.,
Be yourself.",How to Interest a Girl3," Confidence is practically a no-brainer when it comes to attracting a girl. Virtually all women are interested in a guy who feels confident in himself and his abilities. As a general rule if you're confident, others will be confident in you as well. This can be a tough road depending on your current level of self-esteem, but it is possible if you put your mind to it. Keep your thoughts focused on positively, and don't be afraid to tell your brain to ""Cut it out"" if you start dwelling on negative thoughts.Make a list of things you're proud of. No matter how small or big, you should try to fill a page with things you've already done. Don't be modest in the slightest, and don't let yourself underrate the things you've done.Sometimes ""faking it 'til you make it"" can be a good option, especially if you have issues with social anxiety.

, Being proactive will help your life in a lot of ways, and many of these will directly affect your chances with women. If you make a habit of leaping into opportunities as soon as they present themselves, you'll find your life becomes a lot busier. You'll have more chances to meet women if you're out doing things all the time and your life will seem more attractive. Don't depend on anyone but yourself to get the job done, whether you're talking about your job, hobbies or social life.Confidence is a natural bonus from being productive. If you struggle with confidence, you may find yourself feeling better once you set your sights on action.
Procrastination is the enemy of all good things in life. Don't let any chances slip you by.

, ""Be yourself"" is easiest the most common advice in self-help, but it still rings true in most cases. There's no one in the world you can be better than yourself. Even if you think you're not attractive enough to get a girl interested in you, you should never try to put on an act as someone you aren't. Rather, put that energy towards being the best version of yourself you can be.Take time to think about what defines you as a person, and work on doing things that maximize your best traits.


Being yourself is very sage advice if you're on the dating scene. If you try to be someone you're not, you'll probably end up interesting a different sort of woman than the type you want.

Follow your passion.,
Pursue the job you've always dreamed about.,
Break out of your daily routine.,
Read a lot.,
Find opportunities to socialize.Everyone feels happier when they're socializing on a regular basis.,
Keep a record of your activities.",How to Interest a Girl4," There's nothing so interesting as a person who feels consumed by an interest. In this day and age, it's so easy to lose sight of the things that are most important to us. It's really important to make the time for a hobby or creative pursuit. The most attractive men are the ones who don't let their goals get brushed aside for anything.Having that identity outside of your regular job or social life can mean a ton when it comes to a healthy lifestyle.

, Especially as people age, they begin to be associated with the jobs they have. While changing your job may seem impossible, it can totally transform the life you currently have. Think about what you'd always like to do, and take active steps towards making it a reality each day, whether it's building a certain skill or looking at job postings.Make sure your dream has some bearing on reality. Things aren't going to magically fall into your lap, but they will come in time if you set your mind to it.


This isn't so important if you're young. Young adults and teenagers aren't expected to have their lives all figured out. However, it can help your chances with women if you're doing something that's interesting to talk about.

, Even if you love your life, chances are you fall into a fairly predictable day-to-day grind of work, rest and play. It can do you a lot of good to break out of that and try something new.If there's a new hangout that just opened up, check it out. Try a different way to drive home from work. Do something unpredictable. This can require more thinking than you might think at first, but it's totally worth it for the sake of a more attractive lifestyle.


It may be helpful to reflect upon your life as you do this. Try to recognize the things you take for granted. From there, you can see what you can do to shake them up a bit.

, Reading may seem like a boring, passive activity to some people, but a lot of people with the most interesting lives always set time aside for it. Reading can benefit your life in all sorts of ways.You'll learn more, have a better understanding of the world, and have more to talk about in a conversation. All of this can lead to a more interesting life, and it goes without saying that being more interesting will help out your chances with women.

, That includes introverts and shyer sorts as well! If you spend your downtime in the company of other people, you'll end up having a lot more interesting stories to tell before long. In the context of getting a girl interested, socializing lots will increase your chances of meeting someone, and you'll feel more at peace in talking to a girl you really like.

, When it comes to socializing or anything else, it can help to keep track of the things you're doing in life. Try to compare that record with an ideal scheme of the life you'd like to have. For example, if you're shy, make a goal of going out and record each time you do. This same recordkeeping technique works for other things in life as well, such as job hunting and skill building. Consistency is always the goal, and if you stick with a lifestyle pattern long enough, it'll eventually become your routine.

Address adults by their names.",How to Impress Adults," You may look like a lazy person. It might also be disrespectful. Stand up and offer to take their coat or purse, or show them to the closet if you think they would prefer to hang their things up themselves. If they have never been to the house before give them a quick tour. Close the doors of any messy rooms, and tell the adults which rooms are off limits, and where the bathrooms are.;
, Don't stare or give evil glances to people around you. If you know them well give them a hug when you meet, if you don't offer your hand and state your name. Be Polite, and offer the adult an appropriate drink.

, You really don't want to have blue eye shadow and bright red lipstick, with an adult gawking at you, now don't you?

, If you think it's really important then excuse yourself but try to ask the caller to try calling later.

, It's better not to watch TV, go on the computer, or listen to your iPod. Don't be a hermit. If you feel like you are unwanted by the adults in the conversation you should ask for permission to go to your room for a while.

,, How are your children/hamsters/family?"" Use your manners. You want the adults to want you back, and comment on how nicely you behaved. As a bonus, your parents will also be proud.

, Be careful not to spill food or talk with your mouthful. Don't put your elbows on the table. Offer to help out. At the end of the meal join in with taking out the plates, washing the dishes, or drying them. Try to eat what you're given, even if you don't like it that much. Don't complain about the food or make negative comments. Compliment them on anything you do like even if it's only a side-dish. Try to make polite dinner conversation.

, There may be only one little lonely five year old, and no matter how much you may dislike children, play with the kid. Make a craft out of some stationary (ask permission before using materials), draw, or color. If you have been playing for a while responsibly declare that you want to take part in conversation.

, Don't ask for a drink the adult most likely won't have but ask for the choices first. You don't want to ask for a drink that can only be found halfway across the world. Sit in the place that is suggested even if you don't particularly like the people you are next to.

, It is also nice to return the favor by driving them somewhere or bringing them a small cookie or small perfume sample to say that you honestly do appreciate the ride. If you don't say thank you, then they may not be happy about driving you somewhere next time.

, Explain exactly what you received, how much you like it, and what you are going to do with the object. The adult went out to buy you something, and it's up to you to show that you mean it when you say you like it.

, The adult is most likely very happy to see you, and they would be crushed if you look as if you would much rather be at one of your friends' parties.

, Instead of ""Yeah,"" or ""Yup,"" say ""Yes, I would love that."" Listen to the conversations. The adult might ask you a question so try to talk and explain your answers. If an adult asks how you like school, you could say, ""Yes, school is fine, though homework is really going up this term!"" This makes the adults feel that they are your friend, and you are comfortable talking to them. Compliment things you like. Don't interrupt a conversation to say something irrelevant. That is extremely rude. When speaking, make sure it's appropriate. If you're not sure than it's probably better not to say anything.

, They are people, too, and they deserve to be treated as you treat your friends. Use Mister or Miss, and then say their last name unless specified otherwise. If you are just meeting them ask the adult what they would like you to call them.

Dress to impress.,
Be polite.,
Think before you speak.,
Pay her a sincere compliment.,
Make her feel special.",How to Impress a Girl1," Not only will you look and smell more attractive, taking care of your grooming shows her that you're mature and capable of important daily tasks. Also pay attention to the style of clothes that she wears, and wear the same style of clothing, this will help her to relate with you and find you overall more attractive. And pay particular attention to these areas:


Shower at least once a day. Wash your hair, soap up all over, and rinse off. Use a nice smelling shower scrub as well, something not too feminine, but not too masculine either, maybe try a smell like mint, or lemon.
Keep your mouth clean. Brush twice daily, floss, and use mouthwash. For help in the middle of the day, use breath mints and chewing gum.
Manage facial hair by shaving daily. If you're growing facial hair, make sure it's trimmed to a uniform length, and not scraggly or unruly. If you tend to have a unibrow, consider plucking any stray hairs over your nose.
Wear a combination deodorant-antiperspirant. Apply it as soon as you get out of the shower in the morning. Make sure it also doesn't smell too feminine or too masculine either.
Go easy on the cologne. You can use a few sprays of cologne or body spray, but don't go over 2.
Wear clean clothes. If you find yourself scrambling for fresh laundry, consider setting up a regular washing schedule, like doing all your laundry every Sunday night.;
, Being well-mannered doesn't mean you're boring — it means you know how to treat other people with respect, a quality most girls want in their boyfriends. Show her you know how to be considerate by doing these things for everyone, not just her:


Say ""please,"" ""thank you"" and ""you're welcome."" As well as asking with a ""I'd appreciate it if"" or ""I would like for you...""
If someone is walking through a door behind you, hold it open for him or her.
Avoid cursing or saying anything crude in public, or in mixed company. It's fine to relax a little around your friends, but try to show your best side around people you don't know well.
For more help, see How to Have Good Manners.

, Everyone slips up and says stupid things, but try your best to limit it when you're around this girl. Take a few seconds to evaluate what you're going to say before you spit it out.


Don't talk up other girls. You might think making her jealous is a good idea, but steer clear. Discussing the looks of other girls in front of her will make you seem shallow and fickle. As far as she knows, she's the only one you're interested in.
Avoid coming off as a bully. Don't throw out careless insults or put other people down, even if they're meant to be funny. She might not be able to pick up on your humorous tone and take your words at face value.
Don't tell dirty jokes. There's a time and place for wicked humor — and it's when you're hanging out with your guy friends. Keep on a lid on it when you're around her.

, One thing you should say when you're around her is a nice, genuine compliment. It's not as difficult as it seems! Here's what to do:


Think of what you like best about her. It could be her smile, her laugh, her intelligence — whatever strikes you as her best quality. (The only caveat to this is that you should not compliment her on any physical traits except her eyes or her smile. She might have a great figure, but now's not the time.)
Do it semi-privately. You don't have to get her completely alone to pay her a compliment, but try not to do it with all of her friends or your friends listening closely. You could also pull it off in a text or instant message.
Keep it short and sweet. No need to wax poetic for three or four minutes on her best qualities. A simple one-liner will do.
Pay attention to how you word it. Instead of saying ""That's a pretty dress"" or ""I like your outfit,"" say ""You look really great in that dress."" Compliment the woman, not the article of clothing!
Get the body language right. Smile! Keep eye contact while you say it, too.

, Find little ways to let her know that you think she's an extraordinary person, and she'll definitely notice.


Don't ignore her or play hard to get. If she texts you, text back. If she wants to talk, try to make the time even if it's slightly inconvenient.
Go out of your way to help her. If she could use a hand with something, offer your assistance! It could be carrying heavy or cumbersome items, going with her to run an errand, or talking to her through a difficult situation.
Let her talk. The #1 mistake when talking to a girl is focusing on yourself. Girls are way more comfortable when they talk about common interests. Ask about her interests, hobbies, favorite books, music, etc. If she asks you a question, answer it in a few, short sentences and then redirect the question back at her. This engages her in the conversation.
Start an inside joke with her! By doing this the two of you will share a secret connection that is shared between only the two of you. This will make her feel special, included and closer to you. It will also give you an easy-to-come-up-with conversation starter. But keep in mind, if you overuse the inside joke, it could quickly go from fun to boring, so only use it when you must.

Show an interest in him.,
Find common ground.,
Use positive body language.,
Fascinate him.,
Let him see what makes you special -- without showing off.",How to Impress a Guy1," If you want to impress a guy, then you have to make him feel that you care about who he is as a person -- just not too much. When you do start talking to the guy, you should talk about the things he likes to do, what he's interested in, and just generally the things that intrigue him. This doesn't mean you should interview him or ask him too many questions, but it does mean that you should be attuned to the things he wants and cares about.


Let him open up little by little, as you reveal information about yourself too. Don't bombard him with personal questions.
Keep it light. Talk about his dog, his best friends, or his favorite sports teams -- you can get to the serious stuff later.
Ask his opinion on a variety of subjects, from current events to the Super Bowl.;
, Once you've talked to the guy for a while, you should be able to find a few things that you have in common, whether it's your loyalty to your families, your love for the beach, or your mutual obsession with travel. It may not feel like much, but you should build on the interests you share to develop a connection. This will give you more to talk about, and will make the guy more impressed by you.


If you know the guy is really crazy about the Mets, it wouldn't hurt to look up some information on the team so you can impress him the next time you talk. You don't have to become an expert on the subject, but it would give you something to talk about.
You may not have many similar interests, but you may share similar personality traits -- maybe you both have a silly sensibility or a sensitive side. You can build off of that, too.
You can even find common ground by finding something you both dislike or want to laugh at, whether it's Justin Bieber or your sixth period chemistry teacher.

, A guy will be much more impressed by you if your body is in an ""open stance,"" and says that you're ready to talk and have a good time. The first thing you should do is smile to show the guy that you're disarming and ready to have fun. Then, you should work on using your arms to gesture or keeping them at your sides instead of crossing them over your chest, and turning your body toward him, so that he knows he has your attention.


Make eye contact when you talk to the guy so he feels special.
You can play with your hair a bit or lick your lips occasionally if you want to be flirtatious.

, If you want to impress a guy, then you have to be a fascinating conversational partner. Though giggling and flirting and showing him you like him can get you far, he has to also enjoy talking to you and find you a stimulating and engaging conversationalist. To do this, you have to be able to keep a conversation going, to go beyond the small talk to the depth of a matter without being overwhelming.


If you've read something fascinating, don't be embarrassed to mention it. The guy will appreciate your insight.

, You don't have to tell him that you're the star of your track team -- he can figure it out. Just talk about how much you love the sport while being modest, and maybe he'll come see you in a race or hear what a great runner you are. Talk about the things that you excel at or the things that really make you shine, and he'll see that you're a unique individual worth pursuing.


You can share the things that make you unique without bragging. Maybe you're special because you have a twin, because you have five kittens, or because you love walking on your hands. Find a way for him to find out how unique you really are.

"
Get some space away from her.,
Spend time on self-improvement.,
Make a new first impression.,
Don't offer your time so freely.,
Don't waste time.,
Accept her decision.",How to Impress a Girl2," It's the hardest thing to do when you're crazy about a girl, but it's the only sure way to get out of the friendzone. If you want her to see you in a different light, you have to take some away time so your relationship can reset when you start interacting again.


Commit to being in minimal contact with her for at least 3 or 4 weeks. It sounds like forever, but you can do it! Be polite when you see her, but don't hang out with her, don't engage in long phone calls, don't go on dates, and answer her texts with replies that are short and to the point.
If she asks why you're being so distant, say that you're taking some time to refocus your priorities. Tell her it's not personal, you're just working on accomplishing goals in other areas of your life. Most girls like someone motivated and ambitious; even if she's distraught that you're not spending as much time with her, this is as good a reason as you can give.

, Dedicate the hours you would otherwise spend with her (or thinking about her) to feeling better about yourself. You'll be a new and improved guy with better self-confidence, whether or not she's interested in that at the end of the day. Remember that you're not doing it for her right now — you're doing it for you, so that you feel like the best version of yourself.


Step up your grooming. Try making your routine a little more rigorous, and see how it affects your self-esteem. Amp up your skincare, try a different hairstyle, shower more regularly, try a new cologne, and so on.
Take control of your life. If there's some aspect of your life that currently feels out of control — whether it's school, your career, or finances — now's the time to rein it back in. Figure out what you need to do to stabilize your situation and feel like you're back on track. Then go do it — don't waste any more time stressing about it. Yes, girls are attracted to men who seem like they're in control of their lives. But even better, you'll feel confident and self-assured that things are going your way, because you've made it so.
Cultivate a new hobby or interest. Is there a sport you've always wanted to try? Or a subject you've always wanted to learn more about? Now's the time! Devote yourself to whatever extracurricular interest strikes your fancy, and make it your new focus. Girls are interested in people who are interesting, and having hobbies or outside activities makes you interesting.

, After you've been away for awhile, you'll have the chance to make another ""first"" impression when you're ready to interact with her again. If you can play it the right way, she'll start to see you in a whole new light.


Look your best. Put extra effort into looking as good as possible when you feel like you're getting close to seeing her again. That way, your next meeting won't catch you off-guard.
Make your intentions clear. If you want her to see you as boyfriend material, act like it! Flirt with her. Maintain eye contact. Pay her a smoldering compliment. Don't just fall into old habits and act like you worship the ground she walks on. Make her feel special, but not at the cost of lowering yourself.

, Instead of being constantly available for her whenever she wants, make her work a little for your attention. For instance, you're not available to come over and watch romantic comedies with her while she complains about her latest break-up; however, you are available to take her to dinner on Friday if she's interested.


Draw a clear line between things you used to do for her in the friendzone, and things you're willing to do for her as a potential boyfriend. Be vigilant about sticking to this difference.

, After you re-initiate contact, don't wait months to ask her out or otherwise move the relationship to the next level. Do it within the week.


Ask her out on a date that is clearly romantic. That means: dinner, on the weekend, just the two of you. She'll get the hint.
State your feelings for her in a clear, confident way. Let her know that you're interested in being more than friends. Tell her you'll accept her decision if she's not interested, but you can't keep languishing in the friendzone.
Break the touch barrier. Hold her hand, give her a hug, offer to cuddle, or otherwise get physical contact on the table. Especially if the touch barrier was a characteristic of your earlier interactions, this is a pretty clear way to send her a message.
Remember that old Sean Connery movie quote: ""The key to a woman's heart is an unexpected gift at an unexpected time."" The gift doesn't have to be extravagant — try something as simple as a single flower or her favorite treat. Don't make a big deal about giving it to her, just do it with a smile and accept her thanks gracefully.

, If you've tried everything to impress her and she's still not interested in dating, back away gracefully. Sometimes the spark just isn't there. You tried your best, and there are other girls out there who will appreciate the person you are. Move on with confidence!

Pursue your interests.,
Stop caring what people think.,
Have a blast with your friends.,
Embrace your quirks.,
Learn to laugh at yourself.",How to Impress a Guy2," If you want to impress a guy, then the best thing you can do is to pursue your interests and work on becoming a more interesting, well-rounded person. Though you can certainly love watching two seasons of Gossip Girl back to back, you should pursue an interest that is a bit more productive for your mind or body, whether it's yoga, painting, singing, ballet, or creative writing. If you work hard to achieve your goals while pursuing a variety of interests, any guy will be impressed by your talent and dedication.


And if you have many interests, more power to ya -- then you'll have even more room to grow and more things to talk about.
If you're not really sure where your interest lies, it's never too late to find your passion. Finding something you really care about will make you a more interesting, dynamic person.

, Another way to impress a guy is to be so happy with who you are or who you're becoming that you don't care what other people think about you. This doesn't mean that you should be a jerk to anyone who comes your way because you don't care about how people feel, but it does mean that you should be kind and courteous to people without obsessing over how you can please people, make everyone happy, and avoid having anyone say anything negative about you at all costs.


Don't spend all of your time trying to please your friends or enemies, or any guy will see that you're not being true to yourself.
Don't constantly check your reflection in any mirror you see, or reapply your makeup a million times in public -- this will make it look as if you're insecure about your appearance.
Don't let other people get you down. If people criticize you for no reason, don't listen to them or change who you are for the benefit of others.

, If you really want to impress a guy, then he has to see that you're just fine without him. No guy wants a girl who is desperately looking around the room or checking her phone, hoping that the right guy will approach her or send her a message. Instead, guys want a girl who looks like she's having a great time with her girlfriends and couldn't care less if a guy comes along -- this will make you look much more appealing and hard to get.


When you're out with your friends, work on living in the moment and laughing, dancing, and generally having a great time instead of wondering who will walk up to you.
You don't have to ignore guys who approach you or notice you when you're with your friends, but you shouldn't look desperate for male attention.

, If you want to impress a guy, then you can't be afraid to be different. You need to learn to embrace whatever makes you an individual, even if you're afraid it's a little dorky or retro. If you love drawing comic strips, reading science fiction, or dancing the polka, then good for you -- that's something that will make you even more interesting.


Don't be afraid to not mention, or even not pursue, the things that really make you happy just because you don't think it appeals to guys.
Don't be different just for the sake of being different -- that will make it look like you're trying too hard.

, If you really want to impress a guy, then you have to know how to not take yourself too seriously. A guy really wants a girl who is comfortable enough in her own skin to poke fun at herself, to let others make harmless jokes about her quirks, and to generally pal around and know she's not perfect. Being able to laugh at yourself will make you more self-aware and confident -- if you don't think you have any flaws or think you should be taken seriously at all times, then you won't be much fun to hang out with.


This doesn't mean you should let others make cruel jokes at your expense -- it does mean that you should be comfortable with taking a well-meaning joke.
If you know how to laugh at yourself, you'll also be comfortable teasing a guy and being teased, which is a great flirtation strategy.

Be charismatic.,
Be witty.,
Be confident.,
Be original.,
Be independent.",How to Impress a Guy3," If you want to impress a guy, then you should be charismatic and be able to charm everyone in any room you walk into. This doesn't mean being overly loud or dramatic -- just act natural, and be happy to walk into any room, even if you don't know anyone there. A truly charismatic person can talk to almost anyone and make him feel at ease, whether it's an eight-year-old boy or an eighty-year-old woman.


When you talk to people, use their names. Make people feel good about themselves and keep things positive.

, Guys are always refreshed and pleased by a girl with wit. To impress a guy with your wit, work on being clever, being able to keep up a flow of intelligent and sharp banter, and to wow him with your word play, insights, and quick reactions. Being witty means looking at the world in an original way and being funny and creative at the same time.


If the guy says something funny, don't just laugh -- respond back with an equally funny comment.

, Guys are impressed by confident women, because this shows that they have a natural ease with themselves and are happy with who they are. Confident women are fun to be around, add positive energy to any situation, and make other people around them feel good. If you really want to impress a guy, then you should be happy with who you are, what you do, and where you're going.


If you're feeling confident and the conversation is going well, you can even reach out to touch the guy.
Building confidence doesn't happen overnight -- it can take a lifetime. But making a goal of being happier and more pleased with who you are can help you feel more proud and happy to be sharing yourself with others.
Fake it until you make it -- walk with your head high, your shoulders back, and with your eyes looking straight ahead, not at the ground. You'll already begin to exude confidence through your body language.

, Guys love girls who stand out from the pack and aren't like everyone else. Don't be afraid to be original, even if it means to dye your hair pink, dance like a maniac, or to learn how to make your own sushi. Whatever you really want to do, go after it, and you will be rewarded. Guys are impressed by girls who aren't like everyone else because they're worth knowing.


Being original will not only help you impress guys, but it'll also lead you to make more friends and to be friends with more interesting people.

, Guys love girls who are independent and who love to do their own thing. The last thing a guy wants is a clingy girl who wants her life to revolve around his -- instead, guys want a girl who is happy being on her own and hanging out with him. To be independent, you have to not only be comfortable pursuing your own interests by yourself and generally having some ""me time,"" but you also have to avoid conforming or doing whatever everyone else is doing just because that's what's cool right now.


Being an independent person also means being an independent thinker. You should learn to act and think on your own.

Walk away.,
Go a different route.,
Don't respond to annoying behavior.,
Act like you haven't heard what was said.,
Avoid giving any kind of response, even nonverbal.",How to Ignore Annoying People1," Anytime you encounter rude or annoying behavior, you have the option of simply walking away from the person. While it's not always possible to get away from someone who's annoying you, it does work in many situations., If you find you often run into the same annoying person in public, try to avoid that person by going a different way. You may also be able to avoid him or her by going through the area slightly earlier or slightly later., When you can't just walk away, the best thing you can do is stay quiet. Staying quiet does not make you weak, and does not make them the ""winner."" Some people are annoying because they're after a reaction. Don't give them that satisfaction.In addition, not responding helps you regulate your own emotions, so you won't snap on the person or someone else you meet later., When a person is speaking, don't give any acknowledgment of having heard him or her. Meaning, don't even incline your head to the person or jump if he or she starts talking more loudly., Even nonverbal responses, such as rolling your eyes or making faces, can egg the person on. Try not to say anything to the person, but also try not to engage the person nonverbally, too. Any kind of gesture that lets them know they're getting to you will only make things worse."

Find an alternate mode of distraction.,
Work on something that requires your concentration.,
When spoken to, act as if you have been torn away from something of extreme importance, and answer curtly.,
If they continue to talk to you, use sarcasm and extensive vocabulary.,
At all costs, avert your eyes from their face.,
Exhibit closed body language.,
Whatever you do, don´t smile.,
Listen to an iPod or stuff your face in a book.",How to Ignore Everybody Around You," Carry a book or electronic device everywhere with you, and make sure to read or use it at all opportune moments.;
, Be sure that it's portable, and demands the use of two hands and your eyes. This will make the other person think you are busy and will try to avoid interrupting you.

, When possible, answer with a ""yes"" or ""no"". Turn back to your work/book immediately afterward, and resume with faked enthusiasm.

, Enunciate every word, as if speaking to a simpleton. Openly show your dislike of the constant chatting and end your part of the conversation with something like ""Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to what I was doing."" and turn away before they have a chance to reply.

, Do not get caught staring at anyone, this will almost certainly encourage conversation. And when speaking, look away and go back to whatever you were doing before, unless that person is of a higher authority than you, or has connections with somebody that does.

, If sitting, hunch over, curl in on yourself, keep your knees together, your feet tucked under you, and your elbows on your thighs. Whatever you are reading/working on should be placed in front of your face, as if to hide it. If standing, cross your arms over your upper torso, keep your gaze focused toward your feet, and shift from foot to foot, as if impatient to leave.

, Act as if a rain cloud is over your head at all times. Scowl a lot, even more if you truly are in a bad mood. If the situation demands it, have a closed-mouth-smile or a smirk. You may not gain any friends, but that's not what you're after anyway!

, Live in your own fantasy world and sit in the corner by yourself. Use your phone for text messaging or calling. Go to the bathroom or out for a pretend smoke (Or real one if you do). Find a way to go home early or act tired.

When you give someone a hug, make sure that you don't have any body odor as this can make any hug awkward and unenjoyable for the recipient.,
Make sure you're not wearing anything itchy or painful in any way.

Make sure you're in a setting where it won't feel awkward for the recipient.,
When going up to hug someone, don't just walk up and hug them.,
Don't make it awkward!",How to Hug with Confidence,";
,, Depending on the person, he/she may not be a ""huggy type"" of person, and so, not everyone feels comfortable giving casual hugs. You can often sense when a hug feels appropriate.

, Maybe say something like ""I wanna hug!"". If it's a congratulation hug, just say , ""Congratulations!"" and hug them.

, Hugs don't have to mean anything if you don't want them to. For some people, a hug is something you can give to someone you just met. It only feels awkward if you make it seem awkward, so be casual and cool about it.

Sit or lie somewhere comfortable and quiet.,
Turn your attention to your breathing again.,
Grab a pen and paper, or laptop/tablet.,
On a another page, write two headings above two columns.,
Take a look at the values that you are content with and be proud of yourself and acknowledge that you are living your truth with these.,
Number these values you wish to think more about by prioritising the most important as number one and so forth.,
Break these statements down even further.,
Use ""I"" statements.Express to the other person how important it is that you have a massage and how it will benefit you (as a person and as a caregiver).,
See if your communication, using ""I"" statements, works and whether the behaviour/possibly resistance of the other person changes.,
Once you feel that you are confident with articulating your number one value and getting that need met, work you way down your list.

",How to Improve Communication with Others to Get Your Needs Met," Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Let whatever thought enters your mind to just be there...don't fight it. Observe the thoughts as if they are slow flying birds in the sky that disappear out of view in a few seconds.;
, Inhale slowly through your nose and hold it for three seconds, then exhale slowly through your mouth (counting for five seconds). Repeat this twice. Notice what is in your mind and when you are ready, open your eyes.

, Think about what is important to you: your values; beliefs; philosophies; and passions, Write them down (try to write at least five words or sentences). Don't worry about spelling or grammar - just get your thoughts down.

, Now write all of your values and beliefs etc under these two headings. Be as honest as you can, as this is about you, for you. In heading one, write ""I am content with how I live my life according to this value"". In heading two, write ""I would like to improve how I live my life according to this value"".

, Look at the other column. How many values are there and what are they? For example, you may really value time out (away from your family) and realise that this has not been happening. Or you may be working a job that is not congruent with your beliefs and this is causing dissatisfaction for you.

, Focus only on number one value for the moment. For example, it might be self care. Write down all of the things you do, used to do or would like to do pertaining to this value.

, For example, you may value relaxation and used to love getting a massage once per month but stopped due to caregiver commitments. Now write down small steps of how you could have regular massages again. For example:


research an affordable massage school
budget for the massage
work out a suitable time for an appointment
discuss this with others (if, for example you are the caregiver of a child or adult and need to organise someone else to be a carer while you practise self care with a beautiful massage!)

, For example, ""I would like to have a massage as I really need to relax at the moment. I hope you understand and I would appreciate it if you could look after the kids/my mother/father etc) whilst I have my massage."" If the person is initially reluctant to help out, take a deep breath, speak slowly and calmly and look them in the eye and repeat the above sentences. Do this three times if you have to. Your honesty and persistence and above all respect for yourself and the other person will more than likely work.


Here's another example of how you can use an ""I"" statement if a family member keeps dropping in unexpectedly: ""I appreciate your wanting to come over and help. I would really appreciate it if you could respect my wishes and ring me first to check if it a good time to visit or whether we can organise another time if this is not convenient for me."" !

, Notice how it felt to be assertive and articulate your needs in a respectful and calm manner. It is too easy for all of us, at times, to lose our composure, blame the other person and get frustrated!

Make yourself unavailable.,
Report bad behavior.,
Don't walk around alone.,
Be the bigger person.",How to Ignore Annoying People2," If you work with someone who annoys you, it may be difficult to ignore them, especially if you're on a team together. However, one way you can get out of spending time with the person is to put the blame on the work you need to get done.For instance, you could say, ""I'd love to chat, but I really need to finish this project.""

, Whether you're being bullied at school or someone at work is affecting your productivity, you can and should speak out. At school, talk to an adult. At work, it's a bit more difficult, but try to address the situation with your boss, focusing on how it is affecting the work environment instead of the person's flaws., If you are at all in fear for your safety, especially if you are being bullied, try to keep a buddy with you. It's much harder for someone to attack or bully you if you're in a group., Ignoring someone who annoys you is different than bad mouthing someone who annoys you. If you want to ignore someone, then follow the maxim ""out of sight, out of mind."" Don't resort to calling someone names, or being rude in return.When you see someone who annoys you, don't make a big deal about it. Don't talk about them in an attempt to get them to leave you alone. Just keep going about your business, and don't think about that person.

Acknowledge that you are annoyed.,
Stop talking to the person.,
Skip all types of communication.,
Separate yourself from the person emotionally.,
Know that ignoring family members can cause damage.",How to Ignore Annoying People3," Sometimes, you may not even realize how angry or frustrated you are. You may just find that you're extra stressed. Take a moment to actually notice your annoyance, so you can do something about it or at least move on with what you're doing., One of the best ways to ignore someone is to simply not engage. Don't talk to the person or engage in any nonverbal way. You can start out by saying that you won't be talking to him or her and then commence with not talking to the person., That is, don't answer phone calls or respond to any kind of text-based communications. To truly ignore someone, you must stop all lines of communication., If the person is merely bugging you, this step may not be necessary. However, if the person is also criticizing you or getting to you emotionally, you may need to find a way to step back from the person emotionally. In other words, try thinking about placing some kind of mental shield between you and the person. The person may say something negative, but you won't let it reach you. You're not going to take that into yourself.In other words, you hear what's being said, but you reject it's ability to hurt you.

, Ignoring someone is basically a form of the silent treatment. When it comes to close relationships, you shouldn't employ this tactic very often. In fact, it can be considered a type of emotional abuse. You are trying to punish the person by not acknowledging him or her instead of trying to work out the issue.Of course, ignoring your whining child or your little brother for five minutes so you can finish cooking dinner is not the same as intentionally employing the silent treatment against your spouse for a day or longer.
