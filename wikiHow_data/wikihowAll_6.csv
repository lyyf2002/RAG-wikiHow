Recognize when parents play favorites because of your identity.,
Look for signs of personality disorders.,
Consider your parents’ mood.If your parents are under stress, they will be more likely to show favoritism.,
Don’t assume you deserve your treatment.,
Try to see things from their point of view.,
Watch for signs of abuse.",How to Deal with Parents Treating Other Siblings Better3," Parents often treat children differently for reasons based solely on qualities that are nobody’s fault. Step-parents might show favoritism to their biological children because they raised them and feel closer to them. Other reasons might include:Age. Firstborn children often receive preferential treatment. Middle children are often neglected. Younger siblings who are still children might be treated better than teens because they are perceived as being in greater need of parental attention.
Gender. Parents often feel closer to children of their gender than children of the other gender. For instance, mothers often feel closer to daughters than sons, and might thus show favoritism to their daughters. In addition, in a patriarchal society, boys are often treated better than girls.

, If your parents are treating your siblings better than you, they might have a personality disorder.This includes a broad spectrum of disorders (including histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder) in which a person’s feelings are dysfunctional and their thinking is confused. Instead of making decisions on a rational basis -- by, for instance, realizing that each child deserves love equally -- they rationalize their unfair treatment and insist that some children don’t deserve love (for whatever reason).

, Stress might be brought on by financial or relationship problems. If you’re aware that your parent(s) are having problems and they are treating another sibling better, it could be a product of the stress they’re feeling.

, If you parents continuously treat your sibling(s) better (or even if they treat you worse in one particular instance), don’t assume that you deserve it. No matter what their reason for treating you differently, it’s important to recognize that you deserve love, respect, and fair treatment just as much as your brother or sister.


In the end, it shouldn’t matter why your parents are treating you worse. What matters is that their behavior is wrong.
Don’t obsess over trying to figure out how to “fix” yourself or please your parents. In most cases, it just isn’t possible.

, How would your parents explain the differences in treatment? Even if you don’t agree with their reasoning, it helps to think about things from their point of view., If your parents are treating you as less important than a sibling or if they are cruel to you in other ways, then this may be abuse. There are lots of different kinds of abuse, which may include:Emotional abuse, such as calling you names, shaming you, humiliating you, or ignoring you.
Neglect, such as not feeding you enough or not seeking care for you when you are sick or injured.
Physical abuse, such as hitting you, restraining you, or doing other things to harm you.
Sexual abuse, such as touching you in intimate places, forcing you to perform sexual acts, or talking to you in sexual ways.

Consider whether your personal biases are coloring your judgment.,
Ask the person if they're okay initially.,
Give them a little extra attention.,
Offer opportunities for them to be heard (if you believe they want attention).,
Ask the person exactly what their illness is.,
Ask the person whether they have been to see the doctor.,
Ask people close to the person, such as their parents, spouse/partner or close friends.,
Take action.,
Support them.",How to Tell if Someone Is Pretending to Have an Illness," If you have a derogatory viewpoint towards certain illnesses or disabilities, you may inaccurately judge people to be faking when their symptoms are real.


Do you feel that mental illnesses are signs of personal weakness, or that people see them as trends?
Do you believe that symptoms aren't real until they are validated by a doctor?
Do you think there is only one ""right"" way to have an illness/disability? (For example, that menstrual cramps can't be bad because yours rarely bother you, or autism isn't real if the person doesn't talk or ""look normal"")
Do you think that if you can't see the symptoms, it means they aren't there?;
, Ask them what's wrong and if they need any help. If they are experiencing pain, such as a migraine or stomachache, offer them pain relief (if you have any tablets).


Make sure that the pills aren't too powerful and won't make them sick. Most over-the-counter medications won't cause illness in healthy people, but check to make sure.

, If they just want extra affection and love, they may stop faking it if you devote a bit more time to them. Give it a try and see what happens.


Bring up your relationship. ""Joey, I've noticed that we haven't hung out very much lately. I was thinking we should spend more time together. Have you felt this way?"" This might be the opportunity they needed to ask for more attention.
Schedule regular time together, like a walk after supper every evening, or playing basketball together every Sunday morning.
Don't make the attention explicitly related to the illness. If you do, they may worry that if they stop pretending to be sick, then you will stop paying attention to them.

, Work on listening well and caring what they have to say. Let your shoulder be available for crying. If you are there to listen to them and care for them when they are feeling upset, the need for a fake illness will disappear.

, If they claim they have a mental or physical illness without any obvious external symptoms, ask them what the illness actually is. They should give you a definition. Ask them what symptoms they experience, then go home and research the illness they say they have. Someone who pretends to have an illness may only have looked up a few symptoms and so may not fully reflect the symptoms.


Notice how they react when gently questioned. Do they seem defensive or proud of themselves? Or do their emotions feel genuine?
Use a kind, non-aggressive tone when asking questions. If they really aren't faking it, it could be hurtful if you act like they are.

, Getting a diagnosis and medical help from a doctor is an important part of medical treatment. Some people self-diagnose, so they don't actually have any evidence that they do have the illness. Someone who has been or intends to go to their doctor is probably not faking any type of medical condition.


A few people self-diagnose before seeing a doctor, can't afford a non-emergency doctor visit, or are afraid of disability/mental illness diagnoses because they could lead to discrimination. This does not make their illness any less real.
Most self-diagnosis occurs after weeks or months of research from medical journals, and reading the experiences of people who have the illness. Inquire about their research process, or how long they've suspected it.

, If the person is young and living with their parents, ask their parents if they know what's going on. Hopefully, if your friend's parents or a spouse/partner figures out what's going on, they can step in and help the person sort out the need for using the fake illness. Remember, you're not trying to get the person in trouble, you just want to find out what's going on and how to help.


It is usually rude to say that you suspect they're faking. Treat it like a genuine problem as you ask for more information. Say you want to help them (assuming you do, truly, wish to help this person, whether they are faking or not).

, If this has been going on for a long time, you need to take action. They may not have the illness, but they might have a condition called Munchausen's syndrome. This is when someone pretends to have an illness, usually for attention. However, the fake illness life can go on for so long that the person does actually believe they have it, so it can affect their lifestyle greatly. Hypochondria or anxiety disorders are also possibilities.


Tell the person you are very worried about them and insist that they go to a doctor. Say you'll worry about them until they go. Offer to come with if you want.
Tip off someone, such as their parents or best friend. Choose someone who has enough sway with the person to be able to help.

, Whatever their reasons, this person probably doesn't mean you any harm. Assume the best, treat them well, and give them love. Whatever is going on with them, it probably isn't any fun, and they could use all the help they can get.

Recognize that everyone needs a break sometimes.",How to Spot Someone Who Is Faking an Illness to Get out of School," Children who describe vague symptoms that move from one body part to another without discretion are often faking. If, on the other hand, his symptoms are concrete and typically go together—like a runny nose and a sore throat, or stomach pain and diarrhea—that’s not a red flag.;
, Don’t leave the room after handing your child the thermometer. Many a child have gotten out of going to school by running the thermometer under the hot tap or holding it up to a hot lightbulb.

, If your child says she’s been throwing up, you will probably be able to hear and see it.

, Does your child look pale and clammy? Clammy skin is caused by a number of factors, including allergic reaction, severe pain, anxiety, dehydration, and pneumonia., Sometimes children complain of a belly ache. If she won’t let you touch her tummy and refuses to eat or drink, she may be having abdominal pain.Abdominal pain can be caused by constipation, viral infections, and occasionally something more serious. Call your doctor if your child has prolonged abdominal pain.

, If they look red, pink, or watery, ask him if they are bothering him. While it could just be allergies, if it looks crusty it might be Pink Eye.


If your child has Pink Eye, take him to the doctor. This viral infection can be very contagious., Even those children who don’t like doctors or medicine will agree to do whatever they need to in order to feel better. If your child refuses care, it’s probably because he doesn’t need it!

, If she went from droopy-eyed to bright-eyed, she may be looking for a day catching up on “Arthur.”


Keep an ear out for any mention of homework. If she squeals with delight at the thought of not having to do any today, this might be a sign that she is trying to avoid something.

, Don’t incentivize staying home. If staying home sick means special treats and a day of television, she won’t mind falling behind in school. Sick days are meant for resting and recuperating, which can include watching television. However if your child is extremely alert while watching T.V., instead of lying on the couch and watching through squinting, resting eyes, he may have another motive.

, So you said he could stay home, and after twenty minutes of extra sleep he’s playing with LEGO and running around. He may have fooled you once, but he won’t fool you again.

, Take note if your child conveniently gets sick on the day of the US Constitution test. If she didn’t study enough she might be trying for an extra day to cram.


If she’s extremely nervous about a presentation or test, she might actually feel physically sick. Help her to pinpoint what she’s nervous about and brainstorm solutions with her.
Younger kids don’t have the self-awareness to say, “I’m feeling anxious today.”Tell them it’s normal to feel scared, and see if you can help them through their fear., Some kids really don’t click with their teachers. If your child is faking sick to avoid his teachers, this could become a pattern.


If this is the case, you will need to speak directly with your child’s teacher to resolve the issue.
Find out if other students are having a hard time with this particular teacher. If not, it may be a specific to your child’s learning style or personality.

, Approximately 30 percent of students in grades 6-10 are affected by bullying. Understandably, those affected by it may choose to fake sick in order to bypass the jeering. , If it seems that every Tuesday and Thursday—gym day—little Samuel comes down with a vague leg cramp, it’s probably OK to send him to school.


If you honestly can’t tell and it hasn’t been a pattern, go with your gut.
If your child really is sick, the school will send him home anyway.

, You should not send your child to school if she has a temperature above 100.4 Fahrenheit, vomiting, diarrhea, persistent pain or a bad, wet cough. This is not only for your child’s health, but for the health of her teachers and classmates.

, It’s hard to believe that kids get stressed, but they do! Sometimes the weekend isn’t enough time for them to catch up, especially if they are weighed down with projects.


Unexplained symptoms could be a sign of something else. Anxiety, depression, or other issues can sometimes manifest themselves in physical ways."

Prepare your plan.,
Establish a time frame:


Early night 9pm-Midnight
Midnight hours Midnight-1am
Early morning 1am-6am
Morning 6am-9am

,
In the early night start putting your stuff together.,
Make a list of what you'll need, and be prepared.",How to Stay up Late on a School Night Secretly," Have all of your entertainment and food/energy set out when they're ready to be used. Create a list of ideas of what to do when you are bored beforehand, because boredom is what usually makes everybody go to bed.;
,, Do not begin to do your stuff until your parents are in their bedroom, as they don't have to be sleeping. Watch TV when you're done. Midnight hours are the easiest time to stay up. Early morning is the when people begin to get to sleep. Drink energy drinks, soda, or water but not to much. Do whatever you can to stay up. Morning will be the hardest

, Smart things to gather before you go to bed should include ice packs (For waking up when you feel sleepy. Though they'll work for a while, later on you will have to make it cold again in the bathroom somehow).


If you forget to do this, play video games, watch DVDs, play on a laptop, or even a phone if you plan to stay up late and chat to a friends who's also staying up.Be sure not to be on it too long. The phone bills will rise or the electric bill (This may easy to hide, because you can say that the air conditioning turned on a lot) if you're on the phone all night, and your parents will wonder when you got the time. It can also be helpful to bring a whole packet of very minty or spicy gum, if you can. Chewing on something like that can keep your body awake longer when you start to fall asleep, but if you know you're just too tired and gum won't help you, spit out the gum, it can be dangerous to have gum in your mouth as you can choke.

Fake a cold or flu.,
Consider a migraine.Headaches do not cause the kind of noticeable symptoms that a cold or flu would, so you won’t have to do a lot of elaborate set up or change your appearance much for this one.,
Claim a case of diarrhea.This deception depends on planting the right mental imagery rather than faking visible symptoms.,
Go with irritable bowel syndrome to pave the way for future days off.This won't work on parents, but it's effective on teachers and bosses.,
Mention that you’ve felt lightheaded all day.On the evening before your day off from school, casually mention to your parents that you feel dizzy.,
Pick at your lunch/dinner and eat very little.When you sit down to dinner with your parents the night before, take very small bites and push the food around on your plate a lot.,
Ask family members/coworkers if they feel cold.,
Use makeup to look pale and exhausted.,
Go to bed earlier than usual.The night before school, be sure to yawn a lot, appear exhausted, and mention that you’re going to try to get some extra rest.,
Be consistent.,
Wake up early to prepare your makeup and props.,
Sprint to the bathroom with a hand over your mouth.,
Pretend to be upset when discussing if you should stay home.,
Keep the act up as you ""recover.""",How to Successfully Fake Being Sick," These two illnesses are extremely common and everyone is familiar with their signs and symptoms.As long as you can fake sneezing, sniffling, coughing, etc., you can make this work. Both colds and flus are notorious for making you feel really bad the day before they strike, so you can easily set your plan into motion 24 hours ahead of time.


You won’t need to do much to prepare for this bluff. Invest in a box of tissues – they’ll make very simple props.
If you want to go the extra mile, make sure you have some pale makeup on hand.
It only takes a quick pat of white face powder or foundation to give yourself a sickly, wan appearance.;
, You’ll still have a handful of symptoms to fake, but this sham depends more on your acting skills.


Be prepared to do a lot of temple rubbing, squinting, pouting and pretending to be sensitive to light and sound.
A little pale makeup is the only physical change you’ll need to make, and even that is optional, depending on the strength of your performance.

, For this reason, it’s better for getting out of work, not school. As long as you can handle discussing your bowels with your boss over the phone, the diarrhea scam is the most effective of them all because it’s rarely challenged.


The key to pulling this off is the phone call conversation. You’ll need to start by sounding very reluctant and embarrassed about the whole thing.
Lower your voice and say something like, “This is so embarrassing, but I’m just going to come out and say it – I am having serious stomach issues today. I’m running to the bathroom every 15 minutes. It's really bad.”
Insert a dramatic pause before whispering the words “stomach issues.”

, Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic stomach affliction that’s fairly common. The main symptoms are abdominal pain/cramping, bloating, gas, and alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea, which are all virtually invisible to an outsider.Only play this card if you can handle a long con, because IBS is chronic.


Take into consideration that chronic illnesses are serious. It's not very ethical to fake IBS. It is far more serious than a simple cold.
Be aware that some employers/schools will want a doctor's note for this.
Take your boss/teacher aside to share the information privately. Ask that your illness be kept between the two of you, since it’s so personal.
Say that you “suffer from IBS” and it sometimes interferes with your daily life, but you’re working with your doctor to keep it manageable.

, If you're trying to get out of work, mention this to coworkers the afternoon before. Say that you’ve felt “off” all day and you’ve had trouble concentrating. When someone asks you a question, stare off into space and pretend you didn’t hear them. When they ask again, shake your head a little, as if you had to force yourself to snap out of it.


Say something like, “I’m sorry, this has been happening to me all day – I must be coming down with something.”
Sway a bit and maybe grip the edge of a nearby piece of furniture so that it looks like you’re trying to steady yourself.

, For work, do this at lunch the day before. Drink only water and take small sips of it. When pressed, say something like, “I don’t know, I’m really just not hungry,” with a pained look on your face.


You could go further and say, “I actually feel pretty nauseous right now.” Look upset about it.
Hide some snacks in your room (or work desk) ahead of time so that you won’t get too hungry later.

, Shiver and say something like, “I’m freezing. Does it seem really cold in here to you? Maybe I should turn off the air conditioner.” If you have access to the temperature controls where you are, adjust them beforehand so that it’s actually pretty warm.


If you're at home and this is for school, wrap yourself in a blanket and walk around the house with it.

, Whether this is for school or work, use makeup the day before. Dust your face lightly with white powder or use foundation to look unusually pale. Apply a little gray or purple eyeshadow under your eyes so that you look exhausted.


If you're doing this for school, don’t go too far with the makeup the day before – you’ll be using the more impactful makeup the next morning.

, You’ll have to turn out the lights in your room and actually pretend to be asleep, so prepare yourself to be a little bored.


Try to cough loudly and clear your throat a few times during the night so your parents will hear you.
If your fake sickness is a stomach virus, be sure to get up several times during the night to go to the bathroom (set an alarm for every 3 hours, if that helps). Flush twice and wash your hands loudly so you can be heard.
If your fake illness is a migraine, loudly toss and turn all night long. Moan occasionally. Knock on your parent's bedroom door at about midnight to ask for ibuprofen with a pained look on your face.

, Amplify the symptoms that you were faking the night before – don't add a bunch of new symptoms to the mix. To properly continue the ruse, just intensify whatever images and symptoms you planted in your parents’ heads the night before. If this is for work, make sure to remember the symptoms you used the day before. Mention these in your phone call to your boss.

, Use pale foundation and/or powder to look sickly. Put a dark eyeshadow under your eyes. Wipe all moisture off your mouth and avoid chapstick. Mess up your hair and look generally disheveled – maybe have just one sock on. Rumple your bedclothes so that it looks like you tossed and turned all night. All of those will be believable if you're faking a cold/flu, stomach virus or a migraine.


Additionally, if you're faking a cold or flu, you should also apply a small amount of blush to the tip of your nose, your nostrils, and the inner corners of your eyes.
Litter crumpled tissues all over your bedside table and floor.
Run hot water over a wash cloth and then apply it to your forehead for a few minutes so that you’ll feel feverish.

,

Save this for when your parents are definitely awake so they can witness it. Stay in the bathroom for about 15 minutes. Cough and sputter loudly and flush multiple times. Come out slowly, holding your abdomen.

Go back in about 10 minutes later with a look of urgency on your face and repeat the same actions.
Twice is enough. Don’t overdo it!

, If you're trying to get out of work, you'll do this when you call in. If it's for school say something like, “Oh no, I can’t get sick now! This is terrible timing. We are doing something really fun in theater class.” Sigh a few times and look bummed out. Try to steer the conversation so that your parent is urging you to stay home and you’re resisting. Just be sure to give in very quickly!


Don’t overact. If you take any of this too far, you may end up getting hauled to see a physician. That will definitely ruin your day off!

, When you return to school or work after your day(s) off, make sure to have a few light symptoms. If you show back up completely healthy, it will look suspicious. If you were faking a cold/flu, cough occasionally, look tired, and apply the lightest dusting of white powder. If you were faking a migraine or stomach flu, make sure you look pale and tired. Use the white powder and also apply a little purple eyeshadow under your eyes. This will make it look like you haven't been able to sleep well.

Droop your shoulders a bit and be less enthused than usual. After 2 days you can stop with the makeup.
If you were faking a cold or flu, cough occasionally for 3-4 days after your return.

, About five minutes after you've been picked up, wrap your arms around your stomach and say you have a little bit of a stomachache.

, Every minute or so, just make a small ""ugh/appropriate distress"" sound.

, Say you need a rest before attending the activity you participate in.

, Remember: when you're sick, you don't show off your sickness; you only emit signals showing sickness. Whenever contacted, look sad or grumpy as if something isn't right, and remain quiet. However, don't be a mime - just speak very little and speak softly.

, Clutch your stomach and look like you're in pain.

, If your parent or guardian asks if you're okay, make them aware that you aren't feeling too good, but ""reassure"" them that you will be fine for practice; but make it clear that if you get any worse, skipping the session will have to be an option.


Don't exaggerate how much you want to go to this activity. This can make your parents believe that you love the activity, and sign you up for more of it when that's not what you wanted!

, Bring on the drowsiness, headaches and whatever else you are prone to getting, illness-wise. If you fail, prolong your act through practice.

, This will create bags under your eyes, which will help convince your parents that you got worse as the night went on. If they suggest or try to give you medicine, go to the kitchen and get a glass of water. Don't take the pill - quietly throw it away. Go back to your parents with the glass and pretend to put the pill into your mouth and take a sip of water and gulp the rest down. This will hopefully convince them you took the pill.

, Eliminate one symptom of your sickness at a time so they won't take you to the doctor the next day, and to avoid getting in trouble for faking.

Crouch.,
Breathe quickly and deeply in your crouched position.,
Stand up quickly.,
Wait before you walk.",How to Make Yourself Light Headed1," Bend your knees and get low to the ground. Hang your head low. When you stand up quickly after you've been crouching, sitting, or laying down for a while, the blood rushes from your head, and your brain is momentarily knocked off of its usual equilibrium.If you haven't been sitting or laying down for long, try crouching down and breathing rapidly to simulate the process.


Be aware of external factors. The lightheaded effect will be more intense if you're hungry or dehydrated, or if the air is hot and humid.If you get too lightheaded, you might faint or vomit.
Consider standing on your head or performing a handstand. Turning yourself upside-down is a very quick way to bring blood to your head. The process is essentially the same: stay upside-down for a minute or two until your head is heavy – then stand. Make sure that you have plenty of neck support.;
, In theory, this will increase your blood flow and temporarily raise your blood pressure – especially to your head and lungs. Keep breathing and crouching for at least thirty seconds, and as long as several minutes. Bear in mind that the longer you stay down, the more likely you are to feel lightheaded upon standing.


The heavier and faster you breathe, the higher your heart rate will go. This will cause your blood flow to quicken.

, Hold your head high, and don't move around much. The blood pressure should drain from your head, suddenly. You should feel lightheaded almost immediately.


Your vision may go dark. You may see spots, ""stars"", or bright points of light dancing before your eyes. You should feel an overwhelming head rush.

, It's best to stand still for a few moments and enjoy the sensation. Let your vision return, and let your brain restore its balance. If you try to walk while you're very lightheaded, you might trip, fall, or bump into something.

Hold your breath.,
Be very careful.,
Prepare to see stars and feel very dizzy.",How to Make Yourself Light Headed2," Holding your breath deprives your brain of oxygen. Your body is used to a steady flow of fresh oxygen; indeed, you need to breathe it almost constantly to survive. If you hold your breath, you deprive yourself of oxygen, and your brain quickly descends into ""crisis mode"". If you hold your breath until you feel uncomfortable—even for just a matter of seconds—you will be able to make yourself lightheaded.

, Don't hold your breath for too long, or you might pass out. Whatever you do, do not deprive yourself of oxygen in a way that you can't manually override. You're playing with your life here. Only hold your breath if you are able to resume breathing again at a moment's notice. This means:


Do not seal your head inside an airtight container, like a bag or a plastic wrap. Certainly don't plug your nose and your mouth at the same time. You run a high risk of suffocating.
Do not try to make yourself lightheaded underwater. If you pass out underwater, you might not be able to bring yourself to the surface – and you might drown.
Do not try to make yourself lightheaded while you're doing anything that requires your full attention. Don't do this while riding a bike or driving a car. Don't do this while standing on the edge of a high place. You might crash; you might fall.

, Your vision may go dark, and your brain may feel temporarily empty. The sensation might be overwhelming; you might even pass out. Don't try to walk until your head clears. Make sure that you are always in control of whether or not you can breathe – otherwise you risk brain damage or even death.

Breathe through your mouth.,
Cut back on water.,
Cough until it hurts a little.,
Scream into a pillow.",How to Make a Sore Throat1," By moving air through your mouth you can dry out your throat.Sometimes this occurs when you are congested and have to breathe through your nose.;
, Limiting the amount of water you drink will help to dry out your throat, too. Aside from that, if you are 'suffering' from a sore throat it should appear that you are only taking small sips if you drink anything at all.

, If you cough a few times, you will notice that your throat might start to feel a little scratchy from the strain. You don't want to overdo it and irritate your throat more than necessary. Just the sound of you coughing several times should be enough to convince the people that hear you that you might be getting sick.


Close your eyes when you cough so it seems more painful and realistic.

, You can strain your voice a little if you push it to it's limits for a few minutes. Just be smart about it. If you start screaming when others are around to hear, they will likely suspect that is the source of your sore throat.


Try singing forcefully. You can also strain your voice by singing. For best results, pick some loud music that has lots of screaming lyrics. After a few minutes of rocking out, you will likely notice some irritation to your vocal chords.

Only talk when necessary.,
Suck on a lozenge.,
Ask for ice cream.,
Eat some very spicy food.,
Consider coming down with other symptoms.",How to Make a Sore Throat2," If your throat really hurts you than you would not be talking unless you have to. Don't spoil the illusion by getting tricked into telling a story or explaining too much about how you feel. Give short responses. If a question requires a long response, start talking but stop and point to your throat indicating that you need to stop due to the soreness.


Instead of answering, you can always nod or shake your head when possible.
Keep your voice quiet and soft. Use your throat as little as possible when speaking. Go for a raspy whisper.

Just let them know you're not feeling so great. When you wake up the next day with a sore throat, it won't seem like just a convenient excuse to get out of your plans.

, A sore throat is not usually a sign of severe sickness, and you can usually tough it out if you want to be somewhere.However, if you come down with a sore throat when you have choir practice or to clarinet lessons, it can be very difficult to perform such tasks. If you just want to get out of going to class or your uncle's house, you might want to catch something more severe.

",How to Get a Sick Day off from School Without Going to the Doctor," If you want to stay home but avoid a trip to the doctor, you have to choose a sickness that’s not too severe. You'll have to feign an illness that can only be cured by staying at home and avoiding any hard work, (like going to school)! A stomach virus is a good choice because it leaves you unable to go to class but isn’t necessarily severe enough to call for medical attention.
The most awful symptoms of a stomach virus include diarrhea, vomiting and cramps.A fever also works because it makes a good excuse to stay home but usually just requires a little rest and relaxation.
Fever signs and symptoms might include sweating, shivering, headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite, dehydration and general weakness. ;
, People don’t generally get sick all of a sudden, so you'll have to begin feeling bad the day before you want to stay home and let your guardians know about it.


Tell your guardians that you’re not feeling your best. You can do this by saying some key phrases like:

""My head hurts.”
""I ate something funny at lunch today.""
""A lot of my classmates have been out sick lately, I hope I didn't catch anything!""



, If you want to stay home without going to the doctor, you have to convey that you’re sick but not sick enough to need medical care.


Avoid suddenly showing all of your symptoms at once.
Pretending to vomit may make your guardians concerned enough to bring you to the doctor, so it’s best to stick to feigning the other two symptoms. Avoid showing only the symptoms that you know your guardians usually treat with medication, like a headache.

, At this point in your performance, you’re just starting to feel sick and need to be subtle or else risk being figured out.


The “art” of your performance lies in subtlety revealing your ailments.
To help you find the right balance, think about what happened the last time you started to get sick.
Avoid using direct phrases such as:

“I don’t think I’ll be able to go to school tomorrow.”
”I’m not feeling well enough to make it to class.”
”I’m too sick for school.”



, Don’t engage in the normal activities you would do if you felt well to show that you’re not feeling your best.


Decline to participate in a favorite activity, such as watching a movie or playing a board game.
Seem disinterested in engaging in the things your guardians know you usually enjoy doing.
Contribute little to the conversation, so that you seem too tired to be involved.
If your parents ask if you’ve been feeling sick for a while, tell them that you’ve been feeling slightly off all day.

, If your stomach really hurt, eating a big meal is the last thing you want to do! If you had a fever, you could be experiencing a loss of appetite, which also would make you not want to eat much.


Excuse yourself to use the bathroom and don’t come out for ten minutes to give the impression that you are feeling bad but that you can still function enough to not raise too much concern.
When you return to the table, let your guardians know that your stomach is hurting by saying things like:

”Sorry I was gone for so long, my stomach feels really weird.”
”I’m not sure if I can finish dinner, my stomach really doesn’t feel well.”
”Can I be excused? My stomach is hurting and I think I want to lay down for a moment.”


If possible, sneak some snacks into your bedroom to eat later so that you don’t get really hungry at night!

, Generally, being sick is really taxing on your body! Your body works hard to fight off stomach viruses and other fever-causing ailments so you'll need to show your guardians that your body is hard at work because you're ""really"" sick.


Some well-known symptoms of a fever include body aches, fatigue and muscle weakness. You can show that your tired by moving slower than normal, laying down on the couch or resting your head on the table at dinner.
When you’re tired, your body temperature may drop slightly causing you to feel colder than normal. Get a blanket that’s heavier than normal to put over yourself when you’re sitting on the couch. , If you know that your guardians will want to touch your face or use a thermometer to check for a fever, you first need to elevate your body temperature.


A fever is also known as a “high temperature.” You have a fever when your temperature rises above its normal range, which is about 98.6 F (37 C). Depending on what's causing your fever, additional fever signs and symptoms might include:

Sweating
Shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Dehydration
General weakness Pretending you have an increased body temperature should be done by demonstrating that you have the symptoms of a fever and by showing that you have above-average body temperature.

, You want your face looks red and to feel hot to the touch.


Put on a sweater or heavy clothing to begin making your body warm.
Without anyone seeing, do jumping jacks, high-knees, or mountain-climbers for one minute.
If you’re not hot after one minute, repeat your method until you start to feel hot and sweaty.
Don’t overdo it! You don’t want to push yourself too hard and risk injury. Be careful and only perform until you feel hot.
Take off your added layer of clothing and immediately go to your guardians and say you don’t feel well. They will see that you’re sweating and if they touch your cheek, they will feel that you’re hot.

, If you show that you’re consistently warm, your guardians will be more likely to believe you’re sick.


Run a cloth under hot water and put it on your face and neck when no one is looking. Be sure that the water isn’t too hot, because you risk burning yourself.
Pat off the excess water with a dry towel. You want to seem warm and have a little bit of water remaining. This will make it look like you’ve been sweating.
If you don’t have access to a cloth, rub your face with your hands. This will create friction and warm your face quickly, as well as make it red.
Ask your guardians to feel your head or cheek. Once you’ve warmed up, tell your guardians you don’t feel good again and let them touch your hot forehead.

, If you know your guardians will want to measure your temperature, you’ll have to plan ahead to make the thermometer hot to show your temperature is elevated.


Rub the tip of the thermometer with your fingers. The faster you move your fingers, the faster the thermometer will heat up to the temperature you want.
If you have a heat source nearby, like a light bulb, put the thermometer next to it for a few moments.
If your thermometer is one with mercury inside, then you can also raise the temperature by soaking it in hot water. Make sure that the water isn't boiling hot, as this could cause the mercury thermometer to explode. The water temperature should only be a few degrees hotter than your body temperature, around 99.5F. , Like any actor, you'll need some props to show your guardians that your symptoms are persistent and aren’t going away.Hide a cup of water somewhere by your bed. This will be used at night to really convince your guardians that you are sweating.
If you have an electric tea kettle that won’t be noticed if missing, that’s even better than a cup of water. This way, you will be able to show that you’re both hot and sweating.
Get a face cloth to hide by your bed next to the water. The cloth will be used to apply the water and also to make your face red.

, Wake yourself up In the middle of the night to show your guardians that you still have symptoms.


Around 2AM or 3AM is a good time to wake up.
Use the cloth and water that you hid by your bed to rub your face until it looks red.
Don’t dry your face completely, so that it is still slightly wet and will look like sweat.
Walk into your guardian's room and ask them to feel your head because you think you might be sick.

, If you complain about feeling extremely sick now your guardians might strongly consider taking you to the doctor.


If your guardians come to sit with you at night, wait a few minutes before pretending to fall asleep.
Tell them you feel thirsty and ask for water.
Pull the sheets tight over you to show that you’re cold.
Avoid talking or complaining too much: let your performance speak for itself!

, If you stay in bed, your guardians will be more likely to think that you’re tired and simply need to sleep. If they believe you need rest, you’ll be able to avoid both school and the doctor.


If your guardians come to wake you up, try to rub your face with your hands before they come into your room to make your face red and hot.
Tell your guardians that you couldn’t sleep much.
Say you now you’re even more exhausted than you were yesterday.

, Continue “showing” your symptoms during breakfast or else your guardians will know you don’t want to go to school.


Eat little at breakfast to show your still not feeling well.
Wear a heavy sweater and ask for an extra blanket because you “feel” really cold.
Lay your head on the table to show that you’re really tired and disinterested

Reduce your physical activity to a minimum.,
Maintain a positive attitude and smile.",How to Pretend You Are Not Sick1," If you want everyone to think that you’re not sick, it’s important that your energy level appears normal. An easy way to trick people into thinking you’re okay is to maintain a healthy level of energy. Try to say everything with enthusiasm, and stay away from mumbling.Be aware of the tone and pitch of your voice. Having a sore throat might complicate this, but avoid sounding monotone.;
, If someone realizes that there’s something wrong with you, it’s important to change the direction of their inquiries. You can blame it on the bad weather, car issues, something at work, or something personal.


If someone asks you if there’s anything wrong, you can reply by saying “Not really, I just had a hard time starting the car this morning and it’s really throwing me off.”
Don’t make an excuse that’s worse than actually being sick. Think of something innocuous and believable.

, Don’t put in physical effort if you don’t have to. While it may aid in making it seem like you’re healthy, being sick can take a physical toll, and it will wear down your endurance and make you feel worse over time.Opt out of physical activity if it’s an option.

For this type of cast, it's best to not go past the elbow.
This type of cast will look more like an older plaster-type cast rather than the fiberglass wrapped cast most often used today.;
, Starting just below the marker line, begin wrapping the toilet paper around your arm in two layers. Tear off the paper.


At this point, don't cover your hand. Focus on the part of your arm below the wrist.

, Hold your arm under water for a few seconds, wetting the paper thoroughly.

, Press the paper to your skin, squeezing out the water as you go.

Choose an embarrassing sickness.,
Prepare to talk to your teacher.,
Approach your teacher privately.,
Stick to your story.",How to Get Sent Home from School1," You'll want to choose something that is common, but something that most people would be embarrassed to admit. This will give more credibility to your story, as your school nurse or office worker will think it unlikely that you would admit to something embarrassing if it weren't necessary.Some examples include:


DiarrheaBad gas;
, You'll have to convince your teacher to tell her that you aren't feeling well, but before you do, make your story more believable by going to the bathroom several times. Space out your bathroom breaks by about 20 to 30 minutes, and if your teacher questions you, tell her that you've been feeling, ""A little funny.""

, After making a few trips to the bathroom, you're ready to talk to your teacher about getting sent home. Be sure that you are appropriately embarrassed about your condition and try to talk to your teacher one-on-one. Don't come right out and admit that you have diarrhea or gas. Instead, describe it in a different way, like:


""I've been having to go to the bathroom a lot today and my tummy's really upset. I keep having to go and it's really bad. I just want to lay down for a little bit.""
""I'm sorry I keep having to go to the bathroom. I'm really embarrassed, but I keep passing gas. It's really bad and I don't want anyone to laugh at me.""

, You'll likely have to jump through one more hoop before you are sent home. The last obstacle before you get sent home will likely be your school nurse or an office worker. As long as you don't change your story and continue being embarrassed about your condition, you'll likely be sent home before too long.


Stress the fact that your stomach is upset and that you want to lay down for a little while.
You may want to get a false scent that imitates bad gas and spritz some of this around you when no one is looking. These kind of sprays can be bought at novelty stores, magic shops, and online.

Use leftovers from dinner.,
Mix orange juice, milk, and crackers.,
Use canned soup.,
Use oatmeal and food coloring.,
Make spoiled milk vomit.,
Hide the vomit in your room until the coast is clear.,
Fake getting sick first thing in the morning.,
Take your fake vomit into the bathroom.,
Make a big scene.,
Brush your teeth immediately after fake vomiting.,
Keep selling it.,
Don't overdo it.",How to Fake Vomit," After dinner take some leftovers from dinner and chew your food about 20 times and spit it into a plastic Ziplock bag. Make sure you have a lot of leftovers, but not so much that it'll be obvious all the leftovers are gone.


Use some water to help thin out the chewed up food and make it look more vomit-like. Other additions that make fake vomit look gross include thousand island salad dressing, Vaseline, and milk.
Alternatively, you could use breakfast cereal or whatever it is that you plan on eating for breakfast. You might be able to make it a more convincing show.;
, Maybe the most accurate looking fake concoction you can make easily and quickly is to combine three simple elements into a Ziplock bag quickly. Mix equal parts of orange juice and milk and then chew up a handful of plain saltine crackers and spit them into the liquid. Massage the bag to mix it thoroughly and make it look gross.

, If you don't have any leftovers to use for your fake vomit recipe, start looking through the cupboards for cans of soup that you could use for your concoction. Good candidates include clam chowder, beef stew, pea soup, or other fairly chunky soups that will look like they've already been swallowed.


Like the leftovers, try to thin the soup out some with some water or some milk. You probably don't need to use all of the can of soup, maybe less than half a can. Store the vomit in a plastic bag or a jar and hide it in your room.

, Get an empty bottle and fill it 3/4 with water, then add a few drops of different colors of food coloring to make a gross, brownish, dark color in the mixture. Add a pinch of chewed up leftovers to the mixture for extra texture and grossness.


The mixture should be mostly water. If you add too much oatmeal, it's going to look like oatmeal. If your parents look closely and know you haven't eaten oatmeal recently, you'll be caught.

, If you want to go really gross with your fake vomit, you can do some planning ahead of time. Pour some milk into a glass and hide it in your room, preferably in a corner far from your bed so you won't have to smell it. Wait several days until it spoils and gets all chunky and gross. It'll usually take between three and five days. Chocolate and strawberry look best.


Before it spoils, you might want to add some chewed up food and other stuff just so you won't have to add it later. You'll want to be around it as little as possible.

, Keep your fake puke in a plastic bag or a jar and hide it somewhere in your room. Make sure it's safe in a container, because you don't want to spill it somewhere and have a disgusting mess on your hands.


If your puke is discovered before you get ready to 'reveal' it in the toilet, just play it off like it's a science project, or an ""experiment.""

, As soon as you get up, start complaining that you feel sick. Don't eat breakfast, or try chewing food with a horrible look on your face, as if you can't imagine eating something. Just start acting like you feel terrible. Make sure that your parents know you're ""not feeling well.""


The morning is the best time to fake it. If you're throwing up, you won't be sent to school in the morning. If you fake it too early, like the night before or in the middle of the night, it's more likely that you'll be caught.

, When you get a chance, slip away into the bathroom with your fake vomit in a plastic bag. Make sure you lock the door so you don't get caught fumbling with a plastic bag full of the fake stuff.


If the vomit had dried, shake a bit of water around to get it moist again. Now kneel down in front of the toilet and start groaning.

, When you get into the bathroom, start groaning and making retching sounds. As you make the sound quickly pour the vomit into the toilet as if you were vomiting. Dispose of the container as soon as possible. Turn slightly away from the toilet, groan and breathe slowly as if you had just been sick.


Don't dump your fake vomit on the floor. If you think you might get in trouble for pretending to get sick, imagine how much trouble you'll be in if you faked getting sick and made your parents clean up rotten milk and soup off the carpet.

, It's possible to get caught immediately after dumping your fake puke, if it looks like you haven't puked. After you dump it out, start brushing your teeth, which is something you might normally do after throwing up. Open the door and let your parents see the puke in the toilet, just before you're flushing it down. The reason why you should brush your teeth is because usually, people get bad breath while they're sick, so parents may ask to smell your breath. If they do, tell them you brushed your teeth.

, For the most part, you shouldn't have to do much more after your parents see a toilet full of ""vomit"". You'll be able to stay home from school that day. But, that doesn't mean you can suddenly turn around and start doing cartwheels. Act like you're pretty wiped out and tired, head to bed, and relax throughout your day off.


If your parents call you from work, put on a groaning and tired voice. Say you are still feeling awful but not as much as in the morning.

, The suggestion of puke doesn't need to be overdone. If you want to stay home from school, you might even be able to get away with it just by saying that you puked and not necessarily showing it to anyone. Don't over think it. You don't have to prove that you're sick by taking a mouth full of disgusting soup and milk combo and fake puking on the floor.


If you want to fake throwing up in front of someone for fun, do it in one quick motion (like a muscle spasm), leaning forward. Puff up your cheeks like you're about to puke. Repeat about 3 times, then pretend to swallow. Do this a few times, more dramatic each time. Finally in two more retches, spit out the mixture.

""I have a headache and every time I stand up I feel a little dizzy. This has never happened to me before. Is this normal? I don't feel good.""
""My stomach's upset. I don't know why, it just started hurting last night and this morning I had to go to the bathroom real bad. Can I go lay down for a while?""

, Once you have gained access to the nurse's office of the waiting area of your school's office, you are in reaching distance of the school thermometer. The thermometer will be your key to getting sent home. Stick to your symptoms. Now that you're out of class, you should tell the adult watching you that you feel warm and ask for a thermometer.

, This will require some stealth or planning. You must be careful the adult in charge of taking your temperature doesn't even suspect that you are artificially raising your temperature. If he does, you're chances are getting sent home are next to nil. When faking out the thermometer, you'll have to be careful not to raise the temperature too high. The ideal fake-sick temperature is between 99.5°F (37.5°C) and 100°F (37.78°C). To fake out the thermometer, you might:


Do some light exercise on your way to the office/nurse's room. This can artificially raise your body temperature.
Drink hot water before going to the office or the nurse's room.
Hold the thermometer close to a heat source, like a desk lamp., Consistency is key; repeating a thing makes it more believable.By telling the nurse or a school office worker that the same thing, over and over again might get you sent home, even if your temperature is normal.

, When you hear those sweet words, ""We're calling your parents,"" it's easy to lose perspective. If you tip your hand and reveal that you're not really sick by celebrating, you may never be able to use this trick again, or you may even get in trouble.

Understand school policy.,
Gather your pink eye faking materials.,
Apply your phony pink eye product.,
Have a patsy.",How to Get Sent Home from School3," Though some schools may differ, generally, where infectious illnesses are concerned, a student will be sent home if he is infectious rather than risk infecting other students. Pink eye is ideal for these purposes, as it is highly contagious and easy to fake., These should be kept in your locker and applied at some point during the day, like when you take a bathroom break or in between classes. To fake pink eye, you'll need:


Red lipstick OR

Hair gel, If you are using red lipstick, you'll only need a small amount; too much will be spotted immediately as a fake, so you may want to apply your pink eye product in the bathroom. Rub the lipstick along the lids of a single eye. If you are using hair gel, again, take only a very small amount and rub it along the lids of your eye., If you claim, out of the blue, that you have pink eye, your teacher or the school nurse might doubt you. Instead, have a person on which you can blame your condition, like a cousin you visited over the weekend, or a younger sibling who is still in pre-school.

Buy some ipecac syrup at your local pharmacy.,
Observe label directions.,
Take with a full glass of water.,
Avoid milk and carbonated beverages.,
Take a second dose if vomiting does not occur in 20 to 30 minutes.Generally, ipecac syrup should take effect and cause you to vomit in less than a half hour.,
Plan your spew location for greatest effect.",How to Get Sent Home from School4," Most local pharmacies sell this vomit inducing agent over the counter as a syrup. Ipecac syrup is made from a plant that contains chemicals that irritate your digestive tract and cause your brain to believe that you need to throw up.This is a convincing way to get your teacher to send you home from school. She will likely think you are sick and send you home right away., Depending on the brand of ipecac syrup you buy and the way in which it is administered, there may be special instructions that you need to keep in mind.Taking too much ipecac syrup may have serious health effects, including possible damage to your heart and muscles.

, Generally, you should take one to two full glasses of water (8 to 16 ounces) to help the ipecac syrup induce vomiting.It may be an effective strategy for you to keep some ipecac syrup in your locker. This way you can excuse yourself from class for a drink of water or to retrieve a notebook and take your ipecac then.

, Milk and even milk based products may reduce the effects of ipecac syrup, so you should avoid these before taking it.Carbonated beverages, on the other hand, can cause your stomach to swell, which may cause discomfort., If it does not, you can take a second dose with another one to two glasses of water.Do not exceed the label recommendations for how much ipecac syrup you take.

, While you might be able to get sent home simply by vomiting in the bathroom, if you want to guarantee being sent home, you should vomit in class and in sight of your teacher. Since ipecac syrup can take effect quickly, be sure you have quick and easy access to a garbage can.

Decide what illness you are going to fake.,
Start mentioning symptoms the day before you want to fake the sickness.,
Jog your memory.,
Make your face pale.,
Pretend you're dizzy and lightheaded.,
Act uncomfortable.,
Be sluggish.,
Act like you're upset about being sick.,
Don't suddenly get better.",How to Fake Symptoms of Being Sick1," Ideally you want something that incapacitates you from major responsibilities without being so serious that others will take you to the doctor or hospital. A cold, fever, or 24-hour bug are all good options. Make sure you know the symptoms you want to fake, and limit your performance to just those.;
, If you're wanting to stay home from school Monday, act tired and sluggish on Sunday. Say you aren't feeling well, or have a slight headache. Don't eat much and go to bed early. This way when you start showing more severe symptoms it will be more believable.

, You've been sick before, and people have noticed. Think about what it felt like, and what other people noticed the most when you were sick? Try to replicate those symptoms and channel that feeling. It'll be much easier to convince people that you have come down with something you have had before, rather than tackling a whole new ailment.

, If you have green concealer, rub it on your cheeks and forehead to make you appear pale. Don't paint your face green, just slightly change the color of your skin.


Make sure you know how to apply makeup effectively. If you are obviously wearing makeup, you are sure to be caught.






If you use makeup, try to avoid being touched. You'll be found out if someone puts their hand on your face and the concealer comes off.

, Walk slower, with shorter steps. Take your time when getting out of bed or a chair. When you stand up at your desk, pretend to lose your balance a little bit and put your hand on your desk to ""regain"" your balance.


To remember what being dizzy feels like, wait until you are in private and spin around until you get a little dizzy. Make note of how it feels and how you're acting. When you're in front of others, replicate that behavior, but only slightly.

, People who are sick don't feel good, so don't joke around and laugh and smile too much. Give people the impression that you're disoriented and ""in your own world."" If you're the kind of person who gets cranky when you're sick, then get cranky. Don't appear to take joy in the things you normally take joy in. If you're invited to the movies, and you usually love to go to the movies, turn it down.

, Stay in bed if you can. It's a natural reaction to want to rest and sleep a lot when you're sick. It's your body's way of giving itself time to fight the sickness and heal. Nod off or put your head down on your desk occasionally. Whenever you're given the chance, curl up on the closest couch you can find.


Pretend to shiver while in bed, even if under the covers.

, Being legitimately ill is not fun, and often leaves you with lots to catch up on. Tell people you wish you could make it to the activities you are skipping, and apologize for the inconvenience you might cause. Never seem really happy that you can stay home. Tiredly mumble ""ok"" and pretend to go back to sleep.

, If you successfully convince people you are sick, they will start to become suspicious again if you are back to 100% immediately after your sick day. If your parents decide to let you stay home, don't start smiling and acting energetic again until a few hours after school lets out.

Take a moment to calm down before talking to your parents.,
Recognize and admit any wrongdoing to turn the conversation off of you.,
Listen to them without interruption.,
Repeat back to them the main ideas of their argument.,
Walk them through your point of view.,
Come up with solutions together to ensure this fight doesn't happen again.,
Recognize that your parent's ""meanness"" is just a way to show they care.",How to Deal With Mean Parents1," You will not be able to get your full feelings out if you're yelling and screaming. Remember that people mirror behavior in a conversation -- the louder and angrier you get, the meaner your parents will get in response. If you can cool off, they will too. If things are really heated, try and have the conversation an hour or so after the inciting incident -- don't deal with it while the ""wounds"" are still fresh.“I need some time to cool down. I am going on a walk around the block/go to my room/etc. Can we talk in 10 minutes?""
Close your eyes and count to ten, taking a deep breath each time. It only takes a few seconds for your brain to calm down from the initial rush of anger.
Listen to music that soothes you. Put on the music, close your eyes, and concentrate on your breathing to calm down.;
, This doesn't mean that you just give up when they attack you, it just means that you offer them an olive branch. More likely than not, your parents are mean or angry because they think you made a mistake or disrespected them. Even if you didn't do anything wrong, apologize for the misunderstanding and offer to make things better. If you offer this first branch of peace, however small, you'll deflate their mean energy in an instant. All it starts with is an apology.


""I'm sorry I forgot to call, that was my fault.""
""I shouldn't have broken my promise, I'm sorry.""
""I didn't mean to yell, I just feel like we misunderstood each other."", This might be the hardest part of the entire situation, but it is also one of the most critical. Sometimes a mean parent just needs to vent, and you, as their child, are always around to listen. While it can be difficult to listen without jumping in, 90% of the time a parent will run out of things to say if you just let them keep talking. Let them get it all out and, when they're done, offer your side of the story.


Try to calmly remind your parents not to interrupt you when you're talking. If you can keep silent while they talk it will be much easier to ask them to stay silent when you want to speak.
“I want to hear about what happened from your side.” Once you're able to understand their perspective, you'll be able to work together to make the situation better., If you can tell them in a cooperative and calm way what they said, it could help your parents trust that you understand them. This is especially true if you can show your parents how what they are saying connects to the bigger picture. Most importantly, it lets you take control of the conversation, re-framing their concerns in a personal light.


""I can see now that you were worried I had gotten hurt when I didn't call.""
""I know that you're worried I might not have enough time to finish my homework.""
""I realize that you're only upset because you love me and want the best for me.""

, Most fights, anger, and meanness comes from parents who don't understand your side of the story. Instead of shouting, ""you don't know me at all!"" take some time to tell them where you are coming from. Lay out your side of the story in calm, rational steps -- it will be much harder for them to counter with anger if you're being reasonable. So stand up for yourself and let them know that there is an explanation.""I didn't know it looked like that. What I was actually doing...""
""I just want to share my side of the story first.""
""I see where you're coming from, but from my perspective...""

, Don't wait for your parents to hand down judgment on you. Be proactive and make suggestions, working together to find ways to avoid future fights. You want to show that you are a part of the conversation, and you care about making things right. Even if you think your parents are totally to blame, this is a great way to get them on your side. Remember to keep things nice, deflating any meanness before it starts. For example:


If you forgot to call them or stay in touch, offer to give up your phone for a week if you forget next time.
If they want you to do more chores around the house, come up with a list of chores you're willing to help out with, and when you can accomplish them each week.
If they are intervening with your personal life, ask if you can have your friend or new girl/boyfriend over for dinner or a movie so that they can meet them., In almost every situation a parent is not being intentionally mean. Instead, they are just trying to protect their child. Your parents love you, and their anger most likely comes from fear -- fear that you went missing, that you don't respect them or their wishes, that you aren't trying in school, etc. Once you acknowledge why a parent is being mean, it is much easier to calm them back down and make them happy again.Are your parents really being mean, or did they just make a decision you disagreed with? Similarly, are you being mean, or do your parents just disagree with your decisions? Think about this before losing your cool."

Know the symptoms of strep throat.,
Remember or learn what it feels like to have strep throat.,
Act distant to friends, family, and colleagues.,
Mention that you have the symptoms of strep throat before you actually “get sick.” By acting distant and then telling others that you have felt some symptoms of strep throat, you can more believably fake the illness the same day or even a few days later.,
Mention an outbreak of strep throat.,
Fight your fake symptoms before they turn into a full-blown case of strep throat.,
Have controllable symptoms.,
Avoid talking to show how much your throat hurts.,
Avoid talking about whatever commitment you don’t want to attend.,
Swallow slowly and show your pain.,
Gargle with salt water.,
Be tired, sluggish, and sad.,
Have a fever.,
Don’t eat a lot, especially heavy foods.,
Don’t overdo it with symptoms.,
Don’t let anyone seeing you out and about.,
Keep babying your throat.,
Don’t get back to regular activities right away.",How to Fake Strep Throat," Before you can fake strep throat, know what the symptoms are. This helps convince others that your illness is genuine.


The most typical symptoms of strep throat are throat pain, difficulty swallowing, red or swollen tonsils (if you have them), white patches or tiny red spots at the back of the mouth, and swollen or tender lymph glands in the neck.Less common symptoms are fever, headache, rash, fatigue, and stomachache.It’s possible to have these symptoms and not have strep throat. Only a doctor can actually confirm the diagnosis.;
, Recalling how you’ve felt when you’ve had strep throat in the past helps you to remember how to act when you’re faking it. If you’ve never had it, learn about what it feels like. Both are useful bits of information when you’re trying to convince others of your illness.


If you’ve never had strep throat, you can ask someone else how they have felt when they had it or you can research what it feels like.
Generally, it takes a couple of days for strep throat to become a full-blown case. Before you get to this stage where it can be too painful to swallow or talk or you see spots in your throat, you will often have a noticeable “tickle” in your throat. You will also likely have low-grade pain in your throat. Since no one can see or necessarily hear this, you can easily mention that you have these symptoms.

, By acting as if you’re too tired or not feeling well enough to concentrate on conversations or presentations, it will cue others that you may be sick or coming down with an illness.


If you want to avoid a commitment the day of the event, acting distant and lethargic will pave the way for you to say that you’re suffering from a sore or strep throat. This will make your illness seem more credible.

,


The best people to tell that you’re experiencing symptoms are: parents and siblings if you want to miss school; co-workers or your boss if you want to miss work; or friends if you’re trying to get out of a social engagement.
Bring up the symptoms subtly. Simply saying “I have these symptoms” could be a dead giveaway that you’re faking. Instead, clear your throat and say “Oh, I’ve noticed a tickle in the back of my throat” either today or in the past couple of days.

, After you’ve casually mentioned your symptoms, say “I hope I’m not getting the strep throat that is going around.” Making this claim, which no one can really verify, further validates your illness.


Strep throat is highly contagious, so it’s entirely possible that there could be an outbreak that infected you.Again, make sure to do this casually so it doesn’t appear you’re faking.
You can also reinforce your statement about the outbreak by saying something like “I hope I’m not getting the strep throat that is going around because I’m looking forward to a dinner with friends.”

, If you noticeably try to fight the fake symptoms of strep you mentioned, it convinces others of your illness and inability to attend whatever commitment you’re hoping to avoid.


Some good examples of ways to “fight” your symptoms are drinking tea with honey or sucking on throat lozenges to “soothe” your irritated throat, or even wrapping a scarf around your neck to keep your throat warm.
Gargle with salt water. This is one way to soothe an actual sore throat and will show that you’re trying to take care of your own irritated throat., It’s going to be difficult to fake swelling or spots in your throat, so stick to having symptoms that you can control like pain, fatigue, and fever.


It’s a good idea to not take anything that claims to give you the actual physical symptoms of strep throat. These could make you very sick.

, Someone with strep throat is usually in too much pain to talk a lot. If you reply to questions with head or hand gestures or even by writing notes, this helps convince people that your throat is too sore to talk.


It’s also advisable that when you do say something, not to say it too loudly or yell. Remember, you’re in too much pain to really even be talking. This can also be particularly effective if you’re looking to get out of a commitment on the same day.

, This is a dead giveaway that you’re probably not sick and trying to get out of something.

, This demonstrates that not only is your throat hurting so much it hurts to swallow, but also that you’re being careful to not further irritate it.Closing your eyes and lightly wincing when you do slowly swallow reinforces just how much your strep throat hurts., This is one way to soothe an actual sore throat and will show that you’re trying to take care of yourself., If you don’t show any energy or motivation to do things you normally like, this will show that you’re not feeling like your usual self.


Don’t be too sluggish. Showing general fatigue, such as not moving around much or not wanting to get out of bed other than to use the bathroom is plenty. It’s not a good idea to collapse or fall out of bed as it might end with an unwanted doctor’s visit.
If someone mentions that you’re missing a commitment, say something along the lines of “I’m sorry to miss school/ work today because we had a group lunch planned.”
Don’t smile too much or appear happy. Again, you’re feeling sick and want to convince others of this as well. Looking happy will make them question whether or not you’re really ill.

, It’s not easy to tell if someone has a fever unless it’s fairly high. Faking a fever will make it seem like you are sick.


Wrapping yourself in blankets will raise your body temperature slightly for the case that someone wants to take your temperature.
Lightly jogging in place will flush your skin and may cause you to sweat, making it appear as though you have a fever. Just make sure no one sees you jogging.
Spraying your face with a light mist is another option to show that your body is fighting a fever.

, If you’re eating a lot, especially of heavy foods that could irritate your throat further, it will cast doubt on to your illness.


Eat things like soup, bananas, yogurt, or other soft foods that won’t exacerbate your strep symptoms.
Drink soothing liquids like tea with honey or cold water.

, While you want to show that you have the symptoms of strep throat to legitimate your illness, going overboard with symptoms is likely to expose that you’re not actually sick.


For example, it’s impossible to have a temperature of 107 degrees Fahrenheit without being seriously ill or dead. Stay within real limits to avoid someone figuring out that you’re not really sick.

, Remember, you’re sick. By venturing out of the house, you open yourself up to questions about just how ill you are. The safest way to not get caught is to not leave the house.


This is especially true for any type of event like a play or even to go shopping. It could be very uncomfortable, for example, if you run into a colleague or your boss at the mall on a day you’ve called in sick. Likewise, attending a school play or sporting event on a day you’ve been home with strep throat also raises red flags.
If you go outside of your home, for example for food, and run into someone, then you can always say “I’m out to get medication. I ran out last night.”

, Strep throat doesn’t disappear from one day to the next, so it’s important to keep up appearances that you’re healing.


Don’t talk loudly or yell so that you don’t irritate your still sensitive throat.
Keep drinking soothing liquids like tea with honey or cool water. Likewise, using throat lozenges will reinforce that you’re still sick.

, Doing your regular activities, from going to the gym or having a wild dinner party, soon after you had strep throat isn’t a good idea because it will raise questions about why you could do these things but couldn’t come to work or school.


Slowly reintroduce your usual program. For example, if there’s a dinner the day after you get back to work, skip it and say “I’m still a bit under the weather so I’m going to pass this time.”

Common spaces may feel less safe, so go to your room if you can be alone. Lock the door if necessary. You may want to go to the bathroom if you share a room, or to another private area of the house to avoid abuse.

Look around for safe spaces within your own home. If one doesn’t work, try and find another one.
If at any point you fear for your safety, call emergency services or someone who can help you, like a friend or friend’s parent.;
, Find places outside of your home that feel safe. This might be your friend’s house, a basketball court, or skate park. Get involved in activities at school so that you can spend more time away from home.


Join after-school clubs or sports teams.

, If being around your parent makes you feel anxious or angry, try and find some calm. If you feel uncomfortable at your own home, it’s important to find ways to experience peace, even if it’s just for short periods of time. Try taking some deep breaths. Breathe from your belly (not your chest) and extend the length each breath. Take a few cycles of deep breathing to help you calm down.You can’t respond well if you’re panicking or anxious. If you need to get help or find a solution, take some deep breaths before you make a plan.

, If you know your parent is abusive when they drink or they say demeaning things when relatives are around, try and avoid these situations. While this can be difficult when you live in your parent’s house, notice if they get agitated or begin saying hurtful things. Find an excuse to get out of there.Try your best to avoid them if possible. If they have a daily schedule, know it and try your best not to be in the same area as them if you can.

, You don’t have to suffer alone. It can be relieving you have someone to confide in without worrying that your parent will find or get you into trouble. The abuse at home doesn’t have to remain a secret, even if your parents tell you not to tell.Find a friend you can trust or a coach or mentor.

, Talk to your school counselor or see about getting a therapist. It can be helpful to talk to someone who specializes in helping teens.A counselor can help you understand the abuse and find ways to respond or avoid it. They can also intervene (with either your parents or the police) if necessary.


A counselor is trained to support you and help you cope with your problems. Don’t be afraid to open up or tell them the truth.

, If you feel like you’re in danger or cannot take it any longer, tell an adult who’s in authority. This might be a teacher, school counselor, physician or pediatrician, nurse, child care provider, or law enforcement officer. These people are required to report suspected abuse to welfare services to be investigated. Telling one of these people means that someone will likely come and investigate.Making a report is serious. It could result in you living with someone other than your parent, such as a relative.

, Some support groups exist to help kids and teens deal with and recover from abuse at home.You might want to talk to a school counselor or therapist about finding a group you can join. It can help to meet others kids or teens who also have experienced emotional abuse to feel less alone.

A support group can help you feel supported in expressing your experiences without judgment. The other teens can give you advice and help when you need it.

, Depending on the type of abuse happening, you may be able to say something to your parents. Be clear in what you say and if possible, include examples. Avoid being abusive back to them by name-calling, yelling, or screaming. Instead, talk about your experience and how it affects you.For example, you might say, “I don’t know if you’re aware of how mean you get when you drink” or, “It doesn’t feel right to feel so humiliated. I don’t want to feel this way. Please speak more kindly to me.”

, It can be scary to stand up for yourself, but it abuse may never stop if you don’t say something. When your parent says something abusive to you or uses the silent treatment, calmly say what you want to or need to say.For example, say, “I know you don’t think I’m doing well in school, but there’s no need to call me names or make me feel bad. I am working hard.”
You can also say, “I know you’re mad at me, but we need to talk about it. I want to resolve this instead of ignore it.”
Always prioritize your safety. If you don't feel safe standing up for yourself or you think your parents might get violent with you, this might not be the best approach.

, You may want to talk about how the abuse makes you feel. For example, if you feel worthless or hopeless, express these things. They may not even know you feel this way or how their words affect you. You can have a discussion with your parents or respond after they make a comment. When you express yourself, use “I” statements and don’t point the finger back at them.For example, say, “I don’t like feeling blamed. Please don’t put that on me.”
Say, “ I feel so much pressure all around me and I can’t handle it. I feel sad that I can’t please you even though I want to.”

, Make sure there are people in your life who lift you up. These might be sports teammates, club members, or other friends at school or in your neighborhood. Choose people you can count on to be there for you and support you. When you need a friend or a listening ear, count on these people.In addition to peers, you can also include adults or mentors as part of your support.

, If you’ve dealt with your parent’s emotional abuse for years, it may take a toll on you and your own emotional health. Often, emotional abuse results in feeling bad about yourself or feeling worthless or unlovable.None of these things are true. To raise your self-esteem, notice your negative thoughts and try thinking more positively about yourself. Any time you catch yourself in a negative thought, try to come up with a positive thought about yourself.Try regularly doing things you enjoy. Maybe you enjoy sports, reading, dancing, or listening to music. Do more of these things.

, Even if your parents treat you poorly, you might still want to protect them by not telling anyone about the abuse. Maybe parts of you hate your parents and parts of you love them. It’s normal to have conflicting feelings, especially about your parents. However, this shouldn’t stop you from getting help or talking about it with someone you trust. You can still care about your parent and get help.

There may days you love your parents and days you hate them. Talk to someone about your feelings and know that it’s okay to feel this way.

, It is important to identify the things that help you express your emotions or take your mind off your pain. Try expressive activities such as writing, drawing, or singing. These activities should help you feel better and more at ease.Try doing relaxing activities, such as yoga or meditation.

, Journaling is a great way to understand and express your emotions. It can be confusing and difficult to deal with emotional abuse, especially if it happens in your own home. Perhaps you want to talk about it with someone but don’t know what to say. Keeping a journal can help you clarify your thoughts and feelings, understand yourself better, and identify what’s going on.If you’re using a journal in your healing process, it can help to know the various steps of your journey along the way.
If you talk about your parents in your journal, keep your journal in a safe place where it won’t be found. You might even want to use code words if you do fear it being found.

Share your experiences with friends and loved ones.,
Confide in a trusted adult.,
Seek mental health treatment.",How to Deal With Emotionally Abusive Parents1," It can be comforting to have someone to lean on during an abusive situation. Confide in your loved one and ask them for support. They may offer positive words, validate your feelings or have advice for you.For instance, you might say, ""I know this may come as a shock to you, but my home life is pretty bad. My mom talks down to me and tells me I won't be anything when I'm older. It's mainly words, but it makes me feel bad about myself.""
Keep in mind that emotional abuse often involves people brainwashing you into believing that no one will care, believe you, or take you seriously. However, you will likely be surprised by how much support you receive when you share with other people.;
, If you’re a kid dealing with any kind of abuse at home, turn to a relative, teacher, church leader, or another adult you trust. Don’t let your abusive parent intimidate you into keeping secrets. An adult can help intervene in a situation where a kid might not have any power.You might feel awkward or embarrassed about telling an adult what’s going on, but it’s very important to let other people know if you’re being abused. Start by saying something like, “I’ve been having some problems at home lately. Can I talk to you about it?”Or, you could write about how you are feeling if that feels more comfortable to you.
If you told a teacher or a coach and they did not help, schedule to meet with your school counselor and alert this person.If you don’t want to tell someone about the abuse in person, you can call a help line at 1-800-4-A-CHILD. This help line is free, confidential, and open 24 hours a day.

, Emotional abuse can do a lot of damage. Without treatment, you are at an increased risk of low self-esteem and you may have difficulty forming healthy relationships. It can be difficult to break the negative beliefs and thought patterns created by emotional abuse, but a counselor or therapist can help make the process easier.Look for a therapist who specializes in children or adults who are suffering abuse. During therapy you will share about your experiences as you become comfortable with the therapist. The therapist will ask questions and offer insights to help guide your sessions.
If you are a kid, consider that most schools offer free, confidential counseling services. Go to your school's counselor and say, ""There have been problems at my house. My dad doesn't actually hit me, but he calls me names and puts me down in front of other family members. Can you please help me?""
If you are an adult, check to see what your health insurance will cover.
Many therapists accept out-of-pocket payments on a sliding scale.

People with fevers have faces and foreheads that are usually hot, though they themselves feel cold. There are a number of ways to give yourself the appearance of a feverish face.


Take a hot shower without getting your hair wet.






Blow on your face with a blow dryer.






Rub water on your face to make it seem sweaty.






Heat your face for a few minutes with a heating pad or hot water bottle when no one is looking.






Rub your face vigorously with your hands.






Lay down on your back with your head hanging off the edge of your bed so that all the blood flows to it.







, They will make you sweat, but people will think you are cold too. Pretend to shiver, no matter how much you bundle yourself up. A cold sweat is one important symptom of a cold or fever.

, If a parent or nurse leaves you alone with a thermometer in your mouth, there are a few things you can do to give yourself an artificially high temperature. Just make sure you don't get it too high—it will either be obvious that you faked the results or they will take you to the doctor or hospital to treat your dangerously high temperature.


Drink hot water before putting the thermometer in your mouth.






Touch the thermometer to a hot light bulb for a second.






Shake the thermometer vigorously by the metal tip. This will push the mercury out towards the high end of the thermometer. Of course, this doesn't work with digital thermometers.

Display a decline in appetite.,
Occasionally rub your stomach.,
Keep a bowl or bucket by you.,
Spend a lot of time in the bathroom.,
Pretend to throw up.",How to Fake Symptoms of Being Sick3," Only pick at your food, and avoid finishing even things that you usually like.

, Do this with an uncomfortable look on your face. You don't have to say anything at first, but do mention your stomach (or if you are a small kid, your tummy) if someone asks you what is wrong.

, Even if you never use it, this implies that you are on the verge of throwing up. Once in a while pick it up and stare into it with disconcert, as though hit by a wave of nausea.

, Whether from vomiting or diarrhea, people make frequent and long trips to the bathroom when sick to their stomach. You don't need to make a spectacle out of it, but rushing to the bathroom a few times an hour will definitely get noticed.

, Run into the bathroom and make a loud heaving, retching noise, then dump a glass of water into the toilet and flush. Repeat a couple times, then take a minute to ""wash up"" before walking out looking miserable.


Most of the time people won't want to see your vomit, so this sound performance should be enough. You can also make fake vomit and pour it in the toilet while you pretend to throw up.
If you are eating soup, put broth in your mouth and pretend like you swallowed it. Then make your cheeks wide, like you brought the broth back up, and run to the bathroom to spit it in the toilet.

Breathe only through your mouth.,
Shiver and pretend that you are freezing.,
Fake sneezing or coughing.,
Apply a small amount of toothpaste onto your bottom eyelids to make your eyes watery.",How to Fake Symptoms of Being Sick4," It's tough to fake a runny nose if you don't have one, but you can fake being stuffed up. Breathe only through your mouth and talk a little slower. Sniffle occasionally with short inward sniffs.

, Wear many layers of clothing or curl up under several blankets. Take an icy cold shower to make your skin chilly to the touch.

, This is a risky move. Either of these, if done unconvincingly, can let on that you aren't actually sick. Faking a cough is definitely easier than faking a sneeze, but even that can sound forced if you aren't careful.


You could also make yourself sneeze, by sniffing pepper. For some sleight of hand, sprinkle pepper in a sweater and pretend to rub your nose on it. Sniff in the pepper to make yourself sneeze.

, Make sure it's near but not in your eyes. Leave the toothpaste on for about three minutes to make your eyes feel like they're burning.

"
Make your voice sound different.,
Play up how contagious you are.,
Cough or sneeze.,
Fake the sounds of vomit.,
Don't overdo it.",How to Fake Symptoms of Being Sick5," If you need to call your boss to take off work, you need to sound the part to avoid suspicion.


Speak slightly slower. Pause occasionally for a second in the middle of your sentences. Don't be too quick to answer. Remember, you are sick and sluggish.






Try to breathe through your mouth to sound like you have a stuffed up nose.

, Your boss might not care how you feel, but if you are going to get the rest of your coworkers sick that's another matter. Mention that you think you caught your illness from someone else. Explain that you are coughing or sneezing and your nose is running all over the place.

, Don't do this directly into the phone—you don't do that in real life, do you? Hold the phone a reasonable distance away from you and cough or sneeze loudly. Then apologize and continue the conversation.

, Pour one or two large glasses of water and make your call while sitting by the toilet. If you really need to sound sick, stop in the middle of talking to make a retching and gurgling noise and pour the glass of water. That should simulate the sounds of throwing up., One of the quickest ways to arouse suspicion is to ham it up. If you can just ask to take a sick day without giving too many details, you are less likely to get caught in your web of lies.

Make a list of reasonable, actionable requests.,
Find a quiet place to talk to your parents.,
Let them know how their behavior makes you feel.,
Stay engaged in the conversation, even if it gets heated.,
Make smart, realistic goals for all of you to reach for.,
Keep communicating, working together to build respect, each day.",How to Deal With Mean Parents2," Simply telling your parents, ""you are being mean to me,"" will accomplish very little. You need to have specifics on hand in order to make real change possible. Spend some time asking yourself -- what exactly makes my parents mean? What can we do to change things for the better?


Do not think about this as a list of demands. You don't want your parents to feel like hostages.
Think of a reason for each request. Let them know that a nickname they use hurts your feelings, or that you don't have time to clean your room because of homework and sports.

, Once you have calmed down, you should let your parents know that you need to talk to them about something important. Find a quiet place in your house where you can be alone and a time that works for your schedules, giving yourself at least an hour to talk.


""I was wondering if we could have a talk in the living room alone after dinner.""
""I have something that I really need to get off my chest.""

, They may not be aware that they are coming off as mean. Telling them how you feel may be enough to make them reflect on their own behavior and find ways to fix it. Be honest, open, and specific, using stories from the past to show them that this isn't just in your imagination.


If you want them to listen, you need to be willing to listen as well. You may be surprised -- your parents may have similar feelings about you.
Don't be accusatory or mean to them -- this will put them on the defensive and make them even meaner or angrier.

, Nod along while they are talking, keep your arms and legs uncrossed, and make eye contact with your parents while they are talking. Using your body language to let them know you are listening will encourage them to talk and make you seem cooperative and calm. Looking engaged will help you seem mature and reasonable.


Don’t sigh or use gestures that show that you are frustrated.
Don’t fold your arms or legs-- this makes you appear closed off.
Don’t doodle, look down at your hands, or fidget with something while they talk. Give them your full attention.

, Once you've let your parents know how you feel, hit them with your requests. Let them know that you want to develop these together and that you appreciate their input. If you have solid, real goals to work on it will be much easier to see real progress -- and point out if your parents are not following through on their promises.If you want more free time with friends, offer to only go out once your homework/chores are done.
If think you do too much work around the house, show them your schedule and offer to carve out specific hours to do their yard work.

, One conversation will not change your entire relationship. This will be an ongoing process, so be sure to keep checking in with your parents. Remind them of your promises, and hold up your end of the bargain to ensure that they hold up theirs.


Revisit the conversation 1-2 months down the line. If things are going well, thank your parents for their support and respect-- positive reinforcement will work wonders."

Get inside of your parent's perspective.,
Stay calm and respectful, even when they are mean.,
Offer a buffer of positivity.,
Build a supportive group of friends outside of your house.,
Know when normal parenting crosses the line into parental abuse.",How to Deal With Mean Parents3," Try to be open to the way your parents feel about the situation and the reasons they have. More likely than not, you are not the only reason why your parents are acting mean. Just like you they have their own stresses, worries, and relationships to manage, and it is inevitable that some of these tension may boil over onto you. This is just part of being a family.Are there ways to help your parents deal with their stress? Maybe doing 1-2 extra chores will ultimately help them relax and make everyone happier.
Are your parent's concerns or ""meanness"" really a big deal in the grand scheme of things? Are they just in a bad mood because of work, or are they truly cruel?
Outside of small incidents, ask yourself if your parents otherwise support, love, and care for you? All parents can get a little angry, but this doesn't mean they hate you.

, If you jump into a fight every time you believe your parents are being mean, you'll just keep the cycle of anger turning. Everyone has tough days, gets into a grumpy mood, and mistakenly thinks someone hurt them. If you lash out at your parents every time they seem angry you'll just develop a pattern of meanness. Instead, just be yourself and pick your battles wisely.


Go off by yourself for a few minutes if you're upset. Chances are good that, in private, you'll both forget about why you're angry., Be the happy one in your household. Having this aura of positive, supportive thinking is infectious, and is proven to prevent bullying and anger from most people.All it requires are a few simple things:


Thank your parents daily for something. A dinner, a vacation plan, a new softball glove -- all that matters is your gratitude.
Let your parents know that you love them. A simple but thoughtful card on their birthdays, a quick hug before school, a brief ""I love you"" before bed here and there -- these little things add up and diffuse meanness better than anything else.
Apologize when you mess up. Get in front of their anger and own up to your mistake. If you take charge of the situation you give them fewer chances to get angry., If are any church groups, clubs, sports, support groups, etc. that your friends do or that you are interested in, you should find out when they meet and ask your parents if you can go. If you have a friend that goes to the group, ask your friend if you can go with them. These kinds of organizations can help you form a positive identity and purpose outside of your family.Getting out of the house is a great way to diffuse tension between parents and children. You have your own life to live, and don't need them to do everything for you.

, The vast majority of parents would never dream of abusing their child, and the majority of disciplining, arguing, and punishment is not child abuse. However, you should talk to a guidance counselor, social service worker, or call 1-800-4-A-Child immediately if you experience:Constant belittling, bullying, name-calling, or verbal cruelty
Feelings of horror or extreme terror in the presence of your parent(s)
Feeling violated or unsafe.
Beatings, attacks, or serious threats.

Try talking to your parents.,

Try bringing in an outside party.,
Don't go behind your parents' backs.",How to Deal With Annoying Parents1," If your parents don't like your friends, you've probably tried talking to them already, but it's important to keep a line of dialogue open about important issues.Don't use sarcasm. Being sarcastic or otherwise mean to your parents will quickly derail the conversation.Remain calm, and don't get mad. Not only will this help you have a longer, more in-depth conversation, it will show your parents that you are capable of maturity, which can go a long way in trying to earn more independence.Let your parents finish what they have to say, and don't interrupt them. When it's your turn to talk, ask them to be respectful and allow you to speak without being interrupted.;
, If you've tried talking and your parents still don't approve of a friend or group of friends, try letting them all meet. Your parents might have an unrealistic impression of what kind of person your friend is, and letting them all talk and get to know one another can help your parents see why you value that person's friendship.Ask your parents if you can invite your friend over to your house for dinner with the family. Let them know that you're not trying to disrespect them or their wishes, but that you feel like meeting your friend might relieve some of their fears or concerns.Encourage your friend to be on his or her best behavior. Ask your friend to use pleasantries that your parents will appreciate, like asking, ""Hello, how are you?"" or saying, ""You have a beautiful home.""Facilitate a conversation between your parents and your friend to help your family see why that friendship is important to you. If your friend is creative/artistic or has some other talents, bring it up during dinner, and ask your friend to tell your parents about any projects or creative endeavors.Offer to let your parents meet your friend's parents. They might be able to talk as one adult to another, and may find some understanding that wouldn't come from a parent/child conversation.

, If you haven't had any luck talking with your parents about an issue like your choice in friends, it may be helpful to bring in an outside party. Someone outside your immediate family may be able to help moderate the conversation and facilitate a more open dialogue between you and your parents.Ask a relative outside your immediate family to help you talk to your parents. If no one in your family would be a good fit for this role, consider asking a guidance counselor or social worker at school., If your parents simply don't like your friend and forbid you from seeing her, don't sneak around behind your parents' backs. Your parents will eventually find out, and they will likely revoke whatever freedom they had previously been giving you.If your parents forbid you to see a friend, try talking to them about their concerns. You've probably had some kind of conversation about it before, but ask them to address what specifically they are worried about. Try to calm those fears or concerns as best you can.Don't sneak around behind your parents' backs if they've forbidden you from seeing a friend. It's frustrating and it may not seem fair, but going against your parents' demands will further strain your relationship with them, and they may end up revoking certain liberties or independence that they were previously giving you."

Apologize and exit.,
Make light of the situation.,
Give a lame excuse.",How to Deal With Catching Your Parents Having Sex1," In this scenario, you are the intruder. Whether you came home too early, or you didn't knock, knocked and walked right in- you are the one ""disturbing.""


Stay calm and take a deep breath. Figure out your exit strategy- how far is the door, and how silent can you get to it?
Make a quiet exit. If they haven't noticed you, because they are so-ahem- engaged in action, get out as quiet and as fast as you can.
Never, ever mention what you saw or did, and move on with your life.;
, If they've noticed you, the imperative is still to remove yourself physically from the situation as soon as possible.


Say ""I am sorry"" and be out of there.
Act normal the next time you see your parents- and block any attempt of theirs to talk about what you've seen with a friendly ""It's none of my business"" or ""That was your private time.""
Don't ever bring up the incident- they'll be grateful.

, This depends on the relationship you have with your parents and might not work for everybody.


Smile, and say ""Hey, at least it's not the plumber, Mom"" or something along these lines.
Be prepared to have something thrown at you, and leave the room.
Don't mention the incident ever again.

, This is also only an option if for whatever reason you cannot immediately remove yourself from the situation.


Tell them you were looking for socks, wanted to ask them for cash etc.

Refuse to engage with verbal abuse.,
Achieve financial independence.,
Consider cutting ties.,
Protect your children.",How to Deal With Emotionally Abusive Parents2," Don't stick around when they start abusing you. You are under no obligation to stay, call, visit, or otherwise expose yourself to abuse. Don't let your parents guilt you into thinking you need to take their bad treatment. Set boundaries and stick to them.Stop coming over or calling if they abuse you.
If you live with them, retreat to your room or go to a friend's house if they are yelling at you or insulting you.
Set limits if you do stay in touch. Say, ""I will call you once a week, but I will hang up if you say cruel things to me.""
Keep in mind that you do not need to get involved in an argument if you do not want to. You don’t have to respond to what they say or try to defend yourself in any way.

, Don't live with an emotionally abusive parent, and don't give them any power over you. Abusers often try to maintain control by creating dependence. Earn your own money, make your own friends, and live on your own. Don't depend on abusive parents for anything.

Get an education if you can. You might look into how you can apply for federal student loans without your parents. This usually requires some type of documentation from a mental health professional stating that your parents were abusive.
Move out as soon as you are financially able.
If you can't afford to get through college without living with or relying on abusive parents financially, make sure to take care of yourself and draw boundaries.

, You may feel obligated to fulfill a notion of duty to your parents. However, if your parents have abused you, you might find it triggering to care for them when they have been emotionally abusive, especially if the abusive behavior has continued. Consider cutting ties if your relationship is more painful than it is loving.You don't owe a debt of care to those who have abused you.
If community members do not understand why you have cut ties with your parents, you don't owe an explanation.
""Closure"" is not always possible in conversation with an abusive parent. If you don't want to be in touch but fear missing the chance for ""closure,"" ask yourself: have they shown that they are willing to listen? Do they acknowledge my feelings? If not, you may be better off without any contact.
If you decide to become your parents’ caregiver at some point, focus your discussions only on their care. If they become verbally abusive or insulting, then leave right away to make it clear that you will not tolerate this type of behavior.

, Do not put your kids through the same abuse that you were put through. If your parents say inappropriately critical or insulting things to your children, intervene. Either end the conversation or cut off visits.

You can end the conversation by saying, ""We don't talk to Eli that way. If you have an issue with the way he eats, you can talk to me about it."" Although most adult conversations should be conducted in private, it is important for your children to see and hear you protect them in the case of abuse.
Your children will likely have a happier childhood if they are not subjected to abuse by their grandparents.

Dodge your abuser's triggers.,
Find safe places in your house.,
Create a safety plan.,
Spend time with people who make you feel good about yourself.,
Set personal boundaries with your parents.,
Learn stress management skills.,
Define and focus on your positive traits.",How to Deal With Emotionally Abusive Parents3," You probably already recognize the 'triggers' (things said or done) that really set your parents off. If you recognize them, it may be easier for you to either avoid them or get out of the way in time to dodge abuse. One way to do this is to talk with a friend or journal about it so that you can identify contributing factors to their abuse.


For instance, if your mother always yells at you when she has been drinking, try to get out of the house as soon as you see her with a bottle.
If your father tries to diminish your accomplishments when you've achieved something, refrain from telling him about your successes. Instead, tell people who support you.

, Find areas (such as your bedroom) that act as safe havens. Find another place to hang, get stuff done, and spend your time, such as a library or a friend's house. Not only can you get support from your friends at this time, but you're also away from your parents' accusations and scorn.

Although it is smart to protect yourself from the abuse, you also need to recognize that it's not your fault if you do get caught in it. No matter what you say or do, it is no excuse for a parent to abuse you emotionally.

, Just because the abuse is not physical does mean it can't escalate. Develop a plan to keep yourself safe in the case that your parent's abuse turns physical and you think that your life is at risk.


A safety plan involves having a place to go that is secure, having someone to call for help, and knowing how to take legal action against your parent if it comes to that. You might sit down with another adult like your school counselor and put together a plan that helps you feel prepared in case of a crisis.A safety plan may also involve keeping your cell phone charged and nearby you at all times and your car keys on you.

, Healthy self-esteem is the best antidote for emotional abuse. Unfortunately, people who have been emotionally abused often have a negative view of themselves, and they also often find themselves in relationships with emotionally abusive people. To fight low self-esteem, spend time around friends, non-abusive family members, and other people who build you up instead of tearing you down.You can also build your self-esteem by participating in activities that you are good at. Take part in a sport or youth group at school or in your community. This will serve double-duty by making you feel better about yourself and getting you out of the house more.

, It’s your right to set boundaries in your relationships. If you feel safe doing so, sit down with your emotionally abusive parent and tell them which behaviors you’re comfortable with and which you’re not.When you explain your boundaries, decide what the consequences will be if your parent ignores them. Certain kinds of abusers may not respect your personal limits. If this happens to you, don’t feel guilty about following through with your consequences.It is important to follow through with your consequences because making empty threats will only undermine your credibility with the abuser.
For example, you might say, “Mom, if you come home drunk and start bullying me again, I will go and live with grandma. I want to stay with you, but your behavior frightens me.”

, No doubt about it – emotional abuse can generate a lot of stress, and sometimes it can cause long-term problems like PTSD and depression. Develop an arsenal to help you manage this stress with positive activities.


Healthy stress management habits like meditation, deep breathing, and yoga can help you feel calmer and more collected on a day-to-day basis. If your symptoms are severe, seeing a therapist can be a good way to learn how to manage your stress and other emotions., No matter what an emotionally abusive parent might have told you, you are a worthwhile person with good qualities. Don't listen to their insults and ridicule. You may have to think on this for a while, but it’s important for you to build up your self-esteem and pour love into yourself—especially if you are not getting this from a parent.


Consider what you like about yourself – are you a good listener? Generous? Intelligent? Focus on the things you like about yourself, and remind yourself that you are worthy of love, respect, and care.Be sure to engage in activities you are passionate about and/or good at to help boost your self-esteem and confidence.

Consider whether you frequently get the silent treatment.,
Think about whether your parent seems to have your best interests at heart.,
Recognize normal parenting behavior.",How to Deal With Emotionally Abusive Parents4," Emotional abuse can occur in any family. However, there are a few factors that increase the risk of emotional or physical child abuse. The children of parents who abuse alcohol or drugs, have untreated mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder or depression, or were abused as children themselves are at a higher risk for becoming victims of abuse.Many abusive parents don’t even realize their actions are hurtful. They may not know a better style of parenting, or they may not realize that taking out their emotions on their child is abusive.
Even if your parent has good intentions, they can still be abusive.

, The abuser might try to pass it off as a joke, but this type of abuse is no laughing matter. If your parent frequently makes fun of you, belittles you in front of other people, or dismisses your ideas or concerns, you are in an emotionally abusive situation.For example, if your dad says, ""You're such a loser. I swear, you can't do anything right,"" this is verbal abuse.
Your parent may do this in isolation or in front of others, causing you to feel bad about yourself.

, If your parent tries to control every little thing you do, gets angry when you make your own decisions, or dismisses your abilities and autonomy, their behavior is an indicator of an abusive situation.


People who engage in this type of abuse often treat their victims like inferiors who are incapable of making good choices or taking responsibility for themselves.Your parent may try to make decisions for you. For instance, your mom could might visit your high school and ask your guidance counselor about a college you didn't want to apply to.
Your parent may feel strongly that they are just ""parenting,"" but this is abusive.

, Some abusers have unrealistically high expectations of their victims, but refuse to admit any wrongdoing themselves.


People who engage in this kind of abuse may find ways to blame you for anything and everything, even things no reasonable person would criticize you for. They may tell you that you’re the cause of their problems so they can avoid taking responsibility for themselves and their feelings.They also hold you personally responsible for their emotions.
For instance, if your mother blames you for being born because she had to abandon her singing career, she is blaming you for something that wasn't your fault.
If your parents say their marriage fell apart ""because of the kids,"" that's blaming you for their inability to cope.
Blaming someone for things they didn't do is an abusive technique.

, Parents who pull away from their children and don’t provide them with the emotional closeness they need are engaging in a form of child abuse.


Does your parent ignore you when you’ve done something to upset them, show little interest in your activities and emotions, or try to play it off as your fault when they distance themselves from you?Love and affection aren't things you should have to bargain for. This is abusive.

, Some parents, especially those with narcissistic tendencies, may see you as only an extension of themselves. It’s impossible for parents like this to want what is best for you, even if they themselves believe they have your best interests at heart.


Some signs of narcissistic parenting include disrespecting your boundaries, trying to manipulate you into doing what they believe is “best,” and getting upset when you don’t live up to their unrealistic expectations for you.They are also often very uncomfortable with you having attention and will try to make everything about themselves.
Your single parent may guilt-trip you, for example, by saying ""Well, I know you had a party to go to with your friends, but I'm so lonely here. You are always leaving me."" This guilt-trip is a form of abuse.

, Kids and teens make mistakes sometimes; it's a part of growing up and being human. During times when you need guidance, support, or discipline, it's your parent's job to step in. It's important to be able to distinguish between what's natural disciplining and abusive behavior.


In general, you can tell whether a parenting style is disciplining versus abuse from the level of anger exhibited by your parent. It's common for your parent to get angry or frustrated in the moment when you do something that breaks the rules.
However, when anger is driving the behavior or punishment, your parent is in the danger zone of abuse. Abuse involves words or actions that are done recklessly, knowingly, and with the intent to harm.Although you may not like strict disciplining, understand that parents enforce guidelines and set consequences to protect you and steer you towards positive development.
You can try taking a look at some of your peers who have good relationships with their parents. What are those relationships like? What kind of support and discipline do they receive from their parents?

Getting angry will only make things worse for everyone.Take a deep breath and consider your words before you speak. This will help you remain calm and will prevent you from saying something you don't actually mean (and may regret later).

, If your parents disapprove of your partner, you and your parents probably both have a lot to say to one another. It's important that you listen openly to one another, and try to address the specific concerns your parents have with honest and respectful answers.Try to be an active listener. Don't just plan what you're going to say.

Encourage your parents to be polite to your partner as well.Facilitate a conversation that lets your parents see what you find interesting and likable about your partner. Ask your partner to tell your parents about things he is interested in, and see if they can find some common ground., If you go behind your parents' backs, they will eventually find out. Keeping big secrets, like hiding a relationship that your parents don't approve of, will only strain your relationship with your parents.Keeping your relationship a secret creates a time bomb between you and your parents.
Keeping your relationship a secret is also unfair to your partner. Your secrecy might imply to your partner that you are ashamed of your relationship., If your parents still don't approve of your partner, it's important that you avoid taking sides. If you side with your parents, you will hurt your partner's feelings. But if you side with your partner, your parents may get upset or angry. The best way to deal with this situation is to try and reach some kind of responsible compromise that will let everyone be happy.Ask your parents what their specific concerns are. Then try to work out some way that would allow you to be with your partner while proving to your parents that they can trust you.

Point out prying behavior.,
Calm your prying parent's fears.,
Offer some kind of compromise.,
Create an open dialogue.",How to Deal With Annoying Parents3," Many parents are overly invasive because they fear that not knowing what their children are up to will result in poor decisions that may harm the child. But the reality is that prying behavior only makes children exclude parents even more.If your parents are overly invasive, you may need to point out how harmful this behavior can be.


Let a prying parent know that children tend to resent prying parents, and that prying behavior can be highly damaging to a parent/child relationship., If your parent is invading your privacy, it's most likely because he's concerned about your safety and wellbeing.The best thing you can do is address this behavior and let your parent know he doesn't need to worry.


If you have a prying parent, ask him what his fears are.
Ask your parent whether your behavioral history suggests that you would engage in bad behavior. Let your parent know that you would like him to trust you more.

, Try talking to your parent about your concerns with regards to your privacy, and offer a compromise. If your parent is willing to respect your privacy, offer to be more forthcoming about what's going on in your life. Most children who are given a healthy degree of privacy end up naturally feeling more comfortable talking to their parents and disclosing personal information to parents anyway.Ask him whether he would be more or less willing to share things with you if you violated his privacy.
Try to keep your parent filled in on what's going on in your life. There is a good chance that your parent will be less intrusive if you let him in to some degree., The best way to address prying behavior is by asking your parents to respect your privacy, and by letting them into your life. Talk to your parents everyday, and let them feel included in your life.Find little things to talk about everyday. Tell your parents how school is going, and ask them about their day at work.Choose a time to talk when both you and your parents won't be distracted with other things, like watching TV or making dinner. Long drives in the car are a good time to initiate a conversation, or after dinner when you are all relaxing together.Be respectful by making eye contact and avoiding sarcastic or rude remarks during the conversation."

Be patient with unsolicited advice.,
Talk calmly with the person giving advice.,
Ask for trust and respect.",How to Deal With Annoying Parents4," Whether you are dealing with your own parents, a spouse's parents, or the parents of one of your students, you may at some point be given unsolicited advice. If this happens, it's important to restrain your frustration and refrain from getting angry.


If you are getting unwanted advice from a spouse's parents, talk to your spouse. It's best if your spouse addresses his or her own parents, rather than you telling them to stop.Remember that unsolicited advice is, at heart, an effort at showing concern., If you're getting unwanted advice from your parents or from a student's parents, you may need to communicate (calmly) that you feel frustrated by the constant advice.


Politely tell the parent that you understand he means well, but that constantly giving unsolicited advice makes you feel threatened in some ways.Bring the subject up when you're both calm and when you both have time to sit and talk.

, Once you've addressed the unsolicited advice you've been getting, you'll need to make your request for the advice to stop.


Ask the parent to trust you and respect you enough to make your own decisions. Let him know that you share his concerns and will work toward the same goals, but that you need the freedom to do it in your own way."
"
Listen to your parents' fears.,
Calm your parents' anxieties.,
Address pushy behavior.,
Suggest better boundaries.",How to Deal With Annoying Parents5," Anxiety and fear can make people think in very irrational ways. One of the best ways to approach a pushy or overly-involved parent is by listening to his concerns and trying to assuage them.Let your parent feel validated. Listen to his concerns, and let him fully explain himself before you respond.Once a person has had the opportunity to vent, he is more likely to be willing to listen and compromise., Once you've listened to your parent's fears or anxieties you will need to address the things he is worried about. Acknowledge each concern or fear that your parent has, and offer ways to address those concerns.Offer alternatives to being pushy or overly involved. Some parents behave this way because they feel insecure about their role as parents.Suggest other ways to get involved, like taking an interest in your hobbies, or spending more time together on weekends.

, Some people call them ""helicopter parents,"" while others simply call them pushy and demanding. It can be difficult to deal with pushy parents, but it's important to remember that your parents are pushy because they care about you, and what you interpret as pushiness is their effort at expressing it.Let your parents know that you understand they have your best interests at heart.
Gently point out bad behavior. Even the best, most responsible parents may have moments of frustration. Many parents become pushy in the heat of the moment.In these cases, the parent may not even realize that he is becoming pushy or demanding, and is probably overcome with emotion.
Try saying something like, ""I know you're upset, and I completely understand. But let's find a way to deal with this together, in a respectful manner.""

, Many children who have pushy parents feel like they can't make their own choices, or can't work on issues in a way that will be most helpful to them.If you're having problems with your parents, try setting up healthy boundaries so that everyone is happy.


Encourage a pushy parent to let you make independent choices. This boils down to a matter of trust, and you may want to remind your parents that they will need to trust you to make your own decisions at some point in life.Remind the parent that judgment and decision-making skills need to be developed throughout life.You may want to say something like, ""If you want me to be able to make my own successful decisions later in life, shouldn't you start teaching me how to actually make my own decisions now? I need that freedom in order to learn.""

Avoid the sounds.,
Give them a polite hint.,
Give them rather direct hints.,
Ask whether you could move into a different room.,
Talk to them.",How to Deal With Catching Your Parents Having Sex2," This is a short term, immediate solution. If the problem persists, think about how to avoid it in the long run.


Use earplugs and headphones to drown out the sounds.
Soundproof your room. This is a long term solution, but it doesn't always have to be expensive.
Move your furniture- it does make a difference whether your bed is right next to their bedroom wall, or across the room. If possible, put a bookshelf to the shared wall.
Listen to your own music- whales songs are very effective, as the sonar sounds drown out a lot of moans and sighs. Alternatively, didgeridoo or vuvuzela sounds also drown out most other sounds.
Buy a white noise machine.These devices produce different kind of noises, and are designed to drown out other sounds to protect privacy- your parents' and yours. , They may not even be aware that they can be heard. You giving them a subtle hint will make them aware and prevent further ""noise disturbances.""


Send them a text message. Be subtle in approach and vague. For example, just type the word ""Noise."" They will not read the message until later, but they might take more precaution the next time (because chances are, there will be a next time).
Print out an advice column on ""how to deal with overhearing your parents having sex"" and slide it under their door. Again, they will find it later, but it will make them aware of the situation.
Don't mention the incident afterwards. Pretend that nothing happened, and put it behind you.

, If they don't understand the polite hints you've been giving them, try a more straightforward approach.


Walk past their room shouting ""you're not alone in this house""- the reversal of roles in the admonishment that most of us received as children puts a humorous spin on the situation and hopefully relaxes it.
Play songs that tell them that you can hear them at full volume, such as ""Let's talk about sex"" by Salt N' Pepa,or the Bloodhound Gang's ""The Bad Touch.""Bang on the wall, preferably with a broom or a stick. This is maybe not the most subtle method, but they'll get the drift.

, This is a long term solution, but it depends on whether there are other rooms free in the house and other practicalities.


Pick the basement, attic or any room as far as possible removed from their room.
Smile and tell them, ""we're all grown up now, and everybody deserves privacy."" Not only is this an indirect way to tell them what you've heard, it also protects your privacy in the future- if you can hear them, that means that they can hear you and your new girlfriend/boyfriend.

, Only resort to this if there is truly no other option- you can't move rooms, they haven't understood the hints you gave them, and you truly see no other option.


Prepare for awkward silences- nobody wants to be confronted by their own child about their sex life.
Be calm, mature and friendly.
Tell them calmly, that some of their private activities are not so private thanks to noises and that you'd prefer not to be a witness.
Change the subject immediately, and even leave the room- really, there is nothing to ""discuss"", and your parents will be eternally grateful to offer them an ""out.""

Prepare to sacrifice your weekend.,
Start faking your sickness on either the later night hours of Saturday or the early morning hours of Sunday.,
Start by complaining of pain in your stomach or saying that you have a headache.,
Say that you had a nightmare.,
Say you have a mild headache, but don't over-do it or your parents will suspect you of needing medicine and some of the side-effects in medicines honestly will affect you in a bad way if you take them when you're not sick.

,
Hint at the fact that you shouldn't go to school, saying something like, ""How am I going to write with this headache?"",
If your parents know you are notorious for faking sickness, you will have to be very smart and convincing about doing this.,
Hopefully, after at least a day of being ""sick"", your parents will let you stay home.,
Remember not to get ""better"" too quickly or your parents will suspect you just wanted the day off.,
Also remember to fake a fever.,
try to make your face look pale.,
Act like you have no appetite.,
Act like you are cold.,
Don't get up and walk around a lot.,
Be very clever and intelligent about this.,
Think about possible things your parents could do.,
Try making fake vomit or diarrhea.,
Be loud during the night.,
Don't try too hard to convince them you're sick.,
Say that you feel slightly dizzy whenever you get up.,
Do something to make yourself cold so that you will get goosebumps.,
Go to bed late on Sunday night.,
Go toilet a lot.",How to Fake Sickness on the Weekend and Avoid Going to School," Obviously, if you are faking sick on the weekend so you can avoid going to school on Monday, you will be busy faking sick and won't have much time to do the things you enjoy. If there's something you definitely want to do, try to squeeze it in quickly before faking your ""sickness"".;
, Either way, both are a perfect choice. If you start the sickness too early on Saturday, you will have to keep up the masquerade all weekend and Monday, and it will be very hard and your chances of succeeding in fooling your parents that you're sick will be limited and slim.

, Make sure it is something that you don't get often, because if you have faked sick before and used the same excuse too many times, don't try it again or your parents will become suspicious of whether you are really sick or not. If you choose to start the ""sickness"" faking in the night hours of Saturday, go to your parents' room at roughly 11:00pm or 1:00am, or any time between those two, maybe a bit later, and complain of whatever sickness it is you're using.

, Your parents, if they are the sort that try to convince you, ""it was just a dream, there's no monsters"", you are likely to be tucked back into your own bed, but if your parents understand how freaked out you get after nightmares, they'll probably let you stay in their room until the night is over. If they do this, say that you feel like you're going to vomit and go and get a bucket, bowl or plastic bag for you to ""vomit"" in. This way, your parents will think that you really are sick and won't suspect you of going to so much trouble simply to fake sickness.

,, or ""How will I get through P.E. feeling so sick?"" but make sure you only point out things they know you enjoy doing.

, Also, remember to delete your computer's internet history or else your parents will definitely send you to school Monday.

, Beware, though, you also must sacrifice your Monday and be ""sick"" for the whole of that day.

, Also remember to be very, very convincing that you are sick because Monday is the day most kids choose to fake sickness, because they want an extra day off and are not ready for the weekend to end.

, Stay under the covers a lot and breathe on your hands, then rub them on your face, but if a thermometer is involved, try breathing on it behind your parents' backs, but if it becomes too hot your parents will suspect you of being seriously ill and needing the hospital, or they will know you are faking sickness and had breathed on the thermometer.

, Find something like baby powder and put it all over your face, then wash all off but it will leave a slightly pale effect. If you are pale, your parents will be more likely to believe that you're sick.

, Don't eat anything that's offered to you, but if you do accept it only pick off a little bit and chew it slowly to show that you've lost your appetite and definitely are sick. If your parents are insistent on you eating something, tell them ""I'm not hungry!"" but not too rudely or loudly. They might reconsider your ""sickness"" if you have the energy to be yelling and objecting.

, Ask for covers and fake sleeping. If you tend to twitch a lot when you fake sleeping, pull the covers right over you. Your parents are likely, though, to peer into the covers and see how you're doing. Some tips to making sure you fool them into thinking you're really sleeping are:


Don't move a lot. When they're not looking, if you're uncomfortable move slightly. Only move about every 20 minutes or so. If you keep tossing and turning, they're going to know for sure that you're not actually sleeping and are faking.
Stay still. Breathe calmly and casually, like you normally would if you were really asleep or very relaxed. This way they'll think you're deeply sleeping and your body is working on getting you better from your ""sickness"".
When you wake up from your ""sleeping"", remember to make sounds like you're sick and uncomfortable. Say something like ""ow"", which will definitely spark your parents' interest and they will likely ask, ""What's wrong?"" or think to themselves that you can't go to school on Monday.

, Definitely don't do anything you enjoy doing, because not doing it will convince your parents that you're sick if you're turning down one of your favourite things/hobbies to do. Also remember to work hard and go to a lot of trouble to fake your ""sickness"". Your parents will never suspect you of faking sickness if you go to a lot of trouble to convince them you're sick.

, There are many dangers and cautions involving this. You should also remember that your parents might just have a trick up their sleeves to catch you out in the act of faking sickness. If you honestly are hungry, you should eat something when your parents aren't going to notice, but this is also a possible danger. Your parents could catch you eating when you have ""no appetite"".

, While you are busy reading this, your parents might be reading about what kids do to fake sickness.

, There are articles about doing that that could help you in achieving those things. To fake vomit, you could try chewing something, and bring it back up your throat when it's not too far down. Read the article on wikiHow about making fake diarrhea if you want to know how to do that.

, Cough and say something to yourself like, ""I wish Mum and Dad were awake to help me"", right outside your parents' bedroom door, but as soon as they wake up quickly run to the bathroom or toilet and play the ""innocence act"". Act like nothing happened and you were just talking to yourself as you walked past their bedroom and that you didn't intend to wake them up.

, Otherwise, if they notice that you are trying very hard to get the point across that you're ""sick"", they will begin to suspect that perhaps you're not sick after all. Just try hard enough for them to decide you're sick.

, This way, they will think you're sick and won't take you to the doctor because you feel ""dizzy"" whenever you try to ""get up"".

, During the night, while you know your parents are sleeping (and any other members of your family) quickly go to the bathroom tap or the kitchen tap and wet yourself. Dry yourself but make sure you remain cold enough to have goosebumps. Once you're certain you aren't wet but have goosebumps, go into your parents' room and complain that you're cold.

, Then go to your parents' room again and complain of stomach, headache, fever or something like that. This will be your last shot at faking before the morning. Remember to keep up the masquerade in the morning as well. Wake up early deliberately to make it seem like you really do need the day off because you won't be focusing to your best at school due to going to bed late and waking up early. Act like it was your sickness that woke you up so early and kept you up so late.

, Spend a fair amount of time in the toilet (with the door shut) and then flush. Make sure your parents don't see the toilet before you flush it, because they will detect no waste to be found in the toilet bowl.

Don't blame yourself.,
Recognize your beliefs are not reality.,
Create your own connections with others.,
Practice basic self care.",How to Deal With an Emotionally Distant Parent1," It is not your fault that your parent is emotionally unavailable. Emotionally distant parents are dealing with their own issues and unable to provide their children emotional support. When you feel frustrated or guilty, remind yourself you're not to blame for your parents' distance.Instead of ignoring negative thoughts, replace them with positive ones. If you have a thought like ""It's my fault my parent is acting this way,"" acknowledge that emotion. Then, replace it with something positive, like, ""I'm trying my best with a difficult relationship and I deserve credit."";
, An emotionally unavailable parent can affect how you feel about yourself and the world. If you're struggling with negative emotions, remind yourself that there is a difference between belief and reality. Emotions are powerful, but they are not objective facts.Many people with emotionally distant parents feel they don't deserve love. If you feel this way, remind yourself that you believe this due to your relationship with your parents. It's not a reflection of reality.
Imagine someone else is experiencing your feelings. If a loved one told you they didn't deserve love, you would likely reassure them that is not true. Give yourself the same level of support.

, If you can't get emotional support from your parents, seek it from others. A strained relationship with your parents can cause feelings of insecurity. To make yourself feel more secure and supported, work on building and maintaining your existing friendships.Seek out new friendships by joining a club, getting involved in a charity, or finding other ways to branch out and meet people.
Remember, there are many different types of relationships that can be fulfilling. While it can sting to have a strained relationship with your parents, you likely have many other people in your life who love and support you.

, It's hard to control your emotions if you're not doing basic things, like eating right and getting enough sleep. During times when your relationship with your parents feels particularly strained, make sure you're keeping up with the basics of self care.During rough patches with your parents, be extra aware of your daily schedule. Ask yourself whether you're eating enough, sleeping enough, and giving yourself enough down time.
If you find you've been neglecting self care, make a conscious effort to take better care of yourself. Remember, you deserve to be cared for, even if your relationship with your parents makes you feel otherwise.

Admit your wrongdoing.,
Apologize to those you've wronged.,
Work to repair damage or repay debts.,
Communicate effectively with others.",How to Deal With Being in Trouble1," Even if you don't feel what you did was completely wrong, surely there are aspects of the situation you could have handled better. Acknowledge ways to respond more effectively in similar situations in the future. This will help you make better choices in the future and make your parents and other parties involved feel better.


Total denial is usually not received well by parents and other authority figures once punishment has already been assigned, so you should avoid denial.;
, Showing remorse to those you've hurt will go a long way to mend damaged relationships. It will be much easier for others to forgive you, if you express remorse.Your apology should describe what you did wrong and how it hurt the person you are apologizing to.


Your apologies must be sincere. If someone is hurt by something you did, an insincere apology will only further strain your relationship.
You may have a hard time organizing your thoughts in an emotional apology, so it's a good idea to write it out. Having a written apology may also show you put a lot of thought into it, conveying your sincerity.

If you really don't feel you can apologize in person, try writing it in a card.



, Trouble sometimes involves damage to or loss of property. You should help repair or replace those items. If you don't have the money saved, consider finding a part time, after school job. If you are not able to get a job, ask family and neighbors if you can do odd jobs to earn some money. You can also do the actual labor to repair damage in some cases.


Doing this will show you are responsible and might even get you out of trouble a little sooner.

, Poor communications often contributes to conflict, and may have played a role in your trouble. Learning to communicate whole messages clearly will reduce misunderstandings and future conflict.Whole messages can be communicated with a simple formula: statement of fact (usually a description of an act) + your interpretation of what that fact means + how your interpretation makes you feel + how you would like the issue to be resolved. For example, ""When you take my things without permission, I think you don't respect me or my belongings, which makes me feel angry. I will feel more comfortable with you borrowing my things, if we discuss it before you take them.""

If you don’t have enough food at home, are homeless, or put in unsafe situations (like staying with people you don’t know without your mother in sight), it’s okay to reach out for help.

If the situation escalates, you can call the police.

, You may feel really upset, frustrated or angry with your mother, but now is not the time to express these feelings. Save that discussion for when you are both calm and can talk about your feelings honestly and openly.


If you start to preach, punish or threaten your mother, ask yourself what’s motivating these actions. You’re likely angry, and taking it out in this way won’t help you or your mother. Find healthy outlets for your anger, like journaling, playing basketball, or going for a walk.

, It’s not your responsibility to take care of your mother, your family, or the house on your own. If you start taking over her responsibilities, you may take away her sense of importance or her dignity.If you find yourself doing these things, it’s time to have a discussion with her about how things have changed.


It can be hard to see your mother let go of her responsibilities as drugs take over her life. Remember it’s not your job to pick up the pieces. It’s more important to encourage your mother to get treatment.

, You can tell your mother how you feel and that you’d like her to get treatment, but you can’t change her. Often, the only thing that can help an addict is for her to want help for herself and admit she has a problem.


If you've tried your best to help, but always end up being hurt or ignored, it's not your fault. Nothing you did made her start doing drugs and you must never blame yourself.
You haven’t failed your mother or done anything wrong for her to use drugs.

, Recognize your own risks associated with drugs with a close family history. Kids that have a drug using parent tend to start using drugs and earlier and harder than kids that don’t have a drug-using parent. They are also more likely to develop drug disorders., You may feel so involved with the drug problem that you forget to take care of yourself. Make sure you spend time taking care of your own needs.You don’t need to give up your social life to take care of your mother. Remember, this is her problem and unfortunately, you’re involved in it but not responsible for her.


Keep your body and mind healthy, hang out with friends, and do things that make you happy. Don’t let your entire life revolve around your mother.

, Part of taking care of yourself is making sure you have healthy outlets for you to take out your stress, anger, sadness, pain, etc. Being a teenager is hard enough, but having to deal with the stress of having a drug addicted mother makes things a lot harder for you. Engage in activities that make you feel good in your body and your mind. Some easy ways to deal with stress include spending time in nature, writing in a journal, playing with animals, and listening to music.Exercise is a great way to release stress and keep your body happy.Go for a walk, skip, or do some jump rope. You can join sport teams at school to keep you moving.
Spend time with friends. One the best ways to bust stress is to surround yourself with fun and supportive people.

, It’s important to have someone in your life that you trust that you can talk to about your mother’s problems and how they affect you.It’s okay to talk about the hurt, frustration, embarrassment, anger, and fear associated with your mother’s use. This can be a coach, guidance counselor, spiritual leader, aunt/uncle, or therapist.


It can be helpful to find an adult that has similar experiences to you to talk to. This person can encourage you, show you that you can make it through, and be an example that things can work well for you.

, It's important to have people to talk to about what's happening in your life and this is really important. If you feel uncomfortable talking with someone you know personally, then here are some hotline phone numbers, and websites to help you out.


For family members of alcoholics, check out Al-Anon.org (https://www.al-anon.org).
For family members of addicts, check out Nar-anon (https://www.nar-anon.org)
For adult children of alcoholics and addicts, check out Adultchildren.org (https://www.adultchildren.org).

, It can be confusing to work through having a drug addicted mother while trying to be a normal kid, go to school, have friends, and have fun. If you’re struggling to keep that balance, it can be helpful to see a therapist. Even if you cannot afford to see an outpatient therapist, you can talk to your school counselor. Therapy can help you find ways to cope and support you through difficult times.Therapy is a safe place for you to share your thoughts and feelings, cry, and be honest.

, Be loving and supportive of your mother, yet let her know that her drug addiction is negatively impacting you and your family. When she does something embarrassing, hurtful, or dangerous while on drugs, don’t attempt to cover up or hide the negative consequences from her.Be honest with her in how the drugs are impacting you and the ways they hurt you.


Let your mother know how you feel. Don’t try to guilt her or shame her, but do say how you feel about her and the drugs. You can say, “I really miss having my mom around, and it’s really hard to relate to you when you’re on drugs.”

, It can take a lot of guts to step up and have a discussion with her about her drug use. Yet, she may not be ready to accept the fact that she has an addiction and may list off excuses or deny that she has a problem. If so, be ready to list specific examples of her behavior that worry you.Be as matter-of-fact as possible and rely on specific examples. You want to refute the denial and say, “Yes, this is, in fact, a big problem.”

, When talking to your mom, avoid emotional appeals (like playing a martyr) as this can increase guilt and lead to more drug use.Instead, say that you want to help her, and the best way you can help her is by encouraging her to get treatment.


Let her know she doesn’t have to hit rock bottom to seek treatment, and that the earlier she gets treatment, the better.You may want to research treatment options ahead of time. Many drug users go into inpatient treatment in order to detox from the drugs, get psychological help (therapy and medication), and begin their recovery in a highly structured and supportive atmosphere.

, To help your mother and still protect yourself, you will need to set some boundaries with her. Though it is scary to say no to someone you love, especially when that person is your mother, this is essential to her recovery and your own well-being and self-esteem. By setting boundaries, you stop enabling or taking responsibility for your mother's behavior and instead let her experience the consequences of her actions.Know that the boundaries will be tested. It is important that, when you set a boundary, you stick with it. Do not allow your boundaries to ""move.""A boundary you might set is that, if you come home to find your mother using you will call an adult to help her and go stay with a friend.

, Let your mother know that you are willing to support and encourage her along her road to recovery, and that while you do not support the drug addiction, you fully support the recovery.


It can be hard to overcome an addiction, so make sure your mother knows how much you care and want her to improve. Support her through any relapses and avoid passing judgment as she recovers at her own pace.

Get away and go somewhere safe.,
Call for help.,
Comply with authority figures.,
Get therapy or counseling.",How to Deal With an Abusive Father1," Fathers who use alcohol or other drugs and have low impulse control are more likely to sexually abuse their children.Anger or stress, relationship problems, and domestic violence are all predictors of abuse against children.If you notice things getting worse in your home, make sure you have your safety plan handy and you are ready to escape from the situation if you need to.
You may be in immediate danger if your father is: currently threatening to harm you or abuse you, carrying a weapon (including heavy objects), chasing you with an intent to abuse you, or if you are currently being physically hurt or sexually abused.;
, If you are currently in danger of being abused (physically or sexually), you need to get help immediately. If you don’t have access to a phone to call for help, get away from the abusive situation and find a safe place to go.


If you are at home, think of the best way to exit and use it. This could be through a window, door, or out the backyard.
Good places to go include: a trusted neighbor’s house, a friend’s house, or a public place where phones are available.
Do not hide in your bedroom, you could get stuck there and not be able to escape easily if something goes wrong.

, If you are in imminent danger or are currently being physically or sexually abused, call for help immediately. You can call your local emergency contact number(i.e. 911) or the police/law enforcement station.


Consider calling a Child Services Hotline.They are trained to deal with abuse. Be prepared to answer questions about when and how your father has abused you.
You can also contact a mandated reporter (teacher, therapist).

, If you called the police or child services, they may arrive and interview you. Police, social workers, therapists or others may want to talk with you about the situation. They will most likely also speak to your legal guardian or guardians (parent or other person who is legally allowed to take care of you).


Be honest when asked questions about the abuse. Know that these people are trying to understand the situation better so that they can work to keep you safe.
Child Protective Services will ask you questions and intervene. The government agency or social services organization that deals with your case may require you and your father to receive psychological intervention, such as therapy or parenting classes. In very severe cases, children may be removed from the home or separated from the parent until the abusive situation is resolved.
The police may conduct an investigation and speak to you and your parents or legal guardians. In severe cases, and if you choose to press charges, your father may undergo a trial.

, If you have endured an abusive situation, the trauma will not resolve itself. It is essential that you seek the help of a therapist or counselor. The earlier you begin therapy, the better chance you have at recovery.


A therapist can help if you worry about being abused regularly, you avoid certain instances that remind you of the abuse, or if you have excessive feelings of guilt, shame, depression, or fear related to the abuse.
If your thoughts of the abuse prevent you from completing daily tasks or harm your interpersonal relationships, therapy can help. You can work with a therapist to keep yourself safe and deal healthfully with the trauma you have endured.
If you are under the age of 18 you can talk to your school guidance counselor about getting therapy. Unless your guardian has specifically forbidden you to see the counselor or for the counselor to see you, then parental consent is not necessary to receive counseling.The counselor must report known or suspected child abuse.Family therapy is also a helpful option to explore.Your therapist, or a separate one, can work with your family to create safety and reduce abuse. Ask your therapist if this is an option or if she can provide you with a referral.

Take a break.",How to Deal With Elderly Parents when You're an Only Child," It is a good idea to start thinking about care for your parents long before they need it. This will give you and your parents time to prepare physically, emotionally, and financially. Talk openly with your parents about the fact that they are aging, but be sensitive. You might start a discussion by saying something like “I know you are in good health, and will be for a long time to come, but have you thought about what we’ll do as you get older?”;
, Your parents might be quick to assure you that they are fine. Accepting that you are aging is not easy for everyone, and avoiding the topic is all too often how people cope. Asking your parents specific questions will force them to think about real issues around their age.


You might ask legal questions like “Have you made a will?”
You could ask health questions like “When was your last doctor’s visit? Were there any concerns?”
You should also ask your parents if they have a financial plan for their future.

, There are many community service agencies available to child caregivers and their parents. Many of these services may be covered by your parents’ insurance plans. Services may include adult day care centers, home health aides, home-delivered meals, transportation, skilled nursing, mental health support services, and financial advocacy and guidance services.

If your parent is a veteran, home health care coverage, financial support, home care services and more are available. Some of these services may be free to your veteran parent through the Veteran’s Administration, while others require a co-payment. This depends on many factors including your parents military discharge status, when they served, income status, and if there are any disabilities attached to their service discharge. Check with your local VA to find out if your parent is eligible.

, Your parents may not understand how to make the arrangements needed. Things like creating a will or analyzing finances might be difficult. The difficulty is often enough to deter people from completing those essential tasks.Help your parents do an online will, or analyze their budget. If you are unsure how to do that, schedule an appointment with a lawyer or an accountant.

, Depending on your parent’s age and health, the care they require will be different. Maybe they need as little as stopping by a couple of times a month to move heavy things, or possibly they need round the clock care. Your parent may not be capable of determining their needs, and you will have to use your best judgement.


For example, if your parents are very mobile and mentally alert, they may need very little help from you.
If your parents are forgetful and often leave the stove on, or lock themselves out of the house, you might consider more extensive care. This could include hiring a home health professional, living with your parents, or having your parents live with you.

, Take some time to talk with your parents and find out what specific type of caregiving they need. Make a list and then look over it to identify what you are and are not capable of doing on your own.

Be realistic about your capabilities and the amount of time you can realistically set aside to help with caregiving. Anything you cannot do should be designated to a qualified caregiver of your parents choosing.

, You can’t do everything and solve every problem on your own. You’ll need some help from family, friends, healthcare professionals, and community agencies. Trying to do everything yourself will put all of the emotional weight on your shoulders, and you will quickly burn out. This will make it harder or even impossible to provide quality care to your parents. Therefore, it is important to ask for help whenever you need it.

Keep in mind that people you ask for help will likely be honored and happy that you asked them.
Make sure to include your parents by asking them who they would like to seek help from.
Review the list of needs you developed with your parents to determine what specific things they may need help with.
Be willing to point out the areas that you need extra help with.
Make sure that anyone you ask for help understands what is most helpful to you and your parents.

, You should schedule in specific times to physically see your parents. This will allow you to help them with things around the house, and to keep an accurate watch over their health and self-sufficiency. It will also reinforce the bond you have with your parents.


An example might be to go to your parent’s house every other Sunday for dinner.
Sometimes this will not be possible due to living a long distance from your parents.

, In order to do a good job caring for your parents, you have to care for yourself. This means giving yourself time to relax, process things, and reenergize from time to time. Take time to go somewhere you enjoy, or be home alone, or even just see friends. For an only child dealing with elderly parents, this is particularly important., There are many reasons that you might not be able to provide constant care for your parents. You may not have the space for them to live with you, and could be prevented by family or other obligations from living with them. You could also need to work even if you do live in the same house as your parents, and be required to be out of the home for large chunks of time. In this case, hiring in home assistance might be a good choice. It could be anything from hiring someone to clean up the house, to hiring an in home health care provider., Staying in touch with your parents is essential to having a good relationship. In most cases, your parents understand that you have your own life and obligations, but they still want to spend time with you. Giving them some of your time can help them remain emotionally secure and comfortable.


It might be a good rule of thumb to invite your parents over for family game night from time to time, or to have dinners regularly.

, In some cases, your parent(s) may need more support than can be offered by phone calls or occasional visits. If this is your situation, you should consider what living arrangements can be made to put you and your parent(s) under the same roof. The options are pretty straightforward. Either you can move into your parent’s home, or move them into yours.


This is often the case if one parent dies and leaves the other parent alone.

, As your parents age, they will be faced with many frustrations. This can include being less physically capable, facing their mortality, and feeling as though the world has left them behind. You will need to be patient and understand the struggles your parents face. Talk to them on a regular basis and make an effort to be kind.Never talk to your parents in a demeaning tone, especially about something that they can no longer do, such as drive.

, You have to keep your finances in order if you intend to help anyone else financially. This means keeping your job and paying your bills first. With your excess cash, you can help your parents pay the bills they need., Many times, your parents will not need your money, but will need your help managing their own money. Whenever you manage your parents’ money, you should keep records of how the money was spent. Keep a copy of the receipts and file them after every transaction.This will help to avoid any misunderstandings or mistrust about how your parents’ money is spent.

, Even if your parents have a hard time managing their finances, they do deserve to understand where the money is going. They should also have a say in how the money gets spent. Have a talk about finances with your parents each month and discuss what needs payed, and how much excess money they will have to spend as they please. You should also make arrangements to have access to things such as your parents’ safety deposit box., Whether you are spending your money to keep your parents afloat in their older years, or simply giving them your time and energy, you will need to set limits. You have your own needs and wants in life that are also valid. Many people have families of their own, or a career that they are passionate about. While it is okay to dedicate time and resources to your parents, you have to create boundaries and make them clear.For example, you might decide that you will pay your parents’ electric bill, but you will not pay for an extended cable package.

, Your parents may be unappreciative of your efforts to care for them. This can be particularly true with parents that suffer from dementia. The combination of stress about getting older and needing care, and the neurological changes that occur with dementia, makes it difficult (sometimes even impossible) for parents to recognize and appreciate what you are doing for them.Even though your parents may not appreciate your efforts, it is important that you recognize and appreciate your own efforts.

, If you are caring for an aging parent, it is likely because you have some love or attachment to that parent. Keep this in mind as things get rough. You have chosen to take on the responsibility of making the rest of their life as good as it can be, and you should take pride in that., As you become immersed in helping your parents, you may forget to take care of yourself. This may lead to burnout and a feeling of being disconnected from other people. Watch for signs that you are becoming overwhelmed or stressed, and address your negative emotions. Some ways you might take care of yourself include:

Talking to someone. Talking to someone, such as a friend or a therapist, can help you to relieve stress and better understand emotions, feelings, and situations.
Journaling. Writing things down give you the chance to reflect on situations that are bothering you. During and after writing, you may have better insight and identify solutions to issues that you were unable to identify before.
Starting a daily ritual. Set aside anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes each day that is just for you. Use this time to pray, meditate, practice yoga, do deep breathing, go for a walk in nature, or to do something else that is meaningful to you.
Joining a support group. You could get involved with your church, a social club, or another community organization. The more you are able to develop your social support network, the better off you will be.

, You will need to take a break sometimes. Whether it’s to go out to a movie, sneak in a vacation, or just walk around the block, you need some “me time.” Remember that this isn’t selfish or self-serving. It is imperative for you to keep your own sanity so that you may continue caring for your aging parent(s)."

Set boundaries.,
Recognize games and manipulation.,
Stay present in your own life.,
Do not ignore your emotions.,
Take steps to care less.",How to Deal With an Emotionally Distant Parent2," Boundaries are important to help you build a relationship with your parents that's manageable for you. Emotionally distant parents may play mind games or duck in and out of your life. Let your parents know what behaviors are not acceptable.Set boundaries in the moment when your parents do something that makes you feel uncomfortable. For example, if your parents invite you to a holiday event at the last minute, let them know you can't make it and that late invitations don't work for you.
Say something like, ""I appreciate you inviting me to Christmas, but I need you to send me these invitations sooner. I'm sorry, but I've already made other plans.""

, Emotionally distant people are prone to manipulating others. Try to catch moments when your parents are being manipulative. If you catch your parents playing games with you, disengage immediately.Your parents may guilt you, make accusations, compare you to others, or engage in other behaviors to make you feel like their distance is your fault. Watch out for these kinds of behaviors.
For example, say your parent suddenly starts calling you every day after ignoring you for months. When you're unable to take all their calls, they accuse you of not valuing the relationship. Refuse to respond to these accusations as they're a form of manipulation.

, It can be easy to get over-involved in drama caused by emotionally distant parents. If you find yourself exhausted by your parents, focus on what you have going on. Spend time with your friends, pursue your hobbies, and focus on your career and other relationships. Your parents do not have to define your happiness., While it's important to try to disengage from emotionally distant parents, remember it's okay to feel sad, frustrated, or angry. Do not always try to push away emotions. If your parents hurt your feelings, do something like vent to a friend, journal about how you're feeling, or take a long walk to help yourself process.While acknowledging emotions is important, you do not have to linger on them. Let yourself feel what you're feeling, but try to focus on other things after letting out your emotions.

, You will never completely stop caring about your relationship with your parents. However, you can learn to gradually care less over time. Focus on building relationships with people who support you in return rather than seeking your parents' approval."
"

Start with small steps.,
Identify and meet your own needs.,
Seek professional help.",How to Deal With an Emotionally Distant Parent3," Being aware of your issues can help you confront them head on. Spend some time examining yourself, your emotions, and your relationships with others. Take note of any issues that may stem from your parents.Many people with emotionally distant parents shut down or ignore their own feelings. Think about whether you're able to acknowledge and process your own feelings.
You may have a sense of inadequacy or low self-esteem. If so, if this could be related to your relationship with your parents.

, Repairing the damage of emotional neglect takes time, so start small. Take little steps to treat yourself with more compassion and love.For example, if you screw something up at work, stop if you start beating yourself up. Remind yourself you did your best and everyone makes mistakes.
Do not be hard on yourself if it takes you awhile to care for yourself and trust others. The effects of an emotionally distant parent take a long time to undo. Small steps over time are key to healing.

, Many people with emotionally distant parents have trouble identifying their own needs and expressing what they want from others. When you're experiencing stress or negative emotions, take a step back. Think about what you need and how you can meet that need.For example, if you feel irritable after a long day, pause and acknowledge you need a break. It's okay to lie down and unwind if that's what you need.

, Therapy is key to undoing the effects of a difficult childhood. Look for a professional therapist who specializes in helping people with a history of family trauma or neglect. One on one sessions with a qualified professional can help you learn coping mechanisms to help you overcome the effects of emotionally distant parents.You can find a therapist by getting recommendations with friends, talking to your general practitioner, or looking online for therapists in your area.

Focus on your physical and mental health.,
Create a workout regimen.,
Catch up on schoolwork or projects around the house.,
Learn to show yourself compassion.,
Develop your sense of self-worth.,
Stop guilt messages.,
Get involved in bettering your community and help others.",How to Deal With Being in Trouble2," Being in trouble usually means you have less opportunity to socialize. While this may seem like a terrible thing, it actually creates an opportunity for you to focus on developing a healthy lifestyle. Social activities often include unhealthy food and drink, and possibly drugs and alcohol. It's easier to adopt a healthy diet and refrain from abusing substances without peer pressure.


Developing a healthy lifestyle may also help you stay out of trouble in the future.

, Exercise is a great way to relieve stress and distract yourself from your troubles. Workouts will allow you to set and achieve short-term goals to feel like you are using your time productively.


If your lifestyle was previously very sedentary, you should design workouts to get progressively more difficult over time. Starting out easy and building up to more vigorous exercise will help prevent injury.Physical activity can also help you manage feelings of depression and anxiety. Exercise releases endorphins, natural mood-boosting chemicals produced by your brain.Exercise can also help you release anger in a helpful way, which can be helpful if you're feeling upset about being in trouble., Trying to balance friends, family, school, and/or work is difficult, and it's usually homework and housework that gets put off. These small tasks then pile up and become overwhelming. If you're in trouble, it's a pretty good sign you should immerse yourself in your studies and get organized. This will distract you from your problems and help you stay out of future trouble.


Try creating a study schedule to keep you on track even after you are no longer in trouble. Use a calendar to block out time to study specific subjects each week.You can also schedule specific household chores. Tackling projects one at a time will actually help you finish them all in a more timely manner.

, Sometimes, you end up in trouble because you don't feel good about yourself. You may give in to peer pressure or act out in order to ""prove"" yourself. You may feel attacked and become angry if people don't behave toward you the way you think they should. If you have a hard time accepting painful feelings, you're more likely to end up in trouble when you respond to them. Showing yourself compassion can help you feel better about who you are, the mistakes you make, and your capacity for growth.


For example, imagine that you're in trouble because you dented your parents' car due to careless driving. You could choose to beat yourself up about it and think ""I'm such a loser."" This is unhelpful because it doesn't focus on what you can learn from the experience. It also unfairly generalizes about you based on one specific event.
Instead, you could acknowledge that you made a mistake, accept that making mistakes is part of being human, and focus on what you can do to avoid a similar situation next time: ""When I earn back the privilege of using the car, I will look more carefully when I'm in parking lots and won't drive so fast.""
Remind yourself that painful experiences and thoughts are part of living, and everyone experiences them. Understanding that you share common humanity with others can help you be more compassionate towards everyone, including yourself. It can also help you distance yourself from them, because suddenly you're not the only person in the world this has ever happened to.

, Instead of getting your validation from others, like your peers, look inward. Self-worth is highest when you feel like you're living in accordance with your personal values, or the core beliefs that determine how you view yourself, your life, and your world.For example, recognize that you don't have to follow the crowd to be ""cool."" Cool is whatever you define it to be. Perhaps for you, being ""cool"" means expressing yourself artistically, or getting involved in a team sport.
It can help to spend a little time thinking about your values.For example, what feels most important to you? If you could change one thing about your community, what would it be? What traits or characteristics do you really admire in others?
Remember that your values are yours, and thus your self-worth isn't dependent on what others value. Values aren't superior or inferior; they're just different.

, Watch out for generalizing statements, such as ""I'm a loser"" or ""I can't do anything right.""These are unfair generalizations about you, and only pay attention to one thing that you see as wrong, rather than viewing yourself as a whole person.They're often a sign of all-or-nothing thinking, too.


Instead of making generalizations, focus on the single event or experience that's prompted that feeling. In this case, it's probably whatever you did to get yourself in trouble. Acknowledge that mistake, but don't allow it to define you. Instead, focus on your future: ""I made a bad decision about drinking underage. I regret that choice. I can learn from it to help me avoid giving in to peer pressure in the future. I will follow my own values.""
Watch for all-or-nothing thinking, too. This can be extremely demotivating, especially if you're having trouble with schoolwork. For example, you might do poorly on a quiz and think ,""Well, I'm just going to fail this class, that's all there is to it."" Instead, recognize that this is a single event in a larger experience. There are things you can do to help you improve your performance: get tutoring, ask your parents for help with homework, talk to your teacher, watch some YouTube videos explaining the concept. Focus on solutions, rather than allowing the problem to paralyze you.

, Volunteer at local organizations to shift attention from yourself to others. This is a productive way to connect with others and keep your mind off your troubles. Focusing on the hardships of others will also help develop empathy and increase your self-esteem, reducing the likelihood of getting in trouble again.You can find lots of volunteering opportunities online."

If you believe abuse is about to occur, use this safety plan.

, Knowing your way around your home can help you get away if you need to. Having a plan can also help you feel safe.


Identify ways to leave your home, such as through certain windows, doors, fire escapes, elevators, stairs, etc. If you live in an apartment complex, there should be a fire escape posting and map of the premises; study it in order to develop the fastest and safest way out of the situation.
If there are locked windows and doors inside the home make sure you obtain keys or know how to unlock them ahead of time.
Move objects out of the way if they block useful windows or doors.

, Identify safe places you can go in the future, such as certain friend’s or family member’s house, a school, hospital, etc.


Find the fastest route to your identified safe place.
Figure out how you might get there the fastest. For example, you can run, skateboard, or drive (if you have a license).
Make sure you have plenty of places you can go and several back-up plans if people are not home. If necessary, you can go to a public place such as a mall or store to get phone access.
Tell the people you plan to go to that they are part of your safety plan. Know typical times that they are home.

, If the abuse re-occurs, you should know who you can talk to about it. It could possibly evolve into something more, and if it does, you want someone else to know. Ask for help.Helpful people to talk to include: your mother, grandparent, a teacher, school guidance counselor, therapist, friend’s parent, or another adult who you trust.

, Sometimes people who endure abuse end up engaging in risky, unsafe, or uncomfortable situations.Work on preventing future abuse.

Avoid being in a room alone with your father if you can. This may increase your risk of abuse. Try to have friends over, spend time with your siblings, or ask another family member over. If you can’t avoid being alone with him, make sure you have an exit or way of protecting yourself if you need to.
Using drugs or alcohol to cope with abuse can have serious and devastating consequences (illegal activity, lowered judgment, overdose). Avoid using substances to cope. Try exercise, writing/journaling, or therapy instead.

Have self-compassion.,
Embrace your healthy relationships.,
Process your feelings.,
Express yourself creatively.,
Avoid negative coping.,
Empower yourself.",How to Deal With an Abusive Father3," People who have experienced abuse often blame themselves or experience self-loathing.Remember, it's never your fault, and nobody deserves to be abused.


Replace destructive self-talk with compassionate self-talk.If you say mean things to yourself such as, “It’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have made him mad,” this is an incorrect thought because you are not to blame. Replace these types of thoughts with more realistic appraisals of the situation such as, “The abuse is not my fault. I did not wish it or want it to happen. I am deserving of love and respect and should not be abused.”
Take care of yourself. Self-care is an important component of coping after abuse has occurred.This means treating yourself with compassion and respect. Eat healthy, get enough sleep, attend your therapy sessions, and engage in healthy activities (exercise, education, relaxation, leisure).

, Healing from abuse can be achieved with the help of support from others. It is important to have mutually satisfying and collaborative relationships.Chances are, you already have people in your life who can support you, such as other family members (mother, grandparents, siblings, cousins), friends, and teachers.


If you have been avoiding socializing out of fear or sadness, try reconnecting with others who are safe. Invite your friends over, or hang out with safe family members such as siblings or cousins. You don't necessarily need to talk to them about the abuse if you don't want to or aren't ready to do so. Just get support by spending quality time together and doing fun activities (such as playing games).
One way to get social support is to join a support group. Ask your school counselor or therapist for referrals. If you don’t have either of those, try conducting a search online for local organizations that have support groups for individuals who have survived trauma and abuse.
Do not tolerate friends or others who mistreat you or call you names. You deserve to be treated with respect. But don't use physical violence of any kind to get your point across either, just distance yourself and spend less time with people who mistreat you.

, Mourning the trauma and loss is an important piece of healing from abuse.You can write your father a letter, which you don’t need to send. Tell him how you feel about the abuse and how it has affected you. Let your anger out.
Talking to others about your feelings is also a good way to process. You can do this with a friend, family member, counselor, or support group.

, Creative expression is one way to positively cope with a history of abuse. Creativity can help you release you emotions in healthy ways instead of harming yourself or lashing out at others.


Try improvisational music as self-help therapy.This has been shown to help heal sexual abuse, and may be beneficial for other types of abuse as well. Try playing the harmonica (an easy instrument to learn), or download a game or app that allows you to create music.
Write about it. Reconstructing the story of your abuse can be a helpful way to heal.This can help you to resolve the trauma. Gain support or put it aside if it upsets you too much right now.
Try art – you can color, paint, draw, or sculpt. Try to express in your art how you feel about the abuse and how it has affected you.

, Individuals who have survived abuse may be at an increased risk for using alcohol and other drugs.Additionally, people who have suffered from an abusive situation may blame themselves, minimize the seriousness of the abuse (thinking it was not as bad as it was), and rationalize (think that the abuse was necessary or normal).


Focus on having a realistic view of the abuse such as thinking or saying to yourself, “I was abused and it was not okay. I am not to blame for the abuse. I will not tolerate being abused and will get help if I need it.""

, Many individuals who experience abuse may feel dis-empowered and not in control. Take your power back!Take a survivor rather than a victim stance on your history of abuse. You can do this by integrating a survivor mentality into your identity. Think, “It was abuse, and I survived it. I am a survivor, not a victim. I am strong enough to overcome this great obstacle. I will keep fighting to end abuse.”
Find a survivor mission or purpose. Perhaps this means giving talks about your experience, or helping other survivors.

Work on controlling other parts of your life.",How to Deal With Abusive Parents," If you are being physically harmed, or your life is in danger, call emergency services immediately.Signs that you may be in immediate danger include: if someone is threatening to harm or abuse you in a serious way (such as if they are yelling that they are going to hit you or harm you in another way), if that person has a weapon or object, if you are being chased with an intent to harm you, if you are fearful about your safety, and if you are currently being hurt physically or abused by another.
Emergency operators are trained to talk you through these situations. They can send law enforcement or a medical response team to assist you.
Law enforcement are also typically trained to deal with these situations. They will most likely speak to you in person and ask you questions about your situation in order to determine ways to deal with the issue.;
, In order to get help you need to know if what you are experiencing is actually abuse or normal parenting. Child abuse is defined in terms of physical harm, sexual abuse, emotional harm, and neglect., Physical injury related to abuse is anything that causes bodily harm including: hitting, punching, slapping, or any other action that can leave a mark. This type of abuse can be conveyed to a mandated reporter (teacher, therapist, etc), your local department of child/family services, or law enforcement (sheriffs, police). Common signs of physical abuse include: unexplainable injuries or markings (bruises, cuts, sores), injuries that do not match up with the explanation of the situation, fearful or timid behaviors (looking around frequently, alert), easily scared or startled, and expression of fears of family situations.Other indicators may include: extreme changes in sleeping, eating, social, or academic behaviors. The child may also begin engaging in unsafe behaviors such as using drugs or alcohol.






Under federal law in the United States, spanking to the buttocks is not considered abuse unless injuries occur (such as welts, bruises)., Sexual abuse against a child includes touching/petting of a child's private parts, sexual contact with a child, intercourse or other sexual acts, or exposing a child to sexual imagery or content.]


Common signs of child sexual abuse are: an understanding of sex which is too mature for the child's age, seductive behaviors or developmentally inappropriate interest in sex, difficulty sitting or standing/walking, avoiding a particular individual for an unknown reason, embarrassment of one's body or avoidance of changing in locker room or at home, and running away from home.Additional signs could be if the child uses substances such as drugs or alcohol, becomes pregnant or develops sexually transmitted infections.

, Neglect is defined by not providing the child with the necessities of life including food, clothing, shelter, and medical treatment.


Signs of neglect include if the child: is visibly unclean or smells bad, wears clothes that do not fit or are inappropriate for the weather, has poor hygiene, and has medical or physical issues that are not treated.Other warning signs are if the child is left alone for long periods of time without adult supervision, or if the child is missing or late to school often.

, Emotional or verbal abuse includes: yelling, shaming, threatening, calling names, belittling, and other verbal acts that can cause psychological harm.Indicators and warning signs of verbal abuse are if the child is: socially withdrawn, lacking attachment to the guardian or parent, having feelings of shame or guilt, worrying about his behaviors, and behaving in extreme ways that are abnormal for the child (such as very compliant/shy or very obstinate/argumentative, or acting above or below his age).Domestic violence is also an issue. If a child witnesses violence in the family this is a reportable concern.

, It is common for individuals who have survived abuse to blame themselves for the abuse or justify the situation. Realize that abuse is not your fault. Understand that if your situation falls into any of the four types of abuse (physical, sexual, emotional, neglect), this is not acceptable and you do not deserve to be treated this way no matter what., Notifying an adult other than the abuser is the most important part of dealing with abusive parents. Abuse is not something that is easily dealt with on your own. You can contact a trusted adult, mandated reporter (teacher, therapist), Child Protective Services or law enforcement.Child Protective Services staff and other government agency personnel are trained to deal with these types of situations.They will ask you questions and tell you what to expect.
Your local law enforcement or governing agency will most likely conduct an investigation and you and certain members of your family may be interviewed.
Reporting the abuse can result in a social worker being involved in your case and may require that you and your parents receive education or counseling. Worst case scenario is that you would be removed from the home for your own safety. In this case, children are typically placed under foster care until the abusive situation is resolved.

, Creating a safety plan is important to both keeping yourself out of danger and preventing future abuse.Your plan should include warning signs, how to escape, places to go, and people to talk to.


Write down the plan.It is difficult to keep this information in your head, so as you go about making your plan make sure you write down each step.
If you feel unsafe or believe that abuse is about to occur, engage your safety plan immediately.

, It is important to know early if an abusive situation is likely to occur so that you can remain safe, take action or get away. Some situations that are often associated with abuse include: alcohol and/or drug use, heightened anger or stress, relationship issues, and domestic violence.However, if you feel that you are in imminent danger, you need to escape the situation, get to a phone, and call emergency services.


Remember that anger is okay, but violence or abuse is never okay.

, You do not deserve to be abused and if it is about to occur it is important that you keep yourself safe from abuse or harm. Identify possible situations that may occur based on what has happened in the past (type of and nature of abuse).


Identify common places in which the abuse may occur. If abuse has happened in a particular room, make sure you have an easy exit out of that room (whether it be a door, window, etc). Make sure there are no pieces of furniture or other objects that may get in your way.
Do not attempt to hide in your own home. This can cause you to get stuck somewhere and not be able to get away to a safe place.
Identify escape routes out of your home. Many apartment buildings have fire escape plan posted; you can learn the fastest way to exit your building. Use stairs instead of the elevator.
Understand how to unlock windows and doors, as well as where important keys are to your home.

, Identify specific safe places to go to if you are in danger such as a neighbor or friend's house.Make sure these individuals are in on your plan and note when they are usually home vs. when they are not.


Identify the fastest and safest way to get to your safe place. If you can run, do so. If you have easy access to transportation that you are legally allowed to operate, use it (car, skateboard, bike, etc).
Have several back up plans in case you cannot go to your specific safe place. For example, identify close public places that are open 24 hours or have easy phone access.

, Identify safe individuals such as close friends and family members who will keep you away from harm or intervene if you are in trouble.Keep important phone numbers such as emergency contacts on you at all times.
When you get to your safe place you can call for additional help (emergency services or your local police station) if needed.

, Child abuse can lead to many difficulties including: shame, guilt, low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).Additionally, your parents’ actions have formed who you are, what you think about yourself and what you think is normal behavior. Therefore, it can be difficult to know what a healthy parent-child relationship should look like. If your daily actions are based in fear of being hurt or put down, something needs to change. You are a worthy human being and deserve to be happy.

, A natural instinct when dealing with situations you can’t control is to try to ""hide,"" but expressing your emotions may be helpful to your well-being.


Start by talking to a friend. This might feel like a difficult thing to do, but gathering up your courage to do it can be life changing. It may help you deal with the situation and make your friendship even stronger.
Keep a journal. This will help you express your feelings and situation you're in so you can find the best course of action.
Another way to express your feelings is to talk to other people in your situation.

, Adults can not only give you support, but can also help you come up with an action plan. It's okay to be angry or afraid. Talk about how you feel and why. Good people to talk to are:


Your teacher
Your school guidance counselor or therapist
Your best friend's parent
Another relative you trust

, If you notice negative changes in your thoughts (worrying about being abused), feelings (sad, fearful) or behaviors (avoiding certain situations) it may be helpful to get a professional opinion.Other signs you may need treatment are if you are not doing well in school or are neglecting activities you previously enjoyed.


If your abusive situation has been reported to law enforcement then your governing agency may already require that you and your parents engage in therapy. It is important to be open to this experience and know that your therapist is there to help you.
If you are not currently in treatment you can talk to your medical doctor about getting a referral to a therapist.
If you are under the age of 18, your legal guardian (parent or otherwise) must provide consent for you to engage in treatment.Your legal guardian would be required to sign the appropriate paperwork when you first meet with a therapist.
If you do not feel comfortable talking to your parents about getting treatment you can speak to another trusted adult or family member, or your school guidance counselor.

, Coping skills are ways that you can feel better or deal with a situation more effectively. Having more coping skills to reduce feeling overwhelmed or out of control is associated with a better outcome for individuals who have survived abusive situations.Coping skills can be fun and entertaining such as: listening to music, watching movies, and playing games or sports.

, Reduce the intensity of your emotions, discharge your feelings, divide them into manageable parts, or get outside support. Some specific coping skills for dealing with feelings include: writing them down, using art to express them, and exercising to release tension in the body.Pretend your abuser is sitting in a chair and say what you want to say. Yell, scream, curse -- let it all out.
Write a letter of confrontation to your abuser. You do not need to send it but this may help you process and work through some of your feelings.

, Relaxation techniques have been linked to lowered stress levels.Progressive muscle relaxation is one technique where you progressively tense and relax different muscle groups throughout your body until you become relaxed. Start with tensing your toes for 5 seconds, then relax them for10- 30 seconds. Then move slowly up your body all the way to the top of you head (from toes, to feet, to legs, and so on).Deep breathing is another option where you simply breathe deeply through your nose, and breathe out through your mouth. Pay attention to your breathing and when you get distracted return to thinking only about your breathing., Some strategies that are unhelpful in the long-term include: blaming the self, minimizing the abuse (saying or thinking it was not that bad), denial, and rationalizing (thinking that the abuse was normal or okay)., Focus on what you can control instead of what you cannot control.Focus on your own goals such as doing well in school or learning how to play a sport or instrument.
Focus on your own hopes and dreams. Think about what you want to become and start getting information about it or working toward it.

Accept the fact that we don't choose our parents.,
Release any guilt you feel by acknowledging that your dad is not a good parent role model for you.,
Understand it is not your problem other than you are forced to live and deal with him.,
Avoid big, dramatic blow ups with him.,
Work hard at pleasing yourself in life.,
Look around you for good men who could become a father figure to you.,
Stay strong.,
Tell him.",How to Deal With a Terrible Dad," If your dad is abusive or not there for you in the way you need him to be-it can be very painful and it is not your fault. If anyone else had been in your place, he would have behaved the same. His behavior is not a reflection of who you are - it has nothing to do with you. Understanding this fact is very important.;
, There are many ways your father can be harmful to you. Is he physically abusive to you or your mother? Does he call you or other family members names, belittle and curse at them? Is he gone all the time and distant when he is home? Does he not have any time for you? Is he a alcoholic or an addict? Is he too strict or and just plain mean?

, If your dad is an unhappy or weak person that does not make you the ""cause"" of it. You did not drive him to this behavior. He has created his own life and his own relationships with people. He might have been happy at one time but he is not now. This fact you can not change for him, no matter how much you might want to.

, It will get you nowhere if anything only make things worse. Your life just has to go on without him. You don't need to prove yourself or try to win approval from him. It will make you feel horrible and empty inside. Focus on the good relationships you do have with other people. Surround yourself with people who care about you and your feelings. Don't have anyone? Reach out and become friends with kind people. The world is filled with nice people who want good friends and care about others.

, If you want money then work hard at your grades and stay in school. If you are already working than begin to save your money to become more independent.

, Even a woman who you trust could take over this important role in your life. Older men in their seventies and eighties can be lonesome and looking for someone to talk with. They might enjoy telling you stories of their lives or give you good advice.

, Embrace your values and morals. Strive to be a good man or woman despite being dealt with an unhappy father.

, Tell your dad what's making you feel uncomfortable because of him. There will be a fair chance that he might change and try to make you feel happier. If your dad is not that kind of person, act a way that makes him feel that something isn't right about his own kid and he might think about changing a bad attitude or habit.

Acknowledge that selfishness is not the same as not giving you what you want.,
Look for “Win-Lose” outcomes.,
Watch for emotional manipulation.,
Look for signs of neglect.",How to Deal With a Selfish Mother1," When we say a person is “selfish,” what we often mean is that “She isn’t giving me what I want.” For example, if you ask your mother for a Playstation 4 and she says no, but spends money on new shoes for herself, you may think “She’s just being selfish.” However, this isn’t necessarily true; perhaps she actually needs new shoes to go to work, whereas your Playstation 3 doesn’t really need an expensive upgrade right now. Most people don’t like not getting what we want; that’s natural. But take the time to consider whether this is actually the result of selfish behavior from your mother, or if it is due to something else.You may also interpret behavior as selfish if it doesn’t meet your needs as you define them. For example, if you want your mother to do your homework with you every night and she can’t several nights because she has to work, you might feel that she’s being selfish to not meet your needs. You have the right to want your mom to help you with homework, but you should also acknowledge that she has other responsibilities that sometimes mean she can’t help you.
In contrast, if you ask your mother to buy you a new pair of sneakers because you’ve outgrown yours and she says no, but then spends money to buy herself something frivolous, this may be an example of selfish behavior because she is not meeting your real needs.;
, Selfishness often results in “win-lose” situations, where one person always comes out ahead and the other behind. Sometimes, this outcome is unavoidable: if you ask your mother to buy you alcohol when you’re underage and she says no (which she should do), you’re going to be in a win-lose situation because she has decided the outcome she wants and you haven’t gotten the outcome you want. However, in most cases, compromise can help the two of you come to an agreement that works okay for both of you. If your mother is never or rarely willing to compromise, she may be behaving selfishly.For example, if your mother never allows you to use the car to go see friends because she wants you to spend time with her, this could be an example of selfishness. However, if she only allows you to use the car on weekends because she wants to you to be in bed early on school nights, this is a compromise: you get to socialize with your friends sometimes, and she gets to make sure that you’re staying healthy and productive when you need to be.
Another example of selfish mothering might be if she returns home from work and demands that you stop whatever you’re doing and talk with her, regardless of whether you have other responsibilities or commitments. Her desire to talk with you about your day is healthy, but demanding attention on her own terms all the time is not. She may say that you are “ungrateful” if you do not respond to her demands in the way she wants.However, a desire to talk with you itself isn’t necessarily selfish, nor is expressing that desire in an unhelpful way. If your mom asks you to stop your homework and talk with her, and you tell her that you can’t because you have to get it done, she should acknowledge that and ask for an alternate time. This is a healthy compromise and acknowledges your needs as well as her own. This isn’t selfish, even if her initial communication felt irritating or self-centered.
Remember that in some cases, one of you may “lose” (or not get what you want), but in general, healthy relationships -- even between parents and children -- are marked by mutuality and compromise.
An example of a win-lose outcome for someone who no longer lives with her mother would be a mother who always asks to borrow money from her child but never pays her back and uses the money to gamble.

, Emotional manipulation is another hallmark of selfish behavior. A classic example of this is the parental “guilt trip.”The guilt trip may be unintentionally selfish -- your mother may feel like she’s just expressing her love for you -- but it is coercive and unhealthy, and can lead to resentment of her.For example, if you are looking at colleges and considering a few that are far away from where you live, your mother might attempt to emotionally manipulate you into staying closer to home by saying things like, “Fine, go to college in Wisconsin. I guess you don’t care that I’ll be lonely.”
As another example, she might become easily offended if you tell her no. For example, if she asks you to do something and you say you can’t, she may remind you “But I do so much for you. Nobody does as much for you as your mother.” She may try to make you feel like you take her for granted, or she may compare you unfavorably to someone who “loves” his mother.Guilt trips and other types of emotional manipulation are selfish because they don’t consider both people’s needs as valid. An emotionally manipulative or selfish mother will put her needs before yours, all or most of the time.If your mother guilt trips you, it’s very likely that she doesn’t realize that this type of interaction can cause real harm. Studies suggest that people who use guilt tripping are often so focused on getting what they want through this technique that they don’t realize it not only harms the other person, it can come back to haunt them later by encouraging you to disconnect., Believe it or not, sometimes parents can be selfish by giving you too much freedom to do what you want. Your mom’s rules may seem overly strict or pointless to you, but she has likely instituted them to give you a framework to keep you safe, healthy, and happy. If your mother lets you do whatever you want, whenever you want, without talking to you about boundaries or consequences, she could be being a selfish parent by not giving you the structure you need to develop.


For example, if your mother lets you smoke and drink underage because she doesn’t want to have to discipline you or help you end these bad habits, this is actually selfish behavior.
Emotional neglect is another sign of selfish parenting. If you often feel like you walk on eggshells around her because she is easily impatient, angry, or controlling, or you feel desperate to please her in the hopes of getting some validation or approval, your mother may be a narcissistic parent. This means that your relationship, in her mind, is all about her. Narcissists behave selfishly because they have difficulty empathizing, or putting themselves in someone else’s shoes and understanding their feelings.Another sign of emotional neglect is that you don’t feel acknowledged by her. Perhaps she asks about your feelings, but then doesn’t really listen and blows through them to talk about herself. Perhaps she dismisses you when you try to talk to her about your feelings or concerns. These are signs of a selfish, narcissistic mother."
"
Consider your own actions.,
Get social support.,
Define your own self-worth.,
Support yourself.,
Distance yourself.",How to Deal With a Selfish Mother2," You may think your mother is being selfish but be sure this judgment is not being driven by the fact that you just aren’t getting your own way. Think about whether what you are after or expecting from your mother is justified and reasonable.This is not to undermine or take lightly your opinion on thinking your mother is selfish. However, when we get upset we can view others in a way that we later decide is inaccurate or irrational. A relationship between parent and child is very significant, so it should not be taken lightly; extra caution is needed to evaluate the situation and decide how to move forward.
For example, you may feel that your mother is selfish because she keeps pressuring you to choose a particular major in college that she enjoys, but isn’t something you’re interested in. It’s possible that this is selfish, motivated by her desire to feel accomplished through you at any cost. It’s also possible that she believes she is doing the best for you by encouraging you to do something she thinks you will succeed at.
Think about your role in the situation. Have you expressed that you respect her opinion but will make your own choice? Or have you just been quiet and nodded your way through the 87th suggestion? She may not understand that she’s harassing you if you haven’t communicated your own ideas.

, If your mother is self-absorbed and does not give you the attention or emotional support that you feel you need, turn to others for that social support instead. Although no one can replace your mother, you do not need a replacement to feel better about yourself.Reach out to friends and other family members to counteract the stress that can result from having a selfish mother. Having social support can protect against stress and can make you feel better in general and about yourself in particular. Reach out online or through friends who have also have selfish mothers. It can help knowing that you are not alone in your struggle and it may be fruitful, too; you can put your heads together to figure out solutions to your shared problems., If your mother does not care when you achieve something, care that much more yourself about your achievements. If your mother makes you feel bad about yourself because she needs you to be “perfect” in order to feel good about herself, remind yourself that this is her problem, not yours.Do not let other people, even your mother, define how you feel about your own sense of worth. How you feel about yourself ultimately matters most as you are the one ultimately in charge of your life and your future.No one will care more about yourself than you, and so your opinion of you should matter most. Focus on achieving goals larger than yourself and not worrying about your situation with your mother, as much as possible. There are a couple of types of self-esteem. Global self-esteem is your attitude toward your whole self, who you are as a complete person. Specific self-esteem is your attitude about elements of yourself, such performance in school or at work, or your appearance.Both of these are important to feeling good about yourself.
Adaptive self-esteem is about being true to yourself; with this type, you feel authentic, and that makes you feel good about yourself. Maladaptive self-esteem is external: it comes from meeting standards that aren’t your own, or by comparing yourself to others.If you have a selfish mother, you may have low self-esteem because you have been taught to compare yourself to others or to external standards that aren’t meaningful to you. Try to reorient your focus on achieving goals and building traits that are meaningful to you and haven’t been dictated to anyone else. This will help you care less about what others, including your mother, think about you.
For example, if your mother has always told you that you need to lose weight and look more attractive, you may have low self-esteem about yourself. Try to find what is meaningful to you instead. If you decide you want to lose weight to feel more fit and healthy, go for it. If you decide that you like just where you are, be proud of that. The goal is to accept yourself and set your own standards for yourself, not allow anyone else to do it for you.
As another example, if you told your mother that you got a job promotion and work and she fires back with an envious response saying that what you do for a living is nothing to be proud of, think about her motives for saying something so nasty. Also think about what doing well at your job means for you, and you alone! Your mother does not have nearly as close to an idea, compared to you, about what goes on at your job and the impact you have. Keep in mind that you are the expert on your life, not her!

, You will be less influenced by, and thus better able to deal with, your mother's selfishness if you support yourself more instead of relying on her for things. You may even find that your relationship becomes more adult-like as you develop a better sense of autonomy and maturity; her selfishness may come to bother you less and this may help you deal with your relationship with her.


You can support yourself in multiple ways. Start by working toward making your own decisions more often. You may find that you can make decisions fine on your own but just never gave yourself the chance.
Another way to support yourself is to work toward meeting your own needs. In particular, learning how to comfort yourself will make you less reliant on your mother. Think hard about what comforts you and makes you happy. For example, you may find that you really calm down by listening to a specific song. If you feel yourself getting upset, acknowledge those feelings and address them by engaging in what calms you down. Treat yourself when you need it. If you have a selfish mother who does not show you enough love, show some love to yourself. Take yourself to the movies or a nice dinner. Pamper yourself with a manicure, or go shopping. Just make sure you don’t allow material “stuff” to take the place of affection -- then it’s an unhelpful crutch, rather than the occasional treat. , If your mother won't listen to you or change the things that are causing you pain and upset, do what you can to remove yourself from her sphere of influence as much as possible. Try to become less dependent on your mother; if she is self-absorbed she is not someone you want to be depending on, after all. Although it may be difficult at first, in the long run you will likely feel better for it.If you no longer live with your mother, try limiting your contact with her to special occasions or family gatherings.
Do not give into guilty feelings for distancing yourself from your mother if you truly believe she is selfish, self-absorbed, or narcissistic and cannot or is not willing to change. Although guilt motivates us to repair relationships, keep in mind that some relationships, even sometimes with your mother, are not worth repairing.That said, it is key that you have honestly assessed and accurately assessed your situation and have little reservation about the idea that your mother’s selfishness is corrosive to your well-being.

Talk to your mother about what concerns you.,
Understand where she is coming from.,
Focus on her behaviors, not her character.,
Use “I”-statements.,
Keep the hyperbole out of it.,
Emphasize your own needs.,
Set boundaries.,
Speak assertively.,
Suggest family counseling.,
Threaten distance.,
Cut your losses and move on.",How to Deal With a Selfish Mother3," If she is willing to listen, make sure not to be too aggressive, confrontational, or blaming; otherwise she will be less likely to consider changing. Always talk in a calm collected manner, even if she begins to yell, keep your cool.Keep in mind that it is very difficult to change others’ behaviors and ways of thinking, particularly if they are self-absorbed or narcissistic., Think hard about what is motivating your mother to act selfishly.Perhaps your mother is going through hardships of her own and is not meaning to be 'selfish'. If your mother is elderly and is in poor health, she may genuinely need more attention and help; her selfishness may be a necessity of her new station in life. If she was neglected as a child, she may be insecure in her relationships with others and this may be contributing to her selfish, self-absorbed personality. If you understand where she is coming from, you may change your mind on how selfish she is actually being; or if not, you will at least have some sense on how to confront her when the time comes.For example, if you think she is selfish because she was neglected as a child you may remind her that you also feel neglected and that you two should work together to break the family cycle by improving your relationship, not letting her parents’ and her past determine your shared future.

, Instead of saying things like “you are selfish,” phrase your complaints more along the lines of “I think that sometimes you act selfishly by doing ____”. This puts the emphasis on specific behaviors and refrains from directly making a character judgment. Judging her character will just put her on the defensive and make her upset; if you isolate her specific actions she will more easily see how she has been acting inappropriately; calling her selfish doesn’t give her anything to work with., Saying things like “You’re selfish” or “You aren’t being a good mother” justly put people on the defensive. If you use “you”-statements with your mother, she is likely to shut down and feel attacked, even if otherwise she would have been open to listening. Use “I”-statements to keep the focus on your feelings. Remember: you can’t know your mother’s intentions, but you can know your own feelings.


For example, instead of saying, “You’re inconsiderate and selfish,” use a specific “I”-statement: “I feel neglected when you rush past my day to talk about your own all the time. I would feel more valued as your child if you asked me questions about my life.”
Avoid should/ought statements, too, such as “You ought to listen to me more” or “You should be a better mother.” Keep the focus on yourself and how you feel: “I don’t feel heard when you brush my concerns off” or “I feel upset when you don’t acknowledge my accomplishments.”

, If your mother is selfish, it can feel like she is literally the most selfish person in the world and is ruining your life. Even if that feels like the truth, you will have much better success in talking with her if you avoid hyperbolic and overemotional language.


For example, avoid statements such as “Your selfishness is ruining my life.” Instead, go for something calm and balanced, such as “I have a hard time socializing with my friends when you do not let me use the car, even on weekends.” The facts are the same, but the latter statement is less blaming and judgmental, and may get a better response.

, Your mother's selfishness may be driven by a lack of awareness about what you need. There is a chance that she would be willing to change but that she just is oblivious to her own behavior.Tell your mother what you need out of your relationship with her; focus on the things that you can't do without. For example, you may need her to listen to you sometimes, or you may need her to be more encouraging, or less critical and judgmental, or you may need her to quit making all of the things that happen in your life ultimately about her.When telling her a list of your needs, also let her know about other things you would like from the relationship some day but that are not necessary to focus on right now. This will let her know that you are willing to compromise and that you are not being unreasonable by expecting her to immediately adopt changes in every way that you would like.
For example, you could say, “Mom, I could really use a pep-talk from you every now and then. I feel hurt when you don’t acknowledge any of my accomplishments and don’t want to hear about my day. I’d like you to put some time aside every week to listen to what’s going on in my life.”

, If your mom is being selfish in an intrusive way, such as by showing up to your house unannounced when she is not wanted there, or by failing to give you privacy if you live with her, let her know this is inappropriate.Tell her that her behavior is very frustrating and unacceptable. Start by setting small boundaries. The trick is to start small, like getting your foot in the door, and then building up to bigger boundaries once she is used to the smaller boundaries.Here's an example: if your mom shows up at your apartment most nights without being invited and then acts angry or hurt when you’re busy, setting a small boundary would be to say that you need her to call you before she comes over to visit. Setting a bigger boundary might be saying that you want to spend time with her, but that she has to call before she comes over and she can only visit you on Thursdays.
Remember that your mother wanting to spend time with you or do things with you isn’t inherently selfish. It is only selfish if she refuses to acknowledge your needs and desires when you talk to her about them. Often, some clear communication will make both of you happy.

, Let your mom know that you mean business when you talk to her about her selfish behavior so that she can better understand the gravity of the situation.Assertive communication is not the same thing as aggressive communication. Rather, it involves being direct and open about your feelings, thoughts, and beliefs in a way that is respectful of others' needs and points of view.Don't say something less assertive such as ""Mom, sometimes you may do things that seem to focus more on you than on other people, I could be wrong but it seems that way to me. Maybe we can talk about it sometime?""
Instead, be more assertive with something along the lines of: ""Mom, I feel hurt when you make inflexible demands of me even when I have other plans. I want to talk to you about this. I think we can have a better relationship than we currently do. I am willing to put in the effort if you are.""
You can avoid being unassertive by changing the way you think prior to speaking. Avoid thinking things such as ""I should keep quiet because I don't want to burden Mom with my thoughts"" or ""It could be embarrassing or awkward if I say what I think""; instead, think more assertive thoughts such as ""I have the right to say disagree with what Mom thinks"". , Sometimes family problems are too difficult to solve on their own and it can be much easier, more efficient, productive, and helpful to get outside assistance to deal with the underlying issues.


If you suggest family counseling, bring it up with your mother as the family having relationship issues that you think could use improvement; do not put the entire blame or emphasis on her.

, Selfish people fail to remember that relationships are not destined to permanency. Relationships, of any nature, involve some give and take, some reciprocal back and forth. If your mother is selfish, let her know the specific ways she treats you that you dislike and tell her that if she does not change you will not be able to be around her or treat her like a mom anymore. This may work better if you are an adult or no longer live with your mother.

, Save this as a last result, assuming it is an option for you. Sometimes you cannot salvage a relationship, even with your own mother. Keep that in mind as you attempt to navigate the tricky situation that you are in.If you live at home and do not have the means to move out, rather than letting your selfish mother get you down, make a focused plan for how to move out of the house or do well in school so that when the time comes, you can position yourself in a way that will allow you to remove yourself from the negative situation you are in.If you are a parent and have a family of your own, cut your losses with your mother and focus instead on being the most loving parent to your children that you can be. Turn her negative into your positive.
Let yourself grieve. If in evaluating your situation it seems that your relationship with your mother is dead or dying, allow yourself time to process this. Losing a mother to her own selfishness, self-absorption, or narcissism is a very real and painful experience. Do not deny the idea that it is a serious issue; instead, allow yourself to feel sorry but then focus on actionable, goal-directed change and improvement for how to improve your situation and your feelings."

Feel.,
Step Away.,
Comply.,
Seek support and guidance from adults who aren't like her.,
Learn how to become assertive rather than passive, passive-aggressive or aggressive in dealing with people.,
Watch for projection.","How to Deal With a Genuinely Stupid, Mean Mother As a Teen"," Yes, you wish your mother was sweet, gentle, understanding, kind. but no matter what don't be disrespectful,Just don't verbalize your feelings in front of her. It'll only make things worse for you. There's a very good chance your mother knows she's not very smart, and that makes her behave in mean ways. Reminding her of her shortcomings will not make life easier for you.;
, After you've given yourself the permission to cry, yell scream, etc., step away from your emotions. One of the more constructive ways to deal with your mother is with emotional detachment. No anger, whining, crying, begging, yelling, belittling.... just facts. If she intentionally does things to hurt you or make you angry, your best defense/offense is not letting yourself feel hurt or angry.

, Insofar as possible, do what she wants you to do before she asks. This gives her one less thing to be mean about and gives you the upper hand when you ask for what you want.

, Pay close attention to the ideas of friends' mothers who are more gentle, consistent and responsible. Get outside information. Much of what you're being told every day is sabotaging and may be wrong. Instead of just getting mad at her for steering you wrong, seek sources of better information and remember what they say. Question anything she says about you or about life and compare it with what ministers, therapists, teachers, healthier adults say. Examine everything in your life because these things don't blow up out of nowhere. They get passed on by generations and you don't want to continue the cycle.

, This can be studied, even in books it can help to understand the family dynamic and choose your own path in life. It may make her even angrier if you don't respond to the usual mind games in the usual way, but it's important to build some inner resistance to protect your mind and soul.

, Don't be surprised if you get accused of things you wouldn't even think of doing - if she does them, she expects you to do them whether you would or not. Cruel mothers don't always have that good a grip on reality and can't tell the difference between when you're behaving well or not. The best thing to do is behave well anyway and try to spend more time with other people so they can see the situation for themselves.

Think clearly about what's bothering you.,
Request that your mom meet you in a neutral environment.,
Use ""I"" statements during your talk.,
Be gentle.,
Learn to stand your ground.,
Bend -- a little.",How to Deal With a Controlling Mother1," Make a list of all the things you want to discuss with her. In what areas does your mother's controlling become too much? Your appearance? Your career choices? Your relationships? Your children? If your list is really long, try to condense it and focus on the things that get under your skin the most.


Preparing to discuss your mother's control problem is a smart idea in order to easily present your argument and minimize any unnecessary hurt feelings. Plus, the earlier you confront your mother, the better. Overbearing parents can create trouble in future relationships and be a detriment to your problem-solving abilities.If you think it will help, practice in the mirror what you think you will say, or have a friend or partner act the scenario out with you.;
, A controlling mother can swiftly guilt-trip you or take over a discussion if she is in comfortable territory. Meet in a public place so that the discussion feels formal, and so that both you and your mother have no choice but to keep your tempers on a leash.Suggested locations to have this talk can be at a restaurant over lunch, at a coffee shop, or on a park bench. Avoid talking while driving or over the phone. A face-to-face conversation is a must.
Be sure to give your mom a heads up as to why the two of you are meeting. Don't blindside her with a serious discussion. Let her know that you have some things on your mind you would like to talk to her about.

, Psychologists and interpersonal communications experts say that using this form of communication is less likely to make a person defensive and more likely to persuade them to cooperate.Say things like, ""I feel like you are controlling me when you tell me how to dress or how my hair should look. In the future, could you be more mindful that I have different tastes than you?"" instead of ""You make me upset when you keep bugging me about my hair or clothing choices.""
By using the ""I"" statement, you are taking ownership for your feelings rather than presenting them as though they are entirely your mother's fault. This tactic can make her more empathetic to your situation.

, If your mother tries to control your life all the time, you may get very upset. Still, keep in mind that she is your mother, so try to be easy on her and not bash all her parenting skills. It's highly possible that she is not even aware of her behavior, and once you point the problem out to her she will be willing to adjust her controlling attitude.


Another tactic to minimize her hurt feelings is by using the ""sandwich method"". This is a form of constructive criticism in which a critical statement is sandwiched between two complimentary statements.One suggestion for an adult with a controlling mother might look like this: ""Mom, you have been very helpful with the new baby. But, and I feel like you are not respecting our parenting choices. With a few adjustments, I feel like we will all get along really well.""

, It's important to pick and choose your battles with your mother. In some cases, her voicing her opinion about this or that is virtually harmless. However, when the two of your are at odds about an important matter, you need to assert yourself.With important topics such as choosing a college major or taking a job, assert your opinion and remind her that the decision will ultimately affect you the most. Demonstrate confidence in your decisions, and she will respect your voice more.
Do your research and provide a list of pros and cons about your choice. Doing so will impress her and show her that you are not making any decisions impulsively, but thinking things over to decide what's best.

, This may be the last thing you want to hear, but learning to pick your battles also means, at some point, you will actually take your mother's advice. Remember, that you only want to bend on issues that aren't huge decisions affecting your future.


By giving in on some occasions, you are more likely to earn credit with your mother. Therefore, during times when you are firm on your decision, you can subtly remind her that you took her advice on other matters but you really want to be the one who makes the choice on the current one.
Your attitude also could make a major difference in how controlling your mom is in your life. Bend a little by expressing your gratitude for thoughtful solutions and suggestions she has given you in the past. This method will demonstrate to your mom that you are at least listening to her point-of-view, even if your final decision is your own and not hers."
"
Talk during a non-stressful time.,
Express yourself honestly.,
Keep calm.,
Affirm their feelings.,
Be clear about your goals for your relationship.,
Be optimistic and avoid the defensive.",How to Deal With a Domineering Mother1," Sit your mom down for a talk after she has had time to wind down from her day. If you know she has a lot going on at work or at home, delay the conversation to a less busy time. Cook dinner or wash the dishes so she has less to do and you’ll have more time to talk.

Pull her aside and say “Hey Ma, can I talk to you about something? It’s been on my mind for a while.”;
, Be direct and truthful with your mom about how her behavior is affecting you. Tell her about how you want and need more independence in your life to be happier. Appeal to her from both an emotional and a logical standpoint.

You can say “Mom, it bothers me that you won’t let me choose my own clothes for school. I am getting older everyday and it’s embarrassing. I’m trying to become more responsible and mature, but I feel like you won’t even let me make the smallest decisions.”

, Your mom may not react well to this discussion. She might yell or get very upset with you. However, be calm and keep your voice at a neutral tone. Keep your hands in your lap and practice deep breathing so that you don’t get worked up.It is okay to cry, as this is an emotional discussion. But try to avoid allowing your emotions to consume you. You want to seem mature and put together.

, When your mom starts to make her own points, don’t dismiss them. Instead let her know that you hear her, even if you don’t agree. Remind her that you love and respect her.Say something like “I know you’re scared that I could get hurt if I play basketball. I understand that. But Mom, I don’t want to live my life based on fears. I really love basketball and want to play.”

, After you have talked more about the things that bother you, tell your mom what you’d like to do moving forward. Be positive and forward thinking during this part of the conversation instead of harping on the negatives.Say something like “I would like more of a say on my curfew. It has been 9PM for the last two years, and since I’m 18 now, I think that moving it to 11PM makes sense. I have never broken curfew or gotten into trouble, so I’ve proven that I’m responsible.”

, Using phrases like “you always” followed by something negative are sure to put your mother on defense. Instead of doing this, use concrete examples of things that have frustrated you. Set a tone of improving your relationship rather than blaming her for all problems.Say “Mom, on Tuesday when you called me five times back to back, that was really stressful. I was at work and had to finally pick up and my manager got upset. If you call me once, I promise to always call you back as soon as I am able.”

"
"
Establish your boundaries.,
Explain why you cannot do something.,
Negotiate more reasonable expectations.,
Empathize with her.",How to Deal with a Controlling Mother As a Teen Mom1," Write down a list of everything that your mother expects of you that you find unreasonable. Once you have determined what types of freedoms you want, you can carve out boundaries. Express these boundaries clearly to your mother. Let her know that you are still willing to communicate and work with her but that you cannot blindly submit to all of her expectations.


For example, inform her how much notice you need to do something. Say, “I’m happy to help out around the house, but please give me at least an hour’s notice to do something so that I can finish my other work as well.”
You should consistently reinforce these boundaries.For example, if she tells you that you should not let the child watch TV, you can say, “Thanks for your advice, but as their mother, I think that it should be ok for them to watch a few cartoons.”;
, If your mother demands that you do something that you are unable or are unwilling to do, give her a good reason up front or see if you can provide her with a reasonable alternative. She may just be frustrated about something that needs to get done, and not actually mad at you. This will establish that you are not rebelling but rather you have legitimate reasons why you can't obey. Do not simply answer “no” or “I can’t.”For example, if your mom is trying to restrict your movement outside of the house, instead of responding, ""That's unfair,"" you can state, “I know you are looking out for me, but I don’t think it’s healthy for my child and I to be cooped up in the house all day. I’m going to take them to the park.”

, Asserting your independence means that you may have to continuously renegotiate boundaries, expectations, and rules based on your present situation. When your mother expresses a new rule or demand, gently reply with a counter-offer. This should take her demands into account while giving you more freedom and room.


For example, if your mother expects you to report everywhere you go, you can say, “I will call you at three o’clock to update you, but I don’t think I can check in more often than that.”
If you are still in school, it can be extremely difficult to finish your schoolwork while caring for a child of your own. If your mother is nagging you about your grades, tell her that you are working as hard as you can. You can say, “My education is important to me, but so is my kid. Whatever grade I get, I’ll know I tried my hardest.”

, Your mother probably wants the best for you. While this may manifest as controlling behavior, try to step back and see things from her perspective. Not only will this help you appreciate the good things that she does but it may help you find a way to get around her more overbearing characteristics.If you are living with your mother or depending on her for financial support, understand that she might be stressed too. She may not have expected to help raise another baby. Perhaps she was planning on saving money for retirement that is now using to help care for your child. Maybe she has to take extra shifts at work. Although she may be controlling, her attempts to guide you may be a sincere expression of her love.
Be sure to express your gratitude for her help and look for opportunities to do things to show her how much you appreciate her help. No one likes to make great sacrifices and feel unappreciated for them.

Daydream about the future.,
Make a long-term plan.,
Express yourself creatively.,
Talk to a therapist.,
Write your parent a letter.",How to Deal With a Bad Parent1," Daydreaming sometimes gets a bad rap, but there are many benefits to daydreaming. Daydreaming is associated with increased creativity, enhanced memory, empathy, and improved mood. Plus, it’s easy, it doesn’t cost anything, and it’s a wonderful way to cope with your problems at home., You may not be able to pack up and leave tomorrow, but eventually it will be time to go. Heading out on your own requires a great deal of planning, so begin formulating your strategy now. How do you plan to save up enough money to survive? Where do you want to go? Will you head off to school, to the military, or simply to a new city? Form a plan by talking to people who are older than you, speaking with a guidance counselor at school, and/or doing some research on your own. Then, set your plan into motion., Anytime you have negative emotions or a bad situation to deal with, one excellent way to cope is to express yourself creatively. This might be writing in a journal, drawing a picture, or writing a song. This is a great way to process your emotions, and help you cope with your bad parent., Sometimes you may need someone to talk to who has no connection to the situation at hand, and who you can trust 100%. A good choice for this is a therapist. A good therapist can help you sort through your problems at home and find a way to deal with them.If you do not want to approach your parent about helping you find a therapist or if your parent has said no, then you can also talk to the guidance counselor at your school for help.
If your parent says no based on financial reasons, then it might be helpful to let your parent know that some therapists offer a sliding scale for patients who cannot afford the regular fees. You may be able to pay as little as $10 per session.A therapist may also be able to help you and your parent develop a better relationship. If you think that your parent might be open to therapy, then try saying something like, ""I would like our relationship to improve, but I think we might need some help. I am willing to do some therapy with you so that we could work on that. Is that something you would be willing to do too?""

, Many issues between family members can be solved through communication. When we communicate face-to-face, however, things can get heated, and it can be very difficult to get across what you want to say. If you feel that you may be able to sort out the issues you have with your parent, think about writing them a letter.Even if you have no intention of giving them the letter, taking the time to write it can be an excellent way to process what you’re feeling. Then, simply throw it away.

Drink water.,
Divert your mind.,
Remind yourself that everyone has misunderstandings and differences.,
Think in your parents' shoes.,
Let your parents cool down, as well.,
Speak to the issue in a mature and responsible way.,
Solve your problem without crying.,
Give it rest for awhile.",How to Cool Down when You're Mad at Your Parents," This can help to calm you. Follow this with deep breathing to calm any racing feelings and fast breathing. Sit somewhere quiet and peaceful, to recover your thoughts.;
, Try to think about things that you care about or that are coming up soon. Are there any exciting things going on? Planning a cool trip soon? By trying to focus on the things that are good in your life, it can help to place the argument into perspective.

, Conflict is a normal part of being human and it is important to learn how to handle conflict maturely and considerately as you grow up. Consider learning how to respond to criticism, and how to use persuasion to turn a no into a yes, and how to gain compromises. These are far more constructive ways to resolve your issues than fighting.

, Why do you think that they did what they did? For example, there's probably a reason you can't go to that late-night movie. If you try to perceive their reasons for stopping you from doing something or for insisting that you do something you don't want to, it may help you to work through the longer term consequences and to see that their experience is actually being used to help, not hinder, you.

, You'll just get yourself into more trouble if you try to explain your opinion when they're still mad. When everyone is in a heightened state of tension and anger, it's best that everyone gets the space to calm down and then come back and resolve the matter later.

, Use the ""I feel"" statement. For example: ""I feel... when... because..."". Say this without any essence of anger. It allows you to express your concerns without stating blame or refusal to accept your need to be responsible in the resolution.


Can you think of a suitable compromise that they might be willing to agree to? For example, go to the early evening movie rather than the late evening one? Go out with a group instead of just a boyfriend? And so forth...

, Though crying sometimes helps, crying in front of your parents will lead them in the wrong direction. After a time, crying is simply unhelpful because it fails to resolve things and it isn't meant to be a manipulative tool; it's for getting over the worst of how you feel, then letting you start over, afresh.

, If you discover that your parents still don't understand you, leave the topic. It is probably just getting worse by going on about it while the anger and tension is still fresh. Perhaps give it a month or two before raising it again, and do so on a very different way that shows you've learned your lesson and have come up with alternative solutions likely to meet with their agreement instead.

Let go of expectations.,
Stop constantly trying to please her.,
Refrain from accepting money from your mother.,
Set boundaries.It may seem harsh to draw lines when it comes to your mother.,
Get some distance.If your mom's excessive need for controlling is really troubling you, and she doesn't seem to be willing to change, it may be necessary for you to distance yourself from her for a while.",How to Deal With a Controlling Mother2," Chances are, even if your mother has been extremely controlling all of your life, you still are holding out hope that someday she might change. She may eventually change, but that will be up to her. You have to make peace with how she is now and stop wishing for her to suddenly become a different person.When you hold on to expectations, you set yourself up for disappointment. If you didn't expect your mother to magically release her controlling hold on you, her not fulfilling that expectation wouldn't hurt so bad.
By expecting her to change, you are also removing responsibility from yourself. No, you are not responsible for how your mother controlled your life in the past. You are responsible for how you allow her to continue to do this into the future.

, Your mother may be at fault for being overbearing and controlling, but you are at fault for constantly playing into her hand. Your trying to always satisfy her has only reinforced her controlling nature.The only thing wrong with trying to please everyone is that there's always at least one person who will remain unhappy: you.
Of course, it's important to respect your mother, and maybe even consider her point-of-view. Plus, bending a little might put you in her good graces. Still, you don't have to always bend to her way of thinking simply to make her happy or prevent discord in your relationship.

, If at all possible, you need to cut off financial ties. If you are an adult who has been steadily accepting money from your mother over the years, then she may think her contribution earns her the right to make choices for you.Your mom might think you are incapable of taking on adult responsibilities if you have been requiring extra money from her to make purchases or pay bills. Handling your own expenses will show her that you are a responsible adult who doesn't need managing.
Teens and young adults can demonstrate autonomy by spending more carefully or getting a part-time job to make their own money. Yes, you may still live under your mother's roof, but you can express disagreement with your mother more easily if you are pulling some of your own weight in the household.

, But, if her excessive need for control is causing you distress, you need to devise a solution that allows you to assert yourself as an adult.


Does you mother call you throughout the day, reminding you to do this or that? Tell her that you will start putting reminders in your phone, and that she no longer needs to do this. Try to limit phone conversation to one per day, with the exception of emergencies.
Does your mother frequently drop by your house, or enter your room and go through your things? Sit down with her and tell her how this bothers you and hinders your ability to blossom into a fully functioning adult. Make an agreement for her to limit visitations to certain days of the week. And in the case of living in the same house, she should only enter your room in your presence and after knocking.,


Emotional and psychological distance may consist of sharing less of your personal life with your mother, which gives her little opportunity to interfere. When she inquires about a sensitive subject that you know she will be controlling about, gently tell her you would rather not talk about it.
Distance can also be physical such as moving to a new city or coming home to visit her less often. Keep in mind, that this is an extreme mode of action. Family can be one of the biggest support systems you have, so moving away from them can be daunting to both parties. However, if you think it's the only way to live your life on your own terms, then go for it.
As you plan to get distance from your mother, try to include her in the process. Reassure her that you have and will always love her. You will still be her daughter or son. You just need more space to grow into the person you want to be.

"
"
Remind yourself that you are in control of your life.,
Look at her comments as advice, not law.,
Recognize and thank her for good ideas.,
Carve out a personal space.,
Make your own desires clear and consistent.,
Notice the patterns of your mom's behavior.,
Remember that her desire to control you is based in love.",How to Deal With a Controlling Mother3," Ultimately, a controlling mother may try and run your life, but you are in ultimate control of things. Remembering this will help you take her ""suggestions"" in stride, and move out from under her control.


Every discussion doesn't have to turn into an argument -- you get to choose what gets blown up and out of proportion as well. If the advice or controlling doesn't really affect you, try to politely nod and move on with your life.

, Instead of feeling like you need to heed her every word, start viewing her controlling statements as just another piece of advice. Acknowledge her words, and let her know you'll think about them seriously.

, Show her that you are listening and you care about her opinion by thanking her when she has a good idea or helps you out. This will also make it easier to politely turn down a suggestion or break from her ""established"" rules, as you can show that you are objectively heeding her good advice and ignoring the bad.

, You need a spot to go when you want to be alone, and you should use this space when you feel an unwanted fight brewing or need some time to run your own life. Separation is key to maintaining healthy, happy relationships of any kind, so make sure you have boundaries you can stick by.


Setting boundaries is important when dealing with controlling mothers. If you want privacy in your room, ask for it and stand by your decision. Similarly, you mother should know the times you want to spend alone, such as with friends, and when not to visit.

, Talk to your mom from time to time. She may be controlling because she doesn't know what is going on in your life. Thus, she may overreact and try and control everything about you, hoping to become a major figure again as you're growing up. Talking to your mom openly and honestly about your plans, hopes, and goals is a great way to slowly break down the need to control you.

, Are there some things she controls and some she doesn't? Are there times of the day, like after work, where she seems stressed and hard to deal with? Remember, parent's have their own lives to deal with, and it is impossible to fully separate that work life from their home persona. So, notice what issues make her controlling, and the times of the day she is most demanding. Avoid these times, or find ways to make them easier for her and lower stress.

, Being a parent is hard, hard work. Moms are tasked with raising needy, clueless children into responsible, helpful adults, all while living their own lives as well. You mean the world to your mom, and her methods may seem controlling to you, but that is only because she wants the best life for her son or daughter. Recognizing that she comes from a place of love will make it easier to accept her for her controlling tendencies.

Assess your own faults.,
Show that you are responsible.,
Compromise together.,
Be assertive.,
Find an outlet for your anger.,
Enlist the help of your other parent.",How to Deal With a Domineering Mother2," Though you may feel that you have done nothing wrong, determine if there is anything at all that you can improve on. You might yell at her sometimes or rarely clean up after yourself. Though you can’t control your mom, you can control yourself and work to minimize the issues you have with her., Domineering mothers often have a hard time letting go of control of their children and letting them be adults. Show your mother that you are responsible so that she feels comfortable letting you make your own decisions.

Complete your chores, take on more responsibilities in the home, and keep your promises to your parents.

, Your mom’s control might stem from simply trying to be involved in your life. Though she displays this desire in an unhealthy way, try to find a way to let her in. See if she’ll let you stay out later on Saturday night if you do more chores that morning.If she is nervous about you going away to college, set up a communication plan and safety plan so she feels more secure.

, Your mom might be so domineering that you feel scared around her at times. However, begin to establish assertiveness in small ways. Look her in the eyes during conversations. Speak up, keep your voice strong and steady, and hold your head high., Your mom’s control over you is probably so frustrating at times that you want to scream. Instead of lashing out at her or others, find a more productive way to channel your anger. Take up a hobby like painting, drawing, or writing poems. Sit in a hot bath to soothe yourself or meditate.You can also vent to someone you trust.

, Perhaps your dad, second mom, or step parent is far less domineering than your mother. Sit down and have a talk with them to see if they can help you or give advice. They might be able to talk to your mom for you or have a tip on how to deal with her.

Pull them aside and say “Hey Dad, I’m not trying to go behind Mom’s back or anything, but I’m starting to feel smothered. She won’t even let me close my bedroom door to do homework. Do you have any advice or can you talk to her for me?”

Become financially independent.,
Spend time with others and with yourself.,
Limit your interactions.,
Separate yourself from her completely.,
Get help together.",How to Deal With a Domineering Mother3," Your mother might be controlling your life through your finances. If you are a teen, talk to your mom about getting a part time job to pay for any of the things she is using to control you, like your phone or car. If you are older, save up your money to move out and pay all your bills on your own., Try not to get so caught up in your relationship with your mom that you forget about your other relationships. Spend time alone doing the things that you enjoy. Hang out with your friends when you can to keep those connections strong, as well., If possible, limit the amount of time that you spend with your mother. If you still live at home, this will be difficult, but you can try to spend more time alone in your room or you can engage with her less. If you are living away from home, visit and answer her calls less often.When she asks why you’re distant, you can let her know that her controlling behavior has been stressing you out.

, If her controlling behavior is beginning to affect your health, then it might be time to cut the cords. If she has done something to negatively affect your work life or to harm your children, then distance may be necessary.If she shows to you at some point that she is able to change, then consider allowing her back into your life.

, Your mom’s domineering personality might have reached an unhealthy limit. If nothing seems to get her to back off, or if she is starting to harm you physically or emotionally, get help. Talk to a teacher or counselor about these issues. If your mom is open to change, see if she is willing to go to therapy with you."
"
Come to her as a mother seeking advice.,
Explain to her that you need some space.,
Use “I” statements.,
Deflect guilt.,
Work out a solution together.,
Remain calm.",How to Deal with a Controlling Mother As a Teen Mom2," Find a time when your mom is not busy or distracted, and ask her if you can have a serious conversation with her to get some advice. When you start this conversation, you should both express your gratitude to her for being your mother while asserting your own desire to be a good mother yourself.


You can say something like, “Mom, I was hoping we could talk about the types of expectations and rules that are placed on me. I want to be a good mother, but I find that difficult when I am still being treated like a child. What do you think we could do to improve the situation?”

, Let your mother know what the problem is so that you can both work towards finding a solution. In doing this, avoid blaming your mother, but do emphasize your need for more space and freedom within the home.


If you do not want your mother interfering with your parenting as often, you can say, “I know you raised children yourself and that you are giving me advice, but I need to be able to parent my own child in my own way.”
Emphasize to her how much you have matured since having a child. You can say, “I know I’m young, but I’ve had to grow up quite a bit. I need more space if I’m going to grow any more as a person.”
You can also emphasize how important it is for you to protect your child and do right by them. This may help her to feel more comfortable and let go of control because she will know that your child is safe.
If you are 18 or older, you can say, “I am a legal adult now, and I’m a parent. It is not reasonable to confine me to the house or to micromanage my day.”

, “I” statements are sentences that express your situation by using “I” instead of “you.” These allow you to state how a problem makes you feel without blaming the other person. These statements can help you have a serious conversation with your mother without her becoming defensive.Start sentences with phrases like ""I feel,"" ""I think,"" or ""I believe"" to avoid starting conflict.
For example, instead of saying, “you’re controlling my life and making me do everything,” you can say, “Right now, I am expected to cook, clean, and run errands while finishing my education, working at a job, and taking care of a young child. I feel stressed constantly, and I can't balance everything. Can you help me figure this out?”

, Your mother may try to exert control over you by establishing how she contributes financially to your life or how much she helps out with the baby. You should make it clear that while you appreciate her doing these things, you need space and freedom.


Thank her for what she does, but assert that her assistance does not give her control over your life. For example, you can say, “I am very grateful for your help, but I still need to make my own decisions in life.”
Let her know that you are happy to continue doing major things like going to school, but more minor things should be left up to your discretion.

, Try to find common goals and actions that both you and your mother agree on before working out a plan that both of you can achieve together. You may need to compromise on some points.Both you and your mother probably agree that your child needs to be raised in a loving, harmonious home. You might want to start with this point, and see how you both can work towards creating a peaceful environment for your child.
If you feel as though you cannot handle your responsibilities around the house, see if you and your mother can agree on a new set of responsibilities. For example, perhaps you will only be responsible for washing the laundry for you and your child instead of the entire household’s.
You may want to ask for an hour or two a day that you cannot be bothered. For example, you might state that you need at least an hour after school to finish your homework. During this time, your mom may not disturb you.

, Such conversations can quickly become heated. Yelling, blaming, and insulting your mother will not achieve anything; it may only worsen your relationship. As you speak to your mother, use a calm, even tone. Take pauses if you’re worried that you will start to get upset.Try taking a deep breath before you respond to your mother to help you calm yourself down. You can also count to five or ten to give yourself a little more time.
Bring a stress ball to the conversation, which you can discreetly squeeze as you talk. This can may help you divert your anxious energy.
You may also want to rehearse or even write down what you want to say ahead of time to help you if you start to get nervous.

Talk to a counselor.,
Join a support group.,
Appeal to your other parent.,
Find a mental outlet.",How to Deal with a Controlling Mother As a Teen Mom3," If you are in school, try to talk to your school’s nurse, counselor, or social worker for more advice. If you are not in school, talk with your health insurance provider to find out if you may be eligible for counseling and if there are mental health professionals in your area. They may be able to provide you with specific, local resources that can help you in your situation. They also may be able to offer psychological assistance during this time., There are many support groups for teen mothers that are available both in person and online. These groups can allow you to vent your feelings to people removed from the situation. Some people within the group may have had similar issues with their own parents. They may be able to offer you resources and advice tailored to your specific situation.


You can contact your local department of social and health services, council, or school district to see if they offer support groups for young moms.

Young Mommies and Young Mom Support are online support groups for teenage parents.

, If you can, talk to your other parent or a close friend or sibling of your mother’s to see if they can help you reach out to your mother. They can have a private conversation with your mother to convince her to relax her control.


You can say, “I’m really struggling right now, and I was hoping you could talk to mom to help her understand what I’m going through.”
If your parents are separated, you might want to consider if living with the other parent may be an option for you.

, Teen parents often isolate themselves and thus become socially distant from their peers. This can lead to depression and other mental health problems. To help you remain healthy and happy, try to pick up new hobbies that you can do from home while watching your child. These can be creative activities, calming routines, or online social groups. Some outlets you might consider include:


Writing in a journal
Meditation
Yoga
Starting a blog for other teen moms

Create a five-year plan.,
Apply for part-time jobs.,
Find ways to pursue an education.,
Consider your relationship with the child’s father.,
Look for financial aid.,
Find alternative living arrangements if your relationship worsens.",How to Deal with a Controlling Mother As a Teen Mom4," It can take a long time to become successfully independent, but the best way to achieve those goals is to create a solid plan for the future. Your counselor can help you through this process. If you are enrolled at a school, then there is likely a career counseling or planning department that can help you. Ask yourself where you want to be in five years, and make a plan to get there.Start by making a list of ten steps that you can achieve in those five years. For example, you may want to graduate college, get a job, find your own apartment, or afford quality childcare.
Break each larger goal into small, practical, and actionable steps.For example, if you want to be able to get a degree, your steps might be to research local programs, find part-time solutions, apply for financial aid, and build a schedule around your child’s needs.
Understand that you may not achieve all of your goals within five years, but if you start working now, you will have made significant progress.

, A part-time job will allow you to start earning money while giving you a certain degree of flexibility. By earning your own money, you can begin to earn financial dependence away from your mom.Restaurants and retail stores may be a good place to start looking for a job. You may even be able to find an office job answering phones or running errands
If your mother is opposed to you getting a job, have a talk with her. She may be concerned about your education or worried about the cost of child care. Explain to her how important it is for you to start earning your own money. Also, remind her that it is good for your child to see you working hard and making an effort to improve yourself.

, It can be very difficult to graduate as a young parent, but a good education will help you get better jobs and a more independent lifestyle. Many teen parents graduate high school and pursue traditional four-year college degrees, but if this is not possible for you, you can look at other options that can let you work, raise a child, and study at the same time.


Check with your school district to see if there are special high school courses or drop-out prevention programs available for teen parents.High school diplomas and GEDs may be available through online virtual schools. This is a good option if you cannot arrange child care during school hours.
Community College is cheaper than traditional college. After two years, you may have the option to transfer to a four-year university to earn a bachelor’s degree.
If you do not want to pursue academic education, you can always get vocational training or an apprenticeship to study a trade like plumbing or cooking., If you are still in a relationship with the child’s father or if the father is involved in your child’s life, you might consider what types of support you can expect from him as you transition to an independent living situation.Are you still in a relationship? If not, are you at least on friendly terms?
Is the father involved in the child’s life? What types of support does he provide to the child?
Does the father’s family contribute to the child’s upbringing at all?
Would it ever be possible to move in with him or his family?
Can you rely on the father or the father’s family to watch the child while you are working or studying?

, Children can be expensive, and if you are going to transition into a financially independent situation, you should find other avenues of financial support outside of your family. Check with your local government if you are eligible for certain types of support as a young mother.


In the US, you can apply for assistance through the Pregnancy Assistance Fund (PAF), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Contact your local Department of Social and Health Services to apply for any of these grants.In the UK, both you and your parents may be eligible for child benefits, child tax credits, income support, a Sure Start Maternity Grant, or Healthy Start vouchers. Apply to your local council for more information.In Canada, you may be eligible for social assistance, such as Basic Income Assistance, Daycare or Alternative Childcare Benefits, and Postnatal Benefits.If the child’s father is not contributing to the child’s upbringing, you may consider suing him for child support.

, It might take a few years for you to save enough money to move into your own place, but if your mother is becoming abusive or if she is threatening to kick you out, you may need to locate a temporary living situation for you and your child.


If your relationship with the child’s father is good, you might ask if you can stay with him or his family.
Ask friends and extended family members if they would be willing to take you in for a short amount of time.
Look into finding a roommate or two to help cover the costs of rent and utilities. Just make sure to thoroughly inspect anyone who will be living with you and your child.
Check to see if there is a Covenant House or a similar program in a city near you. Covenant House offers programs for homeless mothers and children in 30 cities in the US, Canada, and Central America."

Join a sports team.,
Audition for a play.,
Find an after school job.,
Hang out with friends.,
Visit other family members.",How to Deal With a Bad Parent2," If you enjoy physical activity or would like a reason to exercise, a sports team is an excellent way to get out the house. Furthermore, team sports encourage teamwork, discipline, and cooperation. If you excel at sports, you may even be able to earn a scholarship., If sports are not your thing, auditioning for a play or joining the drama club may be a good fit. If you have an outgoing personality, a part in the school play may be perfect for you. If you don’t see yourself onstage, there are also many behind-the-scenes roles (like stage crew or lighting design) that you might enjoy.

, If school really isn’t your thing, you probably aren’t going to want to spend more time there. Another option for getting out of the house is to secure some part-time employment. An after school job is wonderful for teaching you punctuality, responsibility, and time-management. Best of all, it can put some money in your pocket, which you can save up to enable you to move out when you become old enough., Maybe your life is stressful enough and you don’t want to create more work or take on additional responsibilities. That’s OK! Simply spend more time outside of the house hanging out with your friends. Go see a concert, visit a museum, or take a walk around the park. Time with friends can reduce stress and boost your mood while getting you out of the house., Another healthy way to spend time outside of your house is to visit your other family members. Do you have grandparents, cousins, or older siblings that live near-by? Take some time to go and visit them. You may want to discuss your problems with them, or maybe not. In any case, spending time with family is sure to lift your mood and help you cope."

Identify abuse.,
Talk to someone.,
Submit a report.,
Consider a change in custody.,
Emancipate yourself.",How to Deal With a Bad Parent3," Federal legislation defines child abuse as “Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation""; or “An act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm."" Take some time to consider whether you and your parents are simply have a rough patch, or if you experiencing abuse., The first step in taking serious action against this abuse is to gain the support of a trusted adult. This might be a teacher at school, your guidance counselor, your therapist, the parent of a close friend, or another relative. Explain to them everything that has happened to you, and ask for their help in stopping the abuse.

, The adult who is helping you should contact Child Protective Services (CPS). Sit down with your adult helper and generate a list of any and all abuse you have experienced. Include as many specifics (details and dates) as you can. Then find your local CPS office and have your adult go in person (with your list) to submit the report., Do you have another parent or grandparent who could gain custody of you? You may want to talk to them about taking your abusive parent to court. This requires a visit to a lawyer who can assist your parent or grandparent with filing the appropriate paperwork.Be aware that this can take a long time, and you may need to be in contact with your abusive parent during this time.
These laws vary from state to state, but in most cases the count will strongly consider the opinions of the child.

, If you are a teenager and you are supporting yourself financially, you may want to consider legally emancipating yourself. This involves filing a petition for emancipation (at your local Circuit Court), paying a fee ($150-200), and attending a court hearing.Before you pursue emancipation, you must be employed, and you must secure a place to live outside of your parents home (and be able to prove this to the court).
Depending on your district, filing for emancipation can usually be done without a lawyer.
The emancipation process is much smoother if your parents agree.

Listen to your parents.,
Do what your parents ask you to do.,
Avoid arguing with your parents.",How to Become the Child Your Parents Always Dreamed Of1," It’s important to remember that your parents have more life experience than you; therefore, they know more than you. In fact, there’s a saying “Father knows best.” So, no matter how much you think you know, your parents will know more and will know what’s best for you. By paying attention to your parents, you are letting them know that you care about hearing what they have to say. There are some things that you can do to show your parents that you’re not only listening, but you’re actually hearing them.


Give your parents your undivided attention. You are demonstrating to your parents that you’re open to communicating with them and you respect what they have to say.
Don’t try to talk over your parents while they are talking. This is a sure sign that you’re more interested in talking rather than listening.
Don’t be rude by talking back to your parents or by interrupting them with rude remarks. Making rude comments creates tension and things can quickly escalate.
Avoid pouting, whining, throwing a tantrum, or making gestures and faces to indicate your irritation with your parents.
Don’t ignore your parents when they are talking to you or asking you to do something. By ignoring your parents, you’re showing them that what they have to say doesn’t really matter, which may cause them to become agitated and upset.;
, Once you reach a certain age, you may think that it’s okay to do what you want to do instead of what your parents ask you to do. Remember that they are your parents and not your friends. If they ask you to do something, make sure that you do it even if it doesn’t make sense to you or you don’t feel like doing it.


Make sure that you do your chores. It’s best if your parents don’t have to keep asking you to do your chores. If you know what you have to do, whether it’s daily or weekly, make sure that you get it done.
Don’t be lazy. One of the best things that you can do for your parents is to be helpful. Not only is it important to do your personal chores, but you can offer additional help with things like yardwork, putting the groceries away, preparing meals, doing the laundry, walking the dog, and washing the car.

, It’s common to think that your parents are wrong and you’re right. Even if you are right, you don’t have to prove you’re right by arguing with your parents. There’s a saying “You don’t want to win the battle and lose the war.” It’s okay to disagree with your parents, but by constantly arguing with your parents, you run the risk of shutting down future communication between you and your parents.


Be patient throughout your conversation with your parents.
Avoid raising your voice by calmly stating your point of view.
Allow your parents an opportunity to share their point of view.

Say ""please"" and ""thank you."",
Watch your tone.,
Be responsible for your own mess.",How to Be Respectful of Your Family1," You don't like it when someone demands you do something without asking nicely. In a family situation, it's easy to forget that, though and leave off the niceties. Try to always remember to say ""please,"" ""thank you,"" and ""excuse me"" when appropriate, even to family members., This step goes hand in hand with saying please and thank you. That is, nobody likes to be ordered around.It's important to pay attention to the tone you're using when talking to family members.


For instance, instead of demanding in a rude tone, ""Get me some juice!"" you could say, ""Would you mind getting me some juice, please?""

, One way to be respectful and polite is to clean up after yourself. If you leave a mess for someone else to clean, that shows you don't respect his or her time. Put your toys and items away, and put away dirty clothes. Clean up after yourself in the bathroom, and do your share of chores in the house."

Not to say that they pay for about everything for you. Understand that your parents are a huge part of your life and that they love you.


They feed you. Without your parents, you'd starve to death.
They pay for toys, outings, birthday parties, and all those things you enjoy. Remember that everything costs money, and they're buying you this stuff because they love you.
They pay for your education. Without knowledge, you'd be very dumb, and you'd never get a job. Also you'd probably never have met some of your best friends!
You always have your parents to lean on. When you're sad, mad, or depressed you always know that your parents are there to cheer you up and help you get over a hard time.
They give out advice. When you have questions, your parents are there to answer them. To your parents, there is no such thing as a stupid question.
They sacrifice their time to spend time with you or take care of you. Some parents could be out having fun, but instead they're taking care of you.
They pay for electrical bills, and give you a roof to live under, where you're always welcome.
They simply love you.;
,


Make sure your parents know that you love them more than anything in the world.

, Instead of letting your parents open doors for you, open it yourself. Don't always expect your parents to do everything for you. Instead start opening doors for them.


If you can do it yourself, your parents don't need to do it for you.
If you have a pet, don't make your parents clean up after it! It's your pet, so it's your responsibility!
Always clean up after yourself, whether it's putting your stuff back when you're done, or picking up your plates.

, Such as wiping the table after dinner, or vacuuming the carpet.


Always clean your room, and do your homework without a fight. This will impress your parents.

, If your sibling started it, tell your parents that.


If you started it, Tell your parents the truth. Parents like honesty.

, Get good grades, study hard, and never get a phone home. Your parents will see that you're trying to succeed, and will respect that.


Do not start fights.
Ask your parents any questions you have about your lessons. They went to school too.

, This can range from just going out to breakfast, or seeing a movie together. Use this time to talk and catch up on each other's lives.


Don't talk all the time! Let your parents talk too!

, Nobody likes a liar. And if you lie, Your parents will stop believing everything you say.


If you do lie, Tell your parents. This may not help your punishment, but it'll show your parents that you care about them enough to tell the truth.

, If you want a pop, say ""Mom (Or Dad) Could you please get me a pop"", not ""Hey lady what does it take to get a pop around here?"". Always say please and thank you.


Say excuse me when you burp or fart.

, This could be a homemade gift, movie tickets, or just a smile, hug or kiss, and an ""I love you"".

Be grateful.,
Understand differing perspectives.,
Value their wisdom.,
Remember how much they love you.,
Follow rules.,
Practice good manners.,
Spend time with them.,
Show them affection.,
Don't talk back.,
Watch your body language.,
Don't bring up the past.,
Agree to disagree.,
Engage in open conversation.",How to Be Respectful of Your Parents," Gratitude is simply being thankful and appreciative for what you have.Aside from bringing you into the world, parents sacrifice time, energy, and effort in order to make sure your needs and wants are met. Showing them that you appreciate their efforts demonstrates a level of respect towards them.


Tell them face-to-face. The easiest way to show gratitude is to thank them and tell them that you appreciate who they are and what they do.
Do something small but meaningful. For example, clean the kitchen after dinner or take the trash out without being asked. Parents will notice and appreciate your acts of kindness.
Compliment them on something they do well. For instance, tell your mom how great of a cook she is, or tell your dad how awesome he is at his job.;
, Respecting different opinions is a lifelong skill that is used in everything from politics to careers. Just because you choose to understand where your parents are coming from, does not mean that you lose your beliefs. Instead, looking at situations from their perspective can help both parties understand and accept a bit more about each other.


Ask your parents questions to learn more about them. Understand that your parents are from a different generation and a lot changes with time. Engaging them in conversation will help bridge the gap in order to understand each other better.
Keep a journal about your interactions with your parents. By re-reading a journal, you'll see things with more honesty instead of reinterpreting events in a way that benefits only you.
Talk to an unbiased party. Talking to someone who has nothing to gain can help you see things from others' perspectives, including that of your parents. Learning to see ""where they are coming from"" helps in building a mutually respectful relationship.

, Wisdom is known as the ability to integrate knowledge and an understanding of life in order to tackle all of the uncertainties which may come your way.Believe it or not, much of what you have experienced as a child or teen, your parents have experienced as well. For this reason, it is important to recognize that they have knowledge and judgement which should be respected.


As an example, if you were to visit a doctor, you would want someone who had the experience and training to diagnose and treat your illness. The same is true for parents. Learning to see them as professionals at life will help you to develop a different level of respect for them.

, There is no way to put into numbers or percentages how much a parent loves a child.Not only do they give life to their children, but they raise them, provide them with guidance, help them overcome obstacles, give of themselves and love them unconditionally. As children, we often forget how much they have done in our lives. Taking a second to think of their love and support can help to build bonds of love and respect.


Recognize that when parents seem to be getting in your way, they are, but with good reason. Parents often act as a shield to protect their kids from anything they consider to be harmful.
Because parents love you they are concerned about your future success. When parents perceive your behavior as something that threatens to limit your potential achievement, it can often cause conflict in your relationship. Realize that it usually comes from a place of love.

, As children, we often don't agree with the rules our parents have set, but we don't have the foresight to realize that the rules are in place for a reason. Rules matter because as people we are interdependent; when you disregard rules there are consequences which not only affect you, but others as well (including your parents).Following rules demonstrates to your parents that you respect their foresight and judgement.


Be clear about expectations. Know what your parents' rules are so you can avoid any confusion and avoid accidentally breaking rules.
Take a second to stop and think about the consequences. Think about what ripple effect your actions may have and how it will impact you and those around you. Ask yourself if it is really worth it.

, Manners aren't just about which fork to use at the dinner table; manners demonstrate a sensitive awareness of others' feelings. Caring enough to be polite towards your parents, who you've known your entire life, shows a level of respect and reverence.


Say ""please,"" and ""thank you."" Words are powerful and each of those words carries meaning. Aside from being polite, it shows a level of gratitude and appreciation which are both part of respecting your parents.
Watch your language. Be careful about the topics of conversations and your word choice around your parents. Parents always think of their children as their babies (regardless of how old they are). They would prefer to see them from a clean and pure lens.

, At some point in your life (especially your teenage years), you would rather do anything other than spend time with your parents, and your parents know and accept this. But imagine how much love, admiration, and respect they would feel if you chose to spend some unexpected quality time with them.


Tap into their interests. Take an interest in what your parents do in their spare time. Whether it's sports, dancing, music, or gardening, ask them questions and show them that you are taking an interest in them.
Make them a priority by choosing to spend time with them over your friends once in a while. They'll really appreciate the gesture.

, As we get older, we tend to forget to give hugs and kisses to those we love. By choosing to be close to your parents through physical displays of affection, it shows that you recognize, respect, and appreciate their position as parents and caregivers.


Tell your parents you love them at random times and not just when expected or when you want something.
Give your parents random hugs or kisses just because. If they ask what the unexpected action was for tell them something like, ""just because you're you.""

, Backtalk is a disrespectful response to a parent in the form of yelling, cursing, eye rolling, or even sarcasm.It occurs as way to fight back but all it does is create conflict. Learning to manage knee-jerk reactions helps to show parents that you respect their authority.


Recognize the problem first. If you realize the problem and want to change it, you've already taken the biggest step. It takes maturity to understand the differing perspectives and reactions between kids and parents.
Apologize to your parents. Admit to your parents that you have disrespected them, and ask them for their assistance as you attempt to change your behavior.
Take a mental ""time-out."" The next time you are tempted to say something disrespectful, take a second to regroup before speaking from emotion alone. Take into consideration what your parents are saying, and where they are coming from., The majority of our communication comes from not what we say, but how we say it. It's in the tone of your voice, your eye contact, and the way you move.Be sure that your nonverbal signals demonstrate respect and understanding.


Avoid crossing your arms. This shows that you are defensive and not open to communicating.
Watch your tone. Avoid being sarcastic or raising the tone of your voice. This shows that emotions are beginning to take over instead of logic. Try speaking in a calm and controlled manner instead.
Make eye contact. This shows that you are genuine in what you are saying, and that you are interested in hearing what your parents have to say as well.

, In the heat of discussions, you may veer off point and discuss any and everything that is causing you anger, pain, or stress. Try to stay focused on a single point of discussion so you can work through your problems one at a time without getting overwhelmed.


Check for unresolved problems before beginning a conversation. If you know you're holding onto anger or pain, they can be a hindrance to effective communication. Clear up any unresolved issues (one at a time) before attempting to move forward.
At the beginning of your conversation, make an agreement with your parents that you will only focus on one issue at a time. If either of you seem to be straying from the topic, politely remind each other to stay on topic.

, Parents are not always right; but that doesn't mean you have to be disrespectful in the process of proving your point. Instead of getting into a shouting match with your parents, calmly and rationally get them to see your point of view.


Write it out. Consider what point you're trying to get across to your parents, and write out reasons and examples that will support your argument.
Talk to them at a later time. Reschedule your discussion for a time when emotions aren't running high. Instead, choose a time when your parents aren't busy or stressed to sit down and calmly present your argument.
Use ""I"" statements to get your point across without being defensive. ""I"" statements consist of the behavior that is bothering you, how it makes you feel, and what needs to change.. For example, instead of saying, ""you never listen to me"" you could replace the statement with ""I feel as if I'm not being heard, and I would like my opinion to matter more.""

, Allow your parents into your world. Tell them about school, your job, your crush, or anything interesting that you might not have shared previously.

Talk about your feelings instead of pointing blame.,
Take a deep breath.,
Stay on topic.,
Listen to what the other person has to say.,
Don't yell.,
Be willing to change your mind.",How to Be Respectful of Your Family2," That is, use ""I"" when you get in a disagreement instead of ""you."" If you're upset that your sister always hogs the bathroom, talk about how it makes you feel instead of pushing blame.For instance, you could say, ""I feel disrespected when I don't get enough time in the bathroom because then I don't have enough time to get ready. I feel unprepared for the day.""Using ""I"" helps soften the tone. It helps the other person understand why you're upset without pointing fingers, which can make everyone get defensive.

, Everyone gets a little heated when he or she gets upset. The trouble is, that can make you not think as clearly and say things you may regret later. If you feel your emotions taking over, ask to take a moment to calm down. Try focusing on breathing in and out for a few minutes or counting numbers until you feel yourself calm down., That is, don't throw stuff at the other person from past arguments. Don't remind them of the last time they said something wrong or did something wrong. It only heightens emotions and doesn't help the argument at hand., In an argument, you tend to just want to make your point of view known; obviously, you think you are correct. However, you should take the time to really listen to what the other person has to say. Even if you decide to keep your point of view, you show respect to the other person by giving his or her view credibility and time.Truly listening means actually considering what the person has to say. Don't just sit there thinking up arguments against it., Yelling can scare children, and it teaches them to yell, too, instead of talking about what's bothering them. Similarly, when you yell at an adult, it creates some amount of fear, which shuts them down, meaning they won't be able to actually listen to what you have to say., Whether you're the parent, spouse, child, or sibling, sometimes the other person will have a point. That means that you need to be willing to change your mind if you realize you are wrong.This step also includes being willing to admit you've made a mistake. Sometimes you make a mistake, and you need to apologize. For instance, you could say, ""I realize now that I was wrong. I truly apologize for the mistake I made."""

Go out for a special outing. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you are taking the time to enjoy each others' company., Everyone needs some kind of hobby or outlet, and it's often different for each member of a family.

Learn your family members' love languages.,
Offer encouragement to kids.,
Respect privacy.,
Set boundaries for your child.,
Learn and teach coping strategies.",How to Be Respectful of Your Family4," ""Love language"" is the term that Gary Chapman uses to describe the way that people feel love. That is, different people require different types of actions to feel love from another person. You can use his website, 5lovelanguages.com, to take quizzes and determine the love language for each of your family members.Knowing each others' love languages will help you express love towards one another.
For instance, one love language is words of affirmation, where a person needs verbal encouragement to feel loved. Another is acts of service, where a person feels loved if another person does something for her.The third love language is receiving gifts; small presents make this type of person feel loved. The fourth is quality time, where spending time together makes a person feel loved. The final one is physical touch; love is expressed through hugs, kisses, and affectionate touches., Kids are still learning how to be polite and ask things in a respectful manner. Therefore, when your child does ask politely, make sure to offer encouragement of that behavior.Try to be specific about your praise. For instance, when your child asks politely if she can be excused instead of jumping up from the table, you can say, ""Thank you for asking so nicely and using your manners.""
Also, remember to offer encouragement for the hard work they put in, not just the finished product. For instance, no matter whether your kid wins or loses a tennis match, you can say that you are proud of her for putting in the hard work., Your child will start to set her own boundaries as far as privacy goes. Because it's her way of asserting independence, you should try to respect that as often as possible with a few caveats. For instance, if your child is still fairly young, you may need to be in the bathroom while she bathes; however, you can work on something else so she doesn't feel like you're focusing on her.Remind your child that occasionally, you or her doctor may need to examine her body to make sure she's still healthy.Many children will start wanting privacy in elementary school. However, if your child seems to be very embarrassed about her body, you might want to make sure everything is fine with her, as that can be a sign of sexual abuse., Boundaries are good for kids because they help them know their limits. Your kids may not see it as a sign of respect initially, but boundaries will help them grow into positive, contributing adults.Plan ahead, and tell your child the boundary in no uncertain terms. That is, you need to already know what rule you are going to enforce before you enforce it, and your kid needs to know she doesn't have any wiggle room. For instance, use a statement instead of a question: say ""Please clean up your room before you go outside,"" not ""Can you please clean up your room before you go outside?"" That doesn't mean that you have to be use a harsh tone; in fact, a neutral is better because it won't scare your kids.Don't be afraid to use humor to encourage cooperativeness. Kids love silly voices and jokes, so try making the fork dance when you want her to eat or making her toothbrush talk to her., When you don't get your way, you need to learn to deal with that without yelling. For instance, you can use techniques to calm down, such as listening to a meditation CD. Alternatively, you can use a creative way to express yourself, such as drawing, coloring, or painting.For your kids, you can also help them talk about their feelings. One way to do that is to use visuals, such as a printout of different emotion faces. Have the child point to what they're feeling and then have them talk about how that relates to the situation. You could ask a question such as, ""What are you feeling right now? Can you point to the face that shows what you're feeling? What made you feel that way?"""

Make a plan for communication.,
Don't assume she knows how you're feeling.,
Take the time to listen.,
Ask more questions.,
Share your struggles.,
Don't let disagreements turn into arguments.,
Look for common interests.,
Set some time aside for special bonding time.,
Focus on quality time.,
Celebrate special occasions together.,
Let her know you care.,
Don't wait around for change to happen.,
Pick your battles.,
Have empathy.,
Forgive your mom for past hurts.,
Tell her how you feel.,
Seek counseling for major issues.",How to Become Closer to Your Mother," If you and your mother don't communicate very much right now, you may need a little structure to help get things going. Try sitting down with your mom and coming up with a plan for communicating with each other. For example, you might decide that you will set aside 30 minutes to talk every evening.Let your mom know what kind of communication you want have with her. Be sure to listen to her input, too.;
, Miscommunication often occurs because people forget that not everyone thinks in exactly the same way. This is why it's so important to let your mom know what you're thinking and feeling, even if it seems obvious to you. If you think your mom just doesn't understand you, you may just have to explain something to her.For example, if you feel like your mom doesn't understand how you feel about your new tutor, you might want to say something like, ""I don't think you understand how I am feeling about this and I want to make sure that you do. It's not that I don't care about my grades, but I would like the chance to improve my grades on my own before I start working with a tutor.""
Encourage your mom to share her feelings as well. Explain to her that you don't always know how she is feeling and you would like her to help you understand.

, Listening is a crucial component of communication that is often overlooked. The next time you talk to your mom, really listen to what she has to say to you.Ask questions if something she says isn't clear to you.
Allow her to finish what she has to say instead of interrupting
Instead of jumping to conclusions about what she means, ask for clarification when you don't understand.

, If your conversations with your mom tend to be short and to the point, but you'd prefer to dig a little deeper, start by asking questions. This will help you learn more about your mom's opinions and beliefs.Focus on open-ended questions to keep the conversation going. Questions that start with ""how"" or ""why"" are especially good. For example, if your mom tells you that she likes a certain book, ask her why she likes it.
If your mom doesn't ask these same kinds of questions in return, you can still provide more detail in your answers. For example, if she asks you how your day was, you could say, ""It was not so great because I had a quiz in math that I didn't know about and because my best friend was sick"" instead of just saying it was bad. Eventually, you two will get in the habit of sharing more information with each other whenever you talk.

, Adolescents and teenagers sometimes feel disconnected from their parents because they feel that they can't talk to them about some of the important things that are going on their lives, like problems with their friends or issues related to dating. If you want to get closer to your mom, consider letting her know more about what's going on in your world.It may seem awkward to share these details at first if you're not used to it, so try starting small. Every family has different boundaries as far as what they do and do not want to share with each other.
If you don't want advice about the issue, tell your mom that. Consider saying something like, ""I just want to let you know what's going on with Jane, but I can figure out what to do about it on my own.""

, It's important to focus on healthy communication, which means learning to talk to your mom without getting into arguments. Even if you have different opinions about something, you can talk it out without getting angry at each other.Always keep your cool. Avoid yelling, name-calling, and slamming doors. For example, instead of yelling, ""That's stupid! You don't get it!"" consider calmly saying something like, ""I see your point, but I'd like to share my opinion with you.""
Always respect your mom's opinion, even if you think it's wrong. Listen to what she has to say, and then share your own opinions with her.
Just because you are close with your mom does not mean you have to agree with her on everything. You can still maintain your own voice, and you can even debate your different points of view as long as you remain respectful of each other's opinions.

, You may feel like you have absolutely nothing in common with your mom, but that's probably not true! Chances are the two of you share at least one common interest. No matter what that thing is, use it to come up with activities that you will both enjoy doing together.Your common interests can be anything at all, from traveling the world to playing with your cat.
Take the initiative to plan some activities yourself. For example, if you and your mom both love animals, plan a trip to the zoo. You can let her in on your plans ahead of time or consider surprising her.

, Life gets busy sometimes, so if you're trying to spend more time with your mom, you may need to put it on both of your calendars. Scheduling time to spend together will demonstrate that you are both committed to becoming closer.This is even more important if you don't get to see your mom very often because of her work schedule, for example.
The two of you should agree on how often you will have your bonding time. It may be once a week or once a month, depending on your schedules and your own personal preferences.
You might decide to do the same thing every time (like going out for ice cream every Friday night) or you may plan different activities for each time. The important thing is that you are together and doing something that you both enjoy.
You don't necessarily have to go anywhere for your bonding time. You can stay at home and bake cookies together if you both enjoy doing that.

, Just being in the same room together doesn't always count as spending time together. When you spend time with your mom, make sure you are actually interacting, rather than just co-existing in the same space.Put phones, computers, and other devices away. Instead, focus on having a conversation or doing some kind of activity together.

, In addition to spending time together for no specific reason, you should try to celebrate together. Whether it's her birthday or your graduation, let her know that you want to be together for this special time.


Consider doing something special for your mom for her birthday or Mothers Day. For example, you could plan a day at the beach together or make her dinner.
Let you mom know that you want to celebrate special events in your life by spending time with her too.

, No matter how much time you spend with your mom, it's still important to remind her every once in a while that you love her and are grateful for everything she does for you. You can do this in many different ways.You may want to let your mom know you care by telling her you love her or by kissing and hugging her. You could also try thanking her for something that she did for you. For example, you might want to say, ""Thanks for making dinner tonight, Mom. I know that you were really busy today and it means a lot that you still took the time to cook for me.""
You can also let your mom know that you care about her by being kind, polite, and respectful. For example, you could make an effort to say ""please"" whenever you ask her to do something for you.
Try helping her out more around the house. This shows you are thinking of her and appreciate all of the things she does for you.

, If you want to change the relationship you have with your mom, don't be afraid to take the first step. IF both of you are waiting for the other one to initiate change, nothing will ever happen.Sometimes changing the relationship requires changing yourself. For example, if your relationship with your mother is strained because you have betrayed her trust, work on becoming more responsible and earning that trust back.
The longer you wait to resolve conflicts, the worse they will become, so deal with your issues as soon as possible.

, Some things just aren't worth arguing over, so don't let these small things get in the way of the healthy relationship you are trying to build. If you are tempted to start arguing with your mom about something, take a moment to consider whether you would be better off just letting it go.This is usually the best strategy for small, inconsequential things. For example, if you and your mom disagree about what kind of party you should throw for your dad's birthday, you may want to just let it slide.
Don't just brush aside issues that are really important to you. For example, if you and your mom disagree about what you should study at college, you should not disregard your own opinions just to avoid a conflict.

, No matter what the problems between you and your mom may be, try to look at the situation from her perspective and understand how she must feel. Being empathetic will help you get past quarrels that you have had with your mom and move on.Always take a moment to think about why your mom might feel the way she does. Keep in mind that her various life experiences will influence her opinions. Doing your best to understand where she is coming from is a great way to start having more empathy for your mom.
It's important to keep in mind that your mom is a human being who makes mistakes, just like you. Don't expect her to be perfect.

, No matter what has happened between you and your mom in the past, you have the power to forgive her. Forgiving does not mean that you are condoning your mother's actions, but merely that you are willing to move past these actions and not let them interfere with your present-day relationship.If you want to let your mom know that you forgive her for something, be straightforward about it. For example, you might say something like, ""I want to let you know that I was really hurt when you said negative things about my boyfriend, but I forgive you and I'd like to move on.""
Try to avoid bringing up conflicts from the past in present arguments.
You can encourage your mother to forgive you as well.

, If your mother says or does something that hurts you, it's important to let her know how it made you feel. This will allow you to talk it out and resolve the issue before it turns into a big conflict. When you do this, avoid insulting your mother or accusing her of anything. Using ""I"" statements can help you focus on your feelings instead of her actions. For example, consider saying, ""I feel like you are disappointed in me when you say things like that"" instead of, ""You never appreciate anything I do for you.""
If your mom lets you know that something you did or said hurt her, it's important to be understanding and try to work with her to correct the issue.

, If you and your mom aren't able to repair your relationship on your own, you may want to consider seeing a counselor together. A neutral party may be able to help you understand the obstacles that are keeping you from having the kind of relationship you want with your mom.

, You can become a good daughter by not just talking with your parents, but also by listening to them. Listening to them lets you understand what’s on their mind, their perspective, their concerns, and more.Don’t assume that you already know what they are going to say. Give them a chance to talk and really listen to what they are telling you.


Sometimes you might have to ignore the words and listen to the well-intentioned message.

, If you date someone, you will most likely develop strong feelings of attraction towards your partner. However, it's important to recognize the risks of teen sexuality, and make informed decisions to keep you and your partner safe.


Let your partner know if you are not ready to have sex, and make sure your partner respects your wishes.It's best to delay sexual activity until you are both emotionally and physically prepared to have sex.Make sure your partner consents to having sex. Never try to pressure someone into having sex, and don't let anyone else try to pressure you.
If you do decide to have sex, make sure you use protection. Wear a condom from start to finish during vaginal, anal, and oral sex to reduce the chances of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections.Be aware of STDs/STIs. On average, four out of every ten sexually-active teen girls (approximately 40%) have or have had a dangerous sexually transmitted disease/infection that can cause infertility or even death.The average rate of prevalence for all STDs/STIs among teens is one in four. That means, on average, one out of every four sexual partners you have will carry an STD.Pregnancy is another risk associated with sexual activity. In 2014 alone, 249,078 babies were born to teen girls between the ages of 15 and 19.Remember that abstinence is the only way to completely avoid the risks of STDs and pregnancy. If you're not ready for the emotional and physical repercussions of being sexually active, it's best to wait.

, Gangs are groups of individuals who join together under the guise of protection. Gangs are almost invariably involved in acts of violence, drug sale/use, gun violations, and even homicide.Some teens join gangs because of peer pressure, while others glamorize the lifestyle. Still others see gangs as a way to feel ""stronger"" or more ""connected.""
Being in a gang will not keep you safe. If anything, gang activities will expose you to more illegal acts and violence.
Joining a gang can lead to legal problems, serious injury, or even death. Gangs are routinely assaulted and murdered by other rival gangs, and many gang members are arrested for a number of criminal violations.
It's best to avoid gangs altogether. Stay away from known gang territories and be aware of the clothing, colors, and symbols used by gangs so you are not mistaken for a gang member., Driving can give you a great deal of freedom, but with that freedom comes great responsibility. Driving a vehicle unsafely puts you and your passengers, as well as every other person on the road, in a great deal of danger. Reckless driving can cause accidents that lead to property damage, injury, lifelong disability, and even death. If you feel like you or someone you're with cannot drive safely for any reason, it's best to get out of the car and call a parent, trustworthy friend/relative, or a taxi for a safe ride home.


Distracted driving occurs when you perform any distracting activities while driving. This includes texting, using a cellphone, grooming yourself, adjusting the radio/CD player/MP3 player, or even talking to other passengers.
In 2013, distracted driving caused 3,154 deaths and 424,000 injuries in the United States alone.Having friends in the car can lead to distracted or reckless driving. The risk of a 16- or 17-year-old driver being involved in a fatal car crash doubles when carrying two adolescent passengers and quadruples when carrying three or more adolescent passengers.Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs caused over 10,000 deaths in the United States in 2012, which averages out to one death every 51 minutes.Drug/alcohol use for teens is always bad, but when paired with driving it is a deadly combination.
Drowsy driving (driving while you're excessively sleepy) is almost as dangerous as driving under the influence. If you feel tired, it's best to avoid driving altogether.

Stay in the present.",How to Be a Perfect Daughter," No person is ever perfect, but as the U.S. author John Steinbeck once said “Now that you don’t have to be perfect, you can be good.” Remind yourself that even Olympic gold medalists get points off on their scores (but still win). That Albert Einstein made (but learned from) his mistakes and imperfect solutions. Never let “perfect” undermine your self-esteem and become the enemy of all the excellent, worthwhile (but unfortunately imperfect) things you are capable of.


Striving for absolute “perfection” can be counterproductive, because it can diminish an accomplishment or task completion just because it is not flawless success. Perfectionism is also closely linked to depression, troubled relationships, and decreased life satisfaction.;
, If you are unsure whether something you wish to do will upset your parents, ask first. If you are hesitant to ask, it is probably a good sign that it will upset your parents.


When asking, always ensure you've thought through the possible outcomes of what you are asking to do and anticipate the concerns your parents will have.
Don't get upset. Although your parents may seem resistant to your suggestion, remember to stay cool-headed and present facts and examples that illustrate why you should do something and why you are capable of handling any outcomes.
Especially if you are still living at home, if your parents say ""no,"" always honor their wishes, even if it is not what you would prefer.

, When you have promised parents you will do something, but wait until you have to be told again (and again), it can create negative tensions.


Set expectations early. Say “Mom, I have to finish before I’ll have time, but as soon as I am free, I will take care of this,” then complete all tasks before having to be asked additional times.
Anticipate needs and fill them. Do you know what days garbage runs on? Are guest expected over the weekend? Take out the garbage, clean your room and other rooms in the house, all without being asked.

, You may not initially agree with what your parents are saying, but remind yourself that they have your best interests at heart.


They have seen more of life than you have and may have insights that you are too young to have access to.
Trust that they are looking out for you and don’t back talk. Back talk creates arguments and can be counterproductive to establishing yourself as respectful and trustworthy.

, Demonstrate respect for yourself by caring for your body’s needs and maintaining a healthy appearance. Your parents love you and it reassures them to see you healthy and well-cared for.


Keep up with hygiene and cleanliness. Try to take a bath or shower daily. At the very least, wipe off sweat and grime with a soapy wash cloth. Wash hair every 1-3 days.Wear clean clothes and comb your hair. Iron clothes that need ironing. Wear a belt with pants, especially loose ones. Style hair to keep it out of your face.
Eat regular, healthy meals. Three meals a day is traditionally recommended; however, nutritionists have indicated that 5-6 smaller meals spread over the day can actually be healthier for us and maintain a more even blood sugar. Regardless of which meal plan you choose, make sure you are eating enough to be healthy.Go to bed at a reasonable hour. Teens between the ages of 14 to 17 need 8-10 hours of sleep a night. Anyone over the age of 18 needs at somewhere between 7-9 hours.

, Although we often want to show our parents how successful and capable we are, there are times when we may need help to reach our desired goals.


Don’t be too proud or egotistical to accept help from your parents, even in the form of advice.
When you do take help, be humble and show gratitude for the contributions your parents make.

, When we are young, the world is ours and we can let our ambitions guide what happens. But think about how difficult it can be for parents to adjust to rapid changes that we take for granted.


When you get married, get a job, move to a new place, it can remind them of their own mortality, or make them lonely for the days when you were just down the hall.
Help parents adjust to your own evolution. Take time to talk with them and let them ask questions. Help them understand, but don’t be angry if they can’t always do it. Remind them that acceptance and trust are just as powerful as understanding.

, Being true to you means that you are confident, happy, learning, and growing. Nothing makes a parent more content than seeing their child coming into their own and being successful. When you are true to you, you are actualizing the person your parents raised you to be. Sometimes, however, being true to you will initially create tension with parents.


For example, if you parents want you to attend church with them, but you are not religious, let them know that you wish not to go. If you still have to attend their church, consider how you can still be true to your values during the experience. Resources like the Skeptics Bible offer some great conversation starters to get people thinking about the contradictions and inconsistencies within religious scriptures.Are you worried about coming out to your parents? While your sexuality is an important part of who you are and should be celebrated, if you are living at home with your parents, you may not want to share this part of yourself at that time. If you are living away from home and worried about talking to your parents about your sexual orientation, consider speaking to a therapist about the best ""coming out"" options for your circumstances., Parents want more than anything from their daughter is that she grows up to have a safe and happy life. Part of having that life, however, is that your parents want to be a part of it and offer assistance that will help secure that happiness. They also want to share in your relationships, help raise possible grandchildren, and enjoy watching their family grow., Take the advantages, kindness, support, and generosity you’ve been shown by your parents and offer it to others. That could be your own children, your spouse, friends, and other family members.


Volunteer to be a “Big Sister,” who offers support and life guidance to at-risk young women.When you use what you’ve been given you help others, you show respect and gratitude for the upbringing your parents gave you.

, When families grow and gain new members, it can require some adjustment, particularly for the new addition. Remember that your partner loves you for who you are, and that you should not try to be someone else. At the same time, look for opportunities to make connections to his or her family., Although every family does things differently, many families accept new members by immediately treating them as a new sibling or child.


If you are an only child and have never had siblings before, think of sibling relationships as being like living with a best friend for most of your life. Everyone tries to get along, have fun, and take care of each other, with lots of compromises.
Accept that hugs, jokes, and some teasing may come along with being the new sibling, but that it is coming from a place of love and welcome. Reciprocate in turn when possible.

, Especially if you have just married into a new family, be sure to plan for at least an hour a day of “Me” time during visits.


""Me"" time may be when you say “I’m going to have a quick nap” and then rest for a few moment, thinking back over the events of the day, releasing any possible stress that may have built up.
You can even ask you partner to join you, especially if there is something you are confused about any want to ask questions.
Over time, as you and your partner's family become better acquainted, these quiet moments may not even be necessary.

, The relationship between a parent and biological child can permit a degree of honesty unmatched by any other relationship. While your partner may be able to tell their parents anything, remember that they are getting to know you, and tact can be important maintaining peace.


Remember to never lie to your partner’s family, but also remember to break difficult truths with respect and kindness.

, When we begin a relationship with a partner’s family, we usually want them to like us as much as possible. Yet, while compromise is important, it is equally as important not to sacrifice your entire personal comfort for someone else.


For example, are your partner’s parents asking you to come visit for the holidays when you both really want to stay home? If you and your partner agree, be kind, but firm, in letting the rest of the family know that you will be delighted to join them at a different time, but can’t make the requested date.
This may cause disappointment at first but, in the long-run, establishes reasonable expectations and mutual respect.

, There are points on which you will never agree with a partner’s family. This is not a sign of failure or incompatibility. Instead, think of it as a challenge, to love and be tolerant in spite of differences.


For example, do you already know that your partner’s parents have different politics than you? If anyone asks, say “You know, I’ve never been entirely comfortable talking about politics. Mind if I sit this one out and listen?”
If pushed, gently remind others that you respect their beliefs and feelings, love them dearly, hope they can respect your feelings as well.

, Compromise is a key part of maintaining healthy family relationships. This may mean accepting that your partner’s family has completely different holiday traditions, or that Aunt Margaret will always makes her macaroni and cheese for special occasions (even though that was what you always made).


While you should never give up all the habits and rituals that bring joy and meaning to your life, you may find that you need to adjust how and when you observe your own traditions. For example, if Aunt Margaret always makes the macaroni and cheese, ask your partner what kind of dish you could make that could become a family staple.
Another compromise is to have your own Christmas tree and cookies for Santa at home but still enjoy lighting the menorah and having noodle kugel with your partner’s family.

, Welcoming a new person to the family can be a joyous but also stressful occasion.


It can remind your in-laws that they are aging, or that their child/brother/sister lives far away, or that there may be limitations on how much family time that can be spent together, which can bring mixed feelings into play.
While you should never be a door mat or accept disrespect, understand what families go through when a new person is added and attempt to give in-laws the benefit of the doubt before becoming upset or angry.

, Think about your own personal life, as well as the relationship you share with family, including parents. What aspects could be made more comfortable, productive, or enjoyable? Below are exercises in mindfulness that can help you be a better daughter:


Strive for excellence in all tasks you undertake. When you complete tasks without a commitment to success or improvement, you show a lack of concern for the people impacted by the outcome. Instead, demonstrate love, care, and respect by attempting to complete all tasks successfully, pushing for above-average outcomes. Let your parents feel proud of what you have accomplished
Look for new ways to make positive changes. This could be something as simple as planting flowers in your parent’s garden or deciding to ask your supervisor for a promotion at work. When you make a personal effort to bring happiness to yourself or the people who care about you, you demonstrate a commitment to being a better person for yourself and others., When long periods go without talking to your parents, it can be difficult to make the call when either party needs help or support. For this reason, try to reach out to your parents as often as is convenient and comfortable for both of you.


For younger adults, this could mean daily check-ins via text to a conversation over dinner. For adult children, try to text and/or call your parents multiple times a week. It doesn’t have to be an important message. It might be as simple as seeing your mom’s favorite flower and wanting to say “hi,” to sharing a funny observation from work.Reach out first. Don’t always be the one waiting on a phone call or text. Make time to talk to your parents and call them. Or if you live away from home, invite them to come visit. By reminding our parents of their importance to us, we cement bonds and offer reassurance.

, When parents tell us to listen, it means more than just nodding while they talk. Demonstrate that you are not only engaged but learning through active listening. This is not just an act of respect. It also ensures that you remember what they’ve told you and can act on it appropriately. Below are tactics for active listening:Restate information: This demonstrates that you are attentive and also gives you the ability to clarify things you are less certain of.
Offer subtle ""encouragers"": Nod your head. Say ""uh huh"" or ""I see"" so your parents continue speaking and elaborate on their ideas.
Summarize: Before ending the conversation or asking questions, summarize information into your own words. This helps you remember what was said, but also allows for your parents to say “That one part is not quite right, let me explain again” in order to offer correction.
Give feedback: If something strikes you as a good idea, say “I agree that this is good, because…” If you are less certain of another part, say “I’m less certain about this part. Can you explain it again?” This allows you to collaborate and even nuance the information. Depending on the situation, your parents might even welcome suggestions or alternative ideas.
Probe for more information: when in doubt, ask questions to draw out elaboration, make distinctions, or clarify information. Make sure that you completely understand what you’ve been told and how will impact your behavior.
Validation: Remind your parents that that you appreciate them taking the time to offer guidance and instruction. Give hugs, make a card, say “Thank you.” Always demonstrate your gratitude for and appreciation of your parents.

, Although it can be tempting to remind our parents of mistakes they’ve made, unless it is key to your protection or health, resist the urge to dwell on the past.Forgive. Forgiveness is not a free pass. It doesn’t mean that mistakes that happened are ok or validated. But what it does mean is that you are willing to move on and love in spite of mistakes. That you accept your parents as human and, like you, not expected to be perfect.
Repair disagreements quickly. The longer a disagreement remains unresolved, the longer resentment builds and the more difficult it can be to make amends. Additionally, when we don’t resolve lingering issues with those closest to us, we build a pattern of behavior that will continue into future relationships as well—even those with our own children. For these reasons, it is best to repair damaged relationships quickly and develop the conflict resolution skills required to be a better person, daughter, and mother.

Forgiving them when they do mess up helps you become a good daughter. It allows you to address the problem and move past it in a healthy way.The thought of having disappointed you is already torturing them, so don't worsen it by rubbing it in their faces like salt to a wound.
Instead, realize that their peace of mind and hearts is more important than what they failed to deliver and forgive them.

, You can become a good daughter by acknowledging when you do something wrong and apologizing for it. Instead of getting mad at your parents for holding you accountable for your actions, accept that you made a mistake, talk about it, and apologize.


You might try saying, “I didn’t use my best judgment. I’m really sorry.”
Don’t feel you need to apologize for something you didn’t do or that is beyond your control. For example, you shouldn’t apologize for being a girl.

, Parents may occasionally get upset and yell or speak sharply to you (like saying, “Get in your room!” instead of “Please go to your room.”) However, parents shouldn’t yell at you all the time. It’s also not okay for a parent to put you down, call you names, insult you, or threaten you.If your problem with your parents is that they do these things on a regular basis you should immediately tell someone you trust. You could be in a toxic relationship with them or it might be abuse.


If they are abusing drugs or alcohol, or even just very stressed, they may say or do things that hurt you emotionally, mentally, or physically.
If you see one of your parents abuse the other parent (or anyone else), it can also be considered abusing you. You should report this as well.
Know that telling someone what is going on does not make you a bad daughter. In fact, it makes you a great daughter because you are helping yourself and your parents.
Do things to take care of your mental and emotional health like keeping a journal, talking to a therapist, or practicing meditation.

Share your happiness with them.,
Introduce them to your friends.,
Accept your parents’ help.",How to Become a Good Daughter3," Also, when you are older you will look back and cherish the times you had together.


Plan a trip together, even if it’s just a few hours to an antique mall in the next town over.
Have a regular date, rituals, and traditions.Have breakfast together every Saturday or meet up for a movie once a month.
If you live with them, take a few minutes to just sit and talk with them before you run out the door or after you come in.
You shouldn’t devote every minute to your parents, though. To be happy and healthy you have to have your own life also. Don’t feel bad when you do things without them.

, Studies suggest that it makes parents happy to know that their children are happy.Become a good daughter and let them know when things are going well for you.


If you have shared something upsetting with them, be sure to let them know once things are okay.Send your parents pictures of your happy times if they can’t be there to take part. Video chat with them when you have something special to share so that they can see your joy.
You don’t have to share every little thing that happens. It’s okay to keep some moments of joy to yourself.

, You can become a good daughter by letting your parents know the people in your life.It will make them feel closer to you and possibly get a better understanding of you as a person. They don’t have to or need to meet every associate that you have, but you should let them meet the people that are important to you.


So what if your father ""magically"" pulls out a coin from behind your friend's ear, don’t be embarrassed.
Understand that your parents may not like everyone in your life. That’s okay. Sometimes personalities just don’t mesh. Sometimes your parents are just worried that the person is not good for you.
If your parents don’t like your friend(s) then try to understand why and look at the situation from their perspective. Know that your parents only want the best for you.

, You might think that having your parents help you out with child care, money, or even a project makes you a bad daughter. However, research indicates that parents are happier if they can support you in some way and if their help allows you to live a happier life.Although you may not need their help, accept it when they offer.

Thank your parents for the ways they have helped you.,
Show your parents respect.,
Be patient with your parents.,
Show your parents affection.,
Do something nice for your parents.,
Set boundaries.,
Acknowledge your similarities.,
Spend time with other family members.",How to Become a Good Daughter4," Acknowledging your parents' sacrifices and efforts to give you a good life is a great way to treat your parents well.Try to thank your parents when they do something small or large for you.


For example, you might thank your parents for buying you some new clothes or for attending one of your soccer games on a weeknight.
You can say something simple to thank your parents, such as, ""Thanks for dinner! It was really good!""

, Become a good daughter by talking to them and treating them with respect. Being respectful shows your parents how mature you are and that you appreciate them. It also shows them that they raised you the right way.Don’t be dismissive or rude to them in public or in front of others (or even at home in private).
Although you might have to help your parents as they age, you should still avoid patronizing them or being disrespectful. It makes them feel embarrassed and demeaned, or like they have no independence., Some things will take your parents longer to do or learn to do. Becoming a good daughter means being patient with them. Don’t rush them or get frustrated with them when they are trying to do something.Give them the time, respect, and help that they need.


For example, instead of saying, “Gosh, mom! All you have to do is swipe right here!” Try saying, “I know it can be frustrating at first. Try swiping one finger across from left to right.”
Remember that they were patient with you when you were a child.

, Give them a hug or a pat on the back. Hold their hand like you did as child. Being affectionate with your parents is one great way to become a good daughter because most everyone likes the comfort and closeness provided by physical contact., You can become a good daughter by helping your parents and doing small things to make them smile.If your mother is washing the dishes after returning from an exhausting day at the office, the least you can do is scrub the grease off the dishes.

It’s okay to respectfully ask your parents to talk to you with respect. For example, you could say, “Dad, it hurts my feelings when you say I’m nothing but trouble. Please don’t say that to me.”
There is a difference between discipline and abuse. Calling you names, physically hurting you, and things like that cross the boundaries of acceptable parent behavior.
Understand that if your parents are asking you to do something that you know is wrong or that will hurt you, you don’t have to do it. In this case you should tell someone you trust.

, We often spend a lot of time emphasizing the differences between us and our parents. Become a good daughter by letting your parents know that you recognize the ways that you are alike.It makes them feel good and strengthens your bond.


Show your mom that you get your love of baking from her by making her a homemade cake.
Remind your dad that you tug your ear when you’re thinking, just like he does.
Remember, though, that you are still your own person. Just because your mom has a hot temper, doesn’t mean you have to also.

Do well in school.,
Try to get a job.,
Spend money responsibly.,
Consider furthering your education.",How to Be a Responsible Teenager2," You may find high school boring, frustrating, or even a waste of time, but how you do in high school can shape the rest of your life. If you are planning on going to college, you must do well in high school and earn high grades. Even if you're not planning on going to college, high school can teach you about responsibility, time management, and the importance of hard work - all lessons that apply to adult life outside of school.


Motivation is one of the biggest factors in school success rates, and the self-motivation you learn in high school will be important as you enter the adult world.
Think of high school as your job. If your parents stopped going to work or didn't do what their bosses expected, they would not be able to keep that job for very long - and if you don't learn motivation and discipline, you may struggle with employment as well.
Build yourself a schedule and stick to that schedule. Make time for homework, studying, and reviewing your notes from class every day before you watch TV or go out with friends.
Study without distractions. Turn off the TV, music, and cell phone so you can concentrate without interference.
Use flash cards and mnemonic devices to help you memorize names, dates, terms, and definitions.
Take short breaks when you're studying and reward yourself when you've finished your work for the night.
Make sure you get enough sleep each night, especially the night before a test., Working a part-time job while you're in school can help teach you a lot about responsibility and time management. It can also give you some extra cash, whether you're saving up for college, saving for a car, or just want greater independence. However, it's important to balance your school and work lives so that your grades do not suffer.


Remember to wear appropriate clothing to your interview and your place of business (once you're hired). Follow the dress code, if there is one, and if not make sure you do not wear ripped clothing or shirts with inappropriate messages/images.Consider getting a job or internship in something you're interested in. It may not be as easy to get as a fast food job, but you'll learn a lot about yourself and have the chance to pursue something you're passionate about.Try to get hands-on training in a technical field, such as cosmetology, automotive technology, and even health care.Find internships and part-time jobs by searching online, or talk to career counselors and guidance counselors at your school.

, Whether the money you earn comes from doing chores for your parents or working a part-time job, it's important to learn responsible spending/saving habits early on in life. Spending responsibly and starting a savings account in your teenage years can help prepare you for a more stable and secure adulthood.


Be a smart shopper by comparing prices and waiting for items to go on sale.
Try not to buy needless junk. If you can't justify why you want something other than ""it would be cool to have,"" you can probably go without it.
Ask your parents about how to spend money more wisely, and talk to a parent or a financial institution (like a bank or credit union) about starting your own checking or savings account., Many teenagers graduate high school and enter the workforce. It makes sense to some because of the potential to start making money right away. However, in the long run, you'll be able to make more money and work a job you feel passionate about if you get some type of college education.


The benefits of a college education outweigh the costs. You may need to take out a loan, but you will earn more after college and have access to jobs you wouldn't get without a degree.College graduates tend to be significantly more satisfied with their jobs. They also tend to find and keep jobs more easily than their peers who never graduated from college.Ultimately, your parents cannot decide whether or not you will go to college. But when they tell you how important a college education is, they are probably speaking from experience.

Understand responsibility.,
Find positive, responsible role models.,
Be responsible for your actions.",How to Be a Responsible Teenager3," Responsibility is not something that can be given to you by others. You must live responsibly if you expect any kind of freedom or independence. A big part of responsibility is earning the trust of others, so being honest and morally upstanding is important if you hope to be a responsible teenager/adult.Figure out what motivates your desire to be responsible. Is it your parents' respect and approval, your peers' respect, or your own desire to better yourself?
Motivation has to come from within you. As much as other people can inspire you to take action and live a more responsible life, you ultimately have to be self-motivated enough to create your own opportunities and pursue your own interests.

, Experts on adolescent development have found that having a good, positive role model from an early age can help teenagers be more responsible as adolescents and adults. Even if you go through a rebellious phase, you're less likely to make bad decisions if you have a strong role model in your life.For some people, parents are the ultimate role model. Others may choose to look outside the family circle for a positive role model.
Characteristics to look for in a good role model are strong work ethic, creativity, capacity for independent thinking, and strong sense of morality.Remember that even a role model makes mistakes. No one is perfect, so don't expect absolute perfection from your role model.

, As much as your parents and role models can try to influence you, you are ultimately the one responsible for your own actions. No one can control what you do or don't do, which means you are responsible for your successes and your failures.Take responsibility when you've done something wrong, and try to learn from that experience so you do not repeat your actions in the future.
Try to think about the repercussions of your actions before you make a decision to act in the first place. Thinking about the most likely outcome may help you avoid falling into bad behavior.
Always show respect and appreciation towards others. Making responsible choices includes learning to treat others with the kind of respect you expect for yourself.

Be respectful to your parents and their rules.,
Fulfill your household chores and duties.,
Understand and act on your own values.",How to Be a Good Teenage Daughter1," As a teenager, it can sometimes seem as if your parents’ rules are strict and unnecessary. To be a good daughter, however, it is essential to respect your parents. Follow even the rules you don’t agree with, and don’t complain about them. Rather, talk with your parents if you want them to consider changing those rules. Ask calmly for more privileges and don’t yell at your parents. Yelling will sound disrespectful, and you will appear immature.Ask your parents if you can periodically revisit rules on curfew, nights out, or driving privileges.
Say things like, “I understand you worry about me when I’m out, but I’d really like your permission to stay out until midnight sometimes,” or “I’ve really been working hard on my grades lately, is it okay if I go out an extra night this weekend to see my friends?”
Avoid the argument that your friends get to do certain things that you don’t get to do. Instead, focus on how responsible you have demonstrated you can be and identify potential ways you can earn privileges.;
, A family is a system that relies on each member performing their responsibilities to help things run smoothly. If you are in charge of cleaning the bathrooms or starting dinner on weeknights, be sure to keep on top of these. Your parents will appreciate the help, and your responsibility will be apparent to them.


Offer to help out even more when your parents are busy.
Perform your chores happily, without complaint. If you anticipate a reason why you cannot do this, try your best to talk to your parents about it ahead of time so alternative arrangements can be made.

, This will help you avoid peer pressure and the problem behavior that may come with it. If you feel pressured, talk with your parent or another trusted adult.Choose friends with similar values and perspectives to your own. Take time to formulate a list of what makes a friend a good influence, and see if your friends meet enough of these criteria. If you prioritize your involvement in school clubs and sports, hang out with friends from these groups.
Practice speaking up for yourself on relatively minor matters, like choices in restaurants or clothing stores. If you can confidently disagree with friends regarding your opinions on these somewhat unimportant topics, you will set yourself up for speaking your mind on larger topics.
When avoiding peer pressure, don’t make excuses. Rather, say things like, “I don’t want to lose control of how I act, that’s why I don’t want to drink,” or “I want to take care of myself and be healthy, so I choose not to smoke.”

, This could include your cellphone, tablet, iPod Touch, Game Boy, laptop, D.S., some books, a notebook or diary, pencils, MP3 player, snacks and/or drinks, a PSP, etc.


Sneak some snacks into the room. Just a few snacks (salty, sugary snacks are best) and a bottle of any drink would be perfect. Try to get sugary beverages such as soda or juice.The drinks don't have to be cold.






If you are going to get on the computer, turn it on before going to bed, because it makes noise when it turns on.

, Make a list (in order) of what will be done because it is easier to stay awake with a list to work through.

, About 1-1.5 hours is ideal if a good night's sleep was taken the previous night.

, Avoid arousing suspicions around bedtime––just do everything normally, such as teeth cleaning and saying goodnight to everyone in the house., When they do, hide whatever you are doing and pretend to be asleep. Normally, when pretending to be asleep, you do not move, however, it is okay to turn a little in your ""sleep"".


Don't snore unless you are known to snore.
It helps to pull your blanket over your face to save half the trouble of keeping a straight relaxed face.
Consider sleeping with the radio on to give you cover. If you accidentally make a sudden noise, it'll be blamed on the radio.

, If you want, you can go to their room and double-check they're sleeping (if they are not and ask what you're doing, say you heard something strange.) If not, keep doing things quietly in your room, but if your parent(s) lock their doors, try to hear through the door, if it's quiet they're probably asleep, if not, stay 15 to 30 minutes in your room.

, Line towels against the crack of your door to block out the light.

, It should be late at night (10 -12 pm). Get out the PSP, PlayStation, Wii, computer, DS, 3DS, etc.


Use headphones or earphones for electronics. Putting earphones/headphones in your laptop/computer will keep things quiet.

, A new day has come (12 - 2 am)! If hungry, eat a snack, or drink something. Continue playing the same game until you are bored.

, At about (2 - 4 am), early morning, try something different like reading a book, drawing, watching a movie (quietly!). Get on Facebook, or make a Facebook. Make sure none of your parents friends are friends with you on Facebook; they might tell your parents. Make sure everything you do remains at low volume.


If you are going to text, put the phone's volume on silent or vibrate. This will make it less likely that your phone wakes up your parents.

, Between (4 - 6 am), late morning, have another snack. Keep doing whatever kept you awake most until 5 am. Then, move on to the morning tasks. Take a shower, get dressed, brush your teeth and hair, and tidy up the room again for the day.

, Usually the household wakes up between (6 - 9 am). Stay inside the room and do whatever until it's the time you'd usually be about the house. That will mark your all-night up!

, This way you will at least have some sleep instead of none. Go to bed early the next day; your body will be craving sleep.

Spend time with your parents.,
Introduce your friends to your parents.,
Keep the lines of communication open with your parents.,
Be a good sibling.",How to Be a Good Teenage Daughter2," In a few short years, you’ll be off to college or have a career. Take advantage of the time you have now to have fun with your parents and build some good memories together. If you hate the things your parents like to do, be proactive and suggest plans yourself so that they are more in line with your interests. Additionally, you can benefit from this extra time you spend together. Teens who spend more time with their parents have higher self-esteem.See if there are movies or shows that you can enjoy together.
If you and your parents are “foodies,” try to dine out together a few times a month and try new restaurants.

, You are probably spending more time with your friends than your parents at this point in your life, and it shows great respect to your parents by letting them know your friends. They will feel secure knowing the character of the people you choose to have around you, and it may make it easier to ask for extra privileges if your parents are fond of your friends.


Talk to your parents about your friendships and conflicts or difficulties you may be having. This will help them trust you more, and you can also gain valuable wisdom.
Ask if your friends can come over after school or for dinner.
If your parents attend a school function, make an effort to bring them over to meet a few of your friends.

, It may seem like your parents don’t listen to you or your feelings, but you can help fix this by making an effort to really communicate with them. If you can, schedule a regular “chat time” to talk with them about your day or what is going on in your life. Also ask about them! Take an interest in their lives as well. Regular communication is one of the best ways for you to develop a good relationship with your parents.Start simply, by saying something like, “Today was great. I presented my project to the biology class, and I finished all of my homework in study hall.” Sharing parts of your day like this will help you easily start a conversation and can lead to further discussion.
You could also talk with your parents about challenges you are facing: “My friend started to take her brother’s ADHD medicine, and I don’t know what to do to help her.” Your parents will be happy you confided in them, and they will be able to offer valuable advice on how to face these types of issues.

, Don’t forget about the relationships you share with your brothers and sisters when thinking about being a good teenage daughter. If you are one of the older children in your family, you can model good behavior to the younger ones. They will invariably look up to you, so if you treat your parents well, they will be more likely to also. Your parents will be grateful for you offering a good example to your younger siblings.


See if you can handle disputes between you and your siblings amongst yourselves, if appropriate. Then you can talk to your parents about how this went.
You can also be a good sibling by spending time with them, helping them with their homework, and attending their sports or dance activities.
Offer to watch your siblings so your parents can have some time together.
If you are the youngest in your family, try to keep in contact with siblings who may be away at college or living in another city for a job. You can learn from their experiences and figure out good ways to interact with your parents.

Get a part-time job.,
Exercise regularly.,
Concentrate on school.",How to Be a Good Teenage Daughter3," You may feel busy with school and extra-curricular activities, but a part-time job can offer more than just a few extra dollars in your pocket. You will be able to develop your teamwork and time management skills, and you will learn about how to be a good employee.Offer to use some of your new earnings to help pay for back-to-school clothes or part of your car insurance.
You can look around your neighborhood for opportunities at restaurants or bakeries. Hair salons or doctor’s offices may need part-time office help on the weekend or during summers.

, Consistent exercise, whether alone or through a team sport, leads to higher self image and greater self-esteem for teenagers. Exercise can be a great stress reliever and can also lead to increased confidence.Your parents will be happy to see you take an initiative to maintain a healthy lifestyle.


Use exercise as an opportunity to bond with your parents. Suggest taking regular walks or bike rides together.

Use your own money.,
Get money.,
Look into other options.",How to Own a Cellphone Without Your Parents Knowing1," You will need to buy the phone using your own private funds, and your purchase should be untraceable by your parental overseers. If you have a privately-owned bank/savings account that isn't looked at too closely – use it! However, if your parents monitor your spending, then you may need to be more subtle. Remove small amounts from the bank, and do so only sporadically.


If you don't have enough money, consider asking someone to help you out. Try asking grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins and older siblings – trustworthy adults who won't tell your parents. If possible, don't tell them that it's for a phone.;
, If you don't have a source of steady income, you'll need to find a way to get cash. If you have a job, try saving a little bit each month until you have enough to afford a phone and a phone plan. If you don't have a job, try getting a part-time job at a local shop; consider working odd jobs around your neighborhood.


Store your cash in a secret place: under a mattress or in a piggy-bank. Your parents might not care about you saving up – but it will be easier to keep the phone a secret if you don't need to answer questions about what you're saving for.

, If you need a cell phone to prevent a domestic violence situation within the home, Social Services may be able to help you either source a phone or provide parental counseling. If, however, all you want is to be able to text or call your friends without supervision, there may be other options – including online chat services such as Skype or Google's ""Hangouts.""


If you want the mobility of a phone, an iPod touch or a similar Internet-connecting device could be used in areas where WiFi is available. Buy an iPod touch on either eBay or the Apple Store.

Turn the speakers off.,
Be prepared to minimize the game.,
Do not play games full screen.,
Try playing games that require minimal concentration.,
Keep open numerous other files related to schoolwork.,
Change the school-related files often.,
Turn your computer monitor away from entrances.,
Make it seem like your game was just a random pop up.,
Have an excuse ready.,
Think SMART!,
Also remember that you can also open a new tab (if you are playing in browser), then the new tab will be where you are playing.,
Use Windows 10 Task view.",How to Not Get Caught Playing Computer Games," Whatever game you may be playing, whether it is Mario jumping around on turtles or shooting people in Halo, it is bound to make a noticeable amount of noise. Do not take the chance that your parents will not hear while you are playing; it is too risky. Though turning the speakers off may impair the game experience, most games are still feasible without any sound. You could also try using headphones or Earbuds, but that could get you caught if you don't hear your parents coming towards you.;
, Your parents will usually come to check up on you to see if you are actually doing your schoolwork or not. If you hear any indication of them coming towards your room, minimize your game immediately, even if it may be a false alarm. Do not make the mistake of taking the time to pause your game, you would be surprised at the speed with which some parents would make it towards your room. Even if you lose one life, what is a life in a game compared to the countless hours you could be playing if you do not get caught?

, Try to shorten the space the game takes on your monitor as much as possible. On the offhand chance that you do not realize your dad just snuck up behind you, he is less likely to notice that you are playing when the game isn’t thrown out full screen.

, You will need to be able to focus enough to realize when someone is coming up behind you. If you are one of those hardcore gamers that fall into a state of coma whenever you play, try playing something else that will not take as much concentration. It is essential that you watch out for anyone that may be making their way towards your room.

, The greatest mistake that you can make is to leave only your game file open on your computer. After you minimize it, you have nothing to show that you have been working for the past hour. Open anything school-related, such as past essays, projects, or math homework. If it is an essay, it is recommended that you delete about half of it so that it looks like you actually wrote something in an hour instead of just opening a random file. If you're on a mac, fullscreen both your work and school files and switch it when your parents are here.

, Do not just open up an essay and sit there playing for two hours straight. Change the files you have open related to school every 45 minutes or so. Remember, parents usually know the common tricks that their children play to get around them. If you keep changing files, it looks like you have made progress in your work whenever they check in on you.

, This step will ensure that even if someone does walk in, they will not be able to see what you are playing. You will be given a few extra seconds to minimize the game before they reach you. Do not try this step if you have a computer table that is facing away from the entrance. Turning your computer and the whole desk around is a big giveaway because it shows that you were probably trying to hide what you were doing. If you have a laptop, this step will work best for you.

, Often, pop ups display random games with ads attached to them. If you made your game small enough, it may seem like just an ordinary pop up at first glance to any parent. Do not take any more time than necessary, say, “Stupid pop up,” and move on. Caution must be taken when using this step though, as parents might quickly realize that it is not any ordinary “pop up.”

, In the worst-case scenario, your parents realize that you have been playing games for a couple of hours, and they start yelling. You can quickly stop all of this by having a handy excuse ready, such as, “I already finished all my homework,” or, “I’m taking a quick break from all this work.” Whatever excuse you make, the key is to NOT HESITATE when speaking. Speak clearly, and do not give any indication in your voice that you are lying; the key here is to sound confident. Hesitating when giving an excuse is a quick way for your parents to realize that you are trying to make something up on the spot.

, Last, but certainly not least, always think smart. If your parents are on the other side of the house, then it’s a good idea to try gaming for a while. If suddenly your parents move to the room right next to yours, it’s probably a good idea to stop gaming for a while. Think according to the position of your enemies at the moment; never play like a fool. Besides, your parents will probably move away after a couple minutes or so, and you can go on happily gaming.

, If you hear someone coming, switch back to your schoolwork.

, If you have windows 10 installed on the computer there is a button with 3 rectangles. That lets you create 2 or more desktops on one PC, use that to your advantage and play your game on another desktop while on another is your homework or essay.

Don't feel bad about yourself.,
Keep your cigarettes and lighters hidden.,
Try not to smoke inside or immediately outside the house.

,
Don't throw away those empty toilet paper rolls!,
Eliminate the cigarette odor from yourself before entering the house.,
Act calmly and naturally around your parents, as if you never smoked and have nothing to hide.,
If you have long hair, put it up in a bun, so that the odor doesn't cling to it as much.,
Eat peppermint patties, at least 4 they are very good at hiding the smell.

,If Smoking marijuana, you should have nothing to worry about, since the scent of weed does not stick to the skin

,
If you smoke and drive be sure to wipe your dash, handles, steering wheel down with a rag or your hand because the ash tends to rest in those areas most.",How to Hide the Fact That You Smoke from Your Parents," Your parents will still love you even if you smoke, but they won't like it as it is very damaging to your physical and mental health. Consider telling them the truth. Even though you might get punished, they might at least appreciate your honesty, especially if you want them to help you quit. Or, consider giving up smoking altogether so you have one less thing to worry about.;
, Clean up after smoking a cigarette. Try not to use matches; instead try to get your hands on a lighter. Matches have a distinct scent to them.

,, Stuff them with crumpled dryer sheets on one end, and blow the the smoke through there. The sheets will act as a filter for the smoke. Or you can also take a rubber band and put the sheet over one end then put the rubber band over it, and it will have the same effect.


Take a walk around the block or smoke at the corner where your parents won't see.
Smoke only when you are out with your friends, or when your parents are 'out of the house.'
Some neighborhoods have houses for sale or lease, don't be stupid and smoke in there, it is illegal and you can go to jail if you get caught.
If you're smoking in a car, crack your windows a few inches and make sure the cigarette is out the window, but behind the mirror. Crank up the heat or AC, depending on the weather, and aim the vents toward the nearest window to keep the smoke outside. Wear a sweatshirt, hood up, while smoking. Be sure to exhale the smoke with a strong whoosh out the open window. After you're done, roll the windows down more, leave the air on, and air out the sweatshirt after removing it, then turn it inside out. Drink Gatorade or Powerade during and after, as it soothes your throat and helps with your breath. Afterward, chew gum and use a small amount of perfume, cologne, or air freshener on your hands. Always wash with hot water and soap as soon as possible. Cruise around for awhile to air out the vehicle, yourself, and other passengers. Don't leave your windows cracked when parked at your house since it's a dead giveaway, unless it is the summer time. If you are in the UK, do not attempt to smoke in a car as it is illegal.

, Cigarette smoke takes 45 minutes to get off your clothes if you smoke one, every time you smoke another, add 15 minutes. But keep in mind that the smell of smoke is on your skin and hair so take a shower after every single cigarette or you will smell strongly of it for the rest of the day. Also, your breath and whole mouth will smell so eat several mints constantly.


Keep several cans of cologne or a lot of odor eliminator in your car for convenience.
Similarly, take several breath mint or chew a lot of gum to get rid of your smoke breath, chocolate also works wonders for smokey breath. If you spray too much though, your parents might get suspicious, if you need to drink to get rid of the smell, don't drink soda or water, drink a dairy product like milk.
Oranges and orange oil also masks the scent of cigarettes very well. If you can do so convincingly, carry an orange with you as a snack. After smoking, peel and eat the orange, simultaneously covering your fingers and your breath with the scent of oranges. Or wear some rubber gloves, and dispose once you have used them.
Clean the smell off of your fingers, because parents who have smoked tend to ask to smell your fingers before anything else. Getting rid of the smell can be done with scented soap or rubbing your hands in a clump of grass before entering your home. If they ask why your hands have grass stains, tell them you tripped and fell. De greaser for your hands also works wonders at removing the cigarette smell from your fingers.
If you don't want your fingers to smell like smoke you should not hold on to the filter when you inhale.
If your parents say you smell of smoke, tell them either that you were in a smoky place (for example, a bar), at a friend's house whose parents smoke in the house, or that some of your friends smoke. However, your parents might not be happy about those things either, so be careful.
Smoke clings to hair a lot. Before you need to be in your parents company, try to find a sink, and splash water through your hair. If at all possible, take a shower.

, Stand proud; don't be nervous around them. That will only create a suspicion that you are trying to hide something.

, Also have a hoodie that you can wear and take off before you go inside, so your top underneath won't stink.

,,, Be aware of spraying a lot of cologne on your self because the sudden smell of cologne with cause suspicion. If you happen to stop by a gas station before you get home wash your hands face and nostrils (the smell seems to get caught in them and you think that everything around you smells like smoke) and instead of cologne use soap and water and rub in on your clothes. It masks the smell and causes less suspicion. chew gum but make sure you throw away all your empty packages of gum. Also, know that your parents will find out. It is inevitable, so if you're going to make it a habit, it may be a lot easier just to come clean.

You can leave it in your locker if you have one or in your desk. If you have a job, you can leave the incriminating evidence at work.If it’s a specific test score or project mark that you're trying to hide, don’t bring the graded document home.
If you have an upcoming test or project that you're worried about, avoid telling your parents about it beforehand. Otherwise, they will expect you to tell them about how you did once you get your grade back.;
, If you do bring home your bad report card or a bad grade, don’t leave it lying around where your parents will find it. Hide it somewhere, such as a closet, in a book, in a drawer, or in a secret hiding spot., You can also go so far as destroying the physical evidence of your bad report if you don’t think hiding it at school or in your home is good enough. You can get rid of the evidence by:Cutting it up
Throwing it into a fire
Shredding it
Burying it
Soaking it in water
Throwing it into the recycling or garbage right before collection

, Some schools mail out grades and report cards instead of sending them home directly with students, and if this is the case with your school, you will have to watch the mail like a hawk so that you can intercept the report card before anyone else sees it.Check the mail every day so that you can grab the report card from the box before your parents do. Make sure to take in all the mail every day.
To avoid suspicion, begin checking the mail a couple weeks before you're expecting the report card, and continue checking daily for a couple weeks after the grade has arrived.

, Some schools go to great lengths to keep parents involved in the progress of their children, and if your school does this, you may need to go to equally great lengths to prevent your parents from finding out about a bad grade. However, you should note that these extreme measures take dishonesty to a whole new level, and you are seriously betraying your parents’ trust by attempting to hide your mistakes in this way.


If your school sends report cards or grades to parents via email, you will need your parents’ email addresses and passwords so that you can login to their accounts to intercept and delete the email before they have a chance to see it., Parents are sometimes required to sign and send back report cards, and this is meant to ensure that the parents are aware of how their children are doing in school. For a school that does require a parental signature on a report card, you can't just hide the report card from them and hope they don’t find out.


Forging the signature of a parent without their consent is often considered fraud and is usually illegal.You can also try signing your own name in a creative way and hope that your teachers don’t catch on.

, Another perk of modern technology is that parents are often now able to access their children’s grades via online portals.While you can't prevent your parents from logging in and seeing your grades, you can try to stop them:


Log on to the portal. Copy the format of your grades into an editing program.
Manually alter the grades and print off the changed report. Show it to your parents.

, They say honesty is the best policy, and while taking responsibility for your actions can be tough and may lead to consequences, telling your parents the truth will also make you feel better.Lying to people you love can make you feel guilty, isolated, and it can destroy the trust you and your parents share.If you are feeling bad about covering up your grade, consider telling your parents the truth.
If you’ve got a bad grade and haven't yet hidden it from your parents, you may be worrying more than you need to, and your parents may not be as mad as you think! Telling them the truth may be scary, but it’s better than lying and then feeling guilty., Once you’ve made the decision to come clean or tell your parents about your report card, it can help to think about what you want to say in advance. Before sitting down with your parents, take some time to think about:


The kinds of questions your parents will ask you so that you can be prepared with some good answers.
Why you did what you did or why you got the grade you did so that you can explain yourself clearly.
How you feel about what you’ve done and how your parents might react.

, You can do this one of two ways: you can either schedule a meeting at which to discuss what you want to say, or you can approach your parents unannounced.


If you schedule a family meeting, make sure you set the date soon so everything is still fresh in your mind.
If you’d rather approach your parents, pick a time when they aren't busy or stressed out, or they may not give you their full attention, and may not react calmly.

, Open the dialogue by telling them that you have something to say, and that you'd appreciate if they'd tried to stay calm. Explain to them that what you're going to say is difficult, and that you're worried about disappointing them. This will tell your parents that you're acting in a mature way, and that you feel bad.


Tell them you got your report card and that you weren't happy with the mark. If you tried to hide the report card first, tell them that you’ve known for a while and didn’t tell them right away, and that you know it was wrong.
Let them ask questions, and answer them honestly.

, Even if you tell your parents about a bad grade right away, there may still be consequences for your academic performance, depending on your parents’ expectations. It may be hard, but remember you're doing the right thing by telling the truth, and that your parents are only doing what they think is best for you.


If you did hide the truth from your parents in the beginning, be ready for larger consequences. Your parents may not even care about the grade, but they will care that you lied to them.But remember if you do get punished, you're being punished for the lie you told, not for telling the truth about it.
If you hid a bad grade and haven't told your parents, be prepared for them to find out, and be ready for even larger consequences. Your parents could find out from a friend, colleague, teacher, or someone else, and they will be very displeased when they find out that you’ve lied to them and didn’t come clean., Tell your parents, and make a promise to yourself, to try harder at school. Your education is extremely important, and could help set the course for the rest of your life. Getting good grades could create opportunities for you that you wouldn’t otherwise get. Not only that, but you can also avoid these awkward conversations with your parents by getting better grades!"

Visit a cellphone store.,
Choose a phone.,
Pick a plan.,
Look into online billing.",How to Own a Cellphone Without Your Parents Knowing2," You can buy phones at some dollar stores, drugstores, and convenience stores – or you can go to a service provider like Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile. Make sure you have enough money to purchase the phone you want.


Consider buying your phone online. If you buy it online, do not order it to your house; order it to a friends house. Your parents may get to it before you.

, Most simple phones run from $20-100. The phone you choose will depend on the features you want. A fancy new smartphone will be very expensive, but you can usually buy a simple ""brick phone"" for $20-30.


Consider whether you really need a phone with Internet and app capability. If you just need to text and call your friends, then the simplest phone will do.

, Look at simple pay-as-you-go phones, and check out the different plans. Be smart about which plan you get. Is it really worth the cost and risk involved to get data and 4G for your phone, or can you hijack the existing WiFi in your house? Consider whether a plan is even the best choice for you, or whether you can just top it up with online or over-the-phone top-ups. Think about how often you plan to use the phone; give yourself a buffer of 10% until you find the right pattern for how you use the phone.


Seriously consider a pay-as-you-go minute card. These plans are designed for people who want the convenience of a phone without the cost and commitment of a long-term plan.
Don't add your phone to your home WiFi if your parents are tech-savvy. They might notice that a device called ""your-name's cell"" is logged into it.

, Generally, a home address is needed to send phone bills and general information about the phone account. Check with the provider which you are interested in working with to see if they offer automatic bill pay options, and whether or not they can send bills bills and information online rather than through the mail. No matter what, though, it is unlikely that a cell phone provider will allow a minor to sign the plan contract.


If you plan on getting a clandestine cell phone and you are over 18, It is possible to get a PO Box rather than providing your home address. Again, this will cost money.

Be careful who you tell about the phone.,
Act normal.,
Leave it on silent.,
Hide your phone in a safe place.,
Be sneaky!",How to Own a Cellphone Without Your Parents Knowing3," Only give your number to friends who are trustworthy and unwilling (or unable) to blab. Make sure that no tattle-tale siblings or cousins know what's up. Maintain plausible deniability: never tell anyone where you keep the phone, so that you can deny it if your parents confront you.

, Don't give your parents any reason to be suspicious. If you need to call someone, excuse yourself for a walk, or go to a friend's place if possible. Make up a plausible excuse, and stick with it. This way, if anyone asks, you were at your friend's place playing video games, or hanging out at the park – not making a call. Get a friend to corroborate your stories, to provide better protection. If you play it right, no one should look too closely.


Keep up normal habits. Don't disappear into your room and text/call friends for hours on end when you are at home, or someone will suspect that something is up.

, If your phone rings or vibrates loudly around your parents, you won't able to hide it anymore. Keep it on vibrate, or off, and ensure you take care of it both at school and at home. Make sure that it isn't going to interrupt anything and blow your cover.


Keep in mind that there is no possible situation where you would truly need the cell to ring loudly. Don't tell yourself you will just turn it off again afterwards. At some point, you will very probably forget about that – and then you're in trouble.

, Keep it hidden somewhere that your parents won't look: in a purse or a backpack, or packed into your underwear drawer. Don't leave it laying around your room or your house, or else your parents will be more likely to notice it.


Never charge it overnight or when your parents are at home and you aren't – at least not in easily visible places.

, if you get a call while your phone is off/on vibrate, don't answer it straight away. Wait until you're in a safe place, and be sure that you aren't being watched. When you're sure that you're safe, take out your phone and reply. Keep all conversations quick, and be careful that you aren't spotted. Keep the phone with you at all times, or leave it in a safe place.


Treat the phone like something transient. If anyone sees it, it disappears. Don't have it out texting all the time.

, Use you head phones or turn off the volume all the way on your laptop/computer or anything else you are using.


If you want to watch TV, move slowly and quietly.







, Make sure that you can hear your parents coming when they do. If they do, quickly stop what you are doing, close the lid to your laptop, turn off the computer screen, turn off your electronic device. If you are using a computer, make sure it appears to be off. If it is another electronic, hide it either under the blankets or your pillow. Try to make it appear as you are asleep.


If you don't have enough time to hide what you are doing, just lie down and pretend to be asleep. Your parents will think you accidentally fell asleep.

Determine what it is that scares you.,
Once you have the list, gather what you need.

,
Wait until night.,
Begin.,
Turn all the lights off and take the brightest flashlight you have.,
After you have been through your whole house with the brightest flashlight, take the dim one and do the same thing.,
Got through that level OK?,
Now, the toughest one, no lights at all.,
Do these steps for a few nights.,
You can also start sitting in a dark room for a few minutes.

",How to Go on a Darkness Hunt," Is it because you can't see anything? What about the fact that something could be watching you?;
,, People can be awake, just tell them to go into a room, with the lights off and not talk for awhile.

, First, go through the house with the lights on, noting what you see and what you hear. Say you hear a ticking noise or a thumping noise. Look around for an explanation. Is the clicking the furnace turning on? Is the thumping your cat paying with a string? Once you have the sounds and explanations noted, you can really begin.

, Go through your house and keep the phone on you. The phone is there just in case you're convinced you hear an intruder. As you're walking through the house, listen for noises. Do you still hear that clicking noise and your heart begins to race? Remember: It's the Furnace! Your eyes go wide as a short, black object darts around a corner. Follow it! Chances are, it's your cat! Once you're sure of that, you can go up a level.

, Remember: You're passing the same things you did last time! The clicking; the furnace! The thumping; your cat! All these things are the same thing you saw/heard earlier!

, You're now ready for the dimmest flashlight yet! Go through your whole house again, noting what's different this time.

, NO cheating and turning the porch light on! It's fine if you bump into things. Don't freak out thinking you just ran into an armed intruder. If you feel like you're being watched, it may be your cat. Never think you're alone if there is a cat or a living thing in your house. Even if it's a fly, there is other life. To feel braver, think someone you look up to is watching! If you like Lady Gaga for example, pretend she is watching you. You will feel braver and stronger. Remember, all noises you hear are normal. What if you hear scratching at the window? Go over to it. See, it is just a branch! The dark isn't as bad as you thought!

, It will soon be very easy.

It's important, firstly, that you realise it may not work.,
Make sure you know what you're going to say.,
Don't learn specific words.,
Try to do some of the work.,
Use an appropriate excuse.,
If possible, it's best to tell the truth.",How to Give a Good Excuse for Forgotten Homework," The consequences may still be harsh, especially if your teacher is mistrustful or you often forget your homework.;
, Don't try to make something up on the spot, it's not going to work unless you're a born actor. Have a vague idea of your excuse, but when you tell your teacher don't rush through it.

, You don't want to sound too rehearsed, but of course don't stammer too much.

, If you go to school by bus or car you can always do a bit of it then, or in the library before lessons or any free time you get. Even if you don't finish it, it gives a better impression to have at least some of it done.

, Make it believable and not uncommon, and not something the teachers will overly look into. Look upset or frustrated that you couldn't do your homework.

, Excuses such as 'I forgot' can be used repeatedly but your teachers will think of you as disorganized, which will go into your reports, which your parents will see, and if the teachers ever refer you for a job it will end up there, so beware!

Choose a legitimate excuse.,
Practice your story.,
Involve someone else.,
Give plenty of warning.,
Follow through with your excuse.",How to Get Out of Going to an Event1," A legitimate excuse is one that could plausibly occur. A raccoon breaking into and flooding your apartment, for instance, is not a legitimate excuse. Excuses can include previous events, a sick relative, no access to transportation, or a family emergency, if your excuse is needed on short notice.Choose an excuse you can easily remember. There is nothing quite as humiliating (and heartbreaking for the host) as forgetting your own made-up problem.
A legitimate excuse might include one such as, “I had to take my child to the emergency room” or “My car battery died unexpectedly.”;
, If you turn down an invitation to a significant event, you may have to field a lot of questions and needling. Practice your story, maybe even taking a moment to write down details of your given story to refer back to later.


Be well informed of your fake needs, but do not sound forced or rehearsed. Take a moment to think about answers to any questions that are posed.
Someone might ask how your emergency went. You can say something vague but helpful such as, “We were worried, but (insert name) is doing well now.”
In the case of car trouble, you could say, “I was so bummed! I was able to get my car running a few hours later.”

, If possible, involve someone else who can corroborate your story. You could say, for instance, that you’d already promised a friend you’d take him to a sports game, and have him back you up. This is particularly important if you are turning down an invitation extended by a close friend or family member. These relationships can be fragile, and may deteriorate if your reason for not attending is not important or pressing enough.


You can say that you have to take your child to a game, you have to take a friend to a lesson, or you promised a family member you’d attend their play. The possibilities are endless.

, If possible, give the host or the person inviting you plenty of warning that you will not be in attendance. This is both a courtesy and lends an air of legitimacy to your inability to attend. If possible, avoid waiting until the last minute and extending an excuse hours before the event is due to start.


An ahead-of-time warning could include an excuse such as, “I have to pick a family member up from the airport that day.”
If an advance heads up is not possible, give them at least a few hours of warning. Do not call a few minutes before you were supposed to arrive and ask for a rain check.

, If you’ve given an excuse, follow through by providing additional details, if requested, discussing what occurred during the event, etc. Following through with your excuse will keep suspicions off of you and will make the person inviting you feel as though you weren’t simply blowing them off.


If you are concerned about divulging too much and revealing your hand, feel free to say something simple, such as, “I was so sorry I couldn’t attend, but my family enjoyed their stay.”

"
"
Get to know your teacher first.,
Blame technology.,
Blame a family crisis.,
Blame your memory.,
Fake sick.,
Go see a guidance counselor during the class period.,
Be honest.",How to Get out of Doing Homework1," You have to find that teacher who is not too strict, maybe a little oblivious, and forgiving. Get on his good side at the beginning of the year so he's more likely to trust you when you come to him with excuses later. Laugh at your teacher's corny jokes and smile and try to be a good student for the most part.


Notice how your teacher reacts when other students forget their homework to gauge how much you can get away with.
Notice if your teacher collects homework or usually just walks around and glances at your worksheet to make sure you did it.
Try to get an idea of what your teacher likes. If he has pictures of his cat everywhere, you may be able to use that to your advantage later by telling him your cat is very sick or had to be put down and you were too devastated to finish the assignment.
Remember that your teacher probably got into teaching because he is passionate about his subject. Participate in class as much as possible: if he believes you love history, too, he's probably more likely to be sympathetic later.
Find out how much homework counts toward your final grade. If homework only accounts for 20% of your grade and you ace all your tests, projects, and class participation, you might be able to get by without doing homework and still get a decent grade.;
, Say your computer or internet wasn't working, or your printer broke. Be aware that this is a common and pretty flimsy excuse, so your teacher may not buy it.


If your teacher expects you to email her your assignment, ask her the next day if she got your email. When she says she didn't, act confused and explain that you definitely emailed her and that you can't believe it didn't go through. She probably can't check to see if you are lying and will probably give you an extension.

, Try to pick something your teacher won't ask about too much or won't want to call your family to verify. Say your mom and dad are having marital problems. Get teary-eyed if you can do that on command.


Claim the death of a family member. Make it someone close enough that it would affect you, but not so close that the teacher will find out about it. A great aunt or uncle works as they tend to be older. There is also no limit on the amount of great aunts and uncles you have, whereas with grandparents there is a limited number of times you can use that excuse. Plus, you don't want to tempt karma by saying your grandma died unexpectedly.
Say that you are having a private family issue and you don't feel comfortable talking about it, but you can't do the homework.
Tell your teacher your dog ran away and you were looking for her all night and you were so worried you couldn't do your homework.

, Say you thought the assignment was due the next day or you wrote it down wrong. When the teacher says he is collecting your work, look worried and ask your classmates, ""What homework?!""


Tell the teacher you were in the bathroom when he assigned the work and you completely missed that you had homework.

, You can either fake sick to stay home from school completely, or just go to the nurse's office before class and tell her you have a terrible stomach ache, headache or menstrual cramps if you are a girl. Ask if you can lay down for the period.


This works best if you are somebody who rarely gets sick(maybe once or twice a year) then you will be more trustworthy if you appear sick.

, Discuss with her that your study habits aren't great and that you feel overwhelmed by the amount of work you are getting. The guidance counselor will offer you advice about how to manage your homework for the future, and can also speak to your teacher to extend the due date.

, Don't be cocky or blow your teacher off. Go to him before the class begins and tell him you simply couldn't get it done. Tell him you had too much work, you had to study for a huge exam, you were exhausted or feeling unwell, or you didn't understand the assignment. Show that you don't feel good about not doing your homework. He may give you an extension or tell you not to worry about it this time.


If you do this too often your teacher will stop being sympathetic, so make sure it only happens once or twice.

"
"
Claim a safe but real illness.,
Stay home.,
Schedule some self-care.,
Use vague language after the event has passed.,
Follow up with the host.",How to Get Out of Going to an Event2," You should never claim a serious or debilitating illness you do not actually have, as these claims are easily debunked. This is especially true if the function in question is a work function, as your supervisor could request that a doctor’s note be delivered.Real but safe illnesses include the flu, a cold, bronchitis, or (for women) even a case of severe menstrual cramps.

, On the date of the event you’re hoping to avoid, do not--under any circumstances--leave the house. Sick people do not go out shopping, run errands, or drive around, unless a visit to the pharmacy is in order. Stay home to avoid suspicion.


If you cannot stay home, prepare yourself for the possibility of running into someone. Have an excuse for being out and about at the ready.

, During the time of the event, give yourself some at-home pampering. This way, if someone asks how your evening went, you can honestly say something such as, “I took it easy, took a bath, and stayed in bed for most of the night,” or something similar.If you claimed to have a cold or the flu, you can give yourself a facial to reveal fresh, pink skin to create the illusion of being tired or out of sorts.

, Don’t go into specifics about your illness. You can simply say you were under the weather. Most people do not want to hear the details of others’ sickness, anyway, so do not feel you have to volunteer detailed information.If someone does ask exactly what was wrong with you, you can grimace and say, “You don’t want to know,” or something in a similar vein.

, If necessary, contact the host and once again express your regret at having fallen ill, and ask how the event went. Doing so lends more credibility to your illness, as it creates the illusion that you are genuinely disappointed at having missed the party."
"
Be quick on your feet.,
Schedule something at the same time.,
Go to your appointment, date, etc.,
Express interest in hearing about the event.,
Express your regrets at having had plans.",How to Get Out of Going to an Event3," Quickly identify something you can schedule during the party or event in question, and ruefully claim you’ve already scheduled something else.If you are not known for being quick on your feet, pause for a moment and say you’re thinking about whether or not you are free, or rifle through your phone or calendar while you try to come up with something.
You can say something such as “I have a doctor’s appointment that day, I’m so sorry!”

, This is key to successfully pulling off this ruse. Actually scheduling something at the same time will make keeping up the pretense of your story extremely easy.If you claim a social or work appointment, you can even take a photo or recording of your presence at said appointment to upload to Instagram or Facebook.

, Actually go once you’ve scheduled an appointment! This is a great way to complete a task you’ve pushed aside or avoided, as you have no way to back out of it. If someone later asks how your appointment went, you won’t have to fumble for an explanation: you’ll be able to honestly describe how your day or evening went.Choose an appointment that is not readily rescheduled. A hair appointment, for instance, can likely be pushed to another time, but a doctor’s appointment is harder to reschedule.

, Once the event has passed, if you see the host or person who invited you, ask about the event, how it went, who was there, etc. Be gracious in hearing about what transpired.

, After you discuss the party, once again express your regret that you had something else scheduled, and finish your conversation with something such as, “I’m sorry I wasn’t able to come--it sounds like a great party.”Be sincere. If you cannot think of something nice to say, you can just apologize and leave it at that.

"
"
State your concerns about going.,
Explain why you don’t think going is a good idea.,
Answer any questions the host might have.,
Be kind, but firm in your decision.",How to Get Out of Going to an Event4," Upon being invited, honestly and clearly state why you don’t think attending would be a good idea. Your reasons can span quite a few possibilities, including running into a recent ex, not having enough knowledge of the event in question, or even that you are too tired and need a night to yourself.Some people will be offended by you honestly expressing a desire to stay home. If this is something you can handle--great. If not, you may need to use one of the aforementioned techniques.

, Once you’ve expressed your concerns, reiterate why your presence is not needed. Once you’ve expressed your concerns, the host might try to convince you to change your mind, or have counter-arguments as to why you should come. Explain why your presence is a bad idea, citing example scenarios.You could say, “My ex is going to be there, and I’m not ready to see her yet.”
You could also say, “I am exhausted, and that is my only day off.”

, When you turn people down, they are often flabbergasted and want reasons for your reaction. While you do not have to answer any questions they pose, do try to be gracious in your responses and provide any answers you feel comfortable giving.When you answer questions, do so with respect. If you are not comfortable with the types of parties the host throws, try to phrase your reason carefully, such as, “I’m not much of a drinker, so I always feel awkward and out of place.”

, At the close of the conversation, the person inviting you may offer a last-ditch attempt to get you to come. Many people end up caving in at this stage out of guilt and accept the invite, but be (kindly) firm in your “no.” It might hurt your host’s feelings, but they will likely appreciate your honesty.Do not give in, then change your mind and cancel later. If you do not want to go, say so directly. If you give in, stick to your commitment.

Make it look like you did the work if your teacher only glances at your homework.,
Look up the answers online or in the back of the book.,
Act like you did the homework, but forgot it at home.,
Get help from friends.,
Destroy the assignment if it's on a CD or flash drive.,
Purposely corrupt the file.",How to Get out of Doing Homework2," Put random but relevant-looking work (ex: 2+2= 23/7 Carry the four Multiply by two 7) and hope that they don't look too closely.


If your teacher walks around the class checking for homework, but doesn't take it in, write your homework page and task at the top of some random notes you have for that class. If she's not attentive she won't notice.
If she is attentive try to distract her by asking her a question related to her subject or show her a word in the text book you don't understand.

, Many textbooks have all or half of the answers listed in the back of the book (especially math books). Your teacher may have found the worksheets or questions online, too, so search for the answers online.

, Search your bag thoroughly in front of the teacher before coming up empty handed. Say something like ""I'm so sorry, my alarm didn't go off this morning and I was so late that I just shoved everything in my bag. I must have forgotten it.""


Say you must have left it on your desk/in the car/on the bus and ask if you can turn it in at the end of the day. Then you can quickly do the assignment during lunch.

, Ask someone for the answers or to do your homework for you. You can make a deal with a friend that if they do your assignment this time, you'll get them back another time. Just remember that this can be considered cheating, and you could be in big trouble if you get caught.


Try asking one friend for answers to questions #1 and #2, then another friend for the answers to questions #3 and #4, and so on until the assignment is complete.
Assemble a study group and let them work out all the answers.
If you have a friend who owes you a favor, tell him this is how he can repay his debt.

, Crack the CD in the case before class then carry a lot of stuff to the class and fall or drop everything as you walk into class. Pick up your broken CD. Your teacher will be sympathetic as the entire thing just happened in front of her eyes.


Bring in a blank flash drive and swear to your teacher you saved it to the drive and you don't know what happened.

, You can open a program in one program and then forcefully save it as a word document. When your teacher tries to open the document, it will show an error message.


Go into File Explorer and find the file you want to make corrupt. Right click over the file and select 'Open With...', then select Notepad. Once the file opens in Notepad you should see a really bizarre document with gibberish. Click anywhere within the document and type something random in it, disturbing the flow. After this just save and submit. When your teacher opens it, it will show up an error.
Do not select ""use application as default"" when selecting Notepad after File Explorer step or else all word documents (.docx) will automatically in Notepad showing gibberish.
Create a blank image in Paint and save it in .bmp format. After that, forcefully change its format into .doc, and change the title to the name of your homework assignment. Now, when you try to open the file in any text viewing program, it will show up as a broken file. Send it to the teacher, and if he asks you the next day just say sorry about this inconvenience and promise to send it this evening. Now, you have an extra day to complete your homework.
Open a non-word document say a song so its a .mp3 file. Right click > Properties. In the top of the properties name change .mp3 to .docx. It will now default to opening in word and look like a corrupt word document! Many professors I've had give me a day to ""resubmit"" the paper. In that time I write the paper and submit it.

Say that you need to work on the computer.,
Tell your parents you did all your homework at school already during lunch or during your study hall.,
Tell your parents  you're going to the library or a friend's house to study.",How to Get out of Doing Homework3," You could be on the computer telling your parents that you're doing your homework, and when they walk away, all you have to do is open a new tab on the window and go do whatever you want to do. Remember to switch back to doing your homework when the parent comes back.


So your parents check your history? Easy. If you have the Google Chrome browser, you can use Incognito mode. This will not track your history at all. Press ctrl+shift+N at the same time to open an Incognito tab. Remember to close all Incognito tabs before you go back to doing your homework.

Make them proud in front of others.,
Be consistent.",How to Fool Your Parents Into Thinking You're Good1," Cover the basics: be polite, do your chores, and maintain good grades at school. If you’re having trouble in a particular class, study that much harder. Prove to them that your trouble isn’t due to a lack of effort.


Keep it up when you’re alone. Do your chores and homework when they’re out of the house. Provide evidence that your alone-time is spent productively and responsibly. Inspire trust that you can be left alone without causing any worries.;
, Show your parents that you think about family and how you can make things better for them. Offer to do more around the house or, even better, just do it and surprise them. Prove to them that you are both mature and considerate toward others., Ask about their day. Ask about their own experiences as kids. Show concern about their well-being and interest in their own lives. Make them feel appreciated and loved.


Set aside your cellphone when you engage them. Show them that they have your full attention. If you receive a call, check who it is and set your phone back down. Show your parents that they’re a priority in your life.

, Acknowledge the nice things they do for you. Show them that you appreciate the time, effort, and/or money they spend in trying to make you happy.Show gratitude even if the nice thing they do is something you could really do without. If your parents buy season tickets for the local baseball team without realizing that you hate baseball, you don’t have to pretend to love the game, but you should still make a point of thanking them for the effort that they’ve made. Showing appreciation even when you’re disappointed will help ensure that they’ll do the same if and when you disappoint them.

, Be on your best behavior in public. Parents feel judged by others when their kids act up. Bolster their self-esteem by being polite and attentive to other adults., Behave at school and elsewhere exactly as you would at home. Keep your parents’ image of you intact by ensuring that no teacher or other adult breaks it.

Ask first.,
Ask when your parents are in a good mood.,
Ask if they have a minute.,
Give them time to think.,
Make a bargain.",How to Fool Your Parents Into Thinking You're Good2," Avoid getting into trouble for doing something that your parents might have allowed if you had only asked for permission. Say a friend is having a party at their house while their parents are out of town; some parents might say no to this, but others may be persuaded to say yes. Consider your situation and whether or not your parents are likely to be persuaded.

, If they’re already mad, worried, or otherwise stressed about something else, wait for a time when they’re less likely to dismiss you with an instant no. Seize the opportunity when they’re more relaxed and willing to consider your proposal., If they say no, wait for when they have more time to hear you out. If you do have to wait, open again by asking if they have a minute. Let them know that you expect to have a conversation, not an instant one-word answer. Increase their likelihood of saying yes by letting them know that they don’t have to answer immediately., Tell your parents that you don’t expect an answer this minute. Invite them to talk it over or sleep on the idea. Acknowledge that they might have concerns about your proposal and, by doing so, prove yourself to be both mature and considerate toward others., If your parents still seem indecisive or leaning toward “no,” volunteer to do extra chores or accept other responsibilities. Show them you’re mature enough to work for something that you really want.Or, make compromises. Propose the same conditions that you expect they would stipulate before they can: give your own curfew, for example, or promise to call every hour.

Use the truth to tell a lie.,
Misdirect with indirect answers.,
Anticipate your parents’ questions.",How to Fool Your Parents Into Thinking You're Good3," If you do have to go behind your parents’ back, avoid all the work that goes into a) coming up with a false story, b) telling it convincingly, c) coaching all your friends and collaborators in the same lie to back you up, and d) worrying about whether it will hold together. Instead, lie by omission when needed. Tell your parents what’s true and acceptable to them, and leave out what isn’t. For instance, if you’re going to your friend’s party while their parents are out of town, tell your parents only that you’re going over to your friend’s house. Don’t mention the party or that their parents are away. Although it’s not the whole truth, what you’ve said is technically true, so you’re less likely to give yourself away with nervous tics and tells.

, If your parents ask you a direct question that you can’t answer truthfully, avoid a direct answer. Instead, offer them a true statement that only seems to answer their question.Say your parents ask if your friend is a good kid. You know that, by their definition of “good,” the answer is no. Your friend smokes cigarettes, drinks beer, and sneaks out of his house at night. But despite all that, your friend’s a straight-A student. So, to answer your parents' question, simply answer, “He’s a straight-A student.”

, Ask yourself what they’re likely to ask you. Have an answer ready when they do. Avoid having to come up with a lie on the spot."
"
Act mature.,
Accept responsibility.,
Apologize.,
Propose a solution.",How to Fool Your Parents Into Thinking You're Good4," Alleviate your parents’ disappointment by behaving like an adult. Avoid making a scene, blaming others, or acting defensively., Acknowledge that you did the wrong thing.This will assure your parents that, despite having been “bad,” you still know the difference between bad and good. Admitting to your bad behavior won’t win you any prizes, but your parents will likely see it as an example of good behavior, which will lessen their disappointment in you.

, Say the words: “I’m sorry.” Acknowledge the fact that you’ve disappointed your parents and ask them to forgive you. Repair the bonds between you by making the moment about all of you instead of just you., Assure your parents that you’ll behave differently in the future. Offer ways to make up for what you’ve already done.. Anticipate how they would likely punish you and offer the idea as if it was your own. Prove to them that earning their trust back is important to you.

Once you get the new dish soap, say that that's making you itchy, too.,
Once you get the gloves, rip the sponges with a fork or knife until they're ratty, but not shredded.,
When your parents get you new sponges, rip your gloves a little bit with a knife, fork or scissors.,

",How to Get Out of Washing the Dishes2,",, This works best for young children since they'll probably want to do it because your parents won't let them.

,, If someone's coming, pretend to be washing the dishes and tell the person washing the dishes to hide in the bathroom or a place they can see themselves and wash their hands to look like they weren't washing the dishes for you.

Make a second visit to the nurse.",How to Fake Sick to Stay Home from School," If you are planning on staying home the next day, tell your mom or dad that you don't feel well the night before.Don’t tell them too early the day before, because some illnesses tend to go away overnight like a stomach ache. Aim for starting your symptoms after 6:30 P.M. or after dinnertime.
If you've been ill before with a virus or bug repeat those symptoms; it will seem less like you are faking. But remember that you can't get the same bug twice! If you've been to see someone who had a cold or something replicate those symptoms so it seems as though you caught it from them.
Slap your cheeks. When you are starting to develop a cold or you're becoming ill, your cheeks are red. You can mimic this by slapping your cheeks repeatedly when your parents are not looking. Don’t overdo it though, you don’t actually want to hurt yourself! Or you could use face paint, but that might come off.
Act slightly clumsy, as this will make you look ill or tired.;
, Your parents will believe you more if you sacrifice something you like to do as well as the thing you don't like (school).


Don’t finish eating half of your favorite meal at dinnertime. When your parent(s) ask what's wrong, tell them that your stomach hurts. Make sure you hide snacks in your room so you can miss a meal so they think you are sick because you're ""not feeling well.”
If you have plans with friends, cancel going out with them.
Ask to be excused from family time or don’t watch your favorite TV show.

, This will cover the fact that you're trying to stay home from school, while giving you a reason to stay home the next day.


If you normally do your homework at night, get started on it, but put your head down periodically so that they see you're not feeling well and it's interfering with your work.
If you usually do your homework on time, continue to do it to make it look like you were intending to go to school, but halfway through, complain about feeling ill.
By not finishing your homework, they'll have another excuse to keep you from school.
This works best if you have parents who care about your grades.

, Choosing to actually go to bed early will be a red flag, especially if you usually to try to stay up later than you’re allowed.


Don't say anything or just say you're not feeling well and need to lie down.
Alternatively, try to catch your parents’ attention by just walking by them or out of the room and head straight for your bed.
If you feel like you really are sick, but so mild that your parents wouldn't even listen, exaggerate your symptoms. (For example, nauseated becomes I'm about to throw up) Some studies say that you feel like what you think, so that might be an awesome plan which your parents can't foil! Remember: this devious step only works if you are getting sick in reality, so don't just go for this one if you're not sick. This is a strengthener for your saying for next morning!
Don't brush your teeth. If your parents notice, they'll probably come into your room to remind you. At that point, they'll probably wonder what's wrong, and you can tell them that you're not feeling well.
Appear impatient, maybe even cranky, and eager to go to bed. Don't act too cranky, though, you want your parents’ sympathy for being sick, not punishment for being rude!

, Wake yourself and your parents up around 1:00 A.M. and tell them you’re not feeling well.


If you're pretending to have stomach issues, tell them you just threw up (having left some fake vomit in the toilet).Force tears (if you can) to make it seem real that you’re sick. Try and make it realistic though! Think of a pet dying or something sad to make yourself cry.
Pull at the bottom of your eyelids until it hurts then blink hard a few times; you should get watery eyes.
For flu or sore throat symptoms, cough or clear your throat loudly enough for them to hear in their bedrooms. Rub your face vigorously right before they come in to look red and appropriately ill.

, This gives you bags underneath your eyes, and you will have a legitimate reason to have a day off. Purple or gray eye shadow works too to look like you have bags.


Go to bed an hour or two later than you usually fall asleep. This may make small bags underneath your eyes or make them slightly puffy.
Try to get at least four hours of sleep if you don’t want to be too sleep-deprived for your sick day off.

, Put it in the toilet and pretend to throw up. If this doesn't wake them up, go get them and tell them what just ""happened"".

, Don’t volunteer to get yourself ready for school. Instead, act like it is a difficult task for you to perform.


Slowly dress, but not too slowly. Skip a button on your shirt, don't comb your hair properly, and don't tie your shoe laces properly (or even at all).
Have droopy eyes. Think of something sad and let your eyes water and droop. You can also rub them to give that slightly bloodshot look., Even if you got enough sleep the night before and don’t have natural bags under your eyes, there’s an easy way to fake it.


Take yours or your mom's light lavender or blueish eyeshadow.
Mix in some water to make the color fade into a more natural tint.
Rub it in well, but still make it noticeable.
You could also take some vaseline and rub it under your eyes.

, A lack of appetite is especially symptomatic of not feeling well. Your parents will be especially concerned if you love breakfast, or if they made your favorite breakfast treat.

, When your parents decide to let you stay home, don't just shrug and agree.Protest their decision (but only if you didn't have to convince them first). This reinforces the fact that you really are sick.
Say, ""But Mom, I'm going to have so much work to make up!"" or ""But I have a math test today!"" If your parents know you don't care about tests, say ""But I have band practice, or art class"" or something they know you enjoy.
Do not overdo it. Don't randomly state that you want to do a test if they know you don't care. This can backfire, unless you're careful.
And don't beg excessively to stay home, or your parents might know you are faking it.

, An allergic reaction or another kind of contagious rash will definitely keep you home.


First, scratch your chest lots until it's bright red.
Try to keep a circular pattern to make it look more realistic.
Finally try to combine the ""rash"" with something else like a runny nose or a headache.

, If you do a good job at seeming sick, your parents will probably want to take your temperature. Be ready, though, to to act quick and fake having a fever.Ask to go to the bathroom before they take your temperature.
Make sure you have a cup with you. Fill it with warm water to drink and rinse through your mouth, especially under your tongue. This will raise the temperature of your mouth.
Be sure to flush the toilet before you turn on the sink, just so your parents don't get too suspicious!
Note: this only works if they check it under your tongue, obviously. If the thermometer is one that goes in your ear, try to get it before your temperature's taken and hold it to something warm, like a radiator or a light bulb.
If your parents are the kind that just feel your forehead, frequently rub it rapidly when they're not looking, or take a blow dryer and heat your face and say your forehead feels warm.Put warm water in your armpits, forehead, and cheeks. It makes you warm and looks like you have been sweating.
You’re aiming for a temperature that is above 99 degrees (37 Celsius) but lower than 103 degrees (39.4 Celsius). If it's below 99 degrees than it doesn't count as a fever, if it's 103 degrees you'll likely be taken to the doctor's right away., It's very easy to fake a migraine because there's no way of knowing if you're telling the truth or not. By just faking the symptoms, your parents will believe you.Light and most sounds should bother you. Pretend you're annoyed by them.
Say that only one specific area of your head hurts, for example over your right eyebrow. This is essential if you want to fake a migraine.
Touch your forehead every now and then and frown when doing so.
Say that you feel dizzy and can't see very well. While walking slowly, suddenly stop, close your eyes and ""regain balance"" by holding onto something or someone.
Ask your parents if they could lower their voice a little.
If it's the day before the day you want to skip school, go take a nap and turn off all the lights, or if you're just chilling at home, turn off the lights closest to you and lie down on the nearest couch or chair.
Ask for medicine such as ibuprofen, but don't actually take it.

, This can work great especially after having breakfast.


Run suddenly to the bathroom.
Spend some time in the bathroom, flush the toilet, and spray a ton of air freshener to cover up the smell that isn't really there.
You can also try your hand at making fake diarrhea.

, Pink eye is super-common and also super-contagious! You'll definitely be staying at home if anyone suspects that you have pink eye.


Get red lipstick( most likely in your mom's purse) and some Vaseline and rub them along the lips of one eye.
Be sure to only do this for one eye though, since pink eye does not usually infect both., Other than your word, the only other real symptom for these are vomiting, which you can also fake pretty easily.


After eating a meal, start complaining that you feel sick.
If your parents aren’t looking, stick your finger down your throat (but not too far), and you will start retching but not vomiting. When you feel as though you might actually throw up, quickly remove your fingers. Use this technique sparingly, though, you don't want to hurt yourself.
Have fake vomit ready to complete the effect. Get oatmeal and water, run to the bathroom, put the oatmeal and water in your mouth, then spit it in the toilet and show your parents.
You can also fake a vomiting incident by pouring fake vomit on your floor (or on your bed if you want it to be more believable). In the morning say that you don't remember it and act apologetic to whoever has to clean it up. Be careful with making people clean it up, because if they look at it too closely they're might realize that it's not actually vomit.
If you've started having your period, tell your parents you have cramps or it's that time of the month. Your dad probably won't want to even talk about it, and your mom will understand. Neither of them will be able to disprove it.

, There are many cold and flu that are easy to mimic. These are also highly contagious conditions, so your parents will probably not want to send you to school and infect your classmates.Blow your nose in a bunch of tissues and throw them on the floor or on your nightstand/on your bed. Then your parents will think you have a runny nose and they will not let you go to school if you have that much of a cold.
Breathe only through your mouth, as if your nose is stuffed.
If you're not in the same room as they, and they ask you something, hold your nose slightly when you talk.
Wear many layers of clothing. This makes it look as though you have the chills and are freezing.
Sneeze loudly, then sniffle in front of your parents. Do this also when they're not in the same room but can overhear you from wherever they are.
Stretch your lips to make them look chapped and twist your nose to make it red.
Mention that your “bones hurt” or that you have lots of aches and pains all over.

, Be careful not to make it seem like you have strep throat, though, as this can land you in the doctor’s office.


When walking around keep your mouth open and your throat to become dry.
Avoid eating and drinking.
Suck on red colored cough drops to make your throat look red.
Grimace when you swallow. Speak in a deep, croaky tone and constantly take sips of water.
Say that you feel a bit scratchy in your throat, or that it feels like you’re swallowing glass.

, Chances are your parents will check on you during your day home to either make sure you’re not faking, or to see if you’re feeling better.


If your parents are at home with you, then just pretend to sleep and be sure to act accordingly when they check in on you.
If your parents are at work, call to check-in with them. This will make you seem responsible, and not seem like you're having fun.
If they call to check on you from work, wait for the phone to ring three or three and a half times before you answer, and sound as tired as you can.

, If you do stay home, pretend to sleep a lot and gradually start ""getting better"".


Around mid-day, remove one or two of your symptoms.
If you don't show any signs of improvement towards the end of the day, your parents might want to take you to the doctor, who will see that there's no illness to be found.
If you think your parents will take you to the doctor, try to phase out the sickness or just admit it.

, You're supposed to be home sick in bed, remember?!


Don't leave or get caught outside of the house. If a neighbour or friend of your parents sees you, they might tell.
Be sure to put away any games before your parents come home. If they see you've been having fun, they'll suspect that you were faking the whole time.
Clear out your internet history so that they won't know you were playing on the internet during the day.
Don't forget to especially clear this search from your history.
Do not save bookmarks or download items on your computer; parents will notice that you did these things during your “sick day.” Delete this page from your browser history, so your parents won't see it and question you.

, Depending on your school, you’ll have to get permission from your teacher to go to the nurse’s office. Nurses can be tough and are usually good at spotting fakers because they see them basically every day. It can be easier to fool them, though, if you plan to make two visits at different points in the day.Wait about an hour to two hours after the school day starts, then ask your teacher if you can go to the bathroom.
After taking a little longer than usual, go back to class and tell her/him you threw up and need to go to the nurse.

, Start with simple requests like these rather than bluntly stating ""I want to go home.""


When you first get to the nurse, tell them that you don’t feel well, that you are dizzy, or feel like you want to sleep.
Ask if you can rest a little while before going back to class. This makes it seem like you don't necessarily want to go home, and are trying to make it through the school day rather than faking it., This will lend realism to your story and make it seem like you really don't feel well.


Don't overdo it with fake snoring, though, just keep it simply by covering your face with the pillow or a rag.
This will also make it seem like you're sensitive to light (migraine symptom), and seem like you are indeed trying to sleep it off.

, The nurse might want to run a few medical tests on you to confirm your story.


If your nurse wants to take your blood pressure, hold your breath while he/she is taking it. This helps to lower your blood pressure and make it seem like you are, indeed, ill.Tell your nurse that you threw up; they most likely won't question that.
Your nurse will also most like want to take your temperature. Be prepared for an oral thermometer by rinsing your mouth with hot water right before you go see them, or by running around a little so that you can raise your body temperature and appear to be feverish.

, If your nurse sends you back to class, don't worry! This just means that you'll be paying a second visit which gets you out of class and this time will get you sent home for good.


Tell the nurse that you're tried but are still not feeling well and that you are ""too sick to concentrate."" These are golden words.
Say that you're starting to feel some of the above symptoms for the flu, nausea, etc.
Keep it simple. Don't overdo it by over-exaggerating symptoms or listing too many. Just say that you feel ""bad,"" ""have a headache,"" and ""can't concentrate in class because it hurts.""
It will be tempting to ask her to call your parents, but don't do it!. This will be a red flag for her that you're trying to go home rather than really feeling sick.If you know someone who is already sick, say that you had recently hung out with them. Especially if the nurse knows that he/she is sick, you can act as though you caught whatever bug they had.

Note the the following suggestions are different methods.",How to Get Rid of Your Dinner Without Your Parents Knowing1," Thus, it's up to you to decide whether or not any particular method will work for you in your household. None of these approaches are guaranteed and you need to be fully aware that parents are not dumb, they've been there before and they know what kids get up to. In some cases, it may just be better to leave the food uneaten and to explain that you really, really hate that food and that you're just never eating it, ever. They will get the point eventually.

Plan in Advance- This is a very crucial part of your plan, this will give it the real effect and make your parents consider something is actually wrong with you.,
Tricks up your sleeve- That night go to bed early to simulate being tired and drawn out but stay up as late as possible, to have a more sick and tired look about you in the morning, it is really helpful.,
During your “Sick” Day- Try to stay in bed all day, watching TV and napping, don’t do anything too loud or anything that takes much energy, because your parents might come in and check on you during the day, and you could be in copious amount of trouble if caught faking.,
Back to School- The next morning say you feel well enough to attempt to go back to school, eat your breakfast and get ready faster than the day before, it will make it seem you are getting better.",How to Fake Sick when You Are Too Lazy to Go to School," Two nights before is best, but if you don’t want to, the night prior is fine also. When you come home from school on your chosen day, tell your easiest and most caring parent about how hard it was to be attentive in class. Most likely they will ask why, tell them your chosen sickness was hurting you, ask if you can go lie down, grab your self a flat ginger ale, or even better ask them to get you it. Then see if you can sneak some snacks up in your room. Reason for this, for added effect, skip out on dinner, say that you don’t feel well enough to handle food. If you have chosen two days in advance, get up the next morning and get ready, tell your parents your feeling a bit better and you are going to try to go to school, then when you come home say you felt even worse, and it started to hurt again during class. Repeat your same routine from the night prior.;
, If you want to, you can wake your parents up to have some medicine, obviously you will have to take it, but spit it out when you are alone in your room. Many kids would be in trouble for waking their parents up but, take the risk. In the morning they could try to force you to go to school, if they do, spend a little more time to get out, then have some cereal but pick at it, saying you don’t feel like eating. Then slowly start to dress, put on really comfy clothes, and don’t brush your hair properly. If they actually make you go, then go. But only for a while, call their cell phone, saying you can’t handle it anymore. it will work more or less. If your parents let you stay home you may protest, it's personal choice to do this or not do, your parents may start to think you are faking. But if you have something you enjoy, say “We were going to start basketball in gym today…” It may work.

, At dinner that night say you are feeling a little better, and eat some of your dinner saying you are also starting to get your appetite back. If you eat it all you could look like you are extremely hungry, and people who have not eaten in a while tend to slowly regain their appetite. Go to bed a little early, saying you are still a bit tired and need more sleep.

, Come home saying you barely are in pain any more, and you are well healed. Everything can go back to normal.

Note before trying this method that dogs should not eat many foods that humans eat.,
Call the dog in during dinner.,
Sneak pieces of the food you don't want to the dog when nobody is looking.

,
Use this method only once in a while.",How to Get Rid of Your Dinner Without Your Parents Knowing6," Only feed the dog what is safe, and if you don't know what is unsafe for a dog, then read this: Knowing which foods are dangerous for your dog. If you can't work out whether or not something is safe for your dog, do not give the food to your dog. This method works best with unprocessed pieces of meat without bones, or marinades, spices or mustard on it.

, Have the dog sitting under or near your feet.

,, It's not fair to your dog to fatten it up on your unwanted food, as it could make the dog sick or overweight. If the dog gets used to this method, it will become a bad habit and your dog may suffer from eating too many excess table scraps.

Tell your parents a day or two before you plan to miss school you are feeling bad.,
That night, set your alarm for 2:00 AM.,
As long as they did not accuse you of faking it the night before, wake up later than you usually do in the morning.,
If they take you to the doctor's office, groan and rub your face a lot.",How to Fake Sick and Miss School Successfully,"


If you want them to think you have strep throat, for example, whine every once in a while about your throat burning. Don't be afraid to get descriptive. Don't mention it too often however, or they will be on to you.






For the stomach bug, don't eat as much as you normally do and sneak food later, etc. If you want to really make them think you are getting sick, when they are watching, rub your eyes, then find a spot to curl up a ball. Complain you can't sleep in mid/late afternoon.





;
, Make sure it isn't loud enough to wake up your parents though.


Turn on a lamp and shine the light on your forehead close to the skin for a minute or two.






Then quietly get a washcloth hot and press to your face/forehead until it is no longer hot.






Now, go wake up either your mom or dad to tell them in a whiny voice you feel really bad. Talk slowly as well for a realistic effect. Ask them if they have any medicine you can take. If they give you some, pretend to take it. If they insist upon watching, just keep the pill between your teeth and try not to get it wet with spit so you can spit it in the trash without it dissolving in your mouth







, If your parent comes to wake you up, sit up and tell them you feel really bad again. Act weak, pitiful and sad.


If they don't come to wake you, slowly make your way downstairs or to where they are. Rub your face and forehead while you are in front of them and lay down whenever you get the chance. Either moan or tell them how bad you feel. Focus on infectious things that they won't want you spreading at school (like sore throat, fatigue, nausea or stomach complaints secondary to infections that might not carry a fever but may make teachers and students want to keep you at home where you can't infect everyone else around you).






If they tell you to go back to bed, protest. Tell them you have a test or something you don't want to miss. If they either accuse you of faking it or tell you that you can't miss more school, wait a second before you feign more symptoms so they don't sense you are pulling their leg. Ask them to repeat themselves and act confused--then emphasize you are confused and start to lay down and curl up somewhere






Toss and turn and cry/whine quietly. It seems pathetic, but it works.






If they tell you to go back to bed but tell you they will take you to the doctor, agree, groan, and go back to bed. Never ever smile. If you start to feel happy, think of something very sad so you can control it.







, Always whine. There are no specific directions for the doctor's office, honestly. Just make sure you never smile, laugh, or talk as much as you normally would.

Talk about stomach issues.,
Invent a dicey dining situation.,
Use a likely food as the scape goat.,
Broadcast your illness.,
Plan at home activities.,
Focus on symptoms difficult to verify.,
Be dramatic.,
Keep your sick call short.,
Return to work under the weather.,
Get a doctor's note.,
Print a fake doctor's note.,
Enlist an ally.",How to Fake Food Poisoning," If you've had stomach issues in the past or claim to have a weak stomach, this will make it more believable when you claim to be suffering food poisoning. Try not to focus on this too much, as this can be suspicious, but in the week before you claim you are ill, you might want to mention once or twice that your stomach is sensitive and has given you trouble in the past.


If you plan on using bad restaurant food as your excuse for food poisoning, you might mention you have had stomach issues with this kind of food before.
As an example, if you plan on ""getting sick"" from Mexican food, a week before you might say, ""I love Mexican food, but it always does a number on my stomach."";
, You don't have to actually go out to eat, but if you tell your classmates, coworkers, or boss that you're going to eat somewhere likely to cause food poisoning, that'll make it more believable when it happens. Certain foods, like Mexican, Indian, and Chinese, have a reputation for causing stomach issues. You might use one of these to make your condition credible.


You should be careful when choosing a restaurant if you do not intend to dine there. If someone you know is at the restaurant at the same time you say you were, this could hurt your story.
A safer option might be to say you ate some bad food at a private dining event, like a family dinner or reunion. You can add credibility to this claim by complaining that one of your relatives is an awful cook., Some kinds of food are more likely to give you food poisoning than others. The most common of these are poultry, meat, fish, and eggs.Food made with raw eggs, like a homemade cake or brownies, are also likely causes. When calling in sick, you might say that you ate one of these.


To make your story more convincing, you might say something like, ""I had some fish last night and I think it gave me food poisoning. The flavor seemed off, and I only ate half of it, but my stomach's killing me now!""
Avoid being overly dramatic when describing the food you've eaten. If you talk about the food as though it was rotten, it may come across as suspicious.
It may help you keep your story straight if you choose a specific dish that made you sick. For example, you could choose dumplings or a pork burrito as the culprit that caused your food poisoning.

, By telling your friends and family you're not feeling well in a Facebook post or Tweet, it's more likely people will believe you've got food poisoning. For example, you might say something like, ""I'm going to be on the down-low for a day or two. Got food poisoning last night.""You might also broadcast your illness by calling a classmate or coworker you are close with, informing them you have food poisoning, and asking if they are willing to fill you in on what's happened when you get back.

, If you call in sick with food poisoning and someone sees you out and about, it could cause trouble for you. You'll have a much smaller chance of being found out if you relax at home instead. Restock your supplies, like food and drink, the day before you are sick so you don't run the risk of bumping into someone who thinks you're sick.You could plan a day-long movie marathon for your ""sick"" day, catch up on chores around the house, read a book, or call and catch up with old friends and family.
Be careful with your social media posts when you're pretending to be ill. If you post something on Facebook or Twitter that makes it sound like you're well, your story might not hold up.

, Stomach pain and nausea will be the two easiest conditions for you to imitate and the hardest to confirm. Food poisoning often causes cramping and shooting stomach pain, so you might want to use these terms to describe your symptoms.Food poisoning often leads to dehydration and light-headedness. To convey these symptoms, you could say things like, ""My mouth is really dry,"" and ""Every time I stand up, I get dizzy.""

, Food poisoning is often a highly unpleasant illness, so it's OK if you dramatically clutch at, hold, or hug your stomach and say you're in pain.Nausea can be indicated with a simple comment, like, ""I've felt like I was going to throw up all morning."" Avoid eating if you claim nausea, as most people can't eat on an upset stomach.


Be careful not to overact too much, especially if you're younger and trying to convince your parents. Acting like you're in too much pain might end up with you getting taken to the doctor's office.
If you have to convince parents you are ill and have enough time, you can make some fake vomit to convince them of your nausea.

, When you're sick, the last thing you want to do is make small talk over the phone. Keep your call short and to the point. Briefly tell the person to whom you are reporting sick what you ate, how you feel, and that you will not be able to come in to work or school today.

You may want to change your voice a little bit during the call. Aim for a tone that is weak, strained, and/or sounds like you are in mild discomfort.

, Food poisoning often lingers, so it's best if you return to work looking like you're still feeling its effects.Try to avoid physical exertion and small talk. If someone asks you to do something physical, say that you're still feeling a little rough after getting over food poisoning and you cannot help.

, Many doctors will provide you with a sick note for a kind of ""mental health day"" even if you are not sick.However, this is not always the case, and if you are unsure whether or not your doctor will give you a sick note for your fake food poisoning, you may want to try other measures for providing proof.


Some schools or places of employment require an official doctor's note for you to be excused for the day. Check your student or employee handbook to verify if you'll need a doctor's note.

, There are resources online that provide fake doctor's notes to those who are playing hooky by pretending to be sick. You should be careful when doing this. If you are found out, it could result in serious repercussions.


There are three major features you should look for when searching for a fake doctor's note. The service should provide free sample notes, reasonable prices, and a verification service so if your teacher/boss calls, the note seems legitimate., If you have a trustworthy friend or parent, you can use them as additional proof you aren't feeling well. Have your friend or parent call or speak to your teacher or boss to tell them that you haven't been feeling well after you ate last.


If you bring other people in on your food poisoning scheme, you should make sure that everyone has the same story. For example, you might have your parent/friend specifically mention that you didn't feel well after eating a burrito.

Try faking a cold or flu.,
Convince everyone you have diarrhea or a stomach flu.This one might be a little embarrassing, but it’s very effective if you want to go home from school.If you can deal with the awkwardness, it’s a good choice because it’s not usually challenged – if you have diarrhea, no one is going to want you around.,
Pretend to have a migraine.Since migraines don’t have as many visible symptoms as other sicknesses, your acting skills will need to be very good to pull this off.,
Start early in the day.,
Apply pale makeup before class begins.,
Don’t eat lunch and drink very little.,
Move slowly and appear dazed.All sicknesses are going to slow you down and affect how quickly you are able to think.,
Jump up suddenly and race out of the classroom.,
Remain in the bathroom for 10 or 15 minutes.,
Go back to the classroom but don’t go inside.,
Whisper to your teacher what’s happening.,
Look visibly upset.,
Hit the bathroom again on your way to the nurse’s office.,
Create your fake fever.,
Don't ask the nurse to go home.,
Be consistent with your symptoms and pretend to “recover.” Make sure to show a few subtle symptoms when you come back to school after being “sick.” Otherwise, your teacher will probably get suspicious.",How to Fake Sick at School," Everyone recognizes the symptoms of these two common illnesses, so they are probably the easiest to pull off.Since they are so contagious, it’s very likely you’ll be sent home. You’ll need pretend to cough, sneeze, sniffle and so on. Faking a fever will probably seal the deal for you.


You won’t need a lot of props for this. Get a box of tissues and carry them around with you. Use plenty of them.
Applying a small amount of pale makeup will help you be slightly more convincing.
A bit of white powder or pale foundation is all you’ll need to give yourself a pasty look.;
, You’ll need to polish off those acting skills for this one.


If you’re afraid you can’t be convincing enough, you can always take laxatives. However, try to avoid this route if at all possible, since it will be very unpleasant for you.
Be prepared to jump up in the middle of class with a stricken look on your face and run to the bathroom.
Applying a subtle amount of pale makeup will help you pull this off. You can easily put the makeup on when you sprint to the bathroom.

, If you don’t have any props on you, a migraine is a good choice because you won’t need to alter how you look too much. Migraines are usually reoccurring, so if you convince the school nurse you have one the first time you try it, you can use it as an excuse to get out of school in the future, too.


You’ll need to moan, rub your temples, look nauseous, squint, and pretend that lights and sounds are making you feel worse.A small amount of pale makeup will help you be convincing in this scenario, as well.

, The sooner you start faking your symptoms, the sooner you can go home. You also want to avoid appearing completely fine for most of the day, and then “suddenly” start showing symptoms at 2pm. This will especially hurt your case if you are pretending to have a cold or the flu. You might be able to pull off a sudden migraine in the afternoon, but in most cases, you will need to start working on your ruse as soon as you get to school.


When faking a cold/flu, make sure to start coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose as soon as class starts.
If you cough really hard, it will make your throat a little scratchy and make you sound even sicker.
Look rumpled, tired and unkempt. Ask your teacher for cough drops if you are faking a cold/flu., Regardless of what sickness you choose to fake, looking pasty and exhausted will help you be more convincing. If possible, apply the makeup at home before you leave for school. That way, your parents will notice that you aren’t feeling well, too. If that’s not possible, hit the bathroom as soon as you get to school. Use a little bit of pale foundation and/or powder to make yourself look sick and tired. Lightly apply a dark eyeshadow under your eyes.


If you’re faking a cold/flu, put a little blush or red makeup on the tip of your nose and in the inside corners of your eyes. This will give the appearance of sinus issues.
Don’t overdo the makeup. You want it to look realistic. It shouldn’t be obvious that you have any on. If you need to, practice getting the right look at home the day before.

, Most illnesses, migraines included, will make you feel nauseous and unwilling to eat. For this reason, wolfing down a large lunch will look suspicious. Instead, pick at your lunch and sit with your shoulders slumped. Look as miserable as you can. If anyone asks, say you feel sick to your stomach.


Drink a small amount of water, slightly reluctantly, or a Sprite/7-Up. These beverages are well-known for relieving nausea.Ginger ale is another beverage option that people drink to help ease nausea.

, Try to look as out of it as you can. Move around very little. When you do move, move slowly. Keep your pace sluggish when you walk anywhere. When a teacher asks you a question, look confused. Reply slowly and in a spaced-out way.


Avoid sitting up straight at your desk – slump down and keep your eyes fixed on the surface of your desk.
When you stand up from your desk, sway a little so that you seem dizzy.
Grab your desk so that it looks like you’re trying to support yourself.

, If you are pretending to have a cold/flu, go just outside the classroom door and have a coughing fit. Make it sound really brutal. Rub your palm in a circular motion on the tip of your nose hard enough so that it will look red and irritated when you go back inside. If you’re faking a migraine or stomach flu, you’ll need to run all the way to the bathroom. This is because a migraine causes vomiting and stomach flu causes both vomiting and diarrhea.Vomiting/diarrhea usually strike suddenly, which is why you need to sprint like it’s an emergency.
Make sure your facial expression conveys panic when you jump up.
It will probably help to shout “I’m sorry!” over your shoulder as you head out the door, so that your teacher knows something is wrong. Sound as upset as you can when you say it.

, While you’re in there, cough loudly and make retching noises. Flush the toilet multiple times. Make a production of loudly washing your hands. Reapply a little pale makeup before you leave the bathroom. Then splash a small amount of water on your forehead so that you look clammy.


Dampen the hair at your temples slightly.
This will make it look like you’ve been sweating.

, When you come back, hold your stomach as if it’s hurting you. Wave your arms a bit and do whatever you can to get your teacher’s attention from the hallway so that they will come speak to you privately. You will need to look apologetic, embarrassed and very upset at this point.

, It's convincing to a teacher if you ask them for advice or input about the situation, like, ""What should I do?"" That way they are forced into a position of giving you helpful advice, which will almost always be for you to go see the nurse. Let your eyes glaze over a bit or look like you’re on the verge of crying. Then:


If you are faking a stomach flu, clutch your stomach and say, ""This is so embarrassing, but I have diarrhea. I just got very sick in the bathroom. What should I do, do you think it will come back?"" Look extremely humiliated.If you are faking a migraine, look nauseous and squint at any bright lights, then say, ""My head is pounding and I feel really dizzy. I just threw up in the bathroom and I'm kind of freaked out by how much it hurts. Is something wrong with me?""
If you’re faking a cold/flu, speak with a scratchy voice and say, ""I feel really awful. My body aches all over and my head feels weird. I feel really cold, but I keep sweating. What does that mean?""

, If your teacher doesn't seem to be buying your act, it's important to look like you're on the verge of tears. If you can squeeze one or two tears out, even better. Some teachers can be suspicious at first, but as long as you look teary-eyed, you should be good.


Apologize to your teacher and avoid asking to go to the nurse.
Instead, say something like, ""I don't know what to do. I feel so awful. What do you think I should do?""
Let your teacher suggest that you see the nurse.

, This is the final stretch – all you need to do now is convince the nurse that you need to go home. Check in the bathroom mirror to make sure your pale makeup looks believable. Add a bit more if necessary. Splash a little more water on your forehead and around your temples so that it looks like you’re clammy and sweating.


In almost all cases, the deciding factor for you going home is whether or not you have a fever.
All of these illnesses, except migraines, cause fever. This step won't work if using an ear or forehead thermometer. When the nurse takes your temperature, it needs to be 100°F (37°C) or higher.

, Turn on the tap in the bathroom until it gets very hot. Then fill up your mouth with the hot water. Make sure your cheeks aren't puffing out so you don’t look too obvious. Immediately head to the nurse’s office. Right before you walk in, swallow the hot water. When the nurse takes your temperature, it will read that you have a fever.Make sure you look awful when you walk into the nurse’s office.
Repeat whatever you told your teacher and be as convincing as possible.
Don’t overdo it! School nurses have heard every excuse in the book. It will be obvious to the nurse that you’re faking if you over-act.

, It could blow your cover. Instead, let the nurse be the one to suggest it. The best way to get the nurse to suggest this is to act very convincing and say the right things. If the nurse is skeptical, say things like, ""I knew I was feeling off this morning"" or ""I started feeling weird last night.""


If you're trying to fake a cold/flu say, ""My body aches all over and my head is pounding."" Have tissues with you and use them in front of the nurse. Avoid breathing through your nose so that you sound stuffy.If you're trying to fake a migraine/vomiting say, ""I've never had a headache this bad before. It hurts so much that I feel nauseous. I just threw up in the bathroom."" Squint and mention that lights and loud sounds make the headache worse.
If you're trying to fake a stomach flu/diarrhea say, ""I'm very nauseous and my stomach is cramping up. I have bad diarrhea and I'm afraid something embarrassing might happen."" Be sure to clutch your lower abdomen and look a bit dizzy and sweaty.

, Use a small amount of the pale makeup again so that you look pasty. Appear exhausted.


You can return all the way back to normal after two days or so.
If you were faking a cold/flu, try to cough occasionally when you return to class for at least a day or two.

Parents try hard to do their best by their kids and few parents want to make their child's eating a nightmare occasion.


Be understanding about the need to not waste food. A lot of household income is spent on food, so it's hard to know one has wasted money.

If they start asking you: ""Would you like some pancakes, honey?"" Just answer no. If they ask: ""Are you sure, sweetheart?"" Just say that you're not very hungry).

, Because the strong pill in an empty stomach, will appear as something your stomach doesn't like which equals getting rid of it. Just be sure that you leave your hands a bit in the way so they get a bit of messy (If your hands get too messy, or if someone else was in the bathroom, go to the sink and try to wash your hands. Still leave a bit of vomit on your hands). When you enter the classroom again, be sure to show ""unknowingly"" your hands to either your teacher, or your classmates. This will make them send you to the nurse and wash your hands. (There is a chance (1/25) that the teacher will ask you only to wash your hands, then come back to the class)

, If she takes your blood pressure, try to breathe as rare as you can, this will make your blood pressure lower. If she takes your temperature, say that you have to go to the bathroom again, because you think your going to throw up again. In the bathroom, put hot water on your body. If it's an ear thermometer, just put hot water on your ear, and rub it hard. Then return to the nurse. Your temperature should be higher now.

, To seem convincing, you should pretend that moving your ankle provides you a moderate amount of pain. Your ankle is likely to be examined by a teacher, parent, or healthcare provider. They will begin by moving your ankle from side by side. When this happens, show that it is painful, but do not overact.


Overacting may seem less convincing or result in your family or doctor running tests to determine the problem.

, Avoid moving your ankle from side to side or up and down as much as possible. If a doctor or healthcare provider looks at your ankle they might compare its range of motion to that of your unhurt ankle. A true sprain would limit your range of motion in the injured ankle.

Dry your eyes out.,
Rub the area around your eyes.,
Swim in the pool.,
Chop some onions.,
Use eye drops.,
Use a menthol stick.,
Leave overnight sleep crust in your eyes.,
Spread clear gloss or petroleum jelly underneath your eyes.,
Don't wipe any tears from your eyes.",How to Fake Pink Eye," When eyes aren’t getting enough moisture, they can get irritated and red. By simply trying to blink as little as possible for about 30 minutes, your eyes will start to become irritated because they aren’t being properly lubricated. You can expedite the process by sitting in front of a fan and trying not to blink, so they’ll dry out faster. But remember! We blink for a reason: to protect our eyes. So if the discomfort becomes too great, begin blinking normally again and perhaps even use some eye drops to rehydrate your eyes.;
, Doctors tell us that directly rubbing our eyes isn’t good for them because harmful bacteria may find its way in and cause irritation. You could also damage your cornea, which is the clear protective layer covering the iris.Rubbing your eyes does make them red and a little bloodshot, though — which is the look you're going for. To keep your eyes safe while attempting to make them red, rub the area around your eyes and indirectly stimulate them.


Don't rub directly over the eyeballs and eyelids. This will keep you from damaging your cornea or getting bacteria into your eyes, and will create a mild irritation that will cause sufficient redness.

, Ever go for a swim at the pool and find that your eyes are all red-rimmed and bloodshot? This is a common occurrence caused by irritants in the water. When the cornea comes in contact with water, the protective tear film on our eyes can be washed away, leaving our eyes more vulnerable to irritants.Chlorine can irritate eyes; it's the chemical in pools that’s used to kill bacteria and germs that people bring into the water. What kind of bacteria, you ask? The kind that comes from things like body oil, dirt and even pee (1 out of every 5 adults admit to peeing in pools).Chlorine can kill most bacteria, but not all of it; so once the protective tear film is washed away, bacteria can get into eyes and cause irritation.
Even though going for a swim can help you fake pink eye — if you’re not careful, you’ll actually get it. Pink eye is caused by harmful bacteria, and it’s a common infection that people get from swimming in pools. Figure out whether or not you want to risk real pink eye for fake pink eye., They're notorious for making people tear up when they’re sliced — which means they’re a quick and easy way for you to start producing tears for the weepy look of the bedeviled pink eye.


Onions produce a sulfur compound called syn-propanethial-S-oxide.When an onion is cut open, the compound is released into the air. When the chemical reaches your eyes, the lachrymal glands above the eyelids (responsible for the regulation of tears) produce tears to help wash away the irritating chemical.Sweet onions produce less syn-propanethial-S-oxide than other onion varieties because the sugar and high water content can abate the irritating enzymes.So if you’re really looking to get the tears going, chop the pungent red or white onions instead of the sweet yellow Vidalias.

, If you aren't trying to get too creative with your tear production techniques, then get some eye drops from the drugstore or supermarket. Usually, directions on eye drop containers suggest only one or two spurts into the eye. To create the illusion of more tears, put a few extra drops than you normally would into your eyes and let them run down your face. Don’t wipe the drops off your cheeks so that everyone will assume your eyes are in a constant state of weeping.

, Ever wonder how actors manage to cry on the spot? They could just be really good at their jobs... or they could also be using a menthol stick. Menthol sticks are waxy substances that come in lipstick tubes. To use it, you rub the waxy menthol beneath your eyes and then wait for your eyes to water.These are commonly used in theater productions to create realistic crying scenes. If you’re gonna act like you have pink eye, why not really give in to the performance and do as the professionals do?

, If you’ve just woken up, chances are, you have some dirt or “crust” in the corners of your eyes. Because pink eye involves a lot of crusty discharge around the eye, leaving the crust in your eyes from the night before adds to the natural look of infection and icky-ness.

, Pink eye can produce different colors and thicknesses of discharge depending upon how serious the infection is.In most cases, the discharge is thick and clear. By taking some clear lip gloss or petroleum jelly and spreading it about 15mm underneath the eye, you can create the illusion that your eyes are weeping thick liquid.


Make sure that the lip gloss you use has no sparkles in it so that people won’t be able to guess that it’s fake.
Also, while you have the gloss and petroleum jelly on your face, make sure not to rub your eyes! If these substances come in contact with your eyes, you can experience great discomfort — and the chemicals in those substances are not good for eyeballs.

, If you've managed to work up a lot of tears in your quest for the perfectly fake pink eye, they should pool around the rims of your eyes. Depending upon how gullible your audience is, you could convince them that the tears are thin, clear discharge.

Wrap your ankle in a bandage.,
Use crutches to walk.,
Wear a walking boot.",How to Fake an Ankle Sprain2," If you are trying to fake a sprain outside of a doctor’s office, it is best to appear as though you have seen a doctor. A doctor would typically wrap your ankle in a bandage to provide support and limit your motion. Start wrapping your ankle near the bridge of your foot. Continue to wrap the bandage around your foot and ankle until you reach the top of your ankle. Secure the bandage with the provided pin.You can find a stretch bandage at most general or drug stores.

, A doctor would typically advise that you avoid putting weight on your foot for two to six weeks after spraining your ankle. The best way to do this is by using crutches. You can find crutches at a medical supply store; however, keep in mind that your health insurance will not cover this cost without a doctor’s prescription., A more serious sprain might require a boot to help support the foot and more intensely limit your range of motion. You can also find a boot at a medical supply store.

Decide on a story and stick to it.,
Place a rock in your shoe to remind you to limp.,
Avoid telling people that your injury is fake.,
Read up on ankle sprains.,
Continue faking the injury.",How to Fake an Ankle Sprain3," You typically sprain an ankle when you roll it. This can happen while walking, running, jumping, falling, or playing a sport. Whenever story you make up, be sure to stick to it. Decide on the details of your story before telling it. Changing your story can lead to someone discovering that you are faking a sprained ankle.

, Since you are faking an injury, it may be difficult to remember that you are suppose to limp when you walk. You can place a rock, or something small but uncomfortable, in your shoe to help remind you that you should be walking with a limp.

, You should not trust anyone to keep your secret. Therefore, if you really want everyone to believe that your ankle is really sprained, you should refrain from telling anyone the truth., Before you fake a sprained ankle, you should do your research. Read about what a sprained ankle looks and feels like. Read about recovery times and treatments. The more you know about sprained ankles, the easier it will be to fake a sprained ankle.

, It takes most people between two and six weeks to recover from a sprained ankle if they follow their doctor’s medical advice. You should remember to continue the act for several weeks. It is also wise to gradually “recover” instead of instantly recovering.To “slowly recover”, gradually eliminate the wrap, brace, or crutches. Begin to put weight on your ankle again. Take one to two weeks to “fully recover.”

Progress slowly towards easier movement.,
Don't pull this stunt more than once.",How to Fake an Injury," A sprained ankle is fairly easy to fake and a very common injury. This injury is usually the result of a fall and takes 2-8 weeks to heal, depending on severity.


A good story for how you sprained your ankle would be that you tripped while walking down a steep hill, or fell from a street curb.
This injury can usually just be wrapped up in a fabric bandage, such as an Ace bandage. Crutches may be needed.
If forced to see a doctor, you want to portray mild to moderate pain and slight difficulty moving your foot. Too severe and tests may be ordered.;
, Shin splints are an injury to your shin (surprise!). There is very little evidence of shin splints, even on x-rays or scans, so this is a good option. Pain and some swelling are the usual symptoms and it takes a few weeks to heal.


If forced to see a doctor, tell the doctor that you are in pain and that your leg was a little swollen but it only seems to swell at night.
A good story for how you got shin splints would be that you tried to start running to lose weight/get in shape. This is a common cause of this injury.

, Your rotator cuff is a series of muscles in your shoulder, which can get strained from too much force, usually from overhead. This injury heals in 2-6 weeks, depending on severity.


A good story for how you sprained your rotator cuff would be that you fell while going down the stairs and strained the muscles when you caught yourself.
This should be presented as mild to your doctor, as more severe injuries require surgery or injected steroids.


, This is one of the harder to pass off injuries, as there are tests which can show that you're fine. Downplay it as mild to your doctor, to reduce the likelihood of further investigation.


Bed rest, maybe a back brace, and about a month healing time should get you through a ""mild"" injury.
A good story for how you hurt your back would be that you were lifting a heavy box and it just suddenly hurt very badly.

, The ACL is a ligament in your knee which is prone to injury from exercise and strain. This is one of the harder to pass off injuries, as there are tests which can show that you're fine. Downplay it as mild to your doctor, to reduce the likelihood of further investigation.


A good story for how you sprained your ACL would be that you jumped from a fairly high spot and landed badly.
This injury can usually just be wrapped up in a fabric bandage, such as an Ace bandage. Crutches may be needed as well.

, If you're going to fake an injury, you're going to need to find a reasonable cause for that injury. It should be a fairly common injury, and gotten from something that you would plausibly do. See the injuries listed in the second section for examples of plausible causes for each injury.

, You should know the details backwards, forwards, and upside down. Getting details mixed up when questioned is usually how people find out that you're lying. Do not add details every time you tell the story (though you should tell it in a slightly different way or a slightly different order, so that it doesn't sound rehearsed).

, You don't want to get too in-depth when you tell your story. This gives it a ring of being fake and pre-planned, like you don't think people are going to believe you. Tell the story naturally and as if you don't really want to talk about it.



BAD example: ""I was walking down the stairs to get a can of soup from my basement and then I saw a spider which totally freaked me out so I tripped. Thankfully, I caught myself in time to keep from hitting my head, but I hurt my shoulder instead. I went to the doctor and we had to wait in the room for ages but then..."", etc, etc.

GOOD example: ""I tripped down the stairs and when I caught myself I guess I sprained something in my shoulder.""

, Anything such as cuts, bruises, scars (all of that stage-makeup stuff), might look convincing at first, but you run the risk of it looking different from day to day or getting caught red-handed if it gets wet. If you're going to fake an injury, it should be like one of those above, which has few outside indicators.

, Just aside from the fact that any convincing staging of an injury will likely get you actually hurt, getting injured on school or work property opens them up for a lawsuit and they will more thoroughly investigate your injury. You want people to pay as little attention as possible.

, Overacting is a clear sign of faking. Do you think you're the first person to ever fake an injury to get out of something? They will be naturally a bit suspicious, so don't give them reasons to suspect you even more.


Don't overact with doctors. Doctors especially will be able to tell. Let them see that you are in pain but don't make it seem too serious. You want to avoid getting expensive tests, like x-rays or MRIs.
Don't overact with others. Your teachers, teammates, classmates, coworkers, bosses, etc. will usually be able to tell if you're really hamming it up. Downplay your injury and don't moan and groan all the time.

, You need to be focused on keeping up the act, even when you think you're alone. You never know when someone might walk in. Even if you're among people that know you're faking, don't invite opportunity to get caught.

, Having an injury for only one day, or only being in pain for one day is a clear sign that you faked it. Draw it out, even if you come back to school or work after only a day or two, over the course of at least a week. The length of time will depend on your fake injury.

, Make the ""getting better"" progression look normal. You should wince whenever you move in the beginning, but slowly progress towards being able to do more and more.

, The ""major injury"" excuse really only works once. If you do it twice then you're accident-prone, at best. Three times and people will definitely be able to put it together. Definitely don't get injuries close together. Separate them by at least a few months, if not years.

Play the guessing game.,
Plan in advance.,

When she ""wakes"" you up, tell her you still feel really sick.,
Don't be too eager.,
Slip in the, ""Maybe you're right, I just can't concentrate."",
Keep it simple!,
Give them credit!,
Be more believable and instead of feigning vomiting, just say you started feeling bad.,
Act sick until your mother or father picks you up.,
Go straight to bed when you get home.,
You could also make your eyes really red and say you think you have pink eye, or an eye infection.,
One sure way is to say you threw up in a bathroom.,
Before hand, you could say you feel really dizzy, and in class, take slow breaths.",How to Fake Sick to the School Nurse," Never tell her what you think you have ie. flu, cold, migraine, etc. Just tell her your symptoms (i.e. stomach ache, head ache, itchy throat, achy, nauseated, etc.).;
, If you have a test you are trying to avoid, go to the nurse hours before. They will always ask what you have right now and if anything important is going on.

, They won't be shocked when the nurse calls your house.


Just mention it casually. Ask if there are any cough drops at the house or where the box of Kleenex is.
Don't overdo it with the parents. If they don't let you stay home sick don't try it with the nurse or it could end badly too.
Keep the symptoms you told your parents similar to what you tell the nurse. You may want to escalate the severity a bit. For example: tell your parents you have a little sore throat or cough a bit, and ask for cough drops. Then tell the nurse you have a sore throat, headache, and feel gross or ache all over.

, NEVER ask the nurse, have her suggest it to you. This is a tragic mistake many people make. If you overextend yourself she'll send you right back to class. Instead, ALWAYS ask to ""lie down"", just to ""close your eyes"" or to see if your mother can bring you some Tylenol or Advil. This is more believable. She'll probably allow you to do that for a period. In elementary school, about 2 hours

, This makes the sickness more believable. Cover your face with the pillow or a rag.Try not to do something funny some nurses check to see if your asleep.Some people panic and try to fake snore, but, all you have to do is keep your eyes close, mouth open a little if your head is tilted let a little sniff or cough out to convince the nurse that you're not faking (but you are;-)).

, However, you can't ask to go home. You have to get her to make the very first move.

, She'll ask if you want to call your mom. You are almost there, however, if you jump up and accept she'll be a little wary.


Say something like ""I don't know, I don't want to miss school,"" or ""I think I should get the homework first.""

,

, You're more believable when you aren't trying to fake vomiting or other serious syndromes. Leave your fake vomit recipes for Halloween parties. Not everyone throws up when they're sick and it's too easy to spot a fake. Vomit has a bile smell so even if it looks like vomit it won't smell like it.

, School nurses have seen most of the tricks before so you're better off not bothering with tricks (vomit, fake fevers, etc.) and just saying you feel bad. They become suspicious when someone says ""vomiting"" because that's the first trick some people try when they want to go home. If the nurse takes your temperature, let her put it in your mouth, and once she leaves or looks away, take it out and wave it in the air. Especially if it is the chemical type (i.e. a small plastic tab that has dots on the end that change colors like green, blue, and red) Then put it back and say ""I feel sleepy"" because low body temperature makes you feel VERY drowsy...

, The fewer and more normal the symptoms the more likely they'll believe you.

, Close your eyes and clear your throat often (if complaining of sore throat) all the way home.

, Stay there until your parents leave to go back to work.

, The nurse won't let you stay if they think you are contagious. You can do this by putting a bit of blush around your eyes to redden them but avoid glittery ones at all costs.

, If the nurse asks you if anyone saw it say one of your friends did (name the friend don't say she/he's your friend!) and tell your friend in advance to play along if the nurse asks. EVERY public school sends a child home if they threw up.

, Try blinking your eyes a couple times, and when you do, keep them closed for longer than a regular blink. (A couple seconds will work.) If the teacher asks you if you feel okay, you could say you're really tired and that the lights hurt your eyes. Sometimes that happens. Be believable. Often if students feel sick or dizzy, they don't mention it to the teacher because they think it will go away.

Complain of a slight stomachache the night before.,
Refuse dinner.,
Go to bed early.,
Avoid mentioning the event you’re dreading.,
Act as though you're not worried about the event, if your parents know about it.,
Use baby powder to whiten your face.,
Tousle your hair.,
Rub some lotion on your face, and then cover it with a damp towel.,
Keep your face somber.,
Make sure your body language conveys discomfort.,
Describe your “symptoms” specifically.,
Show interest in going to school.,
Stay calm if your parents don't believe you.,
Head to the school nurse if your parents send you to school.,
Sneak your food.,
Pretend to vomit in the bathroom.,
Allow your parents to take you to the doctor.,
Stay in bed.",How to Fake a Stomach Ache to Get out of School," You need to begin laying the groundwork the evening prior to your sick day so that your parents aren’t caught completely off-guard the next morning. The illness illusion will be more convincing if you start discussing it at night, when there isn’t anything you’re trying to get out of or avoid.Don’t overdo it. If you’re dramatically wailing the night before, they’ll probably suspect something. Just make a couple of remarks about nausea or cramping, and clutch your stomach for good measure.;
, When your stomach is truly upset or unsettled, you probably don’t have much of an appetite. Make your impending sickness convincing by pretending you aren’t hungry. Of course, you will be spending the night hungry and uncomfortable if you don’t plan ahead. Sneak some food into your bedroom so you can eat it later, without your parents knowing.If your family sits down for dinner together every night, act like you are attempting to eat. Push your food around your plate, and then announce that you’re too nauseous to eat much.

, Tell your parents that you don’t feel well and you want to get into bed as soon as you can. Not only is this a convincing way to show your parents you feel sick, but they also won’t be able to attribute any of your symptoms the next day to a lack of sleep.


If you aren’t tired, go to bed anyway. You can grab a book, text your friends, or play on your cell phone secretly.

, For example, don’t complain to your parents about the huge exam or the physical fitness test in gym the next day. If they know that you’re not looking forward to school the next day, they’ll obviously guess your motive for being “sick.” Instead, act as if everything is normal.

, If they know you have a big test the next day, say things like, ""I was pretty nervous for it, but I think I'm going to do well."" If it's something other than a test, just tell them that you feel prepared, or at least no longer worried about it. If your parents don't think you're dreading it, they are less likely to suspect that you're trying to get out of it.


If you're planning on faking sick to get out of an exam or a big homework assignment, be careful. If you blow off studying or homework because you assume you'll get to stay home, you will be in big trouble if you wake up and aren't able to convince your parents you're sick. Study or complete the assignment just in case. If you end up faking sick effectively and getting the extra day to avoid the test or assignment, that's just a bonus!

, When you’re suffering from a stomach sickness, your face often drains of color. A light dusting of baby powder will make you look pale and ill. A little goes a long way! Lightly pat some of the powder onto your skin, just enough so that you look washed out.If you have access to large makeup brushes, tap a bit of power onto one and use that to apply it evenly to your entire face. If you don’t have a brush, you can use a tissue to rub it over your skin.
If you can avoid it, try not to get too close to your mom or dad once you’ve brushed baby powder on your face. There is an unmistakable scent to it, and you don’t want them to notice.

, Embrace your bedhead, and even exaggerate the tangles and frizz. When you’re sick, you often toss and turn throughout the night.Messy, frazzled hair will make your parents think you had a restless night of sleep, and help convince them that you’re sick.


The rougher you look, the sicker you look. Although ugly hair isn’t a direct effect of being ill, it’ll help create the overall image of sickness.

, The combination of the lotion plus the moisture from the towel will make your skin appear clammy.Clamminess is a symptom of a stomach bug, but take care not to overdo it.You don't want to look slimy! You simply want to give your skin that unpleasant moisture that comes with many sicknesses., When you’re truly sick, you probably don’t crack a smile at much. Make sure you keep your facial expression stoic, even if your sibling says something humorous or something funny happens on the television. Remember that you’re supposed to feel queasy and miserable, and you can’t let a smile or laugh give you away!

, Hold your stomach and hunch your back, as if you’re in pain. When you lay down, curl up into a ball. When you have to walk, do it slowly, as if you’re weak. It’s easy to tell someone you’re sick, but you need to make sure your body language tells them you’re sick too.


When you're truly sick, you probably find yourself nodding off to sleep whenever you've been sitting or laying down for very long. To really convince your parents how exhausted and ill you are, pretend to be asleep every time they pop their heads in to check on you.

, Instead of just saying you have a stomachache, elaborate about what specifically is wrong. Tell your parents if you feel nauseous or if it’s more like a cramp. Decide if your fake illness consists of a persistent dull pain, or if it comes and goes in fleeting spells. The more specific you get, the more realistic your illness will seem.Once you tell your parents what hurts, don’t change it! Be consistent whenever they ask what’s wrong.

, Say things like “I know I should stay home, but I really want to be at school because…” and give a specific reason. If your parents think you don’t ‘’want’’ to stay home, they’ll be less inclined to suspect you’re faking it.


You can even go the extra mile and start getting dressed for school, messy-haired and pale-faced.

, If you start getting worked up, your parents will probably suspect that you're desperate to stay home.Don't start yelling or throwing a temper tantrum. Instead, start slowly going through the motions of getting ready for school. The more pathetic and sickly you act as you do this, the better! Hopefully they will see you ""struggling"" and take pity on you.


If they don't offer to let you stay home, simply ask them if you can. Look them in the eye and tell them you really don't feel well, and you don't think you can make it through the school day. Pull on their heartstrings.

, Once you arrive at school, wait at least thirty minutes before heading to the nurse's office. By waiting a bit, your parents will know that you tried to go to school but you just couldn't make it. Make sure that you use the same techniques on your teacher and the nurse that you tried on your parents, like keeping your face sad while hunching over in discomfort.


As you speak to both your teacher and the nurse, hold your hand to your mouth as if you're afraid you're going to puke at any moment. No one wants to deal with a vomiting student, so they'll most likely send you home. Better safe than sorry!
Go to the bathroom repeatedly to imply that you're having diarrhea., No one wants to eat when they have a stomach bug, so don’t eat a big bowl of cereal or a bag of chips in front of your parents. If they encourage you to try eating, take a few bites and then refuse the rest. Tell them that you’re simply too nauseated and you have no appetite.If your parents go to work and leave you alone for the day, make sure to discard any wrappers, dishes, or other evidence of eating.
If your parents stay home with you, smuggle some snacks into your bedroom beforehand. You can munch on them sneakily throughout the day.

, If you’re confident in your acting skills, you can make vomiting noises in the bathroom while pouring a glass of water into the toilet. However, if you aren’t sure you can pull it off realistically, don’t risk it. Instead, spend an unusually long time in the bathroom, and complain of other gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea.


If you're faking diarrhoea, spraying some air freshener around the bathroom before you walk out will make your act more believable, as your parents will think you're trying to cover up the smell from the diarrhoea even though it isn't really there.

, Only do this if they suggest it, of course. If you insist that you don't need to see a doctor, your parents will suspect that your illness is fake. Instead, go to the doctor willingly and tell your doctor the exact same symptoms you told your parents.Don't say anything too severe that could alarm the doctor. Tell them general things like you feel nauseous when you sit up or walk around, that you have cramping, or that you're exhausted and have body aches. Everyone gets stomach bugs, and the doctor will most likely send you home with an order to rest.
Your doctor may have a hunch that you're faking it, but no one can prove that you don't feel sick. There is no test to determine if someone's stomach is upset or not!

, This step is only crucial if one of your parents is staying home with you. Just because they’ve allowed you to stay home, remember that you need to continue acting sick all day.Don’t head out to the driveway to shoot some hoops, or start animatedly playing a video game. Read a book, play on a laptop, watch television, or nap. Just stick to low-energy ""sick day"" activities!


Even if it’s past school hours and you’re officially missed the whole day, don’t magically start acting healthy. If your parents know you faked your illness, they won’t trust you in the future when you’re sick, whether it’s genuine or not.

Remember your parents are people too.",How to Cope With Annoying and Nagging Parents," As annoying as it may be, whatever it is that your parents are bothering you about isn't going to go away by simply ignoring it. Though you might be angry and irritable, it's important to hear what they are saying with a clear head. Don't respond until you know they've said everything they have to say. Listening won't just help you understand the problem; the respectful gesture will also bode well for your relationship with your parents.


Keep in mind how many times you've been nagged to do this one thing before. If it's something small and they've been bothering you about it for weeks, it's probably much easier to oblige them rather than hold off.;
, The broken record technique is a great way to show other people that repeating statements or nagging you won't get anywhere. Each time the same issue (""Can you go do the laundry?"", ""Have you done your homework yet?"") is brought up, respond with the same short, placating answer. Responding to a repetitive request with an equally repetitive answer will give your parents a taste of how annoying the constant nagging will be.


For example: If you're asked to take out the garbage multiple times, you can reply simply: ""I will take out the garbage soon."" Keep it short and vague.
Another example: If your parents are harassing you to get a job, you can respond by saying ""I can just as easily do that on my own time.""
Keep the wording similar or the same each time; that way, it'll be that much more obvious that you're getting fed up of the repetition.
It's important not to do this in an aggressive, or passive-aggressive way. You're not trying to start a fight here; you're just trying to cope with the nagging for the time being.

, If your parents begin to nag you for something new, chances are they won't give you a strict deadline to follow. Next time they bring a new task up for you to do, give them a time you'll do it by, so long as they agree to stop nagging you about it. To make the agreement more interesting, suggest they do the task themselves, should they end up nagging you again. Placing a defined time limit on when you'll finish the task not only gives you extra liberty to tackle the chore as you see fit; it will also relieve the parent's pressure to keep asking you.

, Rather, sitting down and bringing up a problem in controlled circumstances often has a mutually beneficial impact on a relationship. Being upfront and bringing up your grievances in a controlled, passive setting will put a spotlight on the way your parents have been acting towards you, and hopefully get them to realize that there are far better ways to communicate as a family.


For example, you can say: ""I understand and appreciate what you're saying, but repeating it constantly isn't going to make life better for either of us.""
While this might sound aggressive, you can certainly word it in such a way that it does not antagonize them.

, The most important thing you can do to make sure annoying situations like nagging don't occur is to simply stay in good touch with your parents. Most of the time, nagging happens because of a lack of initial communication. Making sure both sides are voicing their feelings equally will limit the amount of nagging in the future.


Especially if most of your relationship with your parents is defined by a lack of communication and tendency to argue, openly communicating can be a very difficult thing to accomplish. Be patient if it doesn't come naturally at first; say what you feel, ask what they're looking for, and let them know they have your ear if something ever bothers them. From there, the pieces will fall into place given time.

, While parents haven't likely considered how unhealthy constant pestering is for you, it's even less likely they've considered their own health. If nagging is a severe problem in your household, getting together as a team and looking for alternatives to nagging will almost certainly be a relief for both parties.

, Once you're speaking candidly about how you're feeling, it may be helpful to get together and list down some clear boundaries. While writing down rules to limit nagging and other annoying behaviour might seem overly official, having the rules on paper will give either side something concrete to bring up if a rule is broken.

, This is about as simple as it gets: if you tell them what they want to know before they ask, they won't have a reason to ask in the first place! If your parents are constantly annoying you looking for information, you can avoid the most stressful part of the formula by letting them know ahead of time.The strongest example of this would be if you're going out at night. While most parents will want the know where, and with whom you're going, writing the basic details down on a piece of paper and giving it to them will likely set their hearts at rest.
To some extent, this advice could also apply to your parents bothering you about chores. Instead of waiting for them to nag you, doing the scheduled task ahead of time will put you at an advantage; you won't be doing any more work than you'd usually be doing, but you'll have proven that you're responsible and proactive, and that nagging you serves no productive purpose.

, Even if you and your parents come up with some rule against nagging, it's likely they'll end up forgetting once in a while-- after all, your parents are human too! If they ever nag you again after a rule is in place, calmly let them know what they're doing isn't good for either of you.

, You'll need to consider all of the circumstances that might be weighing on your parent and your relationship with them. Have they been extra busy at work lately, and need a hand helping around the house more than usual? Is the thing they're nagging you about a regular thing, or is it the first time it's ever come up? Keeping things like this in mind will make your interactions a lot smoother, especially if you tend to fight and argue a lot together.


If they're asking you to do a new chore, it's possible they're busier than usual and need help, or maybe they want to entrust more responsibilities to you now that you're older.
If they're nagging you to tell them where you're going for the evening, it's very likely that they're concerned for your safety and want to know enough about the situation that they won't be left worrying while you're out.

, Arguments in all kinds of relationships occur because both sides are too caught up with their own wants to stop to consider the other party. Listen to what they're saying to you. Consider why they might be asking something of you. Ask them questions if you're confused about any part of it. If you can understand where someone else is coming from, you'll have a much easier time complying to what they want.


Stay calm throughout your interactions with your parents. This is especially true if your parents are upset. If both parties are angry, each side's anger can play off the other, creating a much bigger mess. , Your parents ultimately need to feel some sort of control over you as a way to feel secure about their own lives. Nagging may be seen as one or both parents trying to exercise their power. By simply letting them know that you respect them, you can give them that confidence, even if it doesn't necessarily tie over into the real world.


Reverse psychology works well in creating the illusion of power. Getting your parents to think they want you to do something you wanted to do yourself all along is a good way to ease their nagging while still getting your own way!

, If you say you're going to take out the garbage or clean the laundry, make sure you do it. This can be easy to overlook, especially if a concrete deadline wasn't set. However, by not doing something after you said you would, you're weakening your own position, virtually proving to your parents that they haven't nagged you enough.


Giving a timeline helps both them and you; they'll know you haven't forgotten it (unless the time passes) and you'll feel that much more motivated to finish it in time.

, They're human. They make just as many mistakes as you do, and from time to time, they'll do and say things they'll wish they could take back later on. Making sure to remember that not everything a parents says is absolute is an important step towards forgiving them if they were out of line in dealing with you.


If your parents are approaching you in a particularly aggressive or annoying way, it's best to placate them instead of directly confronting them about their behaviour at the time. Rather, it's better to wait until they've calmed down to bring up the issue. If your parent has had some time to think about it already, it's quite possible they'll already feel remorse for their actions and apologize to you outright.
It's important to keep in mind that parents don't like having these arguments any more than you do. Solving these disagreements and preventing them in the future serves to benefit them as much as it does you.

Remember that it’s not always about you.,
Learn how to please (and love) yourself.",How to Convince Your Parents to Lighten Up," Nothing will make your parents lose trust in you faster than if you lie to them. This is especially the case when it comes to important matters like school. If you get a bad grade on a test, don’t hide it from them. If you do something you’re not supposed to do, own up to it.


Remember that negative situations often matter more than positive ones. Stepping out of line once can undo the effect of having obeyed the rules multiple times before that.;
, Doing chores regularly and before being asked will help your parents trust you more than if they have to remind you. You will probably get bonus points for doing extra tasks that they don’t ask you to do. That's especially the case if you do a chore your parents don't like to do.

, Young people often act without thinking first. That's because the area of the brain that governs good judgment is not fully developed until your mid-20s.If you want your parents to trust you, think before you act. Don’t do anything simply because other people are doing it, especially if it’s something potentially dangerous. Ask yourself “Would my parents be angry with me if they found out I did this?” If the answer is “yes,” pick something else to do.


Remember that if your friends try to pressure you into doing something that you don't want to do, they don't have your best interests at heart. You may want to consider finding new friends if that's the case.

, If you consistently act irritable, your parents will probably respond in kind.This doesn’t mean you can’t say what’s on your mind. Just remember to be mature and thoughtful when you do so. Take a few deep breaths if necessary and don't raise your voice.


It’s particularly important to express anger constructively. Whining or screaming if you don’t get your way will probably lead your parents to ignore or punish you. Do your best to remain calm. Part of growing up means understanding that you can’t always get what you want.

, Your parents will probably be more experienced at arguing than you are. If you want something that you don’t think they’ll want to give, lay out a well-reasoned case for why they should give it to you. Prepare that argument ahead of time so you can lay it out calmly and effectively.


For instance, “I want this because it will benefit both of us” is much more mature and level-headed than simply saying “I want this” without thinking of a reason that might benefit your parents as well.

, Never enter any discussion with your parents with the urge to dominate them. They may respond by punishing you. Remember that as long as you’re living with them and you’re under 18, they have more power than you. By cooperating with them, you are more likely to get what you want. Also remember that being able to control your temper is a sign of maturity and empathy, which your parents will appreciate.For instance, if your parents' schedule is so busy that they are unable to spend time with you when you want, work around their commitments. Pick a time that works for them. Don’t insist that they change their calendars to benefit you.

, Don’t make your parents repeat themselves. Learn from your mistakes. Listen carefully to what your parents tell you if you want to earn their trust.


If your parents tell you to do things that contradict each other (running two errands at the same time, for instance) explain to them why you won’t be able to do that. Again, act calmly and responsibly.

, Developing a close relationship with your parents will help them see that you’re not a little kid anymore. The more they know about what’s going on in your life, the more they will be willing to trust you.Ask your parents for advice. If you show them that you trust them enough to get advice on situations that matter to you, they will trust you more in return.

, Try to have quality time with your parents multiple times per week. This can be anything from simply talking with them, to playing board games, or going on hikes. The more time your parents spend with you on a day-to-day basis, the more they will understand how grown up you are.


Don’t skip family meals, if possible. Having dinner as often as possible with your parents has beneficial effects for both children and adults., Being a parent is tough. They appreciate it when they know that you know how hard they’re trying. Even something simple like cooking dinner or giving them a few extra hugs per week can go a long way towards convincing them to relax more around you., While you and your parents should strive for a friendly relationship, remember that they’re supposed to be more than just friends. They are your mentors and your protectors as well. So don’t get stressed out if your parents don’t always seem like your best buddies. That’s what you have friends your own age for!

, Discipline is necessary to raise healthy kids. But some parents exercise an unhealthy degree of control over their families. Such control can lead to serious health problems for kids later in life.It’s possible for your parents to be strict without being over controlling. If your parents tell you they love you regularly and provide constant encouragement, for instance, your family is probably healthy even if your parents are strict.
If your parents micromanage every aspect of your life, no matter how small, hold you to an impossible standard, and act as though you have to earn their love and support, they may be over controlling., Your parents are human. They have their own lives and their own flaws. Sometimes their actions toward you can be influenced by crises they don’t want to talk about or other matters that are bothering them.


If you believe that one or both of your parents may be suffering from mental illness, do your best to find them help. Mental illness in parents can lead to health risks for everyone around them, including children., If you can’t reach your parents no matter how hard you try, focus on pleasing yourself. Don’t be too hard on yourself, don’t criticize yourself, and never tell yourself that you’re no good. Always remember that you have worth.

Try to understand your parents' feelings.,
Write down your responses to their reasoning.,
Discuss your plans for the future with your partner.,
Prepare what you will say when you talk to your parents.,
Start the conversation at the right time.,
Ask if you can introduce your partner to your parents.,
Don't be too offended if your parents warm up to your partner slowly (or not at all).",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Date Someone Poor," It will help you convince your parents if you know why they don't want you to date this person. Consider the following:


Are they worried about your finances? Your parents may worry about your financial future - will you be able to afford things like health insurance, a place to live, or even food throughout the month?






Do they think that this person is using you for your money? It is not unheard of for this happen, so it is understandable for parents to have concerns about this. This does not mean that they are right, or it is okay for them to assume this is why someone would want to date you.




Are they worried that this will affect what you want to do with your future? Do they think that you'll give up your dreams? Do they think that this person does not have any dreams or goals?






Is it just that they're wealthy themselves and stuck up about it? This is not okay, and is unfair.;
, Evaluate each concern they might have, and address and why they should see it a different way. Try to think of everything they could say against the person you want to date, and come up with respectful ways to prove otherwise.


It might be helpful to write these things down. Keep the list handy when you approach your parents, so you can make sure that you don't forget anything.

, Meet up with the person you're dating, and talk about money-related issues in the future. For instance, talk about ways that each of you can earn money, career goals, whether you're applying for college, how you plan to manage finances, whether you'll need to take out any major loans, and so on.


Again, you might want to write these plans down. Doing so shows that the both of you are considering your future very seriously. You will want to write about:






Consider any and all problems that may arise in your future, and write about how you will handle them. Coming up with hypothetical situations and how to combat them will show your parents that you are prepared to handle life with this person, should the relationship develop into a serious and committed one.







, Combine everything you've thought about in the previous steps into a small speech that outlines your response to your parents' concerns. Try to be respectful, mature, and optimistic. Also refrain from sounding angry, as your parents will just shut you out as soon as they detect that you are getting upset.

, Catch your parents in a good, relaxed mood and ask if you can talk about something serious. Sitting down and talking to them is the best way to get your feelings out, as it will allow for discussion and a better understanding when they can see exactly how you feel.


Say what you have prepared and then allow for discussion. Discussion is one of the most important parts about this. If you have left anything unanswered, now is the time where they will be able to share their views and you both can come to a better understanding about how each other feels.
Consider writing a letter if your parents refuse to listen and/or discuss the issue. By writing a letter, they cannot interrupt you while speaking, because it's all written down already. The only thing they can do is stop reading, or refuse to read it altogether, but parents generally get around to reading what you have written.







, If the discussion about their concerns goes well, the next step is inviting your parents to meet the person you're dating. The hope is that meeting your partner in person will help relieve any lingering concerns your parents might have about the relationship.


Point out your partner's good qualities before the meeting. Before your boyfriend/girlfriend meets the parents, take the chance to brag up him or her. Talk about the qualities you admire, such as how kind he is, or how she's an incredibly hard worker. Telling your parents what you see in this person can help them view him or her in a more positive light when they do meet.






Do something fun with him/her and your family together. By having fun, it will lighten the atmosphere and allow everyone to open up. In the end, your parents may find that they like who you are dating, and you may finally get the approval you seek.
Put a time limit on the interaction. The event should have a definite end point, whether it's as soon as dinner is finished or after you've played a round of a game. Whatever it is, make sure all parties are clear on when the meeting is over.

, Old habits die hard, and it may be that your parents will never truly like the person you're dating. Don't worry too much, though - relationships change over time, and your parents might surprise you someday. In the meantime, focus on acting mature and reasonable.

"
Consider the timing.For many children of traditional parents, marrying is only an option the parents will consider once the child's college or career education is complete, and a steady (and respectable) job has been held by the child for at least 1-2 years.,
Don't criticize them.Belittling them, comparing your behavior to theirs, and otherwise insulting them will not change their mind and is not your role as a respectful and loving child.

,
Allow them to tell you what they think and give you advice.,
Be open.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Marry Girl of Your Choice1," Approaching them with the idea of marriage before you graduate can understandably feel like you're endangering their hard work. Waiting, in that case, is best.;
,, First, ask your parents how they feel, what they like, what they don't like in the current situation, and what they expect you to do. Be silent until they finish explaining what they think about the situation. “I'd like to hear what you think about all this.”


Once they finish explaining, they will definitely ask some questions to you (and the girl, if she is present in the room) in terms of how to approach this whole thing, finances, your future, and other general topics—all of which you should try to answer.
The temptation to avoid answering their questions might be strong, especially if you find you have not thought through an issue they raise or if you do not yet have an answer you like. You can always return to the conversation, but try to answer fully and be honest about where you struggle with their questions.
If their explanation presents another situation that gives a feasible solution for everyone, then take it up.

, Don't keep your feelings or relationship a secret.Hiding a serious relationship from your family can be quite painful for them and suggest to them that you do not trust or respect them. Wouldn't you feel the same if they had hidden some tremendously important relationship from you? Unless you have a strong reason for not telling them (for example, you have not yet graduated from the college they are paying for), you should be honest with your parents sooner, rather than later.

Go small!",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Do Anything," Make sure you have a good understanding of what you'll be asking your parents about so that you will have answers for their questions. If it helps you, try writing a few bullet points to help you to remember. Explaining these things that you have found about your topic will help your case. Also, if you are willing and able, consider paying for a portion of the price of something you desire.


If you want them to let you have a dog, research how much maintenance the dog will require and how much it will cost to have one. Aside from the actual logistics of it, also research the good points of having a dog, and why it would be great for you and your family.
Ignoring the ""cons"" of the thing you want will not help your case, because most likely your parents will bring up these points to you, and without having the time to think about the ""cons"" will not look good as you are trying to convince your parents. To prevent this, look up some ""cons"" of what you are asking for, so you can have some time to think about the ""cons"".;
, Your parents will consider what you want more if they have some background information on what it is you're asking for. The more familiar they are with it, the less ""scary"" or ""risky"" it is, and the more likely they are to say yes. Also, try citing your sources that you use to find information about what you want so your parents can go on the website to do more investigation themselves.


For example, if you want to spend the night at someone else's house, make sure your parents have access to your friend's house number, know your friend's parents' names, and know where the house is.
If you want a body piercing or tattoo, have the number of the establishment or some reliable websites about the practice itself. It also helps if they know the person you want to sleepover with or if they have seen the tattoo shop before.

, It's easy to get caught in a shouting match and lose track of the points you wanted to make in the first place. Write down the three or four main things you want to say in convincing your parents. Go back to them during the discussion, emphasize them, and make sure those points have been discussed fully before you move onto less convincing arguments, like, ""But I want it!""


If you're trying to get a pet, you could easily come up with a handful of points in your favor. It promotes family bonding time, pet owners generally lead longer lives, playing with the pet is a good method of exercise, and it teaches you responsibility. What's not to like?

, In order to see if you deserve the thing you're asking for, or sometimes to make the argument go away, parents ask their children if they've taken care of their chores and duties beforehand. Prepare ahead of time for these questions by cleaning your room, bathroom, living room, etc., doing your homework, eating your vegetables – whatever it is your parents are constantly asking you about. Not only does it make these questions ineffective, but it proves the point that you actually are responsible.


It's a good idea to do these for several days or even a week in advance. If they ask if your room is clean and you say yes, they could easily respond with, ""Well, this is the first time it's been clean in a long time."" You may have to put in some long-term work for it to be convincing.

, Find a time when your parents seem relaxed and happy to have the discussion. It is not a good idea to ask for something when either parent seems stressed or tired, because they might get annoyed easy. Usually, family dinner time is a safe bet.


That being said, if mom or dad seemed stress, that could work in your favor if you're asking for a pet. You could point out that people who are attached to a dog or other pet have significantly lower stress levels, blood pressure, and a decreased risk of depression.If you haven't completed something they've asked of you, such as chores or homework, this is not the right time to ask either. It's another easy (and valid) reason for objection, so get those chores done first.

, If you whine or get angry, your parents will likely think you are not mature enough to handle whatever it is you are asking them for. They'll shut down the conversation immediately, insisting that you all talk about it when you're feeling calmer. That or they'll argue that your tone proves that you're not ready. Both are situations you want to avoid!


Even if you end up not getting your way, behaving maturely throughout will set the tone for future discussions that may go your way. It may leave them thinking, ""Huh, maybe our child really is growing up and becoming mature."" You want to leave them wondering if they should've said yes, so when you bring the topic up later, they're warmer to it.

, Many times parents say it's because it's somehow an inconvenience for them. Either it costs them money or time or both. Because you are likely asking for them to do something for you, emphasize that it could also benefit them. Both of you get something out of the situation, so why not?


If you're asking for a phone, make it clear that they can use your new number to check up on you. You could even be willing to talk about what happens if you don't answer – maybe you'd get your phone privileges revoked?
If you're asking for an extended curfew, emphasize that that means more free time for them. And you could also only get an extended curfew when you can get a ride home from someone else so they don't have to come pick you up.

, Don't force them to give you an answer right away. Tell them to get back to you in a couple hours or days with any questions or concerns they have. Let them know that you want to discuss this as mature, responsible adults and you are willing to work through any potential issues. Say it like that, and you'll be sure to impress them with how well-rounded and balanced your argument is.


It's best to arrange a specific time to talk about it. That way they'll be less likely to respond with ""Oh, we haven't discussed it yet,"" and you won't have the awkward duty of picking a time to bring it up in the future. Instead, saying next week at dinner makes it more concrete and likely to happen.

, Work out an agreement that makes both you and your parents happy. Offer to pay for part of the phone bill or do extra chores around the house in exchange. Make sure they are getting something out of this as well. After all, it's likely they're going to end up taking care of part of it, regardless of what it is.


If you want a dog, for example, work out a compromise of who is going to take it for walks, feed it, let it out, etc., in addition to who's going to pay for it and the veterinary fees. The responsibility doesn't end with a pet (or a phone) after it's bought, and that's likely what they're worrying about.
Come up with stipulations for if you don't hold up your end of the deal, too – if you forget to let Fluffy out a few times, it's goodbye to your late Friday nights or a reduction in your allowance. This shows that you really mean business and are willing to make sacrifices yourself.

, One thing that helps is learning how to write an essay for what you want. These are called persuasive essays. The structure looks like this:


Topic Sentence. Transition sentence. Main Point (or thesis statement).
Topic Sentence one. Specific evidence: evidence proving why you want this. Explanation of your evidence: what does your example show your parents? Transition Sentence.
Topic sentence two. Specific evidence two. Explanation of evidence. Transition sentence.
This topic sentence shows an alternate perspective on the subject. The specific evidence proves your topic sentence wrong. Explanation of specific evidence. Transition sentence.
Topic Sentence four can explain another perspective or you can leave out paragraph four. Specific evidence four. Explanation of evidence. Transition sentence.
Opening conclusion statement. Closing point about your thesis. Closing sentence that restated and reaffirms thesis.
If you write this correctly, it can really help your cause.

, You can always just ask for reasons of why they aren't letting you do the thing you desire. Sometimes they will give you a valid point and sometimes it won't make sense. As long as you do it in a mature fashion, most parents will be happy to give you reasons. Ask them their concerns and try to address them. This may change their minds if you have a convincing rebuttal.


If you can find out why they said no, you can find a way to remove that factor or say it in a way that they will agree to. For example, if you cannot have a phone because they do not think you are old enough, then show them how mature you can be. Pinpointing the reason makes it a lot easier to get to the crux of the issue.

, Parents will inevitably take your history of behavior into consideration. Start getting good grades (if you aren't already), do chores around the house without them asking you, and stay out of trouble. Make sure they know that you're responsible enough to get or do that specific thing you're asking about.


As mentioned previously, sometimes you may have to put in the time. A couple of days of being on good behavior might not be convincing, but a few weeks? That could do the trick. If you remain patient and diligent, they may see that you're ready for this new responsibility.

, Don't make it obvious that you're upset. Be kind to them and act as you normally would. They may act like they don't care, but they are smiling inside and it will help you in the long run.


It can also start making them feel a little guilty, which may not be a bad thing in this situation. The kinder you are, the more they'll feel bad they said no, which could lead to a change of heart.

, Sometimes, parents respond better to having an argument written out. Write a convincing and persuading letter that explains to your parents why you deserve what you're trying to get. This looks professional and your parents will be impressed at the mature way you're handling the situation.


Make sure it's handwritten and presented nicely. They'll see how much work you put into it and how much it means to you. It's a good start point for showing how much work you're willing to put in later, too. If you put this much work into a letter, maybe you will take care of Fluffy, pick up her poo, and take her for walks when she needs them.

, If one method of persuasion isn't working, try switching arguments. Don't use the same material over and over again. Showing them that you have lots of great reasons about why you should have what you're trying to get.


For example, let's say you're asking for a phone and you started with the logical argument that it's safe – if you ever got in trouble, you could call them. It didn't work, so now you need to switch it up. You could talk about how you need a phone to make friends at school, to get a job or volunteer position, or even that there's a special deal going on right now where you can get one really cheaply. What do you think would work for them?

, Sometimes you have to simply let a decision be for the moment. Simply say, ""Okay, thanks for discussing it with me"" and walk away. You can try again at another time. Keep showing that you are responsible and your parents might change their minds. After all, you get older and more mature every day.


You should broach the topic at a later date, but don't be too rushed with it. If your parents say that you'll talk about it after Christmas, for example, wait until a week or so after Christmas. Respect their wishes and they'll be more likely to respect (and grant) yours.

, If you want a dog and they say, no way, that thing is way too big and expensive, keep your cool. If they won't let you have a German Shepherd, ask for a goldfish, or a hamster, something small and easy to take care of. Who knows? You may even be happier with your fishy friend anyway.

Stay calm and confident.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Marry Girl of Your Choice2," First, ask them to talk about their cultural or financial fears, and allow them to explain what it is about your news that makes them fearful. Then, let them know why you are not afraid by being clear about your motives and plans.


You could say, for example, “Do you feel that because she is from a different culture that any children we might eventually have would not understand or appreciate our culture?”

, Avoid giving ultimatums like “It's my way or nothing,” or “If you really loved me, you'd support me.” You probably would not change after a single conversation, so don't expect your parents to do that, either. Taking a side will only confirm their worst fear: that you are rejecting them, their love, their values, and your place in the family as their child.

, Instead of taking a side, focus on the love you have for your parents. Don't be defensive.If you act defensive, it will suggest to them that something is wrong with her or something is not right in your relationship. Instead, clarify your own opinions and use “I” statements.


Saying things like, “She thinks you don't like her,” will only make your parents dislike her more. Own your own opinions rather than using your girl as the scapegoat. A better comment would be something like, “I think you would really like her just as much as I do, once you get to know her.”

"
"
Never complain to your family about her.,
Don't use the girl to make a political point or to “change” them.,
Focus on common ground.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Marry Girl of Your Choice3," Unless breaking up is what you want to do, if you ever complain to your family about her personality quirks or actions, they will by nature feel defensive for you and will dislike her. When you bring her up again later in a better mood, they will not have forgotten the injury or emotional wound you had told them about. Until they have established their own solid relationship with her, keep your comments about her positive.

, Parents who have children in inter-cultural relationships (dating outside the culture, tribe, religion, race, economic class, etc.) will already be sensitive to whatever fears they might have about her and the ways she is “ruining” you. Don't feed that bias by bringing her up as an example in your arguments with them.

, Point out common interests or cultural connection—allow them to begin to imagine her as their daughter-in-law by focusing on topics that you know your parents care deeply about and yet also share with your girlfriend.


For example, you could connect her to a hobby one of your parents have: “Did you know, Dad, that she's also into aircraft? She actually studied and got a private license a few years ago.”

"
"
Explain why she is perfect for you.,
Use “lobbyists.” Have sympathetic family members feed them positive information about her.One effective strategy is to tell the most supportive parent first, away from the other parent.,
Plan a family date.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Marry Girl of Your Choice4," Tell them why YOU like her, why you LOVE her, and what, in your view, makes her the person you want to spend the rest of your life with.


“Mother, you know that studying and doing well in school has always been important to me. Well, it's important to her, too—she's currently in medical school, and studying with her this past year was what helped me pass my exams. She's smarter than any previous girlfriend I've had.”
If this girl is a total stranger to them, then you obviously have to do more preparation before having this conversation. Learn what you can about her background, so you can share that with your parents, and anticipate the kinds of questions they will have about her.

, That way, when you break the news more openly to the family, you will already have a potential ally on your side.

, Arrange for your parents to participate with you and your girlfriend in a safe activity. Once you and your girlfriend have met each others' parents, or if the vibe seems open to it, ask both sets of parents to meet with you and your girlfriend. Fix a day on the calendar (perhaps over a comfortably informal dinner) and have a good first discussion.Arrange for your girl to have some alone time with your parents (individually, or, with both simultaneously), for them to get to know her better.
If you are meeting her parents, try being a little less-talkative than you are at your place—let her advocate to her parents just as you did to yours. You should always ensure that the parents (both sides) don't feel less-respected, misrepresented, or anything bad about the situation.
If she is in the room, let the girl talk in the middle of your discussion, which will help your parents understand a little bit about her, and the way she thinks, and the way she perceives and explains things to your parents.

Have a strong argument for keeping your pet.,
Consider what compromises you will make to keep your pet.,
Recall emotional times with your pet.",How to Convince Your Parents Not to Sell Your Pet1," If you want your parents to listen to you, you will have to show that you put thought into what you are saying. You should be able to cite specific reasons as to why keeping the pet is a good idea (e.g. teaching you responsibility). It will also help if you can find sources online or in print that back up your claims. Even if you think the reasons are common sense, show them that you really cared enough to do some research about it.Avoid exaggerated truths like “Caring for the dog will teach me to care for my kids one day.” Support for such a statement is going to be weak at best. Instead, focus on something like the fact that it will help you be more mindful of your responsibilities, like feeding your pet.
Understand why your parents want to sell your pet. Maybe they don't want to take care of it anymore or can't afford to feed it. Ask your parents questions about why they want to sell your pet, and then come up with counterarguments to their reasons. If they say that they can't afford your dog's food anymore, offer to get a part-time job to help pay for it. If they say that they can't take care of him anymore, offer to take up more specific responsibilities (like feeding and walking) when caring for him.;
, Avoid vague statements such as “I’ll take care if it.” Think about the ways that you can and will actually do this. Have a list of specific responsibilities you are ready to take on, when and how you will complete them all, and what other activities you’ll be giving up to make sure that they happen.Consider alternate living arrangements for your pet. If a dog is taking up too much space in your house, perhaps think about building him a doghouse and letting him live outside. If your best friend has a few cats already, maybe she wouldn't mind taking your cat to live with her. Think about what living arrangements would work for both you and your parents.
If you are not willing to give up after school activities, or make arrangements to help care for your pet, you may need to rethink your priorities.

, Try not to cry and sob to your parents uncontrollably. Instead, combine your reasons for keeping the pet with the compromises you are willing to make, and then remind your parents of good times with the pet. It is okay to cry a little, but keep yourself calm and collected so that you can make your point clearly."

Be open to compromise.",How to Convince Your Overprotective Parents to Let You Date an Older Guy," You need to show your parents that you are able to make your own informed decisions. If you feel that you deserve the space and freedom that comes with dating an older guy, then you need to understand that it may come with having to do things you don’t necessarily want to do. Try not to complain to your parents, this childish behavior will only hinder your chances. Don't walk around thinking the world revolves around you. An attitude of thinking you deserve everything you want only comes across as obnoxiously selfish.
People will not go out of their way to give you what you want, so don't waste your parents time by complaining to them about every little thing that has not gone your way.;
, Staying true to your word will leave a lasting impression on your parents’ good side. Follow through with any commitments you have made with them, and it will prove that you are capable of keeping an intelligent outlook throughout a relationship with an older guy.


Get good grades, complete your chores on time, help with babysitting, etc.
Remember what your parents usually ask of you and complete it before they have to remind you. This responsible behavior will show your parents that you hold their opinions in high regard.

, Respect your parents’ wishes and follow their rules. They usually have rules for your own well-being. Don’t miss curfew and remember to let your parents know how grateful you are whenever they let you do something you want. The next time your parents let you stay out late with friends, show your gratitude by saying thank you and making sure they know that just because they let you stay out one night, it doesn't mean you expect them to give you a later curfew.
Do not rise your voice to your parents or treat them with with an aggressive attitude.

, Set up a time when you can hang out with your group of regular friends, and include your potential boyfriend. Group hang outs with your potential boyfriend will give your parents a chance to see you two interact without a label of “boyfriend/girlfriend” over your heads. When you are ready to speak to your parents about possibly dating this guy, they will know who he is instead of him just being a stranger. Have a movie night at your house or invite everyone to your sibling’s soccer game; two places your parents will most likely be present.
If your potential boyfriend is not already friends with your group, have an initial hangout session where he gets to meet your friends. Then take the next step and include him with your friends around your parents.

, Open up to your parents about what you feel for this guy during your initial conversation with them. Describe his best qualities and make sure to include any thoughtful things he has done for you. Let your parents know why you feel this relationship should move from platonic to romantic. Make sure to emphasize how this relationship will have a positive effect on your life and how you see yourself.
DO NOT say that you ""can't live"" without him. Having such an extreme reaction will just show your parents that you are still immature.

, Trust should not just be between you and your parents. Communicate with your potential boyfriend about your overprotective parents and how this possibly could be problematic. He should respect your parents’ opinion and work towards changing their minds, instead of suggesting you lie or go behind their back.


The less your potential boyfriend negatively interferes in your relationship with your parents, the more likely your parents will be convinced to let you have a relationship with him.
If your parents find out that you were dating this guy in secret before getting their permission, they may demand an end to the relationship.

, Choose whether to speak with your dad or your mom. You can speak with them separately or at the same time. Think about who you don’t want involved in your conversation, like siblings. Having your siblings around may make you feel too vulnerable to honestly open up to your parents. You may be afraid they will try to get their two cents into the conversation.
If you are closer to one parent more than the other, focus on having this conversation with them. They will either inform your other parent on their own, or their opinion could be the only one that matters to you.

, Remember that your parents are probably thinking about a thousand things at once and if either of them work, they won't have that much time on their hands. Based off what you know about their schedule, pick a timeframe that you know they will be able to give you their undivided attention.


Wait a few hours after they get home from work so they can calm down and de-stress from their day.
Talk with your parents on the weekend during breakfast. They are more likely to be relaxed during this time and may be more willing to discuss, rather than dictate.
Don't bring up the conversation too casually when they are in the middle of doing something, like getting ready for work or taking care of your sibling.

, Where you talk should be dependent on where you feel comfortable and where you know your parents will be the most level headed. If your house is usually loud and busy, maybe go for a walk with your parents to talk about this sensitive topic. Or bring it up the next time you are in a long car ride with either of them. The calmer the environment, the better you will feel about being vulnerable with your parents.
If you decide to go for a walk, pick a route you know does not have that many people. If there are strangers around, you may feel anxious they are overhearing your conversation.

, Speak as clearly as you can about how you want to date a guy older than you. Speaking to the point will show that you are confident enough to understand how you feel, which in turn will show your parents that you are mature enough for this relationship. Write down how you plan to start your conversation.

“Mom, I’d like to talk to you about boys and dating.”


Don't beat around the bush.

""I have a friend who wants to start dating an older guy.""



, The more honest you are with your parents, the more likely they will trust you down the line. Especially when talking about you dating an older guy, don’t hide the truth of your situation or over exaggerate for drama’s sake. Lying will only hurt your chances. , Your parents are overprotective for a reason. If they are telling you why they don’t want you to date an older guy, try your best to see where they are coming from. When you start understanding their side of the argument, make sure to let them know. They will put more weight on your views and feelings if they see you are attempting to understand their own. You want your parents to take you seriously. Do not use an aggressive or whiney tone to convince them.
Talk with them in a friendly manner, making sure to actively listen when they speak. Your attitude will dictate theirs.

, Overprotective parents may not give you what you want the first time around, but this doesn’t mean you have to give up. Make sure everyone involved is allowed to express their needs, concerns, and issues dealing with you dating an older guy. You may have to deal with a few restrictions on your new relationship at the start. Your parents may consent to you dating an older guy only if the dates are supervised. Don't fight, instead do what they say and eventually they may loosen their grip.
You may not be allowed to go on dates during the school week. Accept it for now and maybe they will increase your privileges with time.

Tell your friends not to call your landline phone.,
Show consideration for your roommate, if you have one.",How to Avoid Talking to Your Parents1," Don't be rude or disrespectful. Give short, noncommittal answers to any questions they ask. If they ask if you want dinner or if you'll go somewhere with them, say no politely.Break or bend this rule if they're asking questions that might lead to reconciliation. Listen before you respond.;
, Turn the latch or slip the hook into the eye. Put a note on your door explaining that you've locked the door for some space and privacy. If you just lock your door without warning, your parents could get worried and break the door down.If you don't have a lock on your door, put a sign on the door asking people to keep out or at least knock first.

, This includes your books, phone, and video game console. Find a cool, dry place to stash a few non-perishable snacks and drinks. Keep your phone on vibrate or silent to avoid attracting your parents' attention., If your parents answer the phone, you'll have to face them when you answer it. Have your friends call your cell phone, if you have one. If not, stick to email, instant messaging, and chat rooms.

, If you share a room with a sibling, respect their space. Don't hog the room for yourself. If they ask about the situation with your parents, keep your story neutral. Don't try to make your sibling take sides."

Consider an exchange.,
Invite them to take a break and hang out with you.,
Don't whine.,

Don't give up.",How to Ask Your Parents if You Can Play a Game," Do your homework. Finish any chores. Cover all the things your parents expect you to do beforehand. If you have a messy room and ask to play games, you will likely get a negative response. They will likely tell you to do whatever they have been bugging you to do first. Just get your duties out of the way so you can tell them everything is already done. Then they have no reason to say you don't deserve to play your game.;
, This is where being a good student in school pays off. If you can manage to impress your parents in important areas of life, they are more likely to be lenient when you ask to do something you want.


Even if you're not the best student, you impress them in other ways. Next time they have company over, be polite, sociable, and helpful with the food, drinks and dishes. They will be so proud of how you behaved with their friends that they will try a little harder to make you happy too.

, Before you ask for something, thank them for what they have given you already. For example, ""Hey mom, I just wanted to say thank you for that game you got me. I've really been enjoying it. I think I'll go play for a little while now if that's okay with you."" Your parents will be glad to hear that you appreciate what they do for you. Also, instead of trying to tackle the question head on, you've already asked them indirectly and in a polite way.


Be sure you are sincere when showing your appreciation. If you sound like you are just saying it, your parents are likely to see it as a ploy.
Make this method more effective by thanking your parents regularly. Don't just be thankful when you want to something. Showing regular appreciation will help build a better relationship which will make it easier to communicate when you want something.

, If you can tell your parents are very busy or not in a good mood, you are better off waiting to ask about playing your game.


If you aren't sure whether or not it is a good time before asking about your game ask if they have a minute to talk or if they are too busy.
If your parents tell you they are busy just let them know it's okay and you'll come back later. Don't put pressure on them to deal with you immediately, they may have something important that they are focused on.

, Do not make a demand or whine to play your game. Asking nicely is as simple as saying please. You don't need to lay it on too thick by begging, just be polite. For example you might try saying, ""Could I please play my game for an hour before bed?"" Your parents want to make you happy and let you do things, but if you are unable to ask nicely they may think it is a result of lenient parenting and decide to tell you no as a lesson.

, Sometimes getting a positive answer is as easy as explaining that you need a break too. Parents will understand your feelings. Maybe you had a rough day at school or just finished a lot of homework and need a little chill time to recover and relax. It makes it a lot harder to say know when you open up and they can really see how you're feeling.

, Offer to do something your parents want done in exchange for being able to play the game afterwards.Maybe they have been bugging you to cut the grass, put away your laundry, or help with some kind of project around the house. They will very likely appreciate your willingness to pitch in and feel like they are getting the better end of the deal.


See if your parents will set up a chore-reward system. They can create a list of things that need to be done each week and you can earn a set amount of game time for completing them. This way you know what is expected of you and can get the chores out of the way when you're feeling up to it.

, Many parents do not play games, but some do. Even if your parents never play a game, it doesn't hurt to invite them to spend time with you. Some parents will be so excited to do something together with you they will agree, even if they don't like what it is.

, Be friendly and respectful.Even if they make you with their answer, don't call them names or run off to your room and slam the door. If you want your parents to respect your wishes and treat you like a person that is mature enough to make their own decisions, then show them that you are mature.

, Understanding why your parents said no will help you to make the changes in your approach that will lead to hearing yes the next time. Remember, your parents love you and want to say yes and make you happy. When they say no, they likely have a good reason.


Try to change your parents misguided beliefs as to why you can't play. Find them out, change them.
Maybe they just feel you've been spending too much time playing games and are worried it isn't healthy for you. Keep track of how long you have played each week and set down an amount of time with them.
Your parents might not see that playing games is anti-social, since you are alone in your room playing them. Show them how most games involve interacting with other players online and often working together to accomplish a common goal. If they can see you are developing leadership skills or learning to be a team player, they might see your gaming in a new light.

, Show them you can be mature and find another constructive way to spend a little time. Read a book, help with dinner, or just talk with them. Ask again later in the evening when they may have seen enough of your good behavior to sway their decision.

Choose a time and place to talk.,
Make sure your parents are in a good mood.,
Tell your parents what you want to talk about.",How to Convince Your Parents Not to Sell Your Pet2," Catching your parents walking out the door, or otherwise in a hurry, is a bad way to get what you want. If you want them to take the time to hear you out, set a time to talk to them after dinner or on a weekend. Make sure that you discuss it somewhere that you and your parents feel comfortable, such as your living room.It might even help to say something like “Mom, Dad, I would like to talk to you about something. Can we make time after dinner tonight?”
An example of a bad time and place would be dropping by a parent’s office in the middle of the day to talk about your pet.Your parent will be busy with work and will not want to listen to you.

, If your parents are upset about something else, you should wait to bring up your pet. Most people are unable to totally exclude their day to day frustrations from an important discussion or decision. Try to help out around the house or relieve some stress from your parents, and bring up keeping your pet when they are calm and relaxed., This will set the tone for the whole conversation. Be direct and tell them exactly why you want to talk. Be sure that you do not tell them what to do.You might say something like “Mom, Dad, I would like to talk to you about keeping Wilson,” instead of “You guys have to keep my dog!”

"
"
Stay calm.,
Show that you understand their point of view.,
State your case in a clear and concise manner.,
Give them time to think about it.,
Accept the outcome respectfully.",How to Convince Your Parents Not to Sell Your Pet3," If you intend to tell your parents that you are going to be mature enough to relieve them of the burdens of your pet, you have to show a little maturity. Screaming, yelling, throwing things, etc., will send the message that you are just angry and immature. Instead, stay calm and collected while talking to your parents, and they will be more willing to have the conversation.If your parents do not immediately allow you to keep your pet, yelling “I hate you! You are so unfair!” is not going to help you. Instead, try something like “I know you already said that we need to get rid of our pet, but please hear me out before you do.”

, Part of being mature is entertaining and respecting someone else’s point of view. You also need to understand exactly why your parents object to keeping your pet in order to beat those objections. When your parents are talking, listen carefully and respectfully.Your parents might say something like “Buying food for a pet is just getting to be too expensive.” Now you know what the problem is and you can respond “I will earn extra money to cover the cost of the food. I’m sorry I didn’t realize how difficult it must be to provide the money for everything all of the time.”

, The situation is emotional, but you have to stay on topic if you are going to make your point. Go through the list of reasons that you made to keep your pet, and support each reason as well as you can. Then, clearly state the things that you will do to make keeping the pet a tolerable request. When your parents see you put this much thought and passion into something, they are likely to listen.For example, if you are arguing that keeping your pet will teach you responsibility, be very clear about how that will happen. Say something like “Letting me take on the responsibility of caring for our pet will force me to plan my day ahead of time, earn money for pet food, and be considerate of how my actions affect others.”

, Backing your parents into a corner will most likely rush them into giving you an immediate “No.” Instead, make your case and give your parents time to think it through. They will most likely spend a day or so thinking about how they can make the situation work for everyone, and that will work in your favor.It is a good idea to say at the very beginning of the conversation “Please, don’t answer right away. Take some time to think this over after we talk.”

, Whatever your parents finally decide, you will have to be respectful. Not only does this continue to show maturity, it also builds a stronger case for future conversations with your parents. Be appreciative of the time they took to discuss things with you and think about keeping your pet, no matter what the final decision is.Show this appreciation by saying something like “Thank you for talking to me and thinking things over before making a decision.”

If you live close to your school, walk or ride your bike there. Take the school bus or public transit if you can. If all else fails, try to get a ride with your friends.


If you must ride with your parents, keep your headphones on for the whole ride.

, The time away from home will give you space and independence from your parents. Also, earning your own money will allow you to avoid asking your parents for theirs. Just make sure your job doesn't conflict with school, homework, or sleep., Join a sports team that appeals to you. Get involved in school clubs. Volunteer in your community. You'll not only get space from your parents, you'll also build confidence and collect bonus points for college applications., The presence of your parents can add stress and eat into your study time.

Ask your mom directly what her reservations are.,
Appeal to your mom’s sense of fairness.,
Don’t be defensive.If your mom does have a long list of things she doesn’t like about your girlfriend, your first reaction might be to jump to your girl’s defense.,
Convince your mom that she raised you to make good decisions.,
Remind your mom how dating has changed since she was a girl.,
Reassure your mom that your girlfriend is not taking her place.,
Discuss broader relationship issues with your mom.",How to Convince Your Mom to Give Your Girlfriend a Chance1," Your mom won’t see your girlfriend the way you do at the beginning, but that’s normal.Give your mom room to voice her issues about your girlfriend and feel heard. Once you know what your mom doesn’t like, you can address the issues directly.


You could start the conversation by saying, “Mom, I can tell you have some doubts about my girlfriend. What is it that makes you think she isn’t right for me?”
If she gives feelings without specifics, you could say, “I understand how you feel, but what are the specific things you have seen or heard that make you feel that way? I want to make sure I understand what has caused your negative feelings.”;
, If your mother is attacking your girlfriend personally or expressing doubts without enough experience, frame her judgments as they are: personal and premature.


For example, you might say, “I understand you don’t like those things, but how do they make my girlfriend a bad person or bad for me?”
If your mom has yet to even meet your girlfriend, you might try, ""Mom, I know that you are hesitating to accept her as part of my life, but it's a little hasty to judge someone before meeting her. It’s not fair to her or me not to even give her a chance.”

, Resist that urge and keep listening. Acknowledge if your mother makes a legitimate point without losing ground. For example:


If your mother rightly points out that your girlfriend is often late, you could say, “She can be late sometimes, but it’s not out of disrespect and doesn’t affect our relationship.”
If your mom is right that your girlfriend misplaces items easily, try, “Yes, she lost a pair of sunglasses and her water bottle. She’s never lost anything important, and how does any of that make her a bad person or a bad girlfriend anyway?”

, This appeals to your mother’s sense of pride. What parent doesn’t want to feel like they have raised a responsible and conscientious child? For instance, you could try saying one or more of the following lines:


”Mom, you taught me to always be honest with my feelings and genuine around people. The more I did that, the more my girlfriend and I started getting along. We are dating because I followed your advice and learned to be a good person.”
”You taught me to make a list of pros and cons when making a big decision. When I decided to date my girlfriend, the pros totally outweighed the cons five to one.”
”When I started working at the café near school, I learned how important free time is. When I asked myself what I could do to make the most of my precious free time, I decided this relationship was right for me. I made a rational decision based on a lesson you wanted me to learn.”

, Dating and romance change as culture and the times change so take a little time to point out some of those new developments to your mom. She might not understand your relationship because she is looking at it from within an older worldview.


For example, you could say, “Things aren’t as formal now, mom. Just because my girlfriend doesn’t come to the door every time she picks me up doesn’t mean she is disrespecting you. She texts when she is pulling up outside, and I run out the door. It’s quicker and easier.”
Give your mom a lesson in social media and try, “We don’t have to talk on the phone as much or plan dates, mom. We know each other pretty well already because we are friends online, and we hang out a lot with our shared group of friends when we go out.”

, Your mom wants to know that you still need her, not just her money! If you let your girlfriend take on all the roles your mom once did, you risk alienating your mom even more.


You could say, “She is just my girlfriend, mom. She isn’t the only friend I have or the only girl I respect. You’ve been my mom my whole life and will stay my mom for the rest of our lives; I know that.”
Trust that your mom is feeling the stress of this conflict too., Let your mom know that you respect her opinions and want her to stay involved in your changing life. She has more experience in the world of romance than you, and it shows wisdom on your part to trust her judgment.


Your mom will trust your judgment more if she knows you take time to think and talk through your relationships.
Your mom used to be a girl (maybe one not altogether different from your girlfriend) so she has insight into how things work in ""girl world.""
Getting an adult’s perspective on love can help you keep your feet on the ground when dating and romance can make your head spin.

Be willing to compromise.",How to Argue With Parents Successfully," You shouldn’t argue with your parents every time you disagree with them, if only because this strategy will make it harder for you to win when the argument is about something that is really important to you. Weigh the benefits versus the costs. If the topic of the argument is significant to you, it might be worth the effort and the possible consequences of engaging in an argument with your parents. However, if there are minimal worthwhile results, it might be best to let this one go.
For example, if your mom hates it when you play your music loudly, the only real benefit of having an argument about this is that you might get to play your music at a louder volume, and maybe only for a short period of time. It will also be perpetuating a behavior that your mom doesn’t like and will lead to more arguments in the future.
But if your parents have a problem with your significant other and they don’t like you spending time with him/her, this might be an instance in which planning an argument is worth it because there are more possible benefits on the line for you.;
, Causing a scene in public will only embarrass your parents and make them less likely to hear what you have to say. Make sure that your argument takes place at home or in a private space so that they are comfortable having the conversation with you.If you start an argument with your parents in public, they will view it as a very immature thing to do and it will not be a good way to begin the argument.
Some people get embarrassed when they think others know their business or are listening to them talk. This is not a good way get your parents to hear you out. Give your parents the courtesy of conducting your argument in private.

, People are more likely to hear what you say to them and really consider your opinions when they are in a good mood. If you start an argument with your parents when they are already upset, they will probably brush you off or respond even more negatively.


Give yourself the best possible chance by starting your argument when your parents will be receptive to what you have to say.
You might even try putting them in a good mood by doing things you know will make them happy – like cleaning your room, doing your homework, or spending time with them.
Of course, don’t immediately bring up the argument after trying to get your parents in a good mood. That will be too obvious and they will think you only did the nice things for selfish reasons to get something that you want.

, Before you begin an argument, make sure that you have fully considered the entire situation. Try to think about it from your parents’ point of view so that you can predict what they will say in the argument. That way, you can prepare your side of the argument, but you can also think objectively about your position.This can also help you see if you are being unreasonable.
Try thinking about how you would feel if someone was treating you the way you are treating your parents.
There are always two sides to every story and a good arguer knows that they need to consider both sides.

, For example, if you are having an argument with your parents about extending your curfew, you might want to discuss the following things:


Include all of the reasons why you’ve proven you’re responsible enough to handle it (not missing curfew in the past months, completing your homework on time, doing your chores, etc.)
Give counter reasons to eliminate their existing concerns – like if you know they are worried you will get in trouble because you are out later, you might mention that they already know most of your friends and their parents, so they don’t have anything to worry about.
Bring up why extending your curfew would actually be a good thing – like it will make you happy so you’ll be more enjoyable to be around, it will help you develop your friendships more fully, and it will help you learn to handle more adult responsibility.

, If you’re going to engage in an argument with your parents, you need to be fully prepared. Spend some time thinking about what you want to say and write them down. You can bring the notes with you to the discussion with your parents, or you can just study them before you start so that you won’t forget any of your major points.Having a planned, organized argument already in your mind will help you navigate the conversation with your parents and might also impress your parents by showing them that you take this matter seriously.

, Whatever you do, don’t get hysterical during an argument with your parents. This is immature and will not make them see your side of the argument any more clearly. Show your parents that you are capable of a mature discussion by remaining calm even if things don’t go your way., You know how if someone hits you and you hit them back, it counts as self-defense for the second guy? Well, the same idea applies to getting in arguments with parents. Never talk first. Just calmly stand by while they rant at you.In some cases it may feel like whatever you may do will cause your parents to become even more angry. That can be particularly difficult to deal with since you literally have no way of reacting without triggering a bad response. If that is the case, then possibly the best thing you can do is just stand silently, look at them, and do nothing until they calm down a bit.

, Start the argument by saying, “You are right.” This shows your parents that you understand their point of view and that you aren’t trying to dissuade them from their feelings or beliefs.This will help your parents see that you respect their opinions, but that you simply want them to consider some additional aspects of the situation.
For the extending your curfew example, try saying something like this: “I know that you think it will be easy for me to make poor decisions if I am allowed to stay out later at night.”

, Give your parents an opportunity to voice their opinion, but then ask them questions about their stance. If you do this, it will show them that you are really listening to what they are saying and that you are invested in resolving the issue. However, it might also show you some flaws in their logic which you may be able to use to your advantage.Try something like, ""What would you like to know?"" or, ""Could you be a little more specific?"" By narrowing down the topic, you've limited the number of things your parents can go after.

, After they've told you what they expect to have answered, simply provide them with your explanation. Be sure to speak slowly and in a controlled manner, as this helps to decrease tension.


For the example about extending your curfew, try calmly saying something like this: “I would like to extend my curfew because it is important to me to have more time with my friends. Most of my friends are allowed to stay out later and you know them and their families so you should feel at least a little comfortable with this. I would like to have some more adult responsibility in my life.”

, After you've told them your version of the story – whether it’s true or not – be sure not to alter it or change your answers to any questions they might ask you about it. Being consistent is the key to believability. So make sure you stick to your story throughout the entire argument.If your parents think you only want to extend your curfew because all of your friends are all out drinking at night, tell them your version of the story and don’t falter.

, If they think you're lying, so be it. There’s not much you can do to change this fact. But you don’t have to keep going in the same circle where they accuse you and you deny it over and over. Once you have told them your story, tell them that your story won’t change no matter what questions they ask you or how many times they ask you.


Just say something like, ""That's what I'm telling you. Take it or leave it."" This narrows down their options and allows you to take control of the situation.

, If they insist that you're lying, be sure to point out that whether or not they believe you is a choice only they can make, and that you can't decide for them – after all, you wouldn't be in this situation if that was the case, would you? It might also be useful to reinforce the ""take it or leave it"" part mentioned earlier.


Tell your parents something like this: “I can’t help it if you don’t believe me. But I am here trying to have a conversation with you about it, which I think shows a lot of maturity. Whether you choose to believe me or not is up to you.""

, If you keep having arguments with your parents about the same things, try to avoid doing the things that cause these arguments. We can’t always get everything we want all the time, so sometimes it’s necessary to make sacrifices to please the people we love (or the people we live with).Remember to pick your battles. If the problem is not that big of a deal to you, then just change what you’re doing to make your parents happy. It will be better for you in the long run.
Eventually you will be out from under your parents’ roof and able to make whatever choices you want to make. But until that time, it will probably be beneficial to you to at least try to avoid doing things that make them upset.

, Let your parents see all the responsible things that you do on a daily basis. The more confident they are in your behavior, the less likely they will be to nag you about other things.

Let your parents know when you have finished your homework or when you have completed your chores. Bring home good grades to show them. Send them a text when your plans change so they won’t worry about you.
The point here is visibility. It does you little good if you are behaving well but your parents never see the things you do.
But make sure you don’t seem like you are bragging about yourself all the time. That might be off-putting. Just simply let them know when you have done something they would be proud of.

, Giving someone the cold shoulder will not help resolve conflict. It is a childish tactic used to manipulate people and your parents will not appreciate it. It is always better to discuss your problems calmly.

The silent treatment will just make your parents feel disconnected from you and they may start to resent you. It is better to discuss things with them instead.
Giving your parents the cold shoulder will also make them think that you are acting like an immature child. This will not help you win arguments in the future.

, One of the most important things you can do to avoid arguments is to show your parents that you are willing to compromise. If you refuse to compromise, it will show your parents that you are more immature and that you really only care about getting your way.


When your parents suggest a compromise, accept it – even if you have to give up a little of what you want. You can also try suggesting compromises to your parents.
For example, if your mom wants you to finish all of your chores before you go out with your friends, offer to do half of them before and promise to finish the other half the following day. This way, you both get some of what you want.

Find out what your parents want.Ask your parents directly what they want from you.,
Decide what you want.Do you want to stay out with friends beyond the time your parents want you to be home?,
Determine where compromise is impossible.,
Identify where compromise is likely to work.The more closely a compromise approaches the conditions preferred by your parents, the more likely it will be to succeed.,
Understand that compromises need not always be 50/50.Maybe you feel poorly and wanted the day off of school, but your parents wanted you to go the whole day.,

Choose the right place to discuss the compromise.,

Be willing to modify your compromise.,
Enlist the help of a third party.If you’re convinced that your parents’ rules are truly draconian and over-the-top, you may be able to sway their decision with aid from someone else.,

Use comparative reasoning to support your position.,
Make a plan to keep your end of the deal.,
Remember the motivation behind the compromise.There are a couple reasons why you should keep your end of the compromise.,
Be realistic with your compromise.Do not agree to a compromise you know you cannot or will not keep.,
Be honest about your ability to meet the compromise.",How to Compromise with Your Parents," Whether the problem is cleaning your room, doing your homework, or applying a raise to your allowance, listen to what they have to say and think about it carefully. Never assume you know what they want; they may have changed what they expect of you as you’ve grown. Ask questions if you’re confused about their reasoning or need some clarification.


If your parents are having a hard time expressing themselves to you, or you need a direct answer about their expectations, encourage them to share their views with you. Try a conversation prompt such as “I’m very interested in hearing what you think about ,” or “Do you think it would be alright if I ?”;
, Do you want to buy a pair of hundred-dollar jeans but your parents will only spring for fifty-dollar jeans? Think about what your folks are proposing and ask yourself if there’s an alternative to their decision that would make you happier. If there is, suggest it to your parents and explain why.


Your counteroffer is probably what you originally intended to do before your parents curtailed your decision.
For instance, perhaps your plan was to go out with your friends until midnight. Before you could express this to your parents, they informed you that you were to be home by 10:00. When they inform you that you’re to be home at 10:00, gently and patiently respond, “Oh, I was planning to be out until midnight. Is that okay?” With luck, they will accept your counteroffer, and there will be no need to compromise. If they do not accept it, however, you’ll need to think about developing a compromise.
Do not develop a counteroffer long after your parents express what they want. If you wait, they might feel that their initial decision has been “set in stone” and be unwilling to waver on it.

, When dealing with an issue or rule which is long-term or permanent, your parents will be unwilling to make compromises.For instance, where there are hard rules such as no drinking, no drugs, and no driving the Lamborghini, you should not bother trying to compromise. Where compromise is not an option, you should comply accordingly.Doing so will build trust with your parents and make them more disposed toward compromising on other, more debatable topics.

, For instance, if you want to go out until midnight but your folks want you home at 9:00, you’ll have greater luck getting them to compromise for a curfew of 10:00 than 11:00, and more likely to get them to agree to an 11:00 than to a midnight curfew.


The specific conditions of the compromise determine its efficacy. If you’re out on a school night, for instance, you will be less likely to get an extended curfew than if it’s a Friday or Saturday. Think about the specific conditions under which you are compromising in order to develop a logical argument with which to make your case.

, A perfect, down-the-middle compromise would be for you to go half a day. But if you can convince your parents to let you take the first two periods off, call it a win and don’t feel obligated to keep pushing for a half day off.

, The best time to have a serious talk is after dinner.Asking for your parents to consider a compromise in the morning is folly. Around breakfast time, everyone -- including you, probably -- is scrambling to get out the door to work or school. Asking for a compromise, laying out your reasoning, and conducting the back-and-forth conversation which compromise entails is difficult or impossible when you ask for one in the morning. For this reason, choose a time in the late evening when everyone is winding down and has time for contemplation.

, Choose a quiet, well-lit room so as to focus attention on the conversation itself. Do not try to talk to your parents while they are working on the computer or talking on their phone. Ensure you have their undivided attention before asking for a compromise. Arrange some chairs in a tight circle, enough for everyone who is part of the compromise.


For instance, if your compromise is for you and your sister to do something together, your parents, your sister, and you all need to be seated.
Try to always include everyone who the compromise affects in the conversation. If, for some reason such as time constraints, you cannot have all affected parties present when you discuss the compromise, keep an empty chair in the circle in order for each of you to think about what the absent individual would think or say about the proposed compromise.
For instance, if your sister can’t make it to the compromise talk but you and your parents can, keep an empty chair in the circle in order to represent her and her potential wishes. As you discuss the various facets of the compromise, ask of each, “What would think about that?”It can also be good to seek a compromise on something while in the car with your parents. The car is a relatively quiet, enclosed space where you’re ensured direct access to them. Ensure the car ride is long enough for you to lay out your vision for a compromise., Walk away from the conversation for awhile and think about how you can approach the situation from another angle.


For instance, if you feel your face start to flush with rage when discussing when you need to be home at night, take a few deep breaths and retreat to your room, or go for a walk. After clearing your head, try to develop an alternative compromise or word the compromise differently.

, This will make them indisposed to compromising with you. Stay calm and demonstrate that you understand their point of view.


Open the negotiations to compromise with the following: “Thank you for allowing me this audience. I am interested in proposing a compromise on the matter of . While I respect and understand your initial decision, I believe that if we can reach a compromise, we can arrive at a solution in which we both get what we want.”At that point, you can launch into the specific details of your compromise.
When your parents accept a compromise, thank them sincerely for their flexibility and understanding. Parents love feeling appreciated.
Failing to be respectful -- for instance, by telling your parents they’re being dumb or annoying -- may scuttle any hopes of your compromise being accepted or even considered.

, If your initial compromise doesn’t work, try to think of a way to turn the situation more favorably in your direction. For instance, if you want to stay out until one and your parents want you home at 10, they might refuse your initial compromise to stay out until 11:30. Instead, offer to come home at 10 every night the rest of the week if you can stay out until one just this one night.

, Think of this person as a mediator on your behalf. You might get help from another family member, a teacher, a therapist or conflict mediator, or a clergy member who is close to your family.


Before enlisting help, be sure that your parents’ rules are overly strict. If they are reasonable and you seek help in dealing with them, you’ll look immature or insincere.

, If you feel kind of tired one night and your parents ask you to be home at 10 instead of 11 like you planned, accept their request and head home at ten. It’s only an hour, and you’ll probably be ready to hit the hay by then anyway since you’re already tired.

, Comparative reasoning involves comparing your case to a similar case in order to justify a reasonable compromise.For instance, if your parents insist you come home at 10 each night but your brother, who is of a similar age, is allowed to come home at one or two, you could compare your own situation to his to demonstrate how unfairly you’re being treated. Recognizing that your brother is being treated differently than you are might sway their decision in your favor.

, Once a compromise has been reached, you’ll need to hold up your end of the bargain.Having a roadmap with which to get you through the compromise with your parents is a big step toward making it happen.


For instance, if you decided to be home at 9:00 instead of 11:00, write it in marker on your calendar (“PARTY TONIGHT UNTIL 9:00!”). Set your phone and/or watch with an alarm for 8:30 or a point in time from which you can make it home by 9:00. Ask a friend to remind you when the clock strikes 8:30 so that you’ll know you need to go.

, Doing so will make your parents more likely to compromise with you again in the future. On top of that, you’ll feel good when you keep your word and meet your parents’ expectations.


Breaking your promise to your mom and dad will make them doubt your maturity and ability to compromise on other issues. Your parents will likely be angrier than they might normally be since from their point of view, they were showing leniency in their decision to compromise

, If you are going to a ball game that starts at 8:30 and the compromise you worked out with the folks designates a curfew of 9:00, you probably won’t be coming home on time. A broken compromise won’t make your parents happy. For that reason, only make compromises that you will try your best to fulfill.

, If your situation changes or you doubt you can fulfill your end of the bargain, let your parents know. If you come to them in good faith asking for a modification of the compromise, they will probably understand.For instance, perhaps you’re going to a party with a friend. You compromised with your parents to let you stay out until 11:00 instead of your usual bedtime, 9:00. But you find out that your friend who was supposed to give you a ride home is drunk, so you won’t be able to get home until your other friend leaves closer to 11:30.
Call your parents as soon as you find out the new information and ask them to let you stay out later. As good parents, they will surely not insist that you get a ride home with a drunk friend just so you fulfill the terms of the compromise.

Control the urge to talk non-stop about your girlfriend.,
Enlist friends and siblings to help.,
Avoid taking sides.,
Find things that your mom and girlfriend have in common and use them to bridge the gap.You get along with both your mom and your girlfriend so there must be a few hobbies, opinions, favorites, or personal similarities that you can use to ease your mom’s nerves.,
Avoid a relationship that brings negative attention to your family.",How to Convince Your Mom to Give Your Girlfriend a Chance2," If your mom doesn’t like your girlfriend, hearing you become obsessed or single-minded will only support her reservations. Your girlfriend should be just one part of a healthy, colorful life.


If your girlfriend becomes the center of your existence, you give your mom a strong argument against the relationship.

, Get your support group on board talking up your girlfriend and pointing out when your mom says something unfair or out of line. Seeing how people other than you trust and appreciate your girlfriend can slowly wear your mom’s reservations down.


Ask friends to casually mention some mom-friendly things about your girlfriend in conversation. For example, they could say, “Man, your girlfriend killed at that test today,” or, “Sorry we’re late, but your girlfriend just had to walk a bunch of carts back to the store before she’d get in the car.”
Your siblings could ask you questions when your mother is around like, “Why are you so happy today?” or “Why did you put all your clothes away so fast?” Your answers give you a chance to brag about your girl.
Don’t be too obvious, or your mother will get the idea that something is up.

, You might feel like you are caught in the middle between your parents and your girlfriend, and that’s because you are. However, taking sides by pulling away from your family or playing one against the other rarely works.Remember that the goal is to have everyone get along. You need to stay on both sides.
Avoid speaking negatively about one person when alone with the other. You want your mom and girlfriend to respect each other, not just tolerate one another.

,


Mention these things around your mother casually so it isn’t obvious what you’re doing.
If your mom says something that your girlfriend would agree with, try saying something like, “That’s funny. My girlfriend thinks the same thing. I’m not so sure though.” You instantly make your mom and girlfriend a team, and you can play up how your girlfriend eventually helps you see things your mom’s way.
If you are playing games together, you can play “Girls vs. Boys” to ensure that your mom and girlfriend are literally on the same team for a time.

, It might sound fake or posturing in this day and age, but the adult world can put a lot of stock in appearances and reputation.Even if you disagree with the judgmental perspectives involved, you will have an easier time convincing your mom to accept your girlfriend if your relationship is not the talk of the town.


Sometimes you have to stand up for yourself and your beliefs, but try to do so while respecting your parents’ opinions.
Small towns especially can entail intricate family politics that are hard to avoid, and you might not see things the way your parents do.

Ensure that your girlfriend shows an interest in your hobbies and strengths.,
Encourage your girlfriend to be sincere and friendly around your mom.,
Teach your girlfriend the rules and conventions of your home and hold her to them.",How to Convince Your Mom to Give Your Girlfriend a Chance3," If your mom sees her coming to watch you play football, helping you study, or gushing over your artwork, that will help your mom realize that your girl appreciates you for you (not just your boyfriend status).


You could say to your girlfriend, “Hey, my mom is still a little weird about us dating. Would it be okay if we make sure you come to the same games of mine that my mom does so she sees you there each time?”
If your girlfriend has an innocent gift for you, why not plan to have her give it to you in front of your mom?
Parents have invested much into your life, and they love you an awful lot. It is natural for them to want you to date someone who is willing to invest in you too.
Of course, this goes both ways: let your parents see you taking an interest in your girlfriend’s larger life as well.

, Your girlfriend doesn’t have to pretend to like everything your mother does to win over her affection. If your girlfriend is friendly and respectful while still being her genuine self, your mom is more likely to warm up to her.


Everyone can benefit from learning to be courteous while disagreeing with someone.

, Your mother’s hesitations will lose steam when your girlfriend acts like a respectful and integrated member of the family already. For instance:


If your mom doesn't like you using your cell phone during dinner, remind your girlfriend not to text during those times.
If your mom dislikes profanity, let your girlfriend know!
If family members remove their shoes when they walk in the door, don’t shirk the rule for your girlfriend.

This is not necessarily the case. Oftentimes, differences stem from generational divides. Your parents may have reasons for not understanding you or your perspective.Your parents may have grown up in a culture with different beliefs. Perhaps, for example, your father's father was very strict. Your father may feel pressure to be a ""good parent"" coming from his father, causing him to not understand your need for freedom or autonomy.
Your parents lack of understanding may also be caused by outside factors unrelated to you. If your mother does not always have time to listen to the problems you're having with your social group at school, think about what she's going through. Is your mother busy? Is she stressed at work or experiencing difficulties with her family? Outside factors may be blocking your mother's ability to understand you.;
, Listening is key to understanding anyone, including your parents. If you want to understand where the divide comes from, talk to your parents and truly engage with what they're saying.Listen in every day conversations. Even if your parents are just ranting about work or a co-worker, what they're saying can lead to insight on their values, strengths, and weaknesses. When your parents are talking to you, give them your full attention.
Also, watch body language. Body language can convey a hidden meaning to what someone is saying. For example, your father fidgets a lot and hunches over when he tells you he doesn't want you going to the dance without a chaperone. His body language indicates he's nervous. You may assume he does not understand how much the dance means to you. However, he may merely be an anxious person by nature and his concern for your well-being is overriding his ability to empathize with your needs as a teenager.

, When you're listening, pay attention to your parents feelings. If you understand what your parents are feeling, and why they may feel this way, this can give you insight as to why they don't understand you. The more you know, the more you'll be able to accept the lack of understanding.Imagine what your parents may have felt when they tell you about an experience they have had. For example, say your mom tells you about a friend she had as a child who got involved with a bad crowd and eventually dropped out of high school. Imagine how your may feel about this. Perhaps she's scared of the same thing happening to you.
Ask questions to make sure you're understanding your parents' feelings. For example, ""How did losing touch with Shannon make you feel? You must have been scared. Do you have any regrets?""
Try to see how these feelings influence behavior. Maybe your mom is strict with you because of her bad experience with Shannon. Her desire to protect you may be interfering with her ability to understand your need for freedom and autonomy.

, The stories we expose ourselves to can really help develop our sense of empathy and our understanding of the world. If you're struggling with your relationship with your parents, read books and watch films about parent/child relationships. Seeing others cope with a lack of understanding between themselves and their parents can help you learn how to deal.Explore movies and books by theme. At your library, the online card catalogue may help you search for books by topic. You could type in something like, ""Parent/child relationships."" On video streaming sites like Netflix, videos may be tagged with similar topics.
Ask your friends, teachers, and a local librarian for recommendations.
As your watch or read, consider what the characters are experiencing and feeling. See if you can make any connections between these stories and your own life. How do the characters deal with their parents not understanding? Are there any coping skills you can adopt yourself?

, Parents rarely mean to make you feel misunderstood. Your parents are usually trying to protect you from the dangers of the outside world.Your parents may say things like, ""These are the rules in this house and that's it."" You may think your parents are dismissing your perspective. However, they may simply not want to explain certain dangers to you.
Your parents were young once as well, and probably do understand, at least to a degree, some of your frustrations with them. As parents, though, their need to protect you comes first.

, In rare cases, your parents inability to understand you can be a warning sign of emotional abuse. If your parents routinely dismiss your perspective in a way that is belittling or hostile, you may be a victim of emotional abuse. The situation should be addressed by a therapist before it gets worse.Think about how your parents talk to you. Do they criticize you in a very intense way, using foul language to put you down? Do they constantly belittle your feelings when you express your opinion or feelings? Your parents may use terms like ""worthless"" to describe you or refer to you as a ""mistake."" Your parents may say, ""You're being too sensitive"" if you get upset at the way they talk to you, for example.
Your parents may also abuse you via neglect. They may, for example, fail to make sure basic needs, like food, shelter, and safety, are met.
Your parents may also expose you to violence, or threaten violence. They may threaten to harm you in a physical way, or threaten a household pet, when they're angry.
Emotional abuse is a problem greater than a simple lack of understanding. If you are being emotionally abused, you should seek the help of other adults to help address the situation.

, If you and your parents do not see eye-to-eye, certain conflicts are inevitable. You may find yourself frequently frustrated with a disagreement. When a conflict does come up, talk it out. Plan a good time and place to talk over disagreements.Pick the right time to talk. Remember that life is busy for adults, so make sure you know your parents' schedules. Think about when your parents are usually free. For example, maybe one or both of your parents are occupied on most weekday nights, but everyone tends to be home on Saturdays.
Choose a location where everyone is comfortable and one that is free from outside distractions. For example, the living room may be a bad option if it contains the TV. Instead, opt to sit around around the kitchen table and talk.

, Before you talk with your parents, spend some time considering your own point of view. You want to identify the problem and your feelings surrounding it before going into the conversation. This way, you'll be better equipped to express your feelings.It can help to write it out. Take a piece of paper and jot down the issue you're having. For example, ""Mom and Dad won't let me go to a slumber party until I'm 12, so I'm missing my best friend's birthday.""
Now that you've identified your problem, write down your feelings. How and why do you feel you're being misunderstood? For example, ""I feel like my parents don't understand how much Sophie means to me. I want to be a good friend and go to her party.""

, Once you're ready to talk out the issue, be mature. You're unlikely to bridge any gaps by going into the situation with anger. Remaining calm, explain to your parents how and why you feel they're being unfair and how you feel you're being misunderstood.Be clear, direct, and honest with your parents about how you feel. There is no sense withholding any information as you're striving to be understood. For example, state something like, ""I feel sad that I can't go to Sophie's party. It's important for me to be a good friend to her, and I feel like you don't understand that.""
As you talk, try to understand your parents' point of view. Why might your parents not want you to attend this party? Do they have any good reasons?

, You should not whine or complain when talking to your parents. If you maintain a friendly and respectful tone, you're more likely to communicate effectively. If your parents do not change their minds, do not yell or sulk. Say something like, ""I understand you don't want me to go to the party, but I want you to understand where I'm coming from."", If your parents do not understand you, they may not ever agree with you in regards to certain things. In these cases, part of acceptances is agreeing to disagree. If there's still misunderstanding between you and your parents after a discussion, work on accepting the fact and moving forward.There may be room for compromise in some situations. For example, your parents may agree you can attend your friend's party, as long as you don't sleepover. However, compromise is not possible in all situations. If you and your parents can't find a way to meet each other halfway, you'll need to agree to disagree.
Remember, you're your own person. You have a set of thoughts, values, and opinions that will not always align with your parents. You can follow your parents' rules, especially if you are still living at home, but keep in mind you do not have to agree with them. It's okay to have differences of opinions between yourself and your parents.

, You do not want to rely solely on your parents' approval, especially if they do not understand you. Learn to take pride in your own unique strengths and skill set, even if your strengths are not necessarily things your parents would value.Write down a list of your strengths. This can help you affirm your talents and social skills. Include personality strengths, like ""I'm a kind person"" or ""I'm funny"" as well as talents or skills. For example, ""I'm really good at math.""
Your parents may not value all your strengths, which is why it's important you value them. If your parents do not understand you, they may not understand why some of your interests and passions constitute strengths. It's important you believe this yourself.

, You need to have a good support network if your parents do not understand you. Seek out supporting friends, who affirm your strengths and believe in you. Do not hang out with anyone who's negative and tends to put others down. A solid friends group can help you feel good about yourself, despite negativity from your parents.Friends can also help if you're having difficulty with your parents. Talking to someone outside the situation can help you cope. Your friends may also have some insight on how to deal with parents who do not understand., You may become more critical of yourself if your parents do not fully understand your strengths. You need to work to shut out the voice of self-criticism and instead focus on encouraging and loving yourself.Do not be ashamed of your weaknesses or flaws. Everyone has imperfections. Instead of focusing on them, try to pay attention to how your strengths balance out such imperfections.
Think about how you've overcome certain weaknesses, or at least worked within the confines of your flaws. For example, say you get a ""B"" on a chemistry test. Do not think, ""I should have done better. I wish I was smarter."" Instead, think, ""I know chemistry isn't my best subject. I'm proud I studied and brought up my grade from the last test.""

, If your parents lack of understanding has crossed the line into abuse, it's important you seek outside help. You need to be able to love and accept yourself, and these things can be hard in an abusive situation.Talk to another adult, such as another relative or the parent of a friend. You can also talk to someone at your school, like a school counselor.
You and your parents may need to see a therapist together. It's important your parents recognize negative habits and learn to treat you better as a person.

Make sure that you have a backup plan for everything.,

Be nice to your parents.,
Just deal with it.,
Learn something from this experience.",How to Survive a Severe Grounding," Contact a couple of friends and ask if you can borrow some of their stuff for a while. Make sure you have extra stuff around your room such as a music player or some books to read. Things like building that model you got for a birthday or Christmas you never thought of doing, like stuff that would pass the time. If you are aware of the punishment beforehand, make a stash of electronics, such as an old game boy or Mp3 player.;
, One of the most important things that you can do is to make sure that you talk to them at school or put notes in their locker if you can't do that.

, When you are grounded, it is hard to get new stuff. Your parents might keep you from going to the store. This is always a good opportunity to save some money too.

, Yelling at them every time you see them isn't going to help. Don't be overly nice so that it's obvious that you are trying to get out of it, but just follow their terms of your grounding and try not to upset them, or they might increase the length of your grounding. Tell them you understand why you are being punished. If you think it might make them reduce the grounding, do extra chores around the house. This just might get their respect back.

, It's the most important thing to remember. It will all come to an end eventually, and you will survive. Just try to find something that your parents will let you do. Work on your drawing or read a book, or if all else fails, do some homework or some schoolwork. Be positive and tell yourself it's not going to last forever, and Do Not Think It's Entirely Your Fault! You really are good inside.

, If you make a mistake trying to sneak out while grounded, or get caught with your iPod, or on the computer or TV, figure out why your parents caught you and be a little sneakier next go-round

Knowing that he is actually being heard and taken seriously can be the first step to recovery.


Kindly and gently say something along the lines of, ""Dad, it really hurts me to see you in such pain. When you said 'I feel like killing myself,' did you really mean that?"" If Dad says, ""I was just so frustrated...but I'm fine now"" that means you can probably exhale. It does not mean he won't feel worse later, but it does mean he wasn't serious. Continue to monitor him in the coming weeks, and it is ok to ask periodically if he is thinking about suicide. If Dad says something along the lines of, ""I'm just tired of everything,"" or ""I'm tired of living, I'd be better off dead"", that is much more serious.;
, This may seem like something you should avoid asking, but nevertheless, this is not a time to get shy or nervous — a life is at stake. If Mom or Dad is ""tired of everything,"" ask, ""If you seriously were to kill yourself, how would you do so?"" Again, you are trying to assess how lethal the intention is.If Dad says, ""I'd probably use my gun,"" it is absolutely necessary that you figure out where the gun is. If it's locked in a gun box or locker, you should take possession of the key. If it's in the nightstand drawer, you could go and hide it elsewhere. However, that is a serious threat, no matter how you cut it because Dad (A) has a plan (a gun) and (B) has the means (the gun) to carry out the threat. Remove the gun from the house, then call 911 or take your dad to the nearest emergency room for psychological evaluation and referral for treatment.
On the other hand, if Dad responds with something like, ""Oh, I don't know. Maybe pills? Something painless?"" this is a less credible threat, but regardless, it should still be taken very seriously. You can press a little and ask what sort of pills. A response like, ""Tylenol — lots of it. We have a huge bottle of them,"" is bad (he knows what pills he is thinking of, and has enough on hand). Something like, ""I haven’t thought it out that far."" is not as bad (he's unsure if he has enough to do the job and which pills he's even thinking of). In either case, it is imperative that your dad seek professional help for evaluation and treatment. Call his primary care physician, therapist, or psychiatrist if he has an established provider.

, There are some situations that cannot be handled by family and/or friends, no matter how much you love your parent or how good your intentions are. If your parent seems truly serious, repeats the threat more than once, or makes an attempt on his life, realize that you are out of your depth and will need to call emergency services (911 will do for starters in the US/Canada).

, These agencies can help transport your parent to the hospital for psychological assessment and treatment. You can also go to another family member with your fears, or go to a family friend or a teacher to seek support and direction. Someone will be able to get professional help for your parent. Don't wait. If you cannot shake a bad feeling about this, make contact with someone quickly so that an intervention has a chance to work.

, It is not your fault. If a parent is truly suicidal, don't assume her decision has anything to do with you. Those who contemplate suicide often have untreated mental disorders, such as depression. If your parent is considering such a tragic decision, don't blame yourself or anyone else., Feeling that she has lost standing in your eyes may undermine his or her recovery. Make sure your parent knows it's important to you that she is proud of you, approves of your decisions, etc. — just the little, everyday things that you do as a child to a parent.

, Take his or her hand, and pray that he or she will be comforted and find peace settling upon her, and that you can be of help somehow. Many researchers view spirituality and religiosity as potential coping resources for suicidal thoughts.Praying with your parent might provide comfort and a reminder about her reasons for living.


Keep it short — it's not about a long rant. It's about (A) putting your faith to work at a crucial time for a person in need and (B) letting your parent know how very much you love and care for her by offering a very intimate gift.
Praying may have the effect of soothing your heart, and making you feel more confident, plus it can really help your parent to know that your faith is helping you to be strong when she cannot be.
Take pride in the fact that you are doing what you can to help your parent get the help she deserves.

, You may want someone to encourage you when you feel hopeless, or you may need mental health counseling to sort through your feelings about a suicidal parent. Seek your own help if you need it. Don't feel like you need to put on a brave front. Suicide is frightening to everyone.

, It's okay, even necessary, for you to talk about this with another person, but be sure they are trustworthy and try not to tell too many people. Otherwise you might embarrass your parent or put pressure on her to present a strong facade — both for friends and family and for you.

, In some instances, a parent may threaten suicide as a way of frightening you or getting you to do something he wants. While such threats should still be taken seriously, you also have to take measures to protect yourself emotionally. You can identify emotional manipulation suicide threats by their tell-tale ""If, then"" form, although sometimes they may be more subtle. Your parent may make a conditional statement, such as:


""If you leave me here all alone, I will kill myself.""
""If I can't come live with you, I may as well just die.""
""If you really love me and want me to stay alive, you wouldn't treat me like this.""

, Convey to your parent that you are sorry she is in pain and that you want to help, but you will not be controlled or manipulated by threats. Do this in a gentle and non-assuming way, and actually follow up on your words and call for professional assistance.For example, say ""Mom, I love you so much and I definitely don't want you to hurt yourself, but you can't come to live with me right now. I will do what I can to make sure you get the help you need."" Such a statement shows compassion, but sets boundaries of what you will and won't do.

, No matter what your parent threatens, avoid trying to prove yourself or give in to the manipulation. Doing so will only jump start a repetitive cycle of your parent tossing around threats whenever things are not going his way.


Stand firm in your boundaries. And, remember, even if you were to give in this one time, it wouldn't resolve the underlying emotional problem that prompted him to threaten suicide in the first place.
Let your parent know that you are concerned for his safety, thus when he threatens suicide you will take him seriously and call 911 so he can receive the proper treatment. Setting this boundary releases you from manipulation while ensuring your parent remains safe.

, Try your best to prevent any fighting or confrontations. There is no need to tell your parent that you know she is manipulating you. This may only worsen the situation and deter you from reaching a solution. A power struggle may result in your parent attempting a suicide simply to show you he or she was serious.


Once you identify emotional manipulation hiding behind these suicidal threats, consult with a therapist for your parent and yourself. With the guidance of a professional, you may be able to express your feelings about being manipulated in a safe environment without fearing your parent will attempt suicide.

, Remember, no matter how much you love, care for, or pray for your parent, you cannot keep him alive — only your parent can do that. It is unfair for your parent to place such a burden (i.e. whether he lives or dies) in your hands.Clearly state your concerns, but continue to stand behind your boundaries: ""Dad, it hurts me to hear you say you want to kill yourself. But, no matter what I say or do, that decision lies with you. I can't stop you from harming yourself, but I do want you to get the appropriate help.""

You can either memorize them or sketch a rough outline of the stairs or hallway on a piece of paper. Then mark the noisy spots on it as you find them throughout the day., You’ll probably get hungry or thirsty while staying up late, so during the day, sneak some bottles of water and snacks out of the kitchen and into your room. Hide them under the bed if there’s any chance your parents will go into your closet before the end of the day.Choose energy drinks or caffeinated beverages if you’re worried about getting tired.
Select quiet snacks like bread or fresh fruit instead of chips or cereal, which will be in loud, crinkly bags.

, If you’re staying up late to do homework, gather all your books, papers, and pencils together in your room so you don’t have to find them later. If you’re staying up for fun, hide some entertainment under your pillow: a book, your phone, or a handheld gaming device.Make sure any electronic devices are fully charged so that they last through the night.

, You’ll probably have to turn your bedroom light off at some point to pretend you’ve gone to sleep. If you plan to read a book or do any writing, track down a book light or flashlight and store this near your bed so you can read under the covers., If you have time in the late afternoon, take a quick nap. Grabbing an hour or so of sleep now will help you make it through the night later., Avoid rushing to bed early or trying to push your bedtime later. Either of these behaviors could make your parents suspicious. Instead, maintain your regular schedule to prevent unwanted attention.

, If you leave the light on, your parents will see it through the crack under the door. Keep it off until after they’ve gone to bed. Once everyone is asleep, you can turn it back on. Just shove a blanket around the bottom of the door to block excess light in case anyone gets up to go to the bathroom., Keep tabs on when everyone goes to bed. If you hear footsteps outside your door, shove your belongings under the covers in case your parents are coming to check on you.

Make it clear that if they keep it a secret, you two can do this again sometime.Keep your voices down to a whisper as you move around the house, and try not to make each other laugh.
Let the dog or cat join you too if you know they'll be quiet. If the dog will bark, you may need to stay inside your room all night.

, Take slow, soft steps on the balls of your feet if you’re going to leave your room. Avoid any of the areas you determined could have a creaky floorboard. And turn doorknobs slowly to avoid any loud clicks., If you want to watch TV while you’re up, turn it on and then immediately hold down the button to decrease the volume. You never know how loud it was when it was turned off. Keep it as low as possible so that even if your parents get up to go to the bathroom, they might not hear it.If you have a TV in your room, be sure to place a blanket or towel at the base of your door. This will block any light from the TV from leaking out into the hallway.

, Try to go to the bathroom as infrequently as possible in order to cut down on noise. Limiting your beverage intake will help with this. Also consider not flushing the toilet until the morning, right before you hop back into bed., Once it's time to wake up, revert your room to its normal mode. Hide your snacks in the closet, and slide into bed. Pretend that you’re sleeping when your alarm clock rings or your parents come to wake you up.

Get a friend to hold the bottom of the ladder for safety.,
Slowly and quietly climb down the ladder.,
Consider buying a ladder if your family does not own one.",How to Sneak Out of Your Second Story Window1," Look through your family's garage or basement to find a ladder. If you plan on sneaking out, it's best to be discreet when you're searching for your escape ladder. Wait until your family is gone, or wait until they are asleep to look for the ladder. Be careful and be quiet.;
, You should prop the ladder under your window earlier in the day while your family isn't home. If the ladder will be seen by your family, this may not be the best method for you to sneak out of your window.There are a few different types of ladders – extension ladders or tall step ladders are probably best for this type of scenario.
Make sure that the ladder is long enough to reach up to your second story window., Having a second person to assist you when climbing a ladder is always a good safety precaution. However, if you don't have anyone to sneak out with you, you can always use a sandbag, or something else heavy, to secure the bottom of the ladder in place.If you have a friend helping you sneak out, your friend could also bring the ladder to your window. This would eliminate you needing to set up the ladder beforehand.

, Open your window and remove the screen. Leave the screen in your bedroom so that you can put it back on when you sneak back in. (Screens can usually be popped out fairly easily). Feet first, carefully and quietly climb out of your window, and place your feet on the top of the ladder. Once you feel like you're secure, climb all the way down the ladder.

If you cannot find a rope in your house, go to a hardware store.

, Take a few bedsheets (roughly 3-4) that, tied together, will reach from your bedroom to the ground. Take your bed sheets one at a time, and twist each one tightly, length wise. Then, tie a few knots in each sheet, and tie the sheets together. Double knot each knot tightly so that your sheet rope will not break., This can be a heavy bed frame, the foot of a sturdy desk or bookcase, etc. Whatever you tie your rope to, make sure it is something that cannot be moved by your weight. Double knot the rope when you tie it to your sturdy piece of furniture.


The object you're tying your rope to should weigh substantially more than you in order to hold your weight. To see if an object will hold your weight, try moving it with all of your strength. If you can't get it to budge, it should most likely be able to hold your weight.

, Open your window and remove the window screen if your window has one. Toss the rope out of your window so that it reaches down to the ground.

Using these house features will allow you to sneak out without having to use a rope or risk getting caught while setting up a ladder.

, The second story of your house has multiple windows. Choose the best window to climb out of by figuring out which one has the easiest escape route.

What are your parents habits? Is there any chance your dad will hop up for a midnight bowl of ice cream and Leno at the exact moment you're trying to sneak out? Before you sneak out, consider:


Your parents' bedtime and sleep habits
Your travel plan
What to blend in with, and how to blend in
Where you'll meet up with your friends
Your route out of the house
Your route out of the neighborhood
Animals
Back-up plans and excuses;
, Giving some thought to your clothes ahead of time can save you some grief later. Say your parents wake up and you come in wearing your party clothes. Oops. It'll be hard to pawn off a ""Oh, I just went for a walk"" excuse. Anticipate the worst case scenario and prepare for it.


Wear bedclothes over your regular clothes. Make sure your parents see that you're dressed for sleeping.
Take off your bedclothes when you get outside. Stash them somewhere close-by, or in your car, or stuff them somewhere your parents won't look, like the mailbox.
Before you sneak back in, change your clothes. If your parents happen to be up, or awaken when you enter, you'll be able to use a quick-excuse more easily if it looks like you've been sleeping recently.
If you are just sneaking out to hang with friends, and have no specific clothing to wear, consider where you will be, and how to blend in. Although many people think black is a good color, it is not.
Black - As mentioned above, this is not a wise choice for camouflage, as most shadows are not black.
DARK blues or purples - A better choice for blending in. Most shadows tend to be darker shades of blue and/or purple.
Green - A good option for blending in with trees, bushes, and weeds.
Sand/khaki - Better for staying hidden in sandy environments.
Grey - A good choice of camouflage for rocky terrains.
Brown - Better for woody areas. Not necessarily for hiding IN trees, but for areas where the trees have barely any leaves on the lowers parts of the trunk.

, Presumably you're sneaking out to meet up with friends, head to a party, or hang with your sweetheart. Make sure your plans are the same and you're not going to sneak out and find yourself alone. Keep up via text or IM and plan a convenient meeting place for everyone.


Make sure that the location you pick isn't somewhere you're going to get caught. If a snoopy neighbor sees a bunch of pre-teens congregating in the Pizza Hut parking lot and recognizes your friend, you might be one step closer to getting caught.
Think like a ninja. Aim for dark areas, or try to get picked up in a car far a couple blocks away from where you live. Stay out of sight and you won't get caught.

, If you have a dog or excitable cats, or even birds that get to chirping when you're around, how are you going to negotiate them? Dogs in particular are a problem because they have super-ears and noses. It's very difficult to get past a dog, even one who's sound asleep.


Consider coming up with a good excuse for the dog to sleep in your parents room, or another distant wing of the house where you won't be sneaking through: ""Buster keeps crawling up on my bed and bothering me in the night. Do you care if I close him in your room tonight? I don't like closing my door, because it creeps me out.""

, In ""Escape from Alcatraz,"" Clint Eastwood makes a great-looking fake head. While you probably don't need to take it that far, it's a good idea to stuff some clothes or blankets under your covers to make it look like you're right there, sawing logs. You'll be better off if your mom decides to check up on you in the night.

, A good method when you're first sneaking out is to hit up the bathroom and use it as you normally would. Flush the toilet, run the water, and shuffle back and forth to the bathroom as if you were just doing your thing. Then make a break for it, slowly.


If someone hears something, they'll next hear your bathroom routine and drift slowly back to sleep. It's a familiar sound. Then they'll be comfortably sleeping by the time you're at the back door.
Just don't overdo this step. If a parent heard the toilet flush and you walking back and forth every 5 seconds, they might come to check up on you.

, Take your shoes off and get your sneak on. In general, you'll want to move extremely slowly through your house, especially if you have to sneak past your parents for any reason, or deal with any excitable pets who'll make a big commotion.


In general, leave the lights off. If you've got to negotiate a particularly cluttered room, or one with lots of edgy furniture, you might consider flipping it on for a second to get your bearings. As long as it isn't visible from your parents' room, you'll be fine. Get the layout, then shut them back off.

, For floorboards, pause as soon as you hear a significant squeak. They're hard to avoid, but a single squeak every thirty seconds won't rouse anyone.


As for the door, it's usually best to do more like ripping off a Band-Aid. Don't let it squeak eternally, open it only as far as needed to squeeze out and close it almost all the way. Turn it to pull back the lock and push it slowly and gently into place. Then release the handle. Continue being quiet as you walk around the outside, being especially wary of gravel.
If you're driving, you need to be extra cautious. Back your car out of the driveway in neutral and wait to start it until you're somewhere up or down the street. Leave your door open a crack until you get your car started. In the middle of the night, car sounds carry.

, The easiest way to get back in will be by leaving the door unlocked and slipping back in without having to use keys. If, by some chance, one of your parents gets up in the middle of the night to get a drink of water and checks the doors, you might find yourself locked out if you don't have a key.


Leaving windows open can be somewhat sticky, as the noise is conspicuous. You might consider unlocking one as an emergency, if you don't have access to a key. Crawling in through a window without making any noise is a difficult proposition, though.

, It's very unlikely you will get caught sneaking out in the first place, however, sneaking IN is a whole different story. Use extreme caution when you're returning to your house, especially if you have a dog.


Survey the house before you enter. Are any lights on? Do people seem to be up? If the answer is yes, start getting an airtight alibi together, or booking a trip to Mexico.
Slip back into your pajamas to give any possible alibis more credibility. If you try to say that you just went out for a walk, it'll be more believable.

, If you make it as far as the kitchen before your dad comes bounding in demanding to know what you're doing, it's probably best to take your loss and give it up. Make an easy excuse, like: ""Just getting water. I'm tired. Goodnight."" It might be temping to try to out-wait him, but you're asking for more trouble that way. Save it for another night.

, Worst case scenario: You step back in the house at 4am and your parents are both awake, sitting up and looking angry. What are you going to say? Some possibilities:


""Steve called because he needed picked up from a party and was really upset. He's going through some stuff. I didn't want to wake you guys up, but I just wanted to do the right thing. Sorry.""
""I can't sleep, so I texted (a neighbor) and we just took a walk around the neighborhood and got to talking. She's kind of upset, so I didn't feel like I could ditch her. I think I'm going to make some warm milk. I'm exhausted.""
""It's such a nice night, I went out to look at the stars. Guess I fell asleep.""
Alternatively, you could just own up to it and take your licks: ""I met up with some friends. We just hung out for a while. I'm sorry. I won't do it again.""
Avoid stupid excuses like, ""I don't know what happened, I just woke up here!"" Far-fetched excuses won't get you anywhere. Your parents aren't idiots.

, What if you get to the meeting place and nobody is there? What if you end up walking several miles and need picked up after getting ditched? What if you get picked up by the cops for a broken curfew? These aren't things mean to scare you, but you need to think ahead of time about what you might do if you end up in a tight spot because you're better safe than sorry. That way, you'll be able to relax and have fun.


Do you have older cousins to call, or could you get away with calling a friend's parents? Think about your options and clear it with them ahead of time. Let them know you might need them before you find yourself outside and in need of a favor.

, If your parents get suspicious and want to check up on what you did last night, make sure that according to your phone you were in bed when they thought you were. Delete relevant texts, photos, and other information that might incriminate your night out. Don't text about it, don't tweet about it, don't update your Facebook status with, ""Snuck out last night!!1!"" Mum's the word.

, Once you're in and safe, make sure you straighten everything to basically the same place where it originally was. Especially if your parents are very tidy people, you'll want to make sure you don't leave your shoes or keys in a conspicuous place where they'll notice them.

, If you spend all night cavorting around, it might raise suspicion if you need to sleep until 2 in the afternoon. Set your alarm for the late-side of a regular wake-up time and try to get as much sleep as possible. Take a nap later in the day to catch up if you must.

If you haven't already eaten your prize, retire to your HQ and feast.",How to Steal Cookies from the Jar," Is anyone around? Will anyone witness the crime you're about to commit? If you are sure the coast is clear, then get ready to make your move. If you think you will be seen, wait until there is no one in the vicinity. Now proceed to the next step.;
, How hungry are you? How many cookies do you intend to steal? You need to know this before you get your hand in the jar; if you take two, stuff them in your mouth and then realise you really wanted three, you will have to risk your life by sneaking into the kitchen again. Not recommended!

, Creep carefully and quietly across the kitchen. If you have a carpet, proceed to step 4 now. If you have wooden floors, make sure you learn which floorboards creak and which ones are safe. If you make a mistake and tread on a creaky one, make a quick dash back to your HQ and wait to see if anyone noticed. If you are caught in the act, make a speedy excuse and retire to your bedroom. You have failed the mission.

, If your cookie jar is on a high shelf, reach up carefully to take the jar down and place it on the side.

Decide what item you want to get into your room.,
Look at the size of your item, and listen to the sound.,
Know when you're sneaking.",How to Sneak Things Into Your Room Successfully," It could be a game, snack, candy, money, anything you want.
;
, If it's small enough, you can hide it under your armpit, and sneak it into your room. If it's bigger, than get a purse or bag (for girls) to hide it in. Or you can hide it in the pockets of a hoodie. If it's loud or crinkly, like a bag of potato chips, be careful with it so you don't make a lot of noise. That'll give you away.

, In my opinion, the best time to sneak is at night. (Although you have to be very quiet.) Here are instructions on how to sneak at what time.


Sneaking at night. (This one's going to be kind of long.)If you're going to sneak at night, go to your room at your regular time, but don't go to sleep yet. You might want to put a dark, skin tight outfit on, so you blend in with the shadows, and so you don't make much noise when your legs or any other things scrape together. Avoid wearing black though, midnight blue is the best color for this. Also put on some good footwear. If you have wood or tiled flooring, the best thing to wear is socks. For carpets, just your bare feet. Be quiet, and stay awake until you stop hearing noises like walking, talking, doors opening / closing, etc. If someone in your house snores, wait until they do, because it means they're in a very deep sleep. Wait 'till about 10 minutes after you think everyone's asleep, now it's go time. QUIETLY and slowly open your door, and make sure it doesn't squeak. If it does, close the door immediately, but don't slam it. Wait for a minute or two, and try again. To make sure it doesn't squeak, pull up while holding on to the knob, that takes some pressure off of the hinges. Once you're out, stay close to the edge of the wall. The floor is more stable there, and creaks a lot less. Do the same while going down the stairs. When going to the thing that you want to get into your room, be very stealthy. You need to bend your knees, and arch your back for the best position. Take big steps so you don't drag your feet. When you step, go from your heel to the balls of your feet. (It's right below your toes.) If you see or hear someone get up or come near you, quickly but quietly, HIDE. NOW. When you get in your hiding spot, hold perfectly still, and breath through nose, slowly. Wait 'till the person goes away, then wait a minute to get back out. If they see you, say you wanted a cup of water, or you needed to use the bathroom or something of that nature. As quickly as you can, get your item, and quickly get back to your room using the same tactics you used to get down there. Then you're done!
Sneaking in the day. Just walk to the thing you want, and put it in your bag / purse / hoodie, and make sure nobody sees you. If there's a door in the room that you're in, then close it before getting the item. Then walk out and go to your room, but act like you normally do. If you're usually loud and funny, you probably shouldn't walk into room being completely silent, or people will start getting suspicious. If you hide the thing in your armpit, make sure you don't walk weird, or people will notice. Get the item to your room and you're done!

Make a schedule.,
Don't rush going to bed.,
After you let them think you are in bed, quietly get up and shut the door and all lights, if they aren't already.,
Wait until you know for sure that your parents are asleep.,
If your parents go to bed at 10, wait until at least 10:30 to start your work, or if they go to bed at 10:30, wait until at least 11:00, etc.,
Be very quiet.,
Get right to work.,
Work straight through until you have finished any and all book research.

,
Now write your paper if you haven't got any more online research to do.,
Keep measuring your time.,
Go to bed.",How to Stay Up Late at Night Writing a Paper Without Your Parents Knowing," Earlier in the day, plan what you're going to do that night. Don't stay up so late unless it really is due tomorrow, because you could just do some now and the rest tomorrow afternoon.;
, Get all ready for bed, and be sure to have all your books and electronics with you. Include a snack and water in case you might get hungry later, and a flashlight if you might need to get up or see something in your room while in the dark. If your parents see the pile of stuff you have, then just tell them you're getting your backpack ready for school in the morning. Be sure to do normal things, like wait in your room reading until your parents come in and check on you and get you in bed.

, It might be risky, but if you can afford to go and check if your parents lights are on, then this will help with the next step.

,


Most parents take about half an hour to fall asleep, depending on if they talk a lot or are reading for a while

, Go back to bed and stare at the clock until it is the appropriate time.

, Get out your books first if you have research to do, as this is the hardest to do later on at night. Get fully under your covers if you are able to, otherwise just put the lower half of your body under your covers.


Only get out what books you need, to conserve space and time.

, Dilly-dallying is not acceptable.


If you are used to working with music, and your parents are used to you sleeping with an appropriate sleep music station, then go to a music app or website without ads, because if it has ads it can get loud at times.

,, If you do, do that first.

, Make sure to frequently check how long it's been since your parents went to bed:


An hour and a half after they go to bed is safe study time. They are now in REM sleep, and should fall immediately asleep without waking up yet or anything.
About two hours after they go to bed is when it gets nerve-wracking, because they are more likely to wake up and have to go to the bathroom or worse, go check on you. If you are still up doing homework at that time, then you should be extremely careful, or put everything away and lie down until the next time period.
The last good study period is 5 or less hours before you have to get up. For example, if your parents initially went to bed at 10, then you started at 10:30, then worked through until midnight, waited for about half an hour, then kept going at 1 until you were done.
Don't stay up later than 2 if you must get up at 6. Four hours of sleep is only half the daily allotment you need, plus nothing good happens after midnight, so imagine how bad your work is after two! Plus, your parents might get up again around 2-3 am to check on you, go to the bathroom, etc.

, You have successfully worked through a paper quietly and completely, and done your best in only a few hours. Don't forget to set your alarm or something if you need to.

Show you care.,
Be loving and kind.,
Spend time with your parents.",How to Make Your Parents Love You for Who You Are1," If you are wanting your parents to love you unconditionally, then try to show them the same love and support. While some families are more affectionate than others, it is important to express your love and caring in ways that work for you and your parents.Give hugs. Give Kisses. Do what feels comfortable for you.
Say, ""I love you."" Use other words of appreciation such as, ""Thank you so much,"" or, ""You're awesome.""
Help them with things that need to be done, such as chores or running errands. Try to do what you can to make them feel appreciated through your actions.
Understand that some days your parents will reciprocate and other days they may not. Avoid feeling let down if they don't reciprocate sometimes. Avoid seeing yourself to blame.;
, Treat others as you would like to be treated. While your parents may not always follow this, avoid becoming upset, mean, or resentful of them. Focus on being kind to yourself, and in turn being kind to them and others.The more kindness and love you show, the more likely they are to be appreciated and loved you.
Accept that they cannot always show the love that you expect. Be open to different ways of receiving love and respect. For example, your dad may not seem to be loving, yet he attends your school events and makes dinner almost every night for you and your family.
Think about how ""kindness"" and ""love"" are shown in different ways for different people. Ways to show caring include acts of service (fixing the car, doing the dishes); through touch (hugging, kissing, putting your arm around them); words of affirmation (giving compliments, telling them you appreciate them); spending quality time together; giving thoughtful gifts.

, While you may spend a lot of time in the same place, how much of this is quality, one-on-one time together with your parents? Think about how your parents are more likely to show they love and care about you if you find ways to connect rather than argue. Consider these activities as a way to spend more time:Board games, charades, or other social activities
Interactive games on the computer or video games that you both can enjoy
Playing outside in the backyard, at a park, or in nature

Pick a certain day of the week or time of the day when both you and she are free, like Sundays or Thursday nights. It's good to do it the same day and time so you and she can remember when your special time together is, and you will be more likely to be free. Summer is a great time to do things together because your daughter will likely be out of school. If you are still working in summer, try to find time on the weekends to spend with your daughter. Ask for fewer hours at work, if you have to. Aim for at least an hour or two a day to spend with your daughter. Pick a time when your daughter is free, as well as you. Ask her, ""Do you want to do something on ________ night?"" Or, ask her when she is free, you'll be sure to find sometime. However, on weeknights, your child will probably be quite busy with her schoolwork. Respect that, and find a different time to spend together.;
, Knowing what kinds of activities your daughter enjoys will help greatly when you spend time together because you'll know what to do and where to go. Observe your child sometimes, but not too often, to see what they are doing. They might be on the computer, TV, drawing, reading, or playing outside. Look more into what she is doing, though, to get more clues into what she likes. If she is reading, ask her what she is reading. If she is watching TV, ask her what she is watching, and if she is on the computer or outside, ask her what she is playing. You'll get a better feel for what she likes, and when you ask, she'll feel glad that you are interested in what she is doing. Her interests may be very different from yours, but don't try to change what she likes and dislikes.


Try to learn more about your daughter's interests yourself, and do things relating to those activities. If she likes reading, for example, read together at home or spend an afternoon at the library. If she likes soccer, play a game or two in your backyard or the park. If your daughter likes painting or drawing, take her to an art museum.

, If there's one thing that will build girls' relationships, it's shopping. You'll have a chance to talk and find more about your daughter's interests while getting new things. Take her with you to the grocery store to help you pick out dinner or delicious snacks. Have her put some items in the cart that she likes, and help decide what drinks to buy. If your daughter loves to read, go to a local bookstore and look for some books together. Or, go to a shopping mall. Look for clothes and shoes. You could also have her help you pick out clothes for yourself. She'll love to be your ""fashion consultant"", especially if she's into fashion. You can also go to a toy store if your daughter is younger.


Let her go by her style. When shopping for clothes, shoes, books, or anything, especially with teens, let your daughter pick what she likes. She's just expressing herself and being herself, she is her own person. You could always ask, ""Do you like this?"", but don't force her to buy and wear something she doesn't really like. Shop at a store your daughter really enjoys so she'll be more likely to find something she likes.

, If you don't want to shop, there are still plenty of options. Some are the pool, park, beach, restaurant, museum, or amusement park. Now that you know your daughter's interests, you can start to know where she might want to go. Like stated before, pick somewhere that she would like. Take your baseball lover to her favorite team's game, or an artist to the arts and crafts store. Another important factor is the weather. Check online, on TV, or in the newspaper for details on the weather. Save outdoor activities like theme parks and the pool for sunny days. If it's winter, go to a cafe for some hot chocolate or make a snowman. You can always go in your backyard and play with your daughter, no matter the weather. Make a snow fort, have a snowball fight, make snow angels, or make a snowman. If your daughter likes sports, go skiing, sledding, or snowboarding. And don't fret if it's raining. Go to a movie theater, a restaurant, an indoor pool, the library, museum, really anywhere indoors.

, This is a great activity if it's raining out. Watching movies can also really bring you closer. Look through your movies together and find one that you and your daughter want to watch. Make sure it is appropriate for her age! Funny family movies are good for all ages and will always make you and her smile. There are still other choices, though. Some movies you and your daughter might like are Pretty in Pink, Drop Dead Fred, and My Girl. If you don't have good movies at home, go to a theater and see one. Another good choice is to watch TV. You can find a TV show that the both of you would like, and make sure you have time to watch it. It will most likely come on at the same time every day, which will be good for your schedule. If neither of you are home at the time, record the TV show.

, As a mom, it's important that you should support your daughter in her education. Always try to help her with homework if she asks for it. Don't give her the answer, help her. For example, if she is struggling on a math problem, don't just say ""32"". Say, ""You have to ________"" while still having her interact. Go through the steps with her, for example, ""Then you multiply. What is 9 times 13?"" so she'll know what to do next time. Also try to help her if she doesn't ask for it, but you get a hint that she needs help. If she's been doing homework for a long time, ask her if she needs any help she can always come to you. Same with if your daughter got a poor grade on a test.


Make learning fun. Turn studying for a spelling or vocab test into a game of Jeopardy. Or, have your daughter be the teacher, teaching you about it.
Study with her. There might be an important test coming up, so it's your job to help her study. She'll probably tell you what to do e.g. Give me the word and I'll say the definition.

, Another way to interact with your daughter is through playing a great game. Have a game night with the two of you on a certain day, or just ask her if she'd like to play a game. Some good family games you might want to play are Sorry, Monopoly, Life, Scrabble, Taboo, and Snakes and Ladders, but you could really play any game. Card games are also fun. Play Bluff, War, Go Fish, or UNO if you have a spare deck.

, Another fun way for the two of you to bond is through cooking or baking. It's also a good way to start teaching them how to cook if they are older. Bring out some cookbooks and look through them with your daughter to see what to make. You can make cookies, a cake, cupcakes, cookies, brownies, or any dessert. You could also make your own bread or bagels, make a tart, crisp, smoothies, soup, stew, or even your own ice cream!


Remember that you are cooking together. Let your daughter do some things, like cracking eggs, helping whisk the batter, pouring liquids, and decorating. Expect things to not be done perfectly – this is how children and teens learn. However, do not let her use the oven until you believe she is mature and responsible enough to deal with working around heat on her own (by the same token, don't mollycoddle her forever – children should be able to deal with cooking with heat around the age of 11 or 12).

, Of course, your daughter already knows that you love her, but do you really show it? Although playing a game or watching TV is spending time together, is it really quality special time? You may not know how to do this, but it's the little things that count. Go for a nice walk together, talk, and enjoy the nature. Cheer her up on a bad day with a hug or a small gift, like a book or a stuffed animal. Give encouraging messages often, like ""You can do it"", ""I believe in you"", or ""You are a very talented artist/swimmer/soccer player!"". Be sure to praise her efforts above all, as it is important to let her know that it is in the trying and the doing, including learning to deal with failure, that she is going to succeed in life. With support from you, she'll be left with a positive attitude. Laugh and smile with her.

, It's important for your daughter to know that she can always come and talk to you if she needs anything. When you talk to your daughter, make sure that you look at her, and she does the same. Tell her, ""I need you to listen"" but in a calm, friendly way. Try to stay short and sweet, or your daughter will get bored, not focus, and think that they are in trouble or being lectured. Leave the key point for the first sentence, and keep it simple, using non-confusing and/or shorter words. You should also occasionally talk casually. When the two of you talk, it shouldn't all be serious. Talk about school e.g. What's going on in school? How was school today? But, you should also go deeper than that. Ask her about her future, sports, or hobbies.

, Not only should your daughter listen to you, but you must listen as well. If you don't, she'll think it's okay to not pay attention– also be aware that children know when their parent isn't truly listening and it isn't a pleasant feeling because it is dis-empowering. To listen, stop what you are doing to look at her. Have good eye contact with each other so you can listen. To show that you are listening, ask her questions that you have. Also, paraphrase. Paraphrasing is putting something in your own words. Say, for example, ""So you're saying _______"" or ""You mean that ________?"" so you can clarify what your daughter just said to you.


Listen to what she wants to do. For example, if your daughter wants to go to a movie, don't just say ""No"" right away. See what you can do; look at what movies are playing, or ask her what movie she wants to see. You might not want to do it, but once in a while you should let your daughter get her way.

, You need to always be there, whether it's through presence at an important event, advice, or by words of encouragement. If there is a sports, musical, school, or any important event that your daughter wants you to attend, really try to see if you can go. If not, see why. Try to cancel whatever it is that's on the same day, but some things you absolutely cannot miss, so be sure to tell your daughter. But it's okay if you can't actually be present at an event. There are lots of more ways to be there for your daughter.


Offer help. If you see your daughter struggling in anything, like school, sports, or an instrument, help her. Listen to her play her flute, contact the teacher or help with her schoolwork, or play basketball with her.

Be encouraging. It may be hard for her to do something, so you must cheer her on and use encouraging words and actions. Say ""good job"" when you truly mean it, and maybe get her a gift that says ""way to go!"", such as a book.
Compliment her. Say, for instance, ""That's a nice shirt"" or ""I like what you did to your room"".

, This is another form of encouragement, and it will make your daughter feel so happy inside when you recognize her talents. Ask her if she would like to try out for a school play, strings solo, or softball team inside or outside of school (but don't be forceful), and she might agree. See if you can get her into a class or team, too. Another thing to do is to participate in the activity she's trying out elsewhere. Play a game or soccer, hold a concert at home, or have her teach you some dance moves. It will make her feel great, you'll learn something new, and the two of you will bond more.

, This may go without saying, but your kindness has a huge impact on your relationship together. Don't yell at her right away when things don't go accordingly. Instead, remain calm and nice when explaining that she has done something you don't like or don't want her to do again. Try saying, ""I want you to do this"" or ""please do this"" instead of ""do this"" or ""do this now"". She's more likely to do what you say, anyway, if you address her kindly. Moreover, give real reasons, not just ""because I said so."" She will be more responsive if she realizes there are dangers, social pressure or poor health outcomes etc. likely to occur as a result of certain choices she makes. Also, hug and kiss her before she goes to bed, or in the morning before she leaves– always end everything on a good note.


Respect her. She is an individual, and you must remember that. There may be some things about your daughter that you may not quite agree with or understand, but still be respectful; she can have her own opinion.

, It may be hard to do this, but you have to be trusting. The reason why you may not trust your daughter is because she might lie often. This may be because you lie. She'll think it's ok to lie if you do, so it's time to start being a good role model for her (and for everyone else). Be honest yourself; keep promises, and don't break them. However, if something comes up, be sure to tell her that. Say the reason, as she probably would be wondering. When you see your daughter do something responsible, like homework or band practicing, or an A on a test, you can trust her more.


Share your feelings. Tell your daughter that she can always come to you if she needs to, and that she should be honest. You should share your feelings with her as well. Tell your daughter how you really feel about something, and sometimes, you can ask her for advice. Also ask her if anything is wrong and how her day was

Accept your responsibilities.,
Manage your emotions.,
Be honest and trusting.,
Expect imperfection and learn from your mistakes.,
Learn to solve problems yourself.,
Know when to ask for help.",How to Be a Good Child1," It is easy to say that a good child listens to her parents (and other authority figures) and does what she is told. While this is normally true, it is more important that children learn to take responsibility for what they need to do. As a child who strives to be your best, you need to accept that there are things you have to do, for the benefit of yourself and others.The goal of being a good child isn’t really about giving your parents a little less grief (although they will welcome that). Good children learn qualities that will help them become happy, successful, “good” adults.
For example, you need to take responsibility for doing your homework and completing your chores, without constant reminders or resistance. This will help you to become more self-motivated, self-sufficient, and successful in work and life as an adult.;
, Every one of us (including adults) sometimes gets angry, frustrated, whiny, or stressed out. There is no way to deny or avoid these emotions, and it would be unhealthy to do so anyway. However, you can work on recognizing and managing your emotions more effectively.Learning to control anger is one of the most important lessons for children. When you feel anger welling up, simple steps like taking deep breaths, in the nose and out the mouth, and counting to five can help you calm and contain it. Then, you can think more clearly about what caused the anger and what you can do differently next time to manage it.Uncontrolled anger isn't always the cause of bad behavior, though. Sometimes kids act out when they are upset, sad, confused, or lonely. You might experience these emotions if you've been bullied in school, left out of a group activity, or rejected by a friend. When you feel down, talk to an adult you trust. If you can talk to your parents about your emotions, it can improve your relationship with them. There is no shame in seeking help from a counselor or other expert if you need it, though.

, “Good boys and girls tell the truth.” You may have heard this said to you, and it is usually true. But the bigger picture is that honesty is a key part of building relationships based on trust. This will benefit you as a child and as an adult.Healthy relationships require trust, and trust is built on honesty. You may want to lie to your parents in order to avoid punishment or avoid hurting their feelings. This usually doesn't work, though, and it will get in the way of developing a more mature relationship with them.
No matter how upset parents may become when hearing the truth — you failed a test because you didn’t study, stole a candy bar from the store, made fun of a vulnerable classmate, etc. — they will also feel some pride in your choice to be honest. It is an important sign of growth and trust.

, Even the best kids make plenty of mistakes. It is part of growing up, and simply of being human. The important thing is what you do with your imperfections. Learning from mistakes is a sign of maturity and is sure to be appreciated by your parents.If you did poorly on a big test because of a lack of preparation, are you ready to accept the importance of studying? If you were grounded for talking back to your mother in public, do you now understand the importance of showing respect? When a thoughtful, maturing child makes such mistakes, she learns from them and moves forward better off for it.
Even the most demanding parents will accept some mistakes from their children, especially if they are not repeated mistakes. All parents love seeing evidence of growth and maturity in their children. Learning from a mistake instead of repeating it is always a positive sign.

, Children who are seen as ""bad"" because of bad behavior often have trouble dealing with their problems in the proper way. Confusion and frustration often lead to bad decisions. But being able to recognize and solve problems puts you on a path toward self-reliance and confidence.

Remember how proud your parents were when you put a puzzle together by yourself, or wrote your own name? Even when you learned to unlatch the kitchen cabinet and made a giant mess everywhere, there was probably some pride mixed in, because parents know the importance of self-reliance and problem solving skills in the adult world.For kids, problems often result from a conflict with another kid. For a kid-friendly guide to conflict resolution, consider visiting http://www.cyh.com/HealthTopics/HealthTopicDetailsKids.aspx?p=335&np=287&id=1521. Its problem-solving steps include:

Understand. Let each person involved clearly express the problem as they see it.
Avoid making things worse. Don't scream, insult, or take physical action against the other kid(s), no matter how upset you are. Stay calm and work through the problem.
Work together. Explain how you feel about the conflict by saying something like ""I feel angry when ..."" or ""I need to feel ..."". Then listen carefully while the other children involved speak.
Find the solution. Brainstorm different possible solutions together, and choose the one that best meets the needs of everyone involved.



, As we just discussed, learning to recognize and solve problems yourself is an important skill for kids (and adults). But, just as important is being able to recognize and accept when you need help dealing with a problem.It doesn't help you to ""quit"" on your math homework without trying to figure it out yourself. But it is also not useful to refuse to ask for help when you need it because you insist on doing everything yourself.
No child (or adult) can solve every problem herself. Your parents want to give you assistance when you need it, and will see your willingness to ask as a positive sign. Don’t expect them to solve every problem for you, though — that is a sign of immaturity.
How do you know when to keep trying to solve a problem yourself, and when to ask for help? There is no secret formula; you have to trust yourself to make the decision. Have you given the problem your best effort? Are you out of ideas for how to deal with it? If so, then it is probably time to ask for assistance.

Have a quiet conversation with your parents.,
Share your feelings.,
Avoid being angry, upset, or confrontational.,
Set boundaries with your parents.,
Remind your parents that not everyone is the same as them.",How to Make Your Parents Love You for Who You Are2," Open up to your parents about who you are. Find a time that is less stressful for them and you. Consider finding a way to make it a private conversation away from your other family members.


Having a one-on-one conversation that is deeper and more meaningful may help you to trust them and to feel loved by them.
Consider timing. Identify times in the evenings or on the weekends when you and your parents may have more time to really talk about what's on your mind.
Avoid giving up on them if a calm and loving conversation doesn't go as smoothly as you had hoped the first time.

, Be assertive about who you are. Be confident about what matters most to you in life. Express what you love. Express what bothers you. Avoid dismissing your feelings or repressing them because your parents may have a different view.When you're feeling down or struggling with something, be willing to ask for help. Ask them to provide reassurance.
You may need to state it outright, rather than assuming they'll ""know"" what to do. For example, let's say you're having a difficult time with your friend, you could state to your parents that you're going through a difficult time, and then say, ""I could use some reassurance and support right now."" While it may feel awkward at first, it will make clear what your needs are.

, When you feel yourself getting upset with your parents, avoid trying to confront them in anger. You cannot force someone to love you for who you are through your anger. If you are having difficulty talking to your parents without getting upset, then consider doing the following:Find a place that makes you feel calm. Try to remove your negative thinking about yourself and others in this space.
Take a deep breath. Use breathing exercises. Consider meditation or praying.
Focus your mind on letting go of hate, anger, and resentment. Focus instead on loving you. Write out your feelings in a journal. Consider using art such as drawing or painting as a way to release your frustrations.
Communicate with your parents when you are better able to share your feelings in a calm way.

, If your parents will not love and accept you for whatever reason, you can at least set boundaries about what is acceptable to say to you and how you expect them to treat you. Let them know what you will not accept in your relationship with them and what will happen if they violate your boundaries.


Use ""I"" language when communicating your boundaries. Using ""you"" language can cause people to become defensive and sounds blaming. Do not say, ""You always tear down my accomplishments and my work. You're so unsupportive and such a bully!""
Instead, you might say, ""Mom, I know you don't agree with my chosen profession, but I feel hurt when you say it isn't a respectable career. From now on please keep your comments about my job to yourself. If you continue, I'm going to stop coming to Sunday dinners.""

, While your parents may have certain expectations of who you should be, and what you should become, help them to remember each person has their own interests, preferences, and identity. This may be very difficult for some parents to accept, but it is important to express how you are your own person.


Tell them that you will treat their interests, preferences, and beliefs with respect, and that you hope they will do the same. Stay true to your word, and show them that you can respect their differences.
Recognize that your parents may have certain backgrounds or values that reflect how they act and what they say.
Think about what matters to you. If you are seeking their love and respect, then tell them, ""Despite our differences, I hope that you can love and respect me.""

Accept that you cannot control your parents' behavior.,
Seek support from other adults or older family members.,
Consider talking with a counselor.,
Don't force yourself to change if it feels wrong.",How to Make Your Parents Love You for Who You Are3," You cannot force them to love and accept you. While you may have an ideal of what you want your parent-child relationship to be, your parents' behaviors are not likely to change overnight. Learn to let go of what you cannot control.Focus on accepting and loving yourself. Focus on what you can do to better. While this may not change your parents, it will help you to find strength in yourself.
Believe in yourself.

, If you feel like your parents are not able to understand who you are, reach out to other family members such as aunts, uncles, or grandparents. Consider finding other adults in your neighborhood or through your school. Find ways to talk with them openly and honestly about yourself and what you're feeling. Through the support of other adults and family, you may find healthier ways to deal with your parents. Consider asking them for advice about how to handle feeling unappreciated. Consider having them talk with your parents directly.
If your parents appear to be unresponsive to your needs, ask to spend more time with family or other adults that appreciate, love, and respect you.

, Sometimes you may feel like opening up to your family or others around you is too difficult, and talking to a counselor may help you to overcome your anger, anxiety, sadness, or fear related to your parents. Counselors can help to identify what needs are not being met, and help you find ways to heal.


Consider talking with a school counselor or asking your school about counseling resources in your area.
Discuss with a counselor about family counseling options so that you can get your parents involved in this process. Family therapy could include one or more of your parents in a counseling session. These types of session focus on how to communicate more effectively.

, You can only do what feels right to you. If your parents are pressuring you to do something that you disagree with, consider if they are looking out for you, or simply have their own interests at heart.


For example, let's say your parents think that if you're a girl, then you need to wear dresses and look pretty when out in public or with your parents' friends. You may prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt. Explain to them that you dress in a way that feels right and comfortable for you, and that you wish them to respect that.
Be true to who you are. And know that you're not alone.

Store maxi pads and tampons in your makeup bag.",How to Sneak Tampons and Pads Into the Bathroom," This makes sneaking your stash into the bathroom more convenient based on where you are and who you’re with. For example, if spending the day at school or work, store tampons and pads in your purse, desk, backpack, pencil case, lunch box, and car., This tricks people into thinking you’re looking for items other than feminine products. For example, if tampons are stored in your purse, rummage in your bag and grab your mobile phone or lip balm at the same time.

, Wait until others are distracted and paying attention to something else before grabbing pads and tampons from your stash. For example, if watching television with friends, wait until commercial breaks are over before heading to your stash.

, People are less likely to pay attention to what you’re doing if you act calm and natural, while being fidgety, nervous, and frantic can make you look suspicious and sneaky., Most popular tampon and pad brands offer products with quiet, easy-to-open wrappers so you can be discreet on the go.

, Most tampon brands offer compact versions, which are full-size tampons wrapped in a way that makes them smaller for storage and hiding., When reaching for your stash, quickly slip a pad or tampon up your shirt sleeve. This discreet move takes just seconds, and effectively hides tampons and pads of all sizes.

, Boots are an ideal hiding place since they’re roomier than most shoe styles. Before heading to the bathroom, discreetly bend down to adjust your boot or sock, and slip a pad or tampon into its side.

, If using a notebook or textbook, slip a maxi pad into the center of the book and return to your desk or locker before heading to the bathroom.

, This hiding place is most effective if you’re going straight to the restroom, and won’t affect the shape or function of your pad., Back pockets on your pants and jeans are ideal for hiding maxi pads and liners, while front pockets are more effective at hiding tampons.

, Given your clothing isn’t too loose, the waistbands of shorts, skirts, and pants keep pads and tampons snug and secure on your way to the restroom., Pads and tampons resemble common makeup items such as compact mirrors, powder, mascara, and lipstick. Take your makeup bag with you to the bathroom and pretend to retouch makeup.

Treat others like you want to be treated.,
Learn to recognize how other people are feeling.,
Show concern and compassion.,
Offer gratitude to those who help you.",How to Be a Good Child2," Many people call this the “golden rule,” and it really is a valuable rule to live by. For children, acting toward your parents, friends and family, and other people with this guide in mind demonstrates thoughtfulness and maturity on your part.Before you join in picking on a kid in class, think about how you would feel in his shoes. Or, before throwing a tantrum over a request from your mother to help out with the laundry, consider how you’d feel if you needed a hand and she wouldn’t help you.
Good children treat their parents with respect. They treat other people the same way, which also shows respect for their parents. You can earn respect by first showing it.
Difficult as it may be, this rule applies to how you should treat your little brother (or big sister) as well!

, If you know how other people are feeling and are likely to react, you will have a great advantage in deciding how you should behave in that situation. For instance, if your parents are stressed out about how they are going to pay the bills for the month, it is probably not the best time to ask for a video game or new shoes. Or, if your brother is upset about not making the baseball team, it probably isn’t the best time to rib him about his lack of athletic skills.

You can actually practice ""reading"" people’s emotional states by studying their faces. Go to a public place like a shopping mall, for example, and practice trying to identify how strangers are feeling by their facial expressions.
Identifying how others are feeling is important in order to show empathy, which is at the heart of the first three steps here (treating others as you want to be treated, reading others' emotions, and showing compassion for others). Empathy, however, means more than that you can tell how someone else is feeling, and that you can ""put yourself in their shoes."" It means you value others and their feelings and treat them with respect, even when they see things differently than you., When someone is hurting, or needs a hand, take it upon yourself to do what you can to help. The world can always use more compassionate, helpful people. Why not start when you are still a child?

Part of growing up is learning to expand your “circle of concern.” As a small child, you usually only think of your own needs and wants (a cookie, a new toy, etc.). When you get a bit older, you begin to think more about the feelings and needs of people close to you, like family and friends. Eventually, you should begin to realize that there are people in need all around you.
Think about any little things you can do to help, from raising awareness to volunteering to making changes in your own life. For example, think about the good you can do simply by donating the extra cans and boxes in your kitchen cupboard to a food pantry that helps the less fortunate.
You can show compassion in your daily life by standing up for a kid who is being bullied, and asking him to be your friend (maybe by simply saying ""Do you want to play with me?). Or, you can ask your parents to buy an extra meal at the fast food drive-thru and hand it to the homeless person you drove past on the way to the restaurant. Even the small things you do can have a large impact on someone else's life.

, As you become more aware of how you can help others, you should also become more aware of all the people that help you. Let them know you appreciate all they do for you. This is definitely a “good child” quality, and an important part of maturing into a responsible and happy person.

As a child, you should always start your offers of gratitude with your parents. Take a moment and think about all the things they do for you. Write down a list if you need to. A gift or other token of appreciation will be well-received, but simply offering a “thank you” from time to time will warm your parents’ hearts.
To ""raise the bar"" on your show of gratitude, express exactly why you are giving thanks: ""Thank you, Mom, for always taking the time to help me with my math homework. You have helped me improve my grades, and I appreciate it.""

Treat them as fellow adults.",How to Be a Good Son," One of the best ways to show your parents how much you love them is to simply spend time with them. Though you may feel like you have a lot going on, between school, friends, and your personal life, you should always spend quality time with your parents as often as you can. This can mean having dinner with them every night, having family board game night, watching TV with your folks, or just hanging out around the house instead of running off to hang out with your friends. You’ll never know how much the time you spend with your parents means to them.Moms especially love it when their son will love them.


When you do spend time with them, don’t roll your eyes or act like it’s mandatory. Instead, you should look forward to the special time you have together.
Have routine nights where you spend time together, such as Sundays or Monday evenings, so you don’t have to try to work the time into your busy schedule.;
, Your parents love you and want to know what’s going on in your life. While they may not need to know all of the daily friend drama in your social circle or the ins and outs of the baseball game you saw with your friends, they would love to know what’s on your mind, from your struggles with your studies to any big problems you’re having with your friends. They really do care, and even if they can’t always help, they’d just like to know what’s happening. Your parents will feel upset if they’re completely shut out of your life.


Try to leave your bedroom door open as often as you can, so you welcome your parents in to have a conversation with you when they want to. Don’t make them feel like you want nothing to do with them.
Don’t be afraid to ask for their advice. Believe it or not, your parents were once your age, and they’ve gone through the same struggles that you’re going through. They’ll appreciate that you value their opinions, and you may learn a lot in the process.

, It’s easy to take your parents for granted. After all, there was a time when they did absolutely everything for you, from bathing you to keeping you fed and well-rested. As you grow older, it can feel natural for you to forget the fact that it takes your parents time and effort to take care of you, and you have to remember to thank them for all that they do. Whether you verbally say “thank you” every time your parents do something kind for you, write them thank you cards or letters, call them, or do them favors in return, it’s important to let your parents know how much you appreciate them.Don’t think that it’s pointless for you to write your parents a card or a letter just because you live in the same house. They’ll love the gesture.
When you say “thank you,” look into your parents’ eyes to show that you really mean it and that you’re not just saying it because you feel obligated to say it.

, Your parents may not be incredibly tech savvy and may not know some of the things going on in the modern world. If your mom wants to know how to work her new iPhone or your dad wants to start a Facebook account, be there to help your parents learn how to navigate some of these modern challenges. Try not to laugh at them or make them feel inadequate for not knowing these things, and instead, be there to help them learn new skills, remembering all the times they have taught you how to do something.


Teaching them things will make your relationship feel less one-sided. You won’t feel like you always have to learn from them, and your time together may feel more interesting.
When you do help them, don’t sigh or complain about it, and show them that you’re happy to help out.

, In addition to spending quality time with your parents around the house, you can also show you care by doing a variety of bonding activities with your parents. These can include going fishing, hiking, or camping with your dad, or going for walks, going out to the movies, or having a nice meal with your mother. Don’t think that all son activities have to be done with your father, and make sure you spend an equal amount of time bonding with your mom, whether you’re cooking, walking your dog together, or spending an afternoon at the library with her.Go on a camping trip with your family a few times a year.
Spend the holiday season cooking together.
Do a housework project with your mom or dad, such as tiling floors, glazing furniture, or even building a bookshelf.
Find a TV show that you and your parents can watch and enjoy together and make it part of your weekly routine.
Try volunteering at a local park or library with your parents.
Go to watch your favorite sports team with your mom or dad.

, If you want to be a good son, then you should help keep your parents’ relationship strong (if your parents are still together). Relationships are difficult enough as it is, and you shouldn’t try to drive a wedge between your parents. Accept your parents’ rules as a unified mandate, instead of trying to get the more lenient parents to let you get what you want. Work to keep their relationship strong; if nothing else, it’ll make you happier to see your parents happy together.


If you tell your mom, “But dad says it’s okay!” when she won’t let you do something, then you’re only creating friction between your parents by pitting them against each other.

, You may think that your relationship with your parents is one-sided, and that they should listen to you and your problems and offer advice and then call it a day. In fact, sometimes your parents may also need you to listen to them, whether they’re struggling with one of your siblings or having a difficult time at work or with your grandparents. They may not even have a problem, but may just want to share something interesting that happened at work or something they read. The important thing is that you’re there to listen instead of acting like you’re too busy or only half-listening and checking your phone every five minutes. Give them the time they need to tell you what’s on their mind; they more than deserve it.


When your parents are talking to you, give them your full attention. Don’t shift around on your feet or look longingly towards your bedroom. Don’t ever make them feel like you have better things to do than to talk to them.

, You may have a set list of chores to do or there may just be a general understanding that you will help your parents out when they need it. Whatever the rules are in your own household, you should take the initiative and help out your folks even before they ask for it. Whether this means washing your dishes, doing your own laundry, mowing the lawn, or picking up groceries, you should make a point of helping out without being forced to or without expecting a reward, because that is one of your duties as a son.


The least you can do is to always clean up after yourself, whether this means doing your own laundry or dishes or keeping your room clean. But after that, you should go above and beyond and help scrub the bathroom floor, take out the trash, or even clean out the fridge.

, Your parents don’t expect you to be a rocket scientist or to get into Harvard. However, they would be happy if you respected your teachers, did your homework, and kept your grades up to the best of your ability. If you need help in school, ask your teachers or your parents for help, and make studying a priority over socializing. Not only will this set you on a path to succeed in your future endeavors, but it will also make life much easier for your parents.


The best you can do is to respect your learning institution instead of playing hooky or complaining about it all the time. Your parents shouldn’t have to force you to see the value of your education.

, As you grow older, you’ll find that you can’t depend on your parents to do everything for you. Your parents will appreciate that you’re independent and willing to do things on your own — though they’ll still want to love and care for you, of course. Once you’re in the neighborhood of 10-12 years old, you can start thinking about cleaning up after yourself, not asking your mom’s help with basic tasks like laundry or washing dishes, and starting to think for yourself a bit more. This will help you develop strong character and will make you a better son.


Your parents will appreciate it if you learn to do things on your own, from making your own meals to cleaning up on your own initiative. Your foresight will help them out a lot.
Don’t be afraid to be different from your parents. They don’t expect you to be a clone of them.

, One of the best things you can do to be a good son and a good brother is to be kind to your siblings. It’s not always easy to get along with your siblings, whether they are older or younger, but you should try to develop relationships with them that are encouraging and non-competitive. This will not only help you be a good role model to your siblings, but it will help your parents out more than you know.


You can also be a good son by helping your siblings do their schoolwork, clean up, or learn basic skills. This will give your parents some more time to relax.

, As you grow older and develop your own personality and ideals, you may find that you and your parents fundamentally disagree about many things. Maybe your parents are devout Catholics while you struggle to believe in a higher power. Maybe your parents are conservative while you identify as a liberal. The important thing to keep in mind is not that you have to agree with everything your parents believe, but that you have to know how to respectfully disagree with them instead of starting a fight over every little difference you may have.


If your parents want you to do something you don’t want to do, such as go to church, try to explain why it’s not the path for you. Don’t just outright refuse, but make a point of staying calm while you explain your own beliefs. If your parents won’t budge, find a way to keep things civil and even friendly and to avoid topics that will cause you to fight.

, As you grow older, you should begin to see your parents as people who are more than just “Mom” and “Dad.” They have busy lives, friendships, relationships with their own parents, careers that they may or may not be happy with, and at least one child to take care of. Take some time to consider how busy and overwhelming life can be for your parents, and consider how certain difficult situations may make them feel before you start an argument or protest too much.


It takes character to be able to step into someone else’s shoes. The next time you have a fight with one of your parents, try to see the situation from his or her perspective to see if it gives you a better understanding of why they disagree with you. This can help strengthen your relationship and will give you a deeper understanding of who your parents really are.
To see them as people, you can also ask them questions about their friends, their job, their childhood, or anything else that will shed some light on who they are.

, It’s okay to make mistakes as a son, and your parents won’t expect perfection from you. However, they will expect you to be accountable for your mistakes, and the best thing you can really do is to apologize when you’ve made a mistake. If you’ve done something wrong, no matter how big or small, it’s important to sit your parents down, look them in the eyes, and tell them that you’ve really messed up. It’s also important that you make a point of not repeating the mistake again.


Make sure that they know you really mean it, and that you’re not just saying it so they’ll stop being mad at you.
If you’ve upset one of your siblings, it’s just as important to apologize to them as well.

, Once you move out of the home, whether you’re in college or living in another state for a new job, it’s important to stay in touch with your parents. Call them at least once or a few days a week, send them emails when you think of them, and make a point to visit home for holidays, long weekends, or just as often as you’re able. They’ll appreciate the time you’re giving them and will feel loved and cared for because of the effort you make to see them.


Remember anniversaries and birthdays. It’s important to send your parents birthday cards or gifts on their anniversaries or on Mother’s Day or Father’s Day (if your family celebrates it). This shows them that they’re on your mind even when you’re apart.

, Studies show that parents are the most happy when their own adult children are happy in their lives. This doesn’t mean you have to have a perfect life or that you should feel bad if things have taken a bad turn for you, but it does mean that you should work to live a meaningful and fulfilling life. If every time you talk to your parents, all you do is complain about your job, romantic life, or living situation, then they will begin to think that they have failed you by giving you a bad life. Talk to them about the good things in your life and sugar-coat the problems you’re facing, whenever you can, as long as you don’t feel like you’re being dishonest.With this in mind, know that it’s much more important to your parents that you’re happy than if you make a six figure salary, live in a posh neighborhood, or are dating the most beautiful woman in the city. It’s more important that you do the best you can with what you have, instead of striving for some impossible-to-reach version of happiness.

, You may feel like your parents will be disappointed if you ask for financial, or even for emotional support as an adult, but studies actually show that parents are happy to provide support to their children. They’ll like the fact that they can still be useful to you and you shouldn’t be ashamed to ask for help once in a while. This will keep your relationship strong and will allow you to grow up, too.Though it’s important to be independent from your parents as you become an adult and develop your own views about the world and follow your path, you can get some help from them once in a while.

, As you get older, you may have the temptation to tell your parents how to live their lives. While they may need your support as they get older, especially if they have trouble taking care of themselves, you should still try not to condescend to them or make them feel like they are helpless on their own. Give them the help they need without talking down to them or acting like they have no agency, and they will love you for it.


Avoid condescending to them, nagging them, or giving them a hard time for doing something their own way. Even if your way is quicker or more efficient, they may want to stick to their old routines, and you can’t hold that against them.
Be patient with them. As they get older, it may take them longer to do things than it used to, but that doesn’t mean you should get frustrated.

, Another thing you can do to keep your relationship strong as you grow older is to treat your parents like they are fellow adults, instead of always thinking of them in the “Mom” or “Dad” role. This can help you discuss topics like finances or child rearing on an even playing field, and may lead you to get some great advice. Though it’s important not to condescend to your parents when you feel like you need to take care of them, seeing them as fellow adults can help add dynamic element to your relationship.If you see them as fellow adults, you’ll be able to be honest with them instead of just telling them what you think they want to hear from a model son. They’ll appreciate your candor.

Put on some socks.,
Avoid walking down the middle of a staircase.,
Make your way over to the kitchen slowly and without making any noise.",How to Get a Midnight Snack Without Your Parents Knowing1," Fuzzy ones work the best, however any socks will do. Why should you put on socks? Well, socks keep your foot bones from pounding on creaky stairs.;
, Usually, the middle part makes the most noise, so walk down the sides, with your back facing the wall.


Once you are on the floor, step off the stairs. Avoid being loud.







,


Take a flashlight with you. That way, you can see where you are going.

Tell as much truth as you can.,
Turn off the location services on your cell phone.,
Don’t answer the phone if there is background noise.,
Avoid saying you’re inside if you are outside or driving.,
Keep items in your car to freshen up.,
Be careful about social media.",How to Be Secretive About Your Whereabouts To Your Parents1," You will feel better and there is less of a chance of getting caught if you share part of the truth. For example, if you say that you're going to eat with one of your friends, actually do it. Then, since you’re already out, you can do the other secretive activity on the way to or from the restaurant.To avoid getting caught, try to make sure that your secret destination isn't more than 15 or so minutes away from where you're supposed to be. It would be very stressful to get stranded somewhere hours away and then have to explain to your parents why you were there.;
, If you and your parents have an app like Find my Friends, your parents will be able to see where you are. Be sure that, if you and your parents have this app, you disable your location settings before going on a secret mission., If you are in a place with noise that will give away your whereabouts, let your parents’ call go to voicemail. Then, immediately text them and explain why you couldn’t answer. That way, they won’t worry because they are hearing from you, and you won’t have to lie directly about where you are.


In your text, you could say something like, “Sorry I couldn’t answer! Jessie was telling me an important story, and I didn’t want to cut her off. I love you! I’ll call back soon!” This will give you time to relocate to a quieter area to call them back, or to head home.
If your parents know this trick or get suspicious when you don’t answer calls, try to duck into a bathroom or quiet hallway to answer the call.

, If you call your parents to tell them you are, for example, back at your friend’s house getting ready for bed, make sure that you are inside when you call them. If you are standing on a street or driving in a car, the background noise could give you away. You don’t have to be at the friend’s house who you claim to be with, but just be sure you are inside somewhere quiet.


If you must call them from a car while saying you are safe at a house, be sure to roll up the windows, turn off the music, and pull over if possible. That will reduce the possibility that they will hear a car honking or the sound of the moving car.

, Having extra clothes, a toothbrush, a hairbrush, and perhaps some makeup in your car will allow you to freshen up and look presentable before seeing your parents again.


For example, if you want to go dancing in an outfit that your parents wouldn’t approve of, keep a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt in your car to change into. You can stuff the “inappropriate” clothes into your purse or backpack before you go back into your house.

, Even if you do everything right, one thoughtless Facebook post from a friend could blow your cover. Ask your friends not to tag you in any photos or “check-ins,” and be sure not to post anything about your whereabouts that you don’t want your family to know. Even if they aren’t friends with you, other family members or family friends may see the posts and inform your parents.If you want to be able to post about things you do without your family knowing, consider making a private friends list with family members only. Then, when you post, you can choose to hide the post from those in that group.

Before you start pushing things around looking for something and making noise, take a glimpse at the food, and push things away slowly, then grab your food. If it is in a package, hold it in your mouth for this next step.

, If not, then go to your room they way you came. Be sure to close the door and leave everything the way it was before you came down - otherwise, your parents might become suspicious!

, Once safely in your room, go under your covers or some other place you can eat, and eat your food quietly. If it is in packaging, open it slowly - don't rip it up.

, If your parents see the wrappers, or anything else, you could get busted.


If your parents see your evidence, have a reasonable story.

Do your research in advance.,
Prove to your parents that you are a safe driver.,
Show your parents that you can make good choices.,
Call your parents often.",How to Be Secretive About Your Whereabouts To Your Parents2," Depending on how elaborate your lie is, you may need to do some research to make sure you don’t get caught. The best option is always to keep the lie simple, such as “we’re going to the mall” or “I’m staying late after school to catch up with Nicholas!” No matter what your story is, be sure that it will hold up even if your parents do research.


For example, make sure that the mall is open when you say you’ll be there, and don’t say you’re staying at a friend’s house if your parents have that friend’s parents’ phone number.

, Let them ride in the car with you and show that you are a responsible driver. Doing this may help your parents to be less strict and to worry less when you are out.


If you don’t drive, then this step won’t apply to you. If you are having a friend pick you up, have them pick you up at school or at the end of your block instead of at your house.

, While some parents are going to be strict no matter what, sometimes a parent just wants to know that you have a good head on your shoulders. You can build trust with your parents by coming home at your curfew, completing chores on time, getting good grades, and introducing your parents to your friends.Another way to build trust is by talking with your parents about select personal issues, like a boy or girl that you like or a struggle you’re having with a friend. This can promote closeness and may make your parent give you a bit more freedom.If you know your parents won't like your friend, then introducing them could backfire. Use your judgment to decide if introducing a friend to your parents would help you build trust.

, Specifically, call your parents to check in when you arrive at a place that they can know about. This will ease their fears and help build trust. Tell them you’ll also call them when you’re on your way home. Try to avoid calling them when you are at the place where you’re not supposed to be. That way, you won’t be explicitly lying, and you reduce the chance of them hearing a background noise that doesn’t match where they think you are.Give your parents an estimated time frame of how long you’ll be gone. When you tell them, be prepared to explain why what you’re doing will take a long time. For example, you could say, “Mike and I are getting dinner. It might be a few hours because he is going through some difficult stuff that he wants to talk about. Is it okay if I get home at ______? I’ll call you when I’m on my way home.”

Be prepared for shock and awe.,
Be interested in them.,
Ask for things you want - don't demand.,
Anticipate their needs.,
Participate in family life.,
Accept defeat with grace.,
Respect them, and they will respect you.",How to Go from Self Centered to Respectful Towards Parents," If you have been particularly self-absorbed, your folks and siblings may not even believe the change in you is possible. Blow off any teasing, jibes, or jokes, and just stay on your new course. Also, be aware of your manners.;
, Instead of your usual grunted greeting and not looking up from your texting, stop what you're doing and say, ""Hi, Mom. How was your day? Here, let me take that stuff for you."" Get up, help her with whatever she's carried in, and let her talk about her day a little bit. It shows that you are thinking of her, and not just off in your own little world with your friends.

, Instead of telling your parents that you want to go to a party, ask. Instead of informing your parents that they will be spending untold hundreds of dollars on your new wardrobe or school trip, ask if there's a chance you could get some new clothes or go on the trip. Also ask what you can do to help contribute to the cost. The tone of a request is so much different than the tone of you demanding, cajoling, wheedling and whining. It is much more mature, because it shows respect for the fact that your parents may have unexpected expenses (like the doctor, or the tires on the car are bald) that you are unaware of. Parents are not a money fountain that you can always dip into. They work hard for their money and have to pay bills, purchase food, and cover expenses for everyone that resides in the house, not just you. The following examples are ways you can show your folks that you respect them as your parents, and understand that they are dealing with more than just your problems. Next time you want something, instead of the usual way you approach them, try these examples:


""Mom, my friend Derek is having a party on Friday night. Is it okay with you if I go? Here's Derek's mom's phone number. There will be adult supervision. My friends will be there for me to hang out with. Of course it's okay with me if you call. Will it be okay with you, assuming you say yes, if I get home no later than 11:00?
""Dad, I need to ask you something. I was at practice yesterday and noticed that my cleats are falling apart. (Show him.) Do you think we could get me some new ones?""
""Mom, I don't really like this cell phone. I know it's not that old, but I really want a new one (show her the one you want) when my contract is up. I realize it will cost money. I'm not just asking you to shell out for it, I'm willing to work for it. Is there some way I could earn this phone?""

, Part of being respectful and less self-absorbed is looking around and seeing what's going on around you. When your mom comes home from the grocery store, she's tired from walking around and shopping (you'll understand this better 10 years from now). You know those groceries aren't going to walk in on their own and put themselves away - go help her! Bring in the groceries, and then help her put things away. Don't say you don't know where they go. You eat. You know where things are. And if you don't, it's time you learned! And look around at the house. You know that your folks do not like clutter and things being left out. If you see stuff lying around, get your siblings to pitch in and help tidy up before you're asked. Take it upon yourself to do household chores like vacuum, dust, empty the dishwasher, clean the bathroom, clean your room, wash a load of clothes, etc. Do it without being asked. Your parents will appreciate your help in this, and will respect your maturity.

, Sitting in your room, on the phone, texting or on the Internet is not respecting the family. It's okay to be on your own for some time, but do make time for them. They care about you, and part of respecting them and being less self-centered is taking the time to involve yourself in what they are doing. Even if you just watch a TV show with them, go for a walk around the neighborhood with them, sit down for dinner together, or ask for help with homework for a little while, it means a lot to them. You can text your friends and do all that stuff, on your own. But when you're with your family, turn the phone off, or let it go to voice mail; this means no texting either, turn all electronics off. This says to your parents that you are no longer allowing selfish concerns to intrude on family time. They will appreciate that, and respect you for it. Besides, it won't hurt your friends to realize you do have a life other than with them and you are not always waiting around to respond instantly to their messages.

, If you do ask for something respectfully, and they still say no, understand that they don't just say no to make you angry. They really are trying to act in your best interest. When they say no to something, they have reasons you may not be aware of - if they say no to a new cell phone, it may be that they had an unexpected car breakdown, or doctor bill, or even a tax bill. Or it may be that they know that if they pay for a new cell phone, they won't have the money for your prom dress, or your football uniform. When you've made your best case to them, and they still turn you down, accept it with calm and maturity. Just say, ""Okay. Well, thanks for thinking about it."" They'll be amazed that you took it so well, and they will certainly want to say yes to you that much more, later.

, The interesting thing about respect is that it multiplies, like. By showing respect for your parents, you are showing that you are deserving of respect in turn. The more respect and compassion you show your parents, the more appreciative your parents will be that you are turning out to be such a nice person. It will make them respect you as a person, and as a young adult.

Never smoke in the house.,
People often make the mistake of hiding cigarettes in their bedrooms when they're out.,
If you do smoke in the house, make sure to dispose of your paraphernalia.",How to Avoid Getting Caught Smoking by Your Parents1," This should be the most obvious rule! If your parents smoke, however, it is easier to get away with it. But if you smoke a cigarette in a non-smoking house, it will take days and lots of air freshener to get rid of the smell. Just don't do it!


However, if your house has a patio, you can go outside and smoke when your parents are not around. (Make sure any ash in the area is cleaned up if no one else in the family smokes.) If you have to, light a citronella candle to help mask the odor. Otherwise, avoid smoking anywhere near the house. The wood and brick will absorb the odor. BTW: while you are at it, try to not to get caught by your nosey neighbors.





;
, Don't do it. Use common sense. The best thing to do is to have them on you (inside a pocket or something) all of the time. Do this with your matches as well.


If you are going to school and you still have your cigarettes with you, it is a good idea to hide them in your waistband so if you get searched, most schools are not allowed to look in that general area.







, Don't be careless. Get rid of empty packs of smokes and matches. Get rid of ashes by washing them down the sink.

"
"
Never smoke anywhere your parents or their friends might look for you.,
If you smoke in school, go to a place where no one else will go like an old bathroom or storage room.,
Smoke with your friends.",How to Avoid Getting Caught Smoking by Your Parents2," If this isn't possible, try to wear clothes that will help hide your identity, like a hoodie, a pair of sunglasses, and a baseball cap.

, Blow the smoke into a ventilation source such as an air vent.

, It's helpful if one of your friends is allowed to smoke. In this way, if your parents catch you with a cigarette in your hand, you can simply say you were holding it for your friend. Don't expect all parents to fall for this, however. They probably tried the same excuse when they were teenagers.

"
"
One thing that you can do that is really helpful is to take a paper towel roll or a toilet paper roll and tape a dryer sheet to one end.,
Keep an air-freshener/fabric spray hidden somewhere around the house.,
Avoid your parents until you can change your clothes.,
Remove (or unzip) your jacket when you're smoking.,
Take a bath or a shower.,
If you're smoking outside, wear gloves if the weather is a little chilly.,
When driving in a car, make sure all the windows are down.",How to Avoid Getting Caught Smoking by Your Parents3," Exhale into the open end of the roll. The dryer sheet will help disperse the smoke and mask the smell.

, Spray a cloud into the air and walk through it. This will help cover up odor on your clothes, hair and skin.

, Carry some extra clothes if you can. The most important clothes to change are your shirt and hat (if you are wearing one). Have a friend keep it or hide it in the garage.

, After you're done, put the jacket back on. Or better yet, reserve a ratty old jacket to wear while smoking. Make sure your parents do not know about this garment.

, Cologne/perfume will not mask the scent of a cigarette. Bathing is the better option because it gets rid of the smell instead of covering it. Make sure to shampoo your hair. Smoke has a habit of getting tangled up in your hair.


If you cannot wash your hair before you see your parents, running a scented dryer sheet across your head (as well as any clothing) will cover up the smell with the scent of clean laundry.
Many people pull back their hair and wear a hat while smoking. This helps keep your hair away from your cigarette's smoke.

, Smoke will stay on your hands for hours after smoking and gloves will help cover it up. Leather gloves work best; little cotton ones provide no odor protection whatsoever. Also: smoking cigarettes will discolor your fingers. Wearing gloves will definitely prevent this.


If you don't wear gloves, try rubbing your hands with one (and only one) leaf from a tree or a bush. By doing so, the oils from the leaf will cover the smell of smoke. Some leaves will give suspicious smells, so try different varieties until you find the right one.






If nothing else, Wash your hands as soon as you get home. And use an extremely strongly scented soap. You may want to keep anti-bacterial hand sanitizer stashed outside of your house, in a flower pot, in the garage or hidden in your backpack. The smellier and more fragrant the better. Blueberry, blackberry and citrus fruit smells cover smoke well. Lotion always works too.







, This way the smoke won't be trapped inside the car. The rushing air will help keep your car and your clothes a little bit fresh.

"
"
Brush your teeth.,
Cover up your breath.,
Drink a soda or other beverage while you smoke.,
Chew some strongly flavoured gum or drink something like Ice Coffee to get rid of smoky breath.,
Smoke remains in your breath and stains your teeth.",How to Avoid Getting Caught Smoking by Your Parents4," You need to get the cigarette taste out of your mouth. Brushing your teeth and tongue is the best thing to do. Use a mouthwash too.

, After you're done smoking, eat something that will cover up your cigarette breath. Doritos and mints work best. If possible, it is best to brush your teeth.

, A dry mouth tends to hold much more odor.

, Drinking a beer and coke also helps.

, Make sure to have good quality mints or gum to help mask the smell. If you have time, brush your teeth and tongue; the residual odor will be reduced.

"
"
Show and explain your symptoms.,
Avoid the “sick voice”.,
Be confident and clear.",How to Convince Your Parents You're Sick1," If you’re actually sick but your parents are skeptical, the best way to convince them is to concretely show how sick you are. By being forthcoming with your symptoms, you show that you have nothing to hide, making them more likely to trust you. You don’t want to emphasize on them too much, just make your parents aware.


For example, if you’ve had to wake up in the middle of the night to vomit, it’s important to mention that.;
, It’s tempting to make your symptoms sound worse than they are if you want to be convincing. It might work, but if it doesn’t, your parents will be hesitant to believe you’re actually sick. Be upfront and honest, don’t try to fake anything.


For instance, don’t try to force your scratchy throat into sounding more serious. If you’re having trouble swallowing, simply tell your parents. Since you’ll likely be avoiding food anyway, they’ll be more inclined to believe you.

, If your parents aren’t easily convinced, they’ll try and get you to double back on your words. They might try and trap you or make you slip up. If you’re sick enough to need to skip a particular event, stay confident in that fact. If they see that you don’t back down and are secure in what you say, they’ll be more likely to believe you.


If you’re intent on missing a family gathering, you might want to specify that not only are you feeling ill, you’d rather not get anyone sick. If you’re particularly contagious, your parents will understand.

"
"
Save up your money.,
Get to the store.,
Purchase what you want.,
Put your item in your backpack.",How to Buy Something Without Your Parent's Permission1," Search online or in the store you want to buy from to find out the exact price of the item you want. Save up money from an allowance or job so that you have enough to pay for the item yourself.


Remember that tax will most likely be added when you purchase the item, so the total will be slightly higher than the listed price.
If you can’t come up with enough money of your own, ask a friend or sibling if they’ll give or lend you some, but know that they probably won’t give you money without some sort of exchange. You can also try mowing lawns for neighbors in the summer, shoveling snow in the winter, or babysitting to earn some extra cash.;
, Get a friend, an older sibling, or another person who can drive to take you to the store you want to make your purchase from. Make sure this person is someone you can trust. If you are not allowed to go out, you shouldn't. Avoid using Uber or Lyft, especially because you never know if you run into a shady driver:


If you want to take a bus or train, check the routes and figure out the fastest way to get to your destination. Google Maps is a good way to do this.
Make sure you have a good cover up story if you parents asked why you are late, like ""I missed the bus, the next one took ages to come, then I fell asleep on the train!"" Or, if you have weekly remedial and there is no remedial on a certain week, buy the item on that day.

Make sure you have enough money! Your parents will be suspicious if you come home late two days in a row.
If you want to buy it after school instead get there as fast as you can, buy it, and then rush home to avoid suspicion.
If you can go out on your own: Try going after school with a friend who can drive or having an older sibling drive you from home. Avoid lying to your parents about where you're going if you can. If the store is close enough, ride a bike or walk there yourself, especially if you can’t get someone else to drive you or don’t want to tell another person what you’re buying.

, Buy your desired item at the store with cash or a gift card, if you have one.


Don’t pay for anything with a credit or debit card, especially if it’s a parent’s account, because the purchase will show up on bills and statements for the card.
Remember that there are age restrictions on certain items and store clerks will ask to see a valid ID before they let you make the purchase. For example, you’ll need to show that you’re 17 in order to buy an M-rated video game, and you have to be 21 to buy alcohol. If you’re not of age to buy the thing you want, consider asking someone older to buy it for you with your money.

, Conceal your package in a backpack or other normal bag you carry so you can easily bring it home without your parents getting suspicious.


Throw away the store bag or any other evidence you don’t need right away.
If what you buy is very large or bulky and you can’t conceal it in a bag, make sure a friend can help you transport it, and only bring it into your house when your parents aren’t home to see you bring it inside.

Prepare some fake vomit.,
Keep the mixture hidden in a sealed container.,
Use your mixture to fake throwing up.,
”Throw up” a few more times over the next two hours.,
Rest up while you’re staying home.",How to Convince Your Parents You're Sick2," If you want to convince your parents you have a stomach bug, it’s best to make it seem like it’s been stewing. You need to prepare in advance of the day you’re planning to be sick.


Try not to eat too much the night before your sick day. Eating is the last thing you want to do when you feel nauseous; this helps cement the deception.
Avoid excessive activity. It’s hard to believe you have a developing illness if you’re up and about.

, It’s best to do this when you have some time alone, or somewhere you won’t get caught. Mix a few pieces of bread, oatmeal, water and baby food in a bowl. The solid foods give your mixture the chunkiness it needs, while the water and baby food give it a sludgy overall texture.If you can get away with it, snag some leftovers to prepare your fake vomit. Combine different foods with water until you get the right texture. Using real food will make it more convincing.

, If you’ll only be using your fake vomit several hours later, it’s important to keep it out of view. You can hide it under your bed or in a drawer in your room, somewhere your parents won’t look.


Make sure the container can be securely sealed to avoid spillage. Think sandwich bags or plastic kitchen containers.

, Start this process a few hours before whatever event you’re trying to skip. Make sure you stash the fake vomit in the bathroom in preparation for this. Complain that you’re not feeling very well, and excuse yourself to the bathroom if your parents are nearby. Lock the door and stay for a few minutes before “throwing up”. Make dry heaving noises and groan a bit until you make a clear puking sound. Dump part of the mixture in the toilet.


Don’t go out of your way to show your parents the fake vomit, this will be a strong clue that you’re faking.

, If you throw up too often, your parents may become concerned that something is significantly wrong and take you to a doctor. As such, try to “throw up” no more than three times over the next two hours. This confirms you’re too sick to go to whatever event you’re trying to avoid without seeming too serious.

, Unless both of your parents are away from home for the day, you have to be careful about keeping up your deception throughout the day. You’ll need to act like you’re severely tired and worn out. You’ll have to avoid eating, as this will be seen as a sign of improvement. Forget about seeing your friends that day as well. If you’re seen out and about and it gets back to your parents, you’ll be busted.

Complain of a headache.,
Pretend to sneeze.,
Fake a cough.,
Warm up your skin.,
Beat the thermometer.",How to Convince Your Parents You're Sick3," It’s hard even for doctors to determine when someone is just pretending to have a headache.Act like this headache is really keeping you down, making you tired and lethargic. A good way to sell a painful headache is to use symptoms typically associated with migraines: blurry vision and eye pain., The purpose of a sneeze is to remove a blockage in your nose, like mucus caused by a cold.A fake sneeze takes a little bit of acting. You don’t want to exaggerate and simply shout “achoo”, but a sneeze should occur in two parts. A good sneeze starts with an inhale and finishes with a strong exhale.


As the sneeze is supposed to dislodge blockage, try to make it sound “wet” by pursing your lips.
You can also spit a bit into your armpit or hands to simulate residue.

, Try and replicate the last cough you had, but make sure you don’t overdo it. Go into coughing fits every so often; make sure you don’t set a pattern, sometimes cutting off your own sentences. Don’t go for a big hacking cough as it’s the easiest way to get found out.

, The first step to pretending you have a fever is to make yourself warm to the touch. Many parents will just check your forehead with the back of their hands if you start complaining that you’re sick. Try the following to beat this test:


Use a hairdryer for a few minutes to warm up your forehead. Make sure you do this away from your parents so they can’t hear the noise.
Bury your face in the pillow and exhale several times. This will warm up the pillow and your face.

, If your parents are particularly skeptical, they might test for a fever with a thermometer. To convince your parents you have a fever, the thermometer needs to show a temperature at or above 100.4°F (38°C). Be careful not to go too high, as your parents might take you to the hospital. The method you use will depend on how trusting your parents are.


If your parents leave you alone with the thermometer, simply rub your thumb against the sensor until it reaches the right thermometer.
If your parents won’t leave you with the thermometer, excuse yourself to the bathroom. Gargle some hot water to raise the temperature in your mouth. Be careful not to burn yourself."

Get a gift card.,
Enter your information to place the order.,
Constantly track the order.,
Check the mail frequently.",How to Buy Something Without Your Parent's Permission2," Buy a gift card for the online store you want to make your purchase from. You can find a big variety of gift cards at grocery stores or at the desired store itself, and most gift cards should be able to be used for online purchases.


If you can’t get a gift card for the specific store you want to buy from online, you can buy a Visa gift card, or other similar prepaid credit card, to use anywhere. Or try an Amazon gift card to buy anything from Amazon.com.
Remember that when ordering online, there will be tax, shipping, and handling charges added to the price, so the total will be higher than the listed price. If you want to avoid the extra cost of shipping and handling, try to get your purchase in person at a store. But keep in mind some websites like Amazon and Best Buy offer free shipping and handling on qualified items so check the policy on shipping and handling before buying the item on that site.

, Go online to where you want to purchase your item and enter all the information they ask for at checkout, including name and address. Enter the code on your gift card when they ask for your payment method. Don’t use a credit or debit card that your parents use to pay online, as the purchase will show up on bills and statements.


Make sure you enter an email address that only you have access to so that you get the confirmation email and any updates sent to you.
Avoid having your purchase shipped UPS or FedEx, as they will sometimes require a signature from an adult when it’s delivered. Choose regular mail such as USPS if you can.
Consider getting the permission of a friend to have your purchase sent to his or her house to avoid the chance of your parents seeing the package. In this case, enter the person who will receive the package for you name and address when ordering, but still use your email address.

, Go back to the website you made your purchase from or check the confirmation email sent to you for a link that says “Track your package,” or something similar. Continue to check the location of your package in this way so that you know when it will arrive at your house or a friend’s house.


If you’re not given the option to track your package, pay attention to what the online store says about how long shipping takes on average. Notice if they send an email when the item has shipped, and then it should arrive something like 7-10 days after that, or whatever range of time the store provides.

, Try to check the mail before your parents do every day during the time you expect the package to arrive. When you finally get it, slip it into a backpack or other bag you normally carry to bring it into the house and into your room.


Pay attention to what time the mail comes every day so you can be available at that time and ready to go out to check the mailbox or front step right away. You can even go talk to the mail carrier if you see him or her outside to ask if they have a package for you.
If the mail typically arrives while you’re at school or another activity, you may want to have your package sent to a friend or other person you trust to receive it and give it to you.

Conceal it at home.,
Keep receipts hidden.,
Delete search history.,
Use it in private.,
Tell your parents about a rewards program.,
Come clean about what you bought.",How to Buy Something Without Your Parent's Permission3," Find a good hiding place to keep your purchase and only bring it out when your parents aren’t around or won’t notice. Try places with small openings, like underneath furniture.


Be careful not to choose a place that your parents might go to clean, pick up laundry, or otherwise have a reason to go from time to time like your closet, dresser drawers, or other storage areas.
If the item you purchased is too big or hard to hide, consider keeping it at a friend’s house that you trust, and only using it there or carefully transporting it to your own house when you can.

, Also hide receipts or any other evidence of your purchase so your parents don’t come across them and ask about it.


You should still keep any receipts and packaging from the item you purchased and not throw them away, because you may need them later if you need to return or exchange it.
If you ordered online, keep any packing receipts that came inside, but get rid of the other packaging by throwing it away where your parents won’t notice it. A trash can at school or a public place is better than one at home.

, If you purchased online, or if you did any other searching on the internet before or after buying, delete your history from your browser, particularly if you share a computer with your parents.


Go into the settings or history tab on whatever internet browser you use and clear all the recent history of websites visited, or select and delete just the ones you don’t want your parents to come across., Take your item out of its hiding place only when your parents aren’t around or won’t catch you with it. Or use it, wear it, or look at it only when you’re at a friend’s house or at school.


Make sure you have your purchase in a backpack or well concealed whenever you move it from place to place.

, If your parents find your purchase and get suspicious about where it came from, and you don’t want to confess that you bought it, tell them about a rewards program or other contest, like collecting bottle caps or finding a winning code on a food or drink item.


You may want to have a small collection of bottle caps or other proof to show you really are participating in what you say you are.
Note that lying to your parents is not a good idea, so avoid using this step or making up any other excuse if you can. If your parents ask about where your purchase came from, the best option at that point is just to be honest about where and how you got it.

, You might decide you just want to ‘fess up to your parents about your purchase. Consider that they could be mad if they told you not to buy it, but it might be worse if you try to hide it from them and they find it anyway.


If you’ve already asked your parents for permission to buy something and they said no, you can tell them, “Hey, I know you didn’t want me to buy this, but I did on my own with my own money. I’m sorry I went behind your back, but I want to be honest now and not hide it from you.”
If you haven’t asked your parents for permission previously, you can casually mention your purchase to your parents, and hopefully they will not see it as a big deal if you’re of age to own it and you paid for it with your own money.

Come up with an excuse.,
Gain composure over yourself.,
Prepare your speech.,
Set up an escape route.,
Make excuses for leaving plausible.,
Have an objective.,
Execute the plan.,
Follow some of the steps above for phone/internet/letter etc.",How to Avoid Being Suspicious," If your overall plan fails, or you're being grilled by teachers, friends or parents, have a back up plan. This will make it much easier to get away with what you're trying to.;
, Breathe deeply. Relax your face, and do not be tense at all! This is similar to how you would prepare for an audition for something - be it a play, job, etc. You go through the same process, to see if you get past the first round. Practice in front of the mirror.

, Stuttering and stumbling along in your speech indicates to others you're lying. And then the person will ask themselves ""Well, why are you lying?!"" and become suspicious. Have a reasonable response to anything you think that person will ask. Think of the backup phrase, that just in case they ask something that might give you away, you can use.

, If things really start to get sticky, make sure you have a backup. Something to get you out of it. If you need an alarm on your phone that sounds similar to a ringtone set, do it. For example, you plan the conversation to last 15 minutes. Have an alarm set at, say, the 7 minute mark. This lets you have ample time for the conversation to go on, and it doesn't look planned, unless you have this long and awkward pause between the conversation when you're expecting the ring. Or, have a time-frame set, and have your friend call you.

, If you're not in that type of situation, have a good reason set up for you to leave. Mention it in the beginning of the conversation. This is the foreshadow of your 'hasty' departure.

, Having one goal in mind keeps you focused and on tangent. This way your mind doesn't wander and get off track, keeping you in mind of what's going on in the conversation. Along with your larger objective/overall goal, have smaller objectives. For example, you want to go out with some friends and 'study'. Your overall goal is to have your parents let you go. Some smaller objectives during the conversation would be, maybe, 'gain their trust,' first. Then that brings us to tactics. Tactics will basically be ""How will I get the smaller goals accomplished?"" If you wanted your parents' trust, you'd maybe give them examples of how responsible you were in the past. Maybe tell them about how you were on curfew every night you went out. This whole step is crucial in not looking shady.

, Keep your whole game plan in your head. Breathe, relax, and respond. Respond to what that person is saying. If they crack a joke, and you're busy sweating, however, will they not be suspicious?! Breathe, relax, respond, and think. Four things easy enough to do for a face-to-face.

, confrontations. Instead of focusing on breathing (unless you're talking on the phone), try focusing more on your speech. It'll be three times harder to convey what you're trying to get away with since your tone of voice won't be there.


Remember that peers are helpful. If you can, have someone else read it that knows what's going down. Or, just pretend someone else is reading it. Reread, read again, and make sure that there is nothing shady about it!






Send it promptly. If you send it too much earlier, it looks like you're jumping to the gun. Too late, what's keeping you so busy?! Do it how you think/know that person sees you. And between responses, don't be so quick! Having the conversation planned is good, but copying and pasting doesn't make for a believable happy-scotch-free-time!!






Know the field. Knowledge is power, and power is confidence. Play by that.

Begin early.,
Move slowly - remember, if you have an upset stomach, it can be painful and disturbing to move fast or jolt around.,
Feel sick.,
Remember: Sounds.,
You might want to try scents.,
Add accompanying symptoms.,
Don't overdo it!,
Keep up with your personality.,
Try something different.,
Don't cut it too close.,
Go to the bathroom often, but don't over-do it!",How to Fake a Stomach Ache," It's sure to look suspicious to whoever you're faking to if you're fine one minute and the next you're throwing up. Start slow, and let the symptoms get worse slowly.;
, Try to sit down often, holding your belly.

, It's always easier to fake sick if you make yourself feel it. Remember the last time you had an upset stomach. Remember how you felt, and what that made you look like. Queasy? Achy?

, Even if you look completely sick, you need to sound it. Moan a little in the bathroom, even if no one can hear you. When talking, speak slowly and quietly, as well, or a bit faster than usual, in shorter sentences, as though you don't want to talk because you're in pain. Sound strained.

, If you want, you can buy really cheap perfume or badly-scented water and put on a tiny bit, making you smell sweaty and sick.

, It's doubtful the only thing you feel is a pain in your stomach. Fevers are possible, although this can be risky and get you sent to the doctor's.

, Don't groan loudly, clutch your stomach and scream ""My tummy hurts"". Be a little more subtle. Wait until someone isn't looking straight at you, but will see you, then hold your stomach and close your eyes for a second or two before opening them. Moan softly.Sit down and squeeze your eyes shut between getting ready for what you're trying to get out of. Grimace. Be careful to act when people aren't looking straight at you, but will notice.

, Don't tell your parents that you're sick and need to stay home if you always try to get out of going to the doctors. Be quiet about it. Never say you need to stay home. You might want to suggest it, but look uncertain and undecided, but it's better if you let your parents suggest it first.

, If you fake a lot and are often caught, look back on what you did previously and change something. Never over-do it, but don't under-do it, either.

, If it looks like no one's noticing, suggest something before it's too late. Say hesitantly, ""Uh, mom, do we have any medicine?"" Speak quietly, slowly, and urgently. It might be a good idea to make her ask you to repeat yourself, and like it strains you to raise your voice. Hold your stomach lightly while asking. Don't be too specific as to what type until she asks, then say, ""um... I don't know!?"" Sound urgent, like you might throw up soon if you don't get it. Don't give the exact name of the medicine, this will show you knew what you were going to say.

, Groan quietly, especially if someone's passing by or waiting for you do finish. Move sluggishly.

Wake up early.,
Warm up the thermometer to ""fake"" the stats.,
In the event your parents are watching you take your temperature, be clever.",How to Fake a Fever1," The key to faking out your parents is to let them wake you up -— with your fever already flaring! To do this, you have to prepare ahead. If you think your parents are just going to touch your forehead, try the following:


First things first, tell them you feel cold -- not hot. Just because you have a fever does not mean you're aware that you're actually ""burning up.""
Before your parents come wake you, wake up early and put your whole body (including your head) under a thick blanket to increase body temperature.
Get a water bottle or glass full of hot water. If your parents knock or call in to you, you'll know when they're coming and will be able to drink it. This should raise your temperature by a few degrees, and make you look flushed and warm.
Get creative with electronics. Is there a hot laptop or light bulb you could use to warm your face if you don't have hot water.;
,


Heat an electric thermometer with your hand. Hold the thermometer as still as you can with one hand, and rub your thumb as fast as you can until your desired fever is reached. Keep it to 99º or so -- too high and you'll be rushed to the hospital.
Also, you can heat a sock in the microwave for about a minute, put it under your armpit and measure your temperature. You can even do this in front of your parents, just make sure you have large clothing so the sock will not be visible.
If your thermometer has an infant/toddler setting, switch to it. Your temperature will go up 1 or 2 degrees.
Heat a mercury thermometer with water. Go to a sink (preferably one near the water heater so it'll take less time) and turn on the hot water -- as hot as it will go. Put the tip of the mercury thermometer under the running hot water until your desired temperature is reached/passed. If you pass it, shake the thermometer down until it falls back to your desired temperature. If mom catches you in the bathroom, tell her it seems to be moving to your stomach.
Shake your mercury thermometer by holding it from it's tip. But be careful, though, because if you are too violent, it will reach an impossibly high temperature and your parents could either not believe you or send you to the nearest hospital. Be careful not to shake so hard or you will shatter the glass.
Use a light bulb. Heat a mercury thermometer on a light bulb for a few minutes before placing it in your mouth. Or whenever your parents walk out of the room, of course!

, You have to pretend you're going to be sick, and run to the bathroom.


Thank God! False alarm. But you should probably stay in the bathroom for a few minutes to make sure. Do you need anything? No. Just privacy for a while.
Lock the door! Turn on the hot water in the sink. Make horrible retching noises, dump a glass of water (or two...or three) in the toilet bowl. Don't forget to flush!
Drink some hot water before you go back to your bedroom. Dab a little on your face, too, so it feels sweaty and you look a little worse for the wear. By now, mom probably forgot about your temperature! Ask her if she could call into school before she gets around to remembering. Or to call into school while you take your temperature.

"
"
Communicate about your symptoms constantly.,
Stay unfocused.,
Drink hot water, especially if you want to go to the nurse.,
Go to the nurse.",How to Fake a Fever2," Throughout the day you have to make your symptoms obvious, but not too bad; complain -- verbally and with body language -- but don't whine or cry. Mention to your teacher that you're not feeling too great and that you may be hitting the restroom more often than normal. That way, you can get up and leave without asking.


And take those bathroom breaks. If you're lucky enough to have a concerned teacher, they'll suggest you going to the nurse instead of you having to ask.

, Faking a sickness isn't just about temperature and bathroom habits, it's about the look too. It's imperative that you seem fairly miserable quite consistently. Act like it takes serious effort to move your muscles, including the ones in your face.


When it comes to your eyes, don't look alert. You should have a vague look of being somewhere else mentally. After all, you're in your body right now and can't be bothered to appreciate your teacher's lecture on the beauty of the electoral college. All in all, act the part.

, During your frequent bathroom breaks, drink hot water. It'll make you looked flushed, it'll bring your temperature up, and it'll make you sweaty. When you return, decide whether or not you want to report that you vomited. If you do, you'll probably go to the nurse's immediately.


Make sure no one from your class was in the bathroom at the time! Otherwise they'll know you're lying.

, This part is inevitable, unfortunately (unless she's not in -- in which case, go home!). When you get there, she'll probably have you lie down for 15 minutes or so to see if it goes away. Keep it up. You're almost home free. Mention a brother or sister having an illness, if feasible. Ask for an extra blanket. If she has any heart, she'll send you home.


If she hands you the thermometer, consider if any of the above tactics can be applied to this situation.

To practice,find an area where you can walk a in a straight line.,
Take a step on your ""good leg"" and then take a step forward on your ""bad leg,"" bringing your cane forward with it.,
The ""bad leg"" should only be grounded for a fraction of a second, at which time you should bring it forward slowly, getting as much distance out of your ""good leg"" as you can.

Act like part of your back feels painful and sensitive.,
Act like the pain becomes more intense with movement.,
Optionally, fake cramps or spasms.,
Make a convincing story for your sprain or strain.,
Know how to ""treat"" your sprain or strain.",How to Fake a Back Injury1," Strains and sprains are two similar (but not identical) types of injuries with related symptoms that can affect the back. Strains involve pulled or torn muscles or tendons, while sprains involve pulled or torn ligaments.In either case, the injury will generally be accompanied by noticeable pain that gradually subsides over a week or two. To fake this convincingly, you'll want to pretend that part of your back (e.g., upper back, lower back, shoulder region, etc.) is painfully sore like a bad bruise.


For example, let's say that you're faking a strain in your upper back after picking up a heavy box with bad posture. In this case, you might want to do the following to give a convincing performance:
Grunt or shout in pain as soon as the injury ""happens.""
Have the ""pain"" gradually subside over an hour or so until you're simply ""sore.""
After this, wince whenever anything touches your upper back (e.g., a friend pats you on the back, you brush against a coat rack, etc.)
Go slowly and tenderly when you have to press your upper back into anything (e.g., you have to sit back into a chair, etc.);
, A real back strain or sprain can leave you with the feeling that you've just had a very intense workout, but in a bad way. As your body repairs your damaged ligament, tendon, or muscle, the area around it will remain sore to any sort of disturbance — even those caused by simply moving. Thus, if you're faking this sort of injury, you'll want to mimic pain and stiffness whenever you do anything that moves the part of your back you've injured.For example, if you're dealing with a fake upper back sprain, when doing the following sorts of things, you'll want to put on a pained facial expression, wince, and act like you don't have our normal amount of flexibility:
Throwing something
Picking something up from the floor
Pulling something apart (e.g., packaging, tough food, etc.)
Putting on or taking off a coat
Raising a hand
Doing any sort of high-impact exercise (e.g., running, jumping, etc.)

, Especially bad sprains and strains can lead the muscles in the area of the injury to misfire, causing painful contractions called cramps or involuntary motions called spasms.These can be intensely painful and can be triggered by using the affected muscles, though they can also sometimes occur randomly. A cramp should ""hurt"" a lot more than the simple soreness that comes with a healing sprain or strain, so try to sell your sense of pain and surprise. It will also cause your muscles to bunch up and become tight, so you'll probably want to flex your back muscles hard until the cramp ""goes away"" (which usually just takes a minute or two.)For example, acting out an upper back cramp might go like this:
When people are around you, stoop to pick up something on the floor. Gasp and grab your lower back.
Grimace in pain when people are looking. Slowly stretch back into a standing position and pretend like you are still in pain.
Gradually decrease your ""pained"" performance throughout the rest of the day.

, Acting like you have a sprain or strain in your back will naturally attract curious questions, so have a good story ready. In general, most sprains and sprains in the back are caused by putting excessive stress on the muscles, tendons, and/or ligaments (either all at once or over time). Sprains and strains have slightly different causes, so be sure to know the difference to keep your story consistent. See below.Strains are often caused by:
Suddenly twisting or pulling the muscles in the back, especially when handling something heavy.
Stressing the muscles by attempting to lift something too heavy.
Fatiguing the back muscles too frequently, especially with improper form.

Sprains are often caused by:
A sudden blow to the back.
A fall.
The back being forced to stretch beyond its natural flexibility
A sharp, sudden bend or twist in the back.

, Enhance the illusion of your back sprain or strain by pretending to treat it. Most sprains and strains, though painful, can be treated with basic home remedies, so this should be fairly easy to fake! Real sprains and strains usually get better with the following remedies:Ice packs
Warm compresses/baths
Small doses of over-the-counter painkillers and anti-inflammatories (Acetaminophen/Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, etc.)
Gentle massage (for cramps)
Slowly stretching against the pull of the muscle (for cramps)
Rest (for especially bad sprains or strains); doctors recommend no longer than two days, as any longer typically makes healing take longer. It is up to you whether you want to follow this rule for your fake injury.

It does help to have some acting skills in order to pull this off, even though it is a more natural sort of walk.,
Lift the ""bad leg"" by leaning slightly to the opposite side, without bending the knee or moving your foot.

,
Now rotate the leg forward at the hip, but slowly.,
Slowly bring the ""good leg"" forward, the time each step takes should be almost identical.

,
Keep practicing until you can walk with a seamless, fluid movement.,
When you can limp easily, add the cane.,
Keep practicing until it is perfect.

",How to Fake a Limp2," First, start out without a cane. Pretend that your ""bad leg"" is almost entirely immobile by locking your knee and ankle in place and holding your leg perpendicular to the ground.

,, Put the leg down.

,, Initially, you may feel like you are progressing with a strange waddle, but that will change as you find your balance.

, Now, when you bring the ""good leg"" forward, put all of your weight onto the cane.

Decide whether or not to fake nerve pain.,
Fake shooting pains in your lower body or arm.,
Pretend to experience numbness and/or tingling.,
Act like the affected limbs have become stiff and weak.,
Have a convincing story ready.,
Pretend to be seeking treatment.",How to Fake a Back Injury2," A herniated disc (also known as a ruptured disc, slipped disc, pinched nerve, and other names) is a type of injury that happens when one of the fluid-filled discs between the vertebrae of the back breaks, spilling fluid into the surrounding area which can cause painful inflammation and nerve pain. Generally, herniated disc injuries fall into one of two categories, so, to start, pick which one of these you want to fake:Pinched nerve: The actual disc itself (usually in the lower back) may or may not experience pain and inflammation. In addition to this, shooting pain called sciatica will occur in one or both of the legs or from the neck down the arm.

Local Disc Pain: In this injury, just the area around the disc itself experiences pain and inflammation.
The rest of this section will focus mostly on faking a pinched nerve injury because it's a little harder to do. To fake local disc pain, you'll want to act like your lower back is painfully sore and stiff (like a bruise) and that bending, twisting, or carrying heavy weights causes you intense pain.

, One of the ""textbook"" symptoms of nerve pain from a herniated disc is the appearance of sudden, intense pains in one or more of the limbs after the injury. This is caused by the fluid from the broken disc pressing on the base of the nerve and creating the sensation of pain even though the limb is not actually injured. Most commonly, a herniated disc will cause these shooting pains in one or both legs, though they can also sometimes lead to pains between the neck and arm.



Leg pain is usually most intense in the buttocks or hamstring, though it can also occur in the calf or foot. Arm pain can be centered in the neck, shoulder, elbow, hand, or the arm itself. In either case, the pain can be so bad that it causes you to grunt or wince and stop what you're doing, even if you're used to it. The pain usually occurs when performing an activity that puts stress on the lower back, not the limb itself. These include:
Standing up or sitting down.
Leaning back
Bending or twisting
Carrying something heavy
Straightening one leg in front of you (because this tightens the lower back and hip muscles, not because it uses the leg muscles), Another symptom of herniated disc injuries that's indicative of nerve pain is a distracting ""pins-and-needles"" feeling which is almost exactly like what you'd get if one of your limbs fell asleep. This feeling can be accompanied by numbness, but it can also occur without removing the feeling from the affected area. Usually, this feeling occurs in the same spots as the nerve pain from the injury.


The tingling feeling is not usually outright painful, so you don't need to ""sell"" it especially hard. However, you may want to make a point to mention it to add believability to your act. You can also pretend that using the affected limb while you have this tingling feeling gives you an oddly ticklish, numb feeling (again, just like if the limb had fallen asleep.)

, Nerve damage from a disc injury can cause the same muscles that are experiencing shooting pains to rapidly become weaker and less flexible than before, even if they don't look any different externally right away. These changes can even affect your posture and gait, especially when the pains are occurring in a leg. Sometimes, these problems are accompanied by twitching.For example, if you're faking leg pains from a disc injury, you might show the affects on our muscles like this:
Having a limping, lopsided gait that keeps the affected leg stiffer than normal. This should be especially bad right after doing something to aggravate the injury (bending, twisting, standing up, etc.)
Being unable to raise and straighten the affected leg very far in front of the body without pain and tightness (note that this is one of the clinical tests doctors will perform for this sort of injury)Being unable to perform activities that require leg strength without pain, like running, kicking, and especially high-impact activities like jumping.

, Most herniated discs occur in the lower back, so the injuries that cause them are usually from activities that put excessive stress on the muscles and structures there. Some herniated discs occur from a single, definite injury, while others develop over time from bad posture or aging. Below are a few activities known to cause disc injuries that you may want to work into your story:Sharply bending or twisting, especially when holding a heavy weight
Stressing the lower back by leaning back or forward with bad posture, especially when holding a heavy weight
Using back muscles (rather than leg muscles) to pick up heavy things.
Age-related wear and tear
Rarely, receiving a sudden blow to the back or falling

, Most medical agencies recommend that herniated discs that cause nerve pain should be examined by a doctor.While you should not fake your symptoms to a doctor (as this is a gross waste of his or her time and expertise), you may want to pretend to be thinking of seeing a doctor to enhance your illusion.


The pain from disc herniation can be lessened with anti-inflammatory treatments like ice packs, warm compresses, ibuprofen, and so on. However, these things alone will not make a disc herniation better — just temporarily decrease the pain. While most people with herniated discs eventually get better within six weeks, sometimes, more powerful pain medications and even surgery can be necessary.

Pretend to be undergoing treatment.",How to Fake a Back Injury3," A spinal fracture (also called a ""vertebral fracture"") is a very serious injury that can cause permanent damage to the body, though this is not necessarily guaranteed. Spinal fractures occur when one or more of the vertebrae in the back crack or come apart. The most immediate symptom is intense pain in the middle or lower back that makes it very difficult or impossible to continue doing what you're doing. This pain may be similar to what you might get from breaking another bone in your body (like, for instance, an arm bone), only localized in the back.


Faking this sort of pain can be a challenge. When the ""injury"" occurs, you'll want to cry out in pain, fall to the ground, and immediately start wincing or writhing in intense pain. If you can cry on command, this is a good time to use your skill.

, Like most broken bones, spinal fractures lead to persistent pain that lasts long after the initial injury. This pain is especially bad when doing anything that puts even minor stress on the back. This includes:Standing
Walking
Getting up or sitting down
Bending
Twisting

, One of the worst things about spinal fractures is that even lying in bed does not reduce the pain completely. Since it is impossible to lay horizontal without putting a little stress on some part of the back, even bed rest will be painful, though not as much as standing or moving around. Typically, for real fractures, this is mitigated with pain medication and narcotics.

, Because a spinal fracture results in actual physical damage to the bone structure of the back, it can cause noticeable changes in a person's stance and posture (though this was more common in the past when treatments for this type of injury were limited.) You may want to imitate this sort of damage as part of your act. Specifically, spinal fractures can cause:


A ""hunchback"" appearance
A decrease in height
The inability to stand straight up

, When a spinal fracture occurs, the bone from the broken vertebra can press against the nerves of the spinal cord (though this does not always happen.) When this occurs, symptoms that are very similar to those from a pinched nerve caused by a herniated disc can occur. These include:


Shooting pains in one or more limbs
A numb, tingling sensation like the limb has fallen asleep
Weakness and stiffness in the affected limbs
In severe cases, a loss of bladder/bowel control

, Spinal fractures are usually caused by sudden, violent injuries. It can be difficult to seriously fake these sorts of injuries — for instance, convincing your friends that you've just been in a car crash will require lots of work. However, knowing the sorts of injuries that can cause spinal fractures can still be helpful if you're pretending that you had one long ago. Examples of injuries that can cause spinal fractures include:Serious car crashes
Long falls
Gunshots
Violent sports injuries (tackles, etc.)
Combat injuries
Note that all of the examples above will usually also give you other injuries like broken bones, scars, lacerations, and so on. If you are aiming for authenticity, be aware of this.

, A spinal fracture is not something that can be treated in the home with a few over-the-counter pills. Spinal fractures require immediate medical attention to assess the damage done, administer drugs, and start addressing treating serious problems like nerve damage and so on. Don't seek actual treatment for your fake spinal fracture. As mentioned above, this is a blatant misuse of medical resources that can have major consequences. However, if you're pretending that you've already been dismissed from the hospital, you may want to do the following:Wear a back brace or a spinal cast
Stay off of your feet
Wear compression stockings (special socks designed to keep blood clots from forming in the legs for people who are bedridden)
Imitate the nerve damage symptoms indicated above
Take small doses of over-the-counter medications for pain and inflammation. Don't take actual medical-grade painkillers, as these can have serious side effects if misused.

Inhale a big, deep gust of air.,

Speak softly.,
Clear your throat repeatedly.",How to Fake a Cough in School," Breathe in through your nose for as long as you can. This is key to getting enough “power” behind your cough.If you don’t take in enough air, you will produce dainty, weak coughs that will not get anyone’s attention.


Take care to breathe in discreetly, so that it doesn’t look like you’re preparing for the big coughing show.;
, Begin coughing, but try to add some grit to it. Cough from deep within your diaphragm, as if you were giving a speech and attempting to project to the back row of a big room. This will help produce big, hearty coughs that will hopefully get some concern.


As you cough, try to hack up some phlegm to add texture to your cough. If it sounds like your cough is coming up a perfectly smooth airway, it won’t indicate sickness like a really scratchy, phlegmy cough.

, Remember the last time you had a real cough, and try to mimic the physical effect it had on your body. A real, violent cough will rattle your body, making you bend over a bit. As you cough, hunch over and place one hand on your stomach or your chest. Act as if this cough is coming from deep within and taking a toll on your whole body.

, First, covering your mouth is the polite and appropriate thing to do. Even when your cough is fake, it will still be unpleasant to those around you if you’re showering them with bits of saliva as you hack up a lung.Second, covering your mouth will allow you to distort the sound of your cough a bit more, so that you can achieve the really muddled, scratchy cough that will convince teachers of your sickness.


When you truly have a bad cough, you probably cover your mouth, try to quiet yourself down, and get it under control. Do the same thing when you’re faking a cough. Act as if you desperately want to calm it down to avoid distracting everyone so that the teacher knows you aren’t doing it for attention.

, If one moment you are pretending to violently cough and the next you’re turning around to chat with a friend, you probably won’t convince anyone. When you are faking a cough for the day, keep to yourself and try to avoid talking to others. If anyone asks why you’re so quiet, explain that your throat is tender and talking gives you pain.If you’re typically a very talkative student, this step can be incredibly convincing.

, Often when you have a sore throat or a bad cough, you probably touch your throat with your hand, even if it’s unconsciously. While you sit in class, working on homework or listening to your teacher, gently rub the outside of your throat and neck area. This will show the teacher that you are experiencing discomfort in that area even when you aren’t smack dab in the middle of a coughing fit.

, Many teachers will recommend that you do this if you’re coughing a lot, so show them that you’re already trying this technique.For an added effect, wince a very tiny bit as you take a sip of water, as if your throat is extremely sore. When you begin coughing, continue to drink the water as if you’re desperately trying to quiet your cough.

, This is for those students who are extremely serious about faking a cough! Sing at the top of your lungs or yell as loud as you can the day before. If you overexert your vocal cords, they will naturally be tender and raspy the following day. Besides, singing and yelling can be a lot of fun (and stress-relieving) anyways!Find a time to do this when you’re home alone or out with friends, otherwise your raspy voice can be easily explained away by adults.

, If the teacher calls on you or a friend asks a question, clear your throat delicately and respond in a quiet voice. If they tell you to speak up, explain that it hurts when you speak loudly. A bad cough can totally ravage your throat, so this will make your sickness seem more realistic.Apologize for not being able to speak, and act as if you are trying. This will reinforce the idea that your body is out of your control.

, Pretend that you constantly have something blocking in your airway, which is a common feeling when you have a real illness.By doing this, you will naturally create a bit of rasp in your voice, even if you aren’t sick. As gross as it sounds, try to really hack up some mucus so that it sounds convincing. Continuously sip on water as you do this, to make it look like you’re trying to take care of it.


Even though you want your teacher to take notice of your cough and discomfort, try not to become the center of attention. If you act overdramatic, your teacher (and classmates) may start to believe you have ulterior motives.

Catch the behavior in the moment.,
Address specific behaviors.,
Prepare for defensiveness.,
Use ""I"" statements.,
Model positive behavior.",How to Deal With Racist Parents1," In any difficult confrontation, people may feel attacked if you bring up incidents from the past. If your parents say something that comes off as racist or insensitive, talk to them about as soon as you can. It's best to address such things in the moment but this isn't always possible. If you're in public, for example, it might be hard to catch. If you can't address the issue immediately, bring it up later in the day or the next day.


Hold your parents accountable for their words and actions. If they say or do something racist in your presence, try to address it immediately. Ask them to clarify what they meant. Focus on your parents' words and behavior rather than their character as a whole. Never make it personal. Saying ""You're racist"" will only lead to defensiveness and resentment. Instead, try saying ""that statement makes a lot of assumptions"", or ""saying that lumps every person of one color together"". You will likely face resistance, but if you want your parents to be open to change you need to step up and address the issue at hand.Let's say your parents said some racist things about your friend. Start off by saying, ""Can we please talk about some of the conversation around the dinner table?"" Share what was stated in a tactful way to minimize the chances of your parents going on the defensive. For instance, you could say, ""I know you meant well when you stated that Asians are really smart, but it hurt Kyoko's feelings when you saw her according to her skin color rather than the person she is inside.""
Then listen to your parents' viewpoint. They most likely don't realize that their statements are hurtful, or perhaps they just don't know a lot about a different culture. This is your chance to educate your parents and to understand where they're coming from.
You can suggest ways for your parents to converse if they feel uncomfortable with spending time with people from other cultures. Encourage them to ask questions rather than make statements. For instance, they could ask, ""Does your family follow traditions from your culture? What traditions do you follow?"";
, When talking to someone about their racism, it's best to focus on specific behaviors. While you may be tempted to slam your parents for their character, keep in mind people are more receptive when you address their language and actions rather than dismantling their fundamental character.


Remember the difference between a ""What You Did"" conversation and a ""What You Are"" conversation. In a ""What You Did"" conversation, you'll bring up your parents' specific words and actions and why they were unacceptable to you. A ""What You Are"" conversation draws conclusions about your parents' fundamental character based on their actions. Even if you sincerely feel these conclusions are true, it may not be effective to address this. Your parents will resent that you're speculating on their character instead of focusing on the facts of the conversation at hand.Remember, just telling your parents they're racist allows them the opportunity to get off easy. They can easily derail such a conversation by denying that you know their internal character. Even if you're right, if you want to effectively address their racism, stay in the present moment and focus on specific, immediate actions., Even when talking about specific behavior, and focusing on actions over character, people in general do not take well to such conversations. People tend to deeply personalize accusations that their words or actions were racist.If your parents do get defensive at the word ""racist,"" then you can avoid the label and still get your point across. Focus on the behavior and why it was offensive without using the word ""racist"" to avoid triggering defensiveness in your parents.
Do not allow your parents to derail the conversation.Even if you frame the issue correctly, you may get responses like, ""I'm not racist."" If your parents say this, respond by focusing on the effect the statement has had on a person they spoke with, or the potential effect the statement can have on a person. You might say something like, ""What you said made her feel like you don't see her for who she truly is, but as a stereotype.""
There is no easy way to talk about racism. Keep in mind defensiveness is inevitable. Go into the situation expecting your parents to be defensive so you're not surprised when you're met with resistance., In any difficult conversation, using ""I"" statements can be helpful. These are statements that place focus on your emotional reaction to a situation. This avoids coming off as if you're making an objective judgment call. Even if you're in the right in the situation, passing judgments rarely results in resolving issues.


Instead of expressing your opinions on the situation as facts, focus on your own feelings. It will be more difficult for your parents to dismantle your claims when you're speaking in terms of your own worldview.Sentences should begin with ""I feel..."" and go from there. Do not use statements like, ""You make me feel..."" or ""It makes me feel..."" as this is pointing at a cause for your emotion. You want to avoid doing so as it can come off as blaming, which will make your parents feel judged and unwilling to change their ways. Instead of saying, ""The way you treated my friend at dinner embarrassed me"" say ""I feel embarrassed about the interaction between you and my friend at dinner. I think you really hurt her feelings and I felt really upset.""Your parents may be more receptive to this approach. Even if they do not fully understand their underlying racism, they might at least be willing to change for the sake of your feelings. This is a start when it comes to addressing racism. If they ask what they can do differently, say something like, ""Please don't comment on my friend's appearance anymore."", Oftentimes, the best way to deal with racist parents is to model good behavior for them. Be very conscientious about how you talk about different cultures and people of different races. Try to show your parents, rather than telling them, why embracing diversity is important.


Share with your parents the ways that your friends have helped you push your boundaries and helped you gain new perspective.
Avoid stereotyping.

Try to understand your parents' racism.,
Disengage in conversations that cause you discomfort.,
Recognize failure is likely.",How to Deal With Racist Parents2," While it can be hard to be understanding in regards to racist beliefs, try to get inside your parents' heads. Racism is a systemic issue very prevalent in many societies. It is often subtle and many people are unaware their actions and words have racist undertones.


The way people of color are portrayed in the media is often subtly racist. Words used to describe people of color, for example, are often riddled with outdated and offensive terminology. This is a phenomenon that does not just occur in hate speech but in well-known publications such as The New York Times. Over time, a person's perspective can be skewed without their knowing it by the perpetuation of stereotypes in the media. While this does not excuse racism, it can help you better understand your parents.Oftentimes, people are blind to their own racism. As already discussed, people get very defensive when it comes to discussions of race. Therefore, subtle racism often goes unchecked. Your parents may be unable to see their own racist viewpoints. You can work your best to point out your parents' racism, but try to understand how subtle racism really is and why it's so difficult to get people who harbor racist beliefs to change.For instance, the media often demonizes black victims and can actually appear sympathetic to whites suspected of serious crimes, including mass shootings., At a certain point, you have to accept the fact that racism is a deep-seated belief system that's difficult to change. You should seek to develop a no-tolerance policy regarding racist comments, especially if discussing them with your parents takes an emotional toll on you.


If your parents try to bait you into an argument, do not engage. Acknowledge their feelings, and promptly move on to another topic.
It is very difficult for people to change their ingrained beliefs. Sometimes the best thing you can hope for is that they will eventually evolve to become less racist. Angry words, incrimination, accusations, and withdrawal will be of no avail and will only fuel more resentment. Instead, if you simply tell your parents how much you love them and how much you appreciate everything they’ve done for you, they are more likely to reconsider their beliefs after they’ve had more time. After all, they love you as much as you love them. Also, try to recruit other family members who are more sympathetic to your beliefs, and have a conversation with them to see how they may be able to lend their support., Keep in mind it is very rare that people change their viewpoints, especially if they're set in age. It is very likely approaching your parents about their racism will do nothing to change the problem. However, addressing certain behaviors is still important. Racism is able to sustain itself because people often remain silent and do not want to force uncomfortable discussions. Silence is sometimes seen as an endorsement or acceptance of racist viewpoints. Make sure you make it clear to your parents that you do not agree with their point of view. While the conversation may end poorly, you still need to have it."

, If you have any siblings, the company of family members besides your parents can be a great comfort. Depending on the sort of relationship you have with brothers or sisters, you can share a variety of activities together. In some cases, you might even be able to do things with them that you would otherwise be banned from, like video games and movies. In general however, it's recommended that you simply try to talk to them. Conversation can be very enjoyable on its own when it's with the right people.


Board games are an enjoyable, disconnected way to spend time. You will need other players to play however. If you have siblings, you should try to enlist them in a game or two.

Do things that will take your mind off of the situation at home.,
Do not start drinking yourself.,
Get out if your parent becomes abusive.,
Do not be afraid to tell someone.",How to Deal With an Alcoholic Parent," The most common cause is depression. It doesn't happen very often that a person becomes an alcoholic without being depressed; moreover, drinking does nothing but make one even more depressed. The only difference between being depressed when sober and being depressed when drunk is that people forget about themselves and can lose control of their actions when intoxicated. It's important to know that despite the fact that some actions are blamed on loss of control, the overall responsibility of their control is up to the person who is drinking. They are the ones who make the choice to drink, and so the person who drinks somehow eases a burden by pushing that responsibility off onto someone, or something else. It's more difficult to deal with your problems when sober; when you are drunk you can refuse responsibility for everything.;
, Find a time when both of you are calm and your parent has not been drinking. Sit your parent down and discuss how their alcoholism makes you feel. Explain the problems that have arisen because of the drinking. You will probably not be able to convince your parent to stop drinking completely but you can at least encourage more responsible drinking and try to inject some realism into their understanding of the impacts.


Make it clear what behavior you will and won't tolerate. This is not about telling a parent what to do–about ensuring your own safety and well-being. Say that if they keep getting drunk, you will take action (such as getting in help, leaving to stay with someone else, etc.).
Encourage your parent to talk about possible reasons for the depression that fuels it. Showing compassion is not the same thing as tolerating or enabling your parent. You can encourage seeking therapy for the depression but don't be discouraged or surprised if your parent refuses to entertain this idea–it's fairly confronting as it requires taking responsibility.
Ask your parent to take a gradual approach to reducing their reliance on alcohol. It won't work asking them to stop drinking all at once but you can tell them to at least decrease the amount of drinking day by day or week by week.

, A heated argument with a drunk parent is one you will rarely win and it will make the drinker clam up in any future talks. There is a risk of you getting physically hurt, too. In addition, your parent may not even remember the argument the next day, though she or he might remember that they were mad at you.


Avoid sounding as if you're accusing or nagging. Remember that as your parent, they will feel disrespected if you try to tell them what to do. Instead, phrase it as a request coming from their loving and concerned child.

, If you tell your alcoholic parent that you will do certain things as a consequence of their drinking, stick to it. Inconsistency will only make your parent realize that you don't mean what you say and lets them continue to pull the emotional triggers that keep you stuck in enabling their behavior.


Do not facilitate your parent's alcoholism by purchasing or obtaining alcohol for them. Equally, don't provide money for your parent to get alcohol with. If you've already gotten into a pattern like this, realize that while it will be hard to stop doing so, it is important to be consistent with your desire to see them sober again.

, Many alcoholic parents blame their children for their alcoholism. Even without having the finger pointed at you, it may feel like the fault is yours. It isn't. Your parent is the one who chooses to drink, not you. Part of the allure of alcohol is that it does allow a person to become a bit more ""Teflon-coated""–in other words, rather than taking responsibility for their life and actions, alcohol lubricates the ability to level blame at others.


You may feel resentment, especially if you've had to take over household chores.

, Get a journal and write down everything you feel. Or, if you're afraid your parent will find it, get an online journal and make it private. Clearing your history will help minimize the chances of getting caught. Keeping a journal may help you put your feelings into words. Finding ways to express your feelings will help you process and deal with them, whereas bottling them up inside will simply create a pressure-cooker type situation–and when you blow, it may be spectacular. That's not desirable. Instead, try to deal with things in smaller, daily bits.


Looking after your feelings and yourself should be the biggest priority. Worrying all of the time about a parent's alcoholism is ultimately draining and can leave you feeling upset, confused and embarrassed. Exploring your feelings is an important part of acknowledging them.

, For example, if you're going out somewhere, make sure you have a backup plan in case your parent gets drunk and can't (or forgets to) pick you up. Always have backup plans, options and other people to help you out of tight spots if needed. Being resourceful will stand you in good stead both now and in the future.

, Go out with your friends often and have fun. Joining a sports team, reading and drawing are also good activities that will help you escape when you need a break. There is not much you can do to control your own situation at home, so staying when you can with reliable family and friends who care about you will help you feel more stable and in control of your own life.

, Children of alcoholics are three to four times more likely to become alcoholics themselves. Remember everything about your parent when drunk that you do not like and keep that in mind if you're tempted.

, Never tolerate abuse or violence. You need to get out before things escalate or continue the way they are if the abuse has been happening for a while.


Have emergency numbers ready to fast dial on your phone.
Know who to contact and where to go if you need a safe haven. Make sure you have enough money to get you to safety, well hidden.
Do not hesitate–nobody deserves to be harmed, no matter what the relationship. You are not being disloyal when you seek to protect yourself.

, A best friend, school counselor, trusted teacher, or family member are all good choices. They won't judge you, and they'll try to help. And knowing there is someone who knows or understands what you're going through can be very comforting if things get rough.


It is a very good idea to tell a trusted person about your home's situation, as not only will you feel better for it, you'll also have someone ""on your side"". If talking with a friend, approach them (or their parents) and tell them of the severity of your parent's drinking; bring up the topic when the time is right. Ask if you can rely on them if you need a place to spend a night or two, should your parent get out of hand.

Most of the time it's not what you say, but how you say it that matters more. You have to have the courage, the right words and the self- control to not be too emotional. Tell your parent the following: I feel like you resent/reject me (cite some instances when you felt this way), I want to know if I am right about it. If so, then I want to know why you behave that way towards me. What can we do together to make things better for us? The key here is openness, respect and self-control, otherwise this conversation will turn into an ugly, fiery argument. When a parent rejects a child, it's usually a combination of reasons that causes it. Most parents, even if they are controlling, dominating, or rejecting, actually do love their children. Even if you feel that's not true of your parents, and you feel completely unloved by one or both, you are a unique and worthwhile person. Your siblings love you, your grandparents love you, your friends love you. Remember that.;
, If your parent(s) have rejected you because you've come out as gay, because they disapprove of your choice of spouse, or because of religious differences, it's unlikely that you're going to be able to change in order to gain their approval and/or acceptance again. In these cases, time is usually the best cure - if you make yourself open to contact, but try not to force it before they are ready, they may come around eventually. Meanwhile, remember that your life is yours alone, and you are free to live it as you see fit, with or without your parents' approval or permission.

, Sometimes you feel rejected by a parent because that parent seems to favor a sibling. You are compared (usually unfavorably) to your brother or sister, and this hurts. The reality is that we all like some people better than others. While parents are supposed to love their children equally, some just can't be bothered to make an effort to understand a child that is difficult for them to read, or is so different from them personally that they find little in common. If this is the case, try not to view your siblings unfavorably, but instead simply understand that if you are going to be true to yourself, your parent may not ever be as comfortable with you as with your brother or sister. It may hurt now, but later in life, you will cherish your individuality and all that makes you a unique person, and will realize that these traits do not make you undesirable - they only make it harder for you and your parents to connect.

, It may have been repeated many times in other sources, but it does help. Talk it out. Talk to your parents and try to root out the problem. Or talk to a sibling or a close relative. If someone is willing to talk, there is always someone willing to listen. Some of the most caring people work at Child Line, or other similar resources. It sounds drastic, but Child Line is there for any child who feels upset. You can remain anonymous and just chat with them for some friendly advice. And if you don't want to actually verbally speak, go on the internet, whether at home or at an internet cafe, and talk to people here at the Discussion Page on this article. There are even folks who are willing to chat with you through wikiHow.

, If you've been kicked out or you don't want to, or dare not stay at home, go to a relative's home or stay with friends if possible. It may not be permanent, but it will get you through for a time.

, Do try to sort it out with your parents. Send them a card, and/or flowers, or just go home and talk it through. Let them have their say and then have yours, but be calm, and don't be afraid to cry - crying can give you a great sense of release. Try to find common ground, and ask them how you and they can be better family to each other.

, This does not mean you should excuse this damaging, hurtful attitude. But it may be helpful to you to know that they may not ever really understand that how hurtful their actions are. Some parents truly are hateful, and it's a mystery why they ever had children to begin with - these people are best left alone as soon as you are able. But some parents are rejecting because you will not follow their plans for your life - they make plans for you starting from the time you are in your cradle. They believe that if you will only follow the path they have set out for you, you will avoid all hurts and be ""set for life"" - prosperous and ""perfect."" Example: If they wanted you to be a doctor, but you decided to be an artist, they may express their disappointment in their own failure to control and dictate the terms of your life by constantly carping at you about how stupid, disappointing, etc. your choices are, what a failure you are, and the like. Sometimes parents misguidedly feel that this type of censure will ""jolt you into reality."" They believe that this is ""for your own good,"" and that behaving this way will ""help"" you to make right choices, and leave behind the supposedly wrong choices you are making. The reality is that you feel like a failure in their eyes, and feel unloved by them.

, You may not have many choices until you are an adult - you may just have to try your best to endure until then. But once you are, if you have tried talking with them, and all your efforts to remedy this problem have failed, then accept whatever you can. It is pointless to berate yourself - it's not about you, it's about them. Your job in life is to be the best person you can, to experience life on your terms, and to be a kind, caring and giving friend or family member. Your job is not to try to change them, just as they should stop trying to do to you. These may not be the parents you would have wished for. Nevertheless, these are the parents you have. If you can simply understand that they will not change (just like you), then you can limit your exposure while having as good a relationship with them as possible. If your parents tend to be polite at first, and then descend, after an hour or so, into criticisms, make sure you spend no more than an hour at a time with them. Go to their home, have a drink or a snack or a cup of tea, and then say, ""Well, it's been good to see you - I've got to run!"" And leave before it turns unpleasant. If you know that the unpleasantness begins sooner, stay away. Call them on the phone, and as soon as criticism or berating begins, say, ""Okay, Mom, well, I understand all that, but I really need to get going. See you soon."" And hang up. If all contact is extremely difficult and horrible, cut them off altogether and make a new family for yourself out of friends, or another branch of the family. It's all about doing what works for you.

How to Deal With Difficult Relatives

, Do not harm yourself. Self harm is NOT the answer. Do not take your anger out on someone else by harming them.


How to Stop Cutting Yourself

, If you're still a minor, consider going to a nearby youth club. Talk to the youth club owners, they'll be able to help you, and while you're at it, have some fun with some kids of your own age. If that doesn't appeal, go to a gym to work the punching bags or run around your school's or a local park's racetrack if you're not a gym member. If you enjoy writing, write your feelings out on paper, but instead of writing in first person write in third, so you refer to yourself as s/he. This takes your mind off of the anger/pain. This can also provide very good release, so write passionately and with all of your heart and soul. When done, release any leftover anger by ripping and tearing it to bits. Or release sadness by burning the paper, and sending the ashes to Heaven on the wind.


How to Release Anger
How to Get Closure

, If you allow others to decide who you are, you will never be happy. You will always be aiming to please others, rather than yourself. While that may be noble and selfless, the truth is, you need to be true to your own self. If your parents don't get you, that doesn't mean your life is any less valuable or significant. You don't get certain people - they don't stop living because you and they differ on certain things. Same with you - others may have opinions. That's fine - everyone has opinions. Your opinions are just as valid as anyone else's.


How to Stop Being a People Pleaser

, Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you come to a point when you realize that your parents will never accept you as you are. Every encounter with them is as painful or worse than the one before, and no progress is being made at all. In these (rare) cases, you have to know when you've done all you can do, and move on with your own life. Cut contact to a minimum, or cut it off altogether. Although it's painful at first, it can be as healthy as cutting out a cancer.



How to End a Controlling or Manipulative Relationship - While these steps are aimed at someone escaping a romantic relationship, much of the advice can be applied to a parental relationship.

, Many children of unloving parents find themselves having one or two wonderful friends - a great comfort in itself. But when your friend learns that going home for holidays is painful, s/he may invite you to celebrate with his/her family. If this becomes a habit, you may feel more at home with this family than you do your own. While you don't want to encroach upon your friend, many friends will consider you part of their own family, and will welcome you this way - will celebrate your milestones with you, etc. Or you may find that you meet others who have little or no family of their own, and you may form a family-like friendship. This is a wonderful way to cope with this problem.


How to Make Friends

, In spite of your parental units' rejection of you, you can have an excellent, productive, and rewarding life. You are awesome.

Make plans with friends once your grounding is up.",How to Have Fun While You Are Grounded2," Surfing the internet takes up hours of people's time without them even realizing it. The internet has a virtually unlimited stream of information. Try Google searching something you find interesting, or go for an info hunt on Wikipedia.If you just want the time to pass faster, sites like Buzzfeed specialize in mildly amusing distractions.The possibilities for the web are endless, and virtually every curiosity can be satisfied with a working internet connection.

, Nothing quite makes the time fly past than a great TV show. Shows from AMC and HBO are often film-quality, and can keep you occupied for hours and hours. Watch a show via Netflix or your computer. It's recommended that you do this in your bedroom where it's private. If your parents see you watching TV, they might make a stink about it.


Movies are always recommended as well, but because it's assumed you probably have a fair amount of time on your hands, you have a perfect opportunity to catch up on longer TV shows.

, Video games are lots of fun. If you have a console in your house, there's a good chance you already go out of your way to play them. If it's just a matter of not being able to go see friends, video games are a great way to kill time. What's more, you can play a multiplayer game and interact with your friends as such.

, Luckily, if your phone wasn't confiscated, you can keep in contact with them over the phone. Let your friends in on the situation, and get them to keep you up to date on what's going on with the outside world.

, If you have your phone or a computer and wish you were out with friends, it can feel good to make plans for a day after you're ungrounded again. Suggest to go see a movie together, or meet up for food. Although it won't change your current setting much, the fact that you'll have a social event to look forward to once the punishment is over.

Apologize.Even if you're not entirely sorry for what you did, apologizing to your parents for what you did will work out big in your favour.,
See things from their perspective.When parents ground you, they're usually not doing it just as a way to get at you.,
Negotiate a deal.,
Keep your emotions under control.If you've been grounded for whatever reason, it is natural to feel angry.",How to Have Fun While You Are Grounded3," If your parents think you are truly regretful for whatever you did, they'll be that much more likely to ease restrictions and unground you.

, Rather, they're using a punishment to teach you a lesson. If you try to understand why they've grounded you, your attitude towards them may change. Try to put yourself in your parents' shoes. Whether you think you deserved to be grounded or not, try to imagine how something looked from their perspective. Most parents do not go out of their way to be purposefully unfair. Trying to empathize with your parents' side may help you better understand the situation.


If you end up feeling like you deserved some form of punishment, the grounding won't feel as bad. On the other hand, if you empathize and still feel like things were misinterpreted, you can bring the issue up with them if you think they're open for discussion.

, Many parents will accept other forms of restitution as a way to replace or shorten the grounding. While you'll most definitely need to apologize first in order to open a dialogue with them, you should come prepared with a few ideas on how you're going to make up for whatever it is you did. For example, you should suggest that a day of your grounding be removed in exchange for doing the dishes or sweeping the downstairs floors. These alternative punishments are usually a hit with parents because they'll get something real done for them.


Some parents are very strict and won't be open to negotiating. This is something you'll have to deal with if you're in a strict family setting.

, However, letting these feelings loose will only spell bad news for you and your family situation. Even if you think you're being punished without cause, you should make a firm point of keeping your composure. A simple grounding can be made into something much worse if fighting keeps up.

You're probably angry at your parents for grounding you and you're probably upset about other stuff too. That's okay! Everyone gets upset and has stressful feelings. But if you want to show your parents that you're being responsible and are going to act like an adult, it means that you have to show them that you can handle being upset like an adult too.


Don't act upset or mope around the house. Instead, make the most of your time while you're grounded and keep a positive attitude.
Don't be passive-aggressive with your parents or rude to them. Even if your grounding wasn't fair, being mean to them because of it will not help get you un-grounded.;
, When talking to your parents, use polite language like ""please"", ""thank you"", and ""ma'am"" or ""sir"" if your parents prefer those terms. When you talk to your parents, use a voice that is calm, quiet, and friendly. When you can, do nice things for them, such as helping them get out the door in the morning or cleaning up their plate at dinner.

, Do chores around the house to show that you're ready to grow up and take responsibility. Vacuum the house, clean the toilet, wash the windows, keep your room very tidy, do the dishes, and pick up after any younger siblings (or messy older siblings!) that you have.


You can also ask your parents if there's a chore that they'd like help with.
Cleaning out the garage, basement, or attic is also very helpful, since your parents often ignore this because it is very time consuming.

, Be very kind to your family members and help them out or generally do nice things for them. This can mean playing with younger siblings and helping them get ready in the morning (even helping them with their homework!), or it might mean making your grandmother a special dinner and bringing it to her house. You can also help your parents, by doing things like ironing their work shirts or making them a lunch.


Just make sure you ask your family members if it's okay to help them before you do anything.

, When you're grounded, you often won't be allowed to do the fun stuff that you normally do. While you might want to sit around the house and be angry because you're bored, find better ways to spend your time if you want to make your parents see that you're ready to be ungrounded.


For example, you could read a book. This is also very calming and lets you feel like you get to escape!
Another good option is to use the time to teach yourself a new skill. You could teach yourself how to do a better free throw, how to draw, or anything else that seems fun to you.

, Show the same respect to your teachers that you would show to a military general. Speak to them politely, pay attention when they talk, and never talk back to them. You should also think about honestly asking them for advice and help, and then taking the advice and help. Even if a teacher seems mean, when you have an honest relationship with them their hearts will melt and you will get along better than ever before.


Just remember that if you were very bad before, it might take time and some work to build up trust.

, Don't bully, tease, or pick fights with your fellow students. If they try to fight you, get help from an adult. Anyone that teases you for asking an adult for help was just looking for an excuse to be mean to you anyway and you don't really want to be friends with them. They're jerks!

, Work really hard on your schoolwork to try to get your grades up. Do your homework as soon as you get home, study for your tests, and ask your teacher about extra credit.

, If you're having a hard time with the work, ask your teacher about getting a tutor or staying during lunch to get extra help. You can also get friends to help you, if they're better at the subject than you.

, If you're good in another subject, ask your teacher if there is anybody in your class or in a lower grade that might need tutoring. Being responsible like this and helpful to other people will really impress your parents.

, Once you've shown your parents how responsible you are, ask them if you all can sit down together and have a serious talk. Say something like:


""Mom, Dad, would it be okay if we had a meeting after dinner to talk about the way I acted? I'd like it if we can work together to find a solution and make things better.""

, Tell your parents why you did the bad thing you did. It's a good thing for them to understand your feelings and thoughts. They should see that you thought you were doing the right thing or that you were struggling with some tough feelings. Say something like:


""I'm sorry that I was fighting with Becky. She took my journal and that made me feel really violated and angry.""

, Never make excuses for what you did or make it seem like it was someone else's problem. Say that you know what you did was wrong and upset them, even if you don't really agree. Then, tell them why what you did was wrong. This will help them see that you've learned your lesson. Say something like:


""It was wrong to hit Becky. I know that. Hitting her isn't going to make better what she did. I should have come to you.""

, Apologize again, in a sincere, meaningful way. Ask them to forgive you and what they would like you to do in order to make things better.

, This is the biggest risk. If you get grounded a lot or what you did made your parents really angry, this is probably not going to work and might even make things worse. After seeing how good you've been, your parents might feel manipulated and betrayed. Be careful if you decide to go this route.


Say something like, ""You were right. I made a mistake. But I've really learned my lesson. I was really hoping that you'd think about letting me off of this punishment. I promise, will change and be better in the future.""

, A safer option is to ask to be grounded for less time. If you were supposed to be grounded for a month, for example, and you've already done two weeks, ask to have the last week taken off.


Say something like: ""I think I've shown you that I'm willing to change and improve. I hope you agree. If you do and I continue to show good behavior, can we end my grounding a little bit earlier?""

, Renegotiate the terms of your grounding. See if they're willing to make exceptions for big events that you would be missing because of your grounding, such as your prom or a weekend summer camp. Ask to be allowed to attend your important event in exchange for an extra week or two of being grounded. Your parents will probably like this option best.


You can also ask for a change to your restrictions. For example, you can ask to remain grounded but now be allowed to certain tv programs or have some (but less than normal) time on the computer.

, This is a risky option but has more benefits than you'd think. If you don't get grounded very often, then just having good behavior might be enough to get your parents to let you do stuff even if you are still grounded (as long as you ask really nicely). If you get grounded more often, taking your punishment like a mature adult and showing all this good behavior might earn points with your parents in the future.

, A lot of the time, the reason that you get grounded is for starting fights at school, arguing with your siblings, or being rude to your parents. It's very normal and reasonable to be upset when you think people have treated you unfairly, but if everyone went around starting fights and being mean every time something didn't go their way, what do you think the world would be like? Being rude or violent also stops you from actually solving the problem that you're having. Instead, try talking to the person you're having a problem with or to an adult that can help.


Remember that sometimes things in life are just hard and unpleasant. There might not be a way to get around problems sometimes, but by staying calm and kind you'll be becoming more like an adult and less like a kid.

, Another common source of groundings is bad grades and reports from your teachers. While it's fun to blow off school and hang out with your friends instead, it's really important to work hard in school. If you don't you'll have a really hard time in the future, getting a job and paying for the things you want. If you don't feel smart, talk to your teacher. They may be able to find a way to help you understand the material better.

, Sometimes your friends make you into a bad person. Even if your friends themselves are pretty cool people, sometimes putting the two of you together makes things harder for both of you. If you have friends that want you to do things that get you in trouble or put you in danger, those people are not your friends. They're selfish. You should get friends that really care about you.

, Having fun things to do that keep you busy and away from things your parents don't like can be a great way to prevent yourself from getting grounded in the future. Picking up a musical instrument, starting writing short stories or poetry, teaching yourself how to draw, or even just starting an exercise routine can all be fun ways to spend your time.

You can even make wikiHow your hobby! We can always use more help keeping away the trolls!

, When we're working towards a goal, it's easier to stay on track and out of trouble. Give yourself a goal and start working towards that goal. Maybe you want to save up for a new Xbox? Find work around your neighborhood and save up. You can even get your parents to pay you small amounts of money each time you get a good grade.


Working hard like this will no only make things better for you, it will also show your parents that you are mature. This will make them much more likely to forgive you when you do make mistakes.

, Sometimes, when it's our behavior that gets us in trouble, we're acting out and causing trouble because we're stressed, worried, or angry. If you want to avoid getting grounded for bad behavior like this, it's a good idea to find good ways to release those bad feelings and get away from the things that are causing you problems.


Going for a walk is a great way to get away from annoying family problems and relax.
Reading in a quiet spot is also a great way to relax.

Show your parents a little respect and even consider doing something nice for them. However, remember that, if you did nothing wrong, you shouldn't pretend to apologize and repent just to get out of the punishment. Virtue and honesty is better than comfort.;
, Compromise with them to see if they will unground you. Try to talk them into making your grounding shorter, or ask if they will give you an alternative punishment, like doing extra chores or giving you a spanking instead. If that doesn't work then give up, your parents won't budge they will see that you aren't enjoying your punishment and think they are doing the right thingRespond in a mature way. Do not throw tantrums or give them the silent treatment. These responses will only confirm in their minds that they're doing the right thing.

, Spend some time talking and hanging out with your parents. Instead of focusing on how mad you are about being grounded, try to change the subject by spending time with your parents. This will help everyone forget how upset they are and might help you get ungrounded more quickly.

, Making good grades, or at least showing your parents that you are trying to improve your grades, will also show your parents that you are acting responsibly. Working on your schoolwork will also show your parents that you are thinking about the future, which is a sign of responsibility., Go above and beyond doing your chores and ask your parents if you can help them with anything else. Give your mom a hand with dinner or help your dad in the garage. Take your family dog for a walk. Do anything that will show your parents you are trying to be helpful and responsible.

, If your parents don't unground you, then just make the best of your situation. Being grounded doesn't always have to be boring. Find out what your parents will let you do and take advantage of it.


Try playing with your siblings or running around with your dog. Spend some time outdoors or bake some cookies with your mom. Or suggest an activity that your whole family can do together like going for a hike or playing a board game.

, If you keep nagging to get ungrounded, it might result in you getting a longer punishment. But it will definitely show your parents that you haven't learned your lesson and that you aren't ready to be ungrounded.

, Instead of focusing on what you don't have or what you're being restricted from, try thinking about all the things you do have: a roof over your head, parents who love you enough to discipline you, etc. When you are ungrounded, be thankful that you can once again participate in the activities that you enjoy. Thank your parents for helping you learn from your mistakes.


Actually saying the words is important here. Show your parents you are truly thankful for providing for you by saying thank you.


, Don't repeat the same action that got you grounded this time and promise your parents that you'll never do it again. Don't get grounded so you won't have to try to get out of being grounded.

, Your parents want you to learn from your mistakes, so if you let them know that you are sorry for what you have done, they will remember it in the future.


Try beginning the conversation with something like, I know I broke your trust with my actions. I am very sorry and I hope that you will forgive me.


, Show your parents that you deserve their trust and respect by showing them consistently positive behavior. You won't get grounded if your parents approve of the choices you are making.

When your parents are asleep or not home, you can play on the computer while they are gone.,
Open up the computer and play your games.

,
If you hear your parents wake up/come home IMMEDIATELY turn off the computer, rush up to them and stall them with questions.",How to Secretly Play Video Games when You're Grounded2,";
,, Don`t be overly suspicious!

"
This method is easier, especially if you have siblings!

,
Tell your mom/dad that you need to use the computer for schoolwork.,
Open up 2 or more tabs or webpages and play the stuff you want, but make sure at least 1 of the tabs or webpages are school-related stuff.

,
If you hear a parent coming, close everything except the school-related page(s) so it appears you are doing research for a project or something like that.

,
When they leave, open up the other webpages and keep playing.

,If parents ask to see your ""project"", say ""I`ll show it to you after it`s graded""

,After a while say, ""I was trying to take my graded project home but (say something like a dog chewed it, it flew out the bus window)

,
However, taking it this far can be suspicious.",How to Secretly Play Video Games when You're Grounded3,", They usually let you on for this.

,,,,,, if your school posts your grades online, ask to go on to see your grades. This is much easier because you don`t have to do any ""work"" and it involves less lying!

Try to have a plan on where you're going and able to meet someone or be with someone while you are sneaking out.,
Plan how you're going to get out and where you are going to go and how long you will take (do this during the day when no one is watching).,
Prepare physically and mentally for your big night.,
If your parents wake up, have a good excuse ready.,
Try to dress in an appropriate color;


Black: Rarely found in nature, actually a poor choice.,
Make a clean exit out of your house.,
Be quiet when walking through the house.,
Keep a watch with you.,
Step outside quietly and breathe in the cold, moist night air.,
Start sneaking around.,
Sneak back in the house the way you came out.,
Keep caffeine or some other form of artificial energy in your room.",How to Sneak Out of Your House at Night," (A girlfriend/boyfriend or group of friends is common, but don't make the group too big or you will be noticed.);
, Do not write this down on paper, as it can be evidence to your parents. Mentally, try to plan out;


Fencing, terrain, lighting and hiding spots where you will be going
Blind spots from the windows of nearby houses
Floor creaks or squeaky doors and windows
Naturally occurring things, such as weather and moon phase
Time you are departing
Method of exit from home - must be quiet,
Consider nearby barking dogs and avoid them and any other animals
Path taken to destination
Path taken back home
Method of entry in home
Stay away from the main streets
Estimate of how long all this will take
Excuses, backup plans, things you'll need, etc.

, Eat 2 hours before and drink one hour before. 15 minutes before departing, get dressed up, but no earlier or you will risk being discovered by your parents. Also, at about 15 minutes, have an energy gel - they are like goo and contain caffeine usually and complex sugars. Pack all the stuff you'll need, but make sure you don't get weighed down too much by it. Remember you're only sneaking out don't over think it.


Stretch before sneaking. In the dead of night, your joints creaking and popping can be much louder than you may anticipate. Stretching before you go out is a great way to ensure being able to move smoothly without cracking all of your joints.

, The classic ""glass of water"" excuse seems to work fairly well. If you were caught coming back inside, you may want to say you were merely admiring the stars. It's always good to have multiple excuses for any and every possible situation. Another thing to remember is to think of your excuses before you start sneaking. If you already have the conversation planned out, they're less likely to discover your lie.


Know how your parents wake up. Some people take a while to wake up, while others are instantly alert the moment their eyes open. Sometimes you can abandon your sneaking, and quickly run upstairs to your room, before their sleepy mind can process what they just heard. If your parents have the ears of secret agents, you're probably best to try and sneak back to your room, but walk normally once they come within eyesight of you. Remember to think of a good excuse.

, Only good for asphalt and parking lots.
Slate gray: Good for concrete and other urban settings.
Navy blue/midnight blue: Matches the general color of the night, allowing versatility in most settings.
Olive drab/military green/: Good for both dense and thin green foliage, in suburban settings you will probably find yourself hiding in bushes and grass hills often, this would be a decent choice.
Khaki: Good for dead foliage and desert settings.
White: Good for snow, a white outfit with a few digital black and grey specks works best.
Brown: Good for crawling through big areas with only dirt and no plants.

, Everyone's house is different, so you will have to try to figure out a few things for yourself. Be sure to walk quietly and avoid squeaky spots in the floor. Make sure to go out the farthest window or door from your parents. Try not to run into any furniture, as this could both hurt and make noise. Bring with you anything you might need, depending on where you are going. For example, money, flashlight, pocket knife, etc.


Leave a screwdriver or butter knife in your window or the door to hold it a crack open so you don't get locked out. Bring a front door key just in case. If you sleep on a second floor, consider getting a roll down fire escape ladder. Put some stuffed animals under your covers to make it look like it's your body. Leave your door as it normally is to avoid suspicion from your parents - and do not lock it! In case they do figure out that you are missing, leave a note saying you are fine that you have cash for a pay phone and not to call the police.

, Here are some things to do:


When walking down stairs (particularly creaky stairs) try to stick close to the walls. This is where the boards are most reinforced. It is also a good idea to check the stairs during the day to try and memorize which steps are creaky.
If you have to, press against the walls with your hands to put as much weight on your arms. This will take some of the weight off of your feet, and minimize creaking.
Turn doorknobs very slowly. Also, know what your door is going to do when you open it. Some squeaky doors can be opened quietly by quickly opening it before it has a chance to squeak, while others require you to open it very slowly. Know your environment.

, Make sure you notice what time it is, and how long it takes you to get to and from the desired place. Be sure to be back at least an hour before your parents usually get up.

, Take a moment to appreciate the crickets and far away traffic and airplanes, look at the moon with the thin clouds floating by and the stars. This helps create the right attitude and teaches you to be silent as a ninja and become part within nature. If you are really nervous, stay in the garden and just appreciate the night. This will help you be at ease, so you feel more confident when you go out.

, Now that you have gotten out of front lawn, it's time to rock and roll. Stay low, stay quiet, and stay alert. Watch your back and walk quietly.

, Remember—it's actually easier to get caught sneaking back in than it is to be caught sneaking out. Don't get cocky and think that you have already succeeded. Be very quiet, the best thing to do now is to get undressed and mess up your hair and stop by the kitchen for a cup of water so you have an excuse if your parents hear you coming upstairs, And be sure to lock the door that you came in so your parents don't notice something is up.

, Your parents will be suspicious if you sleep in until past noon (unless that is your normal sleeping habit) or if you are obviously extremely tired the next day. Drink an energy drink or some caffeinated soda so you are not too tired.

Find a good time to talk.,
Apologize.,
Don't make excuses.,
Use ""I"" statements to describe how you are affected by the punishment.,
Suggest the chance to earn back your privileges slowly.,
Suggest an alternate punishment.,
If this doesn't work, try again in a few days.",How to Get Off of Punishment Early," Show that you're willing to help out your parents or guardians, and they may be less angry or strict. Wash the dishes, take out the trash, or clean up after a younger siblings.;
, If you're serious about trying to get the punishment to end early, follow the restrictions your parents have put down. If they discover you didn't obey them, they may even increase the length of your punishment.

, Your parents might watch your behavior to siblings, older relatives, and family friends when deciding whether to keep punishing you. Be nice to your siblings or anyone else who lives in your house, and make an effort to talk politely with your parents' friends.

, Retreating to your room and sulking may make your parents more irritated at you. One of the most convincing ways to show you're making an effort is to volunteer to go with them to family events, such as visiting relatives or visiting a restaurant. If you're too angry to stay polite with your parents, try an activity that doesn't involve much talking, such as watching a movie together.

, Your parents probably know that you're acting extra-nice because you want to get off punishment. The longer you keep acting this way, preferably a few days or more for a longer-term punishment, the more likely you are to convince your parents that you deserve less punishment.

, You may find it easier to have a conversation with just one person at a time. This is especially true if one parent is stricter or angrier at you than the other one.

, Ask your parent whether he is busy before you ask your question. Make it clear that you want to talk about the punishment before you begin talking.If he seems irritated or distracted, ask whether there is a better time to talk to him.

, It may hurt your pride, especially if you do not think you did anything wrong. However, your parent does, and she probably won't change her mind on the punishment unless you agree with her.

, When you apologize, don't try to pass on the blame to someone else, or even part of the blame. You may explain briefly why it happened, but it's best only to talk about your own actions.

, Talk about your own feelings, and avoid using the word ""you,"" which can sound accusing.For instance, ""I take a walk outside when I need to relax, so I feel stressed when I'm not allowed to leave the house."" or ""I know I did something bad, but I'm not sure this punishment is giving me the opportunity to show I can do better.""

, This works best for long term punishments, such as grounding that lasts several weeks or months. For instance, ask for the ability to leave the house, but with an earlier curfew. If you show you can follow these terms, your parents might continue to reduce the punishment or end it early.


Some experts on parenting recommend that parents follow this strategy. Be cautious about telling this to your parents, though. They may not appreciate their child telling them about good parenting practices.

, Your parents might let you exchange your current punishment for another one. Depending on the situation, you might ask to have extra chore duties, be banned from television and computers for a certain amount of time, or find a tutor for your schoolwork.


Your parents probably know which punishments you find easy to handle. Suggest a serious alternative punishment, just one that will restrict you in a different way.

, Listen to your parent's response. If she does not agree to your suggestions, just end the conversation as politely as you can. Arguing back is more likely to result in increased punishment, not less. For longer term punishments, you can try again in a couple days, after emotions have lessened.

Sneak back in quietly.,
Return to your bedroom.",How to Sneak out at Night to Go to a Party," This may help fool your parents and keep suspicion minimal. Don’t overdo it, but yawn a bit and mention that you’re feeling tired.;
, If you want to sneak out successfully (and you do!), you’ll need to prepare and plan as much as possible in advance. Give yourself a couple of days to coordinate everything and confirm with your friends via text that the plan is still the same.


When is the party? Where? How are you going to get there? Is there going to be drinking? Is it an all-nighter or will you have to leave after a while? Is there any chance of the police showing up? Are your friends going? How? Are their parents okay with it? This is all vital information!

, Shower, get into your nightclothes, eat dinner, watch television, do your homework - just act normal. Chill out at home until it's almost bedtime. Maybe watch something fun to get you in the party mood (without being obvious).


When bedtime comes around, act sleepy. Say goodnight to your parents. Act normal and be believable. Go to bed as usual and turn off the lights.

, While in bed waiting for your parents to retire, you may want to listen to music with your headphones or read a book to pass the time. Whatever you decide, make sure to have as little light showing as possible. Once you know your parents have gone to bed, wait at least a half an hour to make sure they’re sound asleep.


If your parents check on you before they go to bed, make sure that you pretend to be asleep when they come in. If they don't, then you're lucky and you can probably start getting ready earlier.

, It’s the oldest trick in the book, but it wouldn’t hurt to put a couple of pillows underneath your blanket to represent you, just in case a parent does wake up and comes to your room to check on you.


Fluff the pillows and arrange them a little so that everything looks believable. If your room is dark and someone pops in for a look, they should be fooled by this.

, Do your makeup (if applicable) and hair first. That way if your parents come in while you're getting ready and they see you in your pajamas with your makeup on, you can just say that you couldn't sleep so you decided to practice make up techniques or something.


Prepare your outfit all the way down to the accessories and hairstyle at least a day in advance. Stow it somewhere safe so you can grab it quickly on the night of the party.
Get dressed quickly and silently, using as little light as possible. Carry your shoes and just wear socks so that you step quietly.

, If you share a bedroom with a sibling, it will probably be easier for you to take your clothes and makeup to the bathroom and get dressed quickly in there. Check to make sure they are asleep before you leave your bedroom.


Bring everything you need with you down to the bathroom so that you won’t have to re-enter your bedroom. The less movement, the better.
If a sibling does wake up while you’re getting ready to leave, you’ll have to deal with that situation. If your sibling can keep a secret, get them up to speed on your plan. Then you are probably safe to go ahead.
If the sibling threatens to tattle, try bargaining with them. You will do their chores for a week – something along those lines. If you don’t trust your sibling and they see you, you might have to cancel your plans.

, Don’t turn on any lights in your bedroom and once you get out into the hall, keep everything dark. If you want to confirm that your parents are asleep, walk quietly past their door and assess the situation.


Listen for snoring, talking, and whether or not the television is on. You probably know exactly what to look for – everyone’s parents are different.
If closing your bedroom door doesn’t look suspicious, definitely close the door quietly behind you when you leave. If you never close your door at night, don’t do this, since it will only arouse suspicion.
If you leave your bedroom door open, make sure to check that your decoy is in place and looks believable from the doorway before you leave.

, If you are able to sneak directly out of your bedroom window, you are lucky! Quietly open the window and slip out. Be careful not to slam it closed or lock yourself out.


A few days before the party make sure you test the window and familiarize yourself with how it operates and what sounds it makes. Ensure there's nothing underneath it that will hinder your escape.

, If you are sneaking directly out of your bedroom window and your room is on the second floor, you might want to reconsider that plan! Unless you have done it many times before, it’s probably too risky. Also, it’s dark and you could get hurt.


Sneak downstairs and leave that way. If you are sure you are able to get out of your bedroom window easily and there’s little chance you’ll slip up, go ahead and do it.
If you don’t have a sure way in place to get from the roof to the ground relatively easily, this is a really risky move.

, Try to be a quiet as possible and follow the entire plan that you put into place beforehand.


Check frequently behind you to see if any lights come on in your house. Look around to make sure absolutely no one is around before you exit the house.
If your house has an alarm system that will go off when you leave the premises, the only way to safely get around that is to know exactly what the code is to bypass the alarm. You need to be able to pull that off as silently and quickly as possible.
Be certain that you know how the system works beforehand so that you can get in and out with no trouble.

, Walking or catching a bus late at night, especially on your own, is dangerous. Avoid this if at all possible. Taxis are an acceptable choice, but that can be expensive and as a teen, you should never catch a taxi late at night on your own. Always try to go there with other people.


Your best choice is getting a lift from a friend who drives. Organize in advance a place for them to pick you up; usually around the corner from your house or a short distance down the street from where you live is ideal.
If someone is picking you up, tell them beforehand not to have any loud music playing in their car when they are arrive, just to be safe.

, Avoid turning on your headlights in your driveway because they will shine into your house. Switch your headlights on once you get on the street.

, The last thing you want is to be pulled over by a police officer for a traffic violation when you are in the middle of sneaking out! Follow all speed limits and be extremely cautious in everything you do while on the way to the party.


Avoid very loud music that might draw attention when you’re stopped at a red light.
Wear your seatbelt.

, Your best bet is to stay in the car and drive by the party slowly, checking out the place as you go past it. Look for red flags that could draw attention to the house, increasing the risk of neighbors complaining and getting the party busted by the police.


Check for policeman (parked nearby or already approaching the house), extremely loud noise, or any number of belligerent people standing in front of the house.
Try to gauge attendance by looking at how many cars are parked in the street and in the surrounding neighborhood.
Park safely and correctly on the street so you won’t draw any attention to your car and so that you eliminate any chance of being towed.

, If you plan on drinking, make sure to have a designated driver. Do not drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs, ever.


If your friend drove and both of you plan on drinking, see if someone at the party who won't be drinking can drop you off.
Have cash on you in case you have to call a cab. It’s better to be safe when put in this situation. The extra money you have to spend on the cab is completely worth it.

, You did it! Have fun at the party because if you end up getting caught, at least it will have been worth it.

, Get dropped off a few houses down and walk the rest of the way. Don’t act suspicious in any way and walk normally, don’t run. Stick to the shadows if you can.


If you drove your own car, switch off your headlights right before you pull into your driveway.

, The bag is something you would need to plan one day in advance. Stash a spare pair of PJs and a bottle of makeup remover somewhere outside of your house in a waterproof bag. Hide the bag in a garage, bush, under a deck – anywhere you know it will be safe. Do this so that you can change back into your pajamas and clean off your makeup before going past your parents’ room or in case they wake up and see you elsewhere in the house.


Go behind a tree or around to the back of your house to slip back into your PJs and remove your makeup. Put your party clothes and accessories into the waterproof bag and hide it in the same place as before. You can safely retrieve it the following day.

, Go via the route you planned ahead of time. Even though you might be nervous and twitchy, try to move slowly and carefully. The finish line is in sight and you don’t want to blow it now! You’re almost there.

, YOU DID IT! Get in bed and reflect on how awesome that was, then get some rest.

Set up a plan.,
Put on your shoes before leaving.,
Sneak out the back door if possible.,
Close any doors in between the door that you're going out of and your parents.,
Open the door only as wide as you need to fit through.

,
Open the door really quickly.,
If your parents get up a lot in the middle of the night and check the locks, make sure you lock the door behind you and bring a key with you so you can get back in.

Getting back into the house through the backyard can be hard and noisy.,
If you have sticky locks, to ensure that it's noiseless when you unlock your door, put a little spit on the key.,As soon as you get back inside, take off your shoes and socks and take down your decoy carefully

",How to Sneak Out of a House with Loud Doors," If all the lights are off, a simple decoy will be all that is necessary. If you have dark hair, take a dark shirt or pair of shorts and put it under the blanket on top of the pillow, leaving a little peeking out. In the dark, this is really convincing.;
, If you tread lightly, there should be no problem and you don't have to put on your shoes outside.

, In this case, if a parent catches you, you can just say you were going out to the back to look at the stars. If you have a dog that sleeps out back, you can just say that you thought they were barking and went outside to quiet them down. If you can't sneak out through the back door without making more noise than the front door, then go out the front. There!

, Better safe than sorry.

,, It can silence a lot of creaks that you would've heard if you opened it slowly. Make sure it doesn't bump into anything, though.

Devise a get-away plan.,
Plan your route out of the house.,
Take note of your parents' schedule.,
Research the stairs.",How to Sneak Out of Your House1," You need to pinpoint when you're aiming to leave, how you're leaving, and where you're going to go. Sneaking out successfully is not a spur of the moment thing. Sit down and map out (in your head, not on paper) your tactic for the mission.


When do your parents go to sleep? What time will be the absolute earliest you can escape without being noticed? Better yet, what time must you be back by?
What exit will you use? What obstacles are in your path?
Are you meeting a friend? Where will they be? How will you get to them? How will you get back?;
, This is entirely based on your situation. There may be a number of possibilities, but only one means of likely escape to freedom. Consider the following:


If you are climbing out your window, take note of the surrounding terrain. For a first-story window, this is not an issue. But for sneaking out of a second-story window, be careful -- being found on the ground with a broken leg in the middle of the night is not the start of a memorable evening you had in mind. Is there a tree or a terrace you could climb?

If the get-away is in the daytime, this will probably your only option (as done from your room). You will need to lock the door, turn on some light music or the television, and get your defenestration on.


If you are climbing out a window that is not your own, make sure it is far away from your parents' location. Choose a window that's on the opposite side of the house. Make sure it isn't noisy to open.
Check the screen of your chosen window beforehand. Some screens are very difficult to work with and you may have to nix this possibility if it means damaging the window. Does it come out easily and can you put it back intact?
If you are going out the door, can you unlock it at an earlier time? Can you leave the screen ajar with a doorstop? How much noise does it make upon opening and closing?

, If your parents go to bed at 10:30 PM like clockwork Sunday - Thursday, this may be less of an issue. But if there's any possibility at all that they'll stay up late to watch Conan or they have extra paperwork to do, be ready.


If it's normal for you to ask about their day, do so. They may casually mention their workload or their post-dinner plans. However, if you are the go-directly-to-my-room-and-draw-skulls-on-my-notebook-all-night-long type, don't bother. They'll wonder what's going on and it'll just rouse their suspicions.

, If you are unfortunate enough to have to climb up or down stairs on your path to liberation, do the work beforehand. Where do they creak? How should you tread to make the least amount of noise? Generally, using the sides and leaning on the banister are your best bets, but every flight is different.


Experiment with different types of footwear. Maybe socks make the least amount of noise or maybe your tennis shoes/slippers do a good job diffusing the sound. The night of, don whatever is the most silent.

"
"
Be respectful.,
Apologize for your mistake.,
Ask for a cool down.,
Leave the past in the past.,
Show you're truly sorry by fixing what you can.,
Offer alternatives to the punishment.,
Let your parents know that you want to work with them rather than against them.,
Use logic, not emotions, when trying to bargain for a lesser punishment.,
Use all your tools.",How to Get Out of a Punishment1," Being respectful will help keep you from receiving punishments in the first place, but if you find yourself in hot water, stay calm and polite. The more you yell, the madder your parent is going to be. The madder your parent is, the more severe your punishment is likely to be.


Never insult your parents. Calling them names will land you in more trouble than it's worth, and you'll regret doing it later. If you feel like flinging an insult, count to 10 before speaking, and take a few deep breaths to calm yourself down.;
, This tactic is the most obvious one for avoiding punishment, but it will not work repeatedly on a single rule you have broken, nor will it work if you are disingenuous about it. If you cannot apologize truthfully and sincerely, don't waste your time. Your parents will spot your insincerity, and it will probably work against you rather than in your favor.


For instance, you could say something like, ""I'm really sorry I stayed out past curfew. I know you worry when I'm not home on time, and I really will try to be home on time in the future.""
Pay attention to your tone and expression. Don't smirk when you are apologizing, and don't mumble through the apology. Mumbling says you are just trying to get through it, and you aren't owning up to what you did. Speak in a clear voice that shows you really are sorry.

, If everybody is angry, including you, ask your parents if you can wait until everyone has calmed down to talk about your punishment. You may receive a lesser punishment or no punishment at all if you give your parents a chance to calm down and think about how severe your crime was., Dragging past punishments and mistakes--your parents, your siblings, or your own--into the present will only make people more upset, and it may even remind your parents that what you did this time was not your first time to make that mistake. Rather, stay on topic.For instance, saying ""But Marcie didn't get in trouble when she stayed out too late."" will not endear you to your parents. You and your sister are different people, and your parents are doing what they think is best.

, If your broke something, try to replace it or fix it. If you made a bad grade, try to make it up. Not everything can be fixed, as sometimes the things you break will be people because you were mean to them. However, you can try to find a way to show your love by being extra nice to the person you hurt or by doing something nice like making her a card., Sometimes, this suggestion won't work. Punishment is not supposed to be pleasant. However, sometimes you may be able to offer an alternative to a punishment your parent decides on. Maybe instead of being grounded for a week, you can go help out at the library everyday after school. Your parent may be amenable to this suggestion because you are offering to help someone else. Maybe instead of not seeing your friends, you can offer to do extra chores. If you offer a punishment ahead of your parent deciding on one, you may be able to sway his or her decision.


If you do offer an alternative punishment and your parent accepts, make sure you follow through with it. Otherwise, this option won't be available to you in the future because your parents won't trust you to do what you say.

, That is, don't argue against them. Let them know you are aware you made a mistake, and you want to cooperate with them to do better. See if you can work with them to put together a plan of how you can avoid the same mistake in the future. Asking them to make a plan with you will show them you are sincere about doing better.Try saying something to this effect: ""I know I was late for school again. Do you think we can sit down and talk about how I can manage my time better? I always feel rushed in the mornings, and I can't seem to get myself together.""

, Yelling ""It's not fair"" is not likely to help your case. However, offering up a reasonable explanation about why you deserve a lesser sentence than the one being offered is likely to be better received. If your parent can understand why you made the mistake you did, he or she might be willing to lessen the punishment. Your parent may even be willing to let you off the hook if you had a very good reason for why you did what you did. Even if you don't receive a lesser sentence, your parent will respect your maturity.For instance, if you stayed out past curfew, you could say, ""I know it was wrong of me to stay out past curfew, but I ran out of gas on the way home. I know that I should plan ahead, and I'll try to not be in this situation again. Do you think maybe we can skip the punishment this time?""

, That is, after everyone has cooled down, be extra affectionate towards your parents, offering hugs and kisses."
"
Your parents are going to care about a sudden switch in behavior, and possibly punish you more.,
Understand what you did wrong.,
Do not cheat your punishment.,
Be especially conscious of not screwing up while grounded.,
Always show respect.,
Find something else to do!,
Use this punishment to avoid the next.",How to Cope With Being Grounded," Consider waiting in your room for 20 minutes or so, then go out and talk to them. They should be more calm at that point.;
, The whole point of being grounded is so that you learn a lesson. Your parents will be a little more lenient with you if you acknowledge that you did something wrong. Admit that you did something wrong (even if it's hard), apologize and accept your punishment.

, If you are grounded from the phone for a week, don't sneak on when your parents are gone. You're not going to learn anything, and your parents might double your grounding if they find out. Also, you will lose their trust, which has longer lasting effects then simply being grounded If you try to talk to them they would even ignore you.

, The last thing you want is to be caught doing something wrong when you're already in the doghouse. If you usually have to be told to take out the trash, do so without being asked. Increased responsibility during punishment pleases many parents.

, While you may be really mad at your mom for unfairly taking away your computer, remember that giving them attitude and talking back is not going to do you any good. They may say provoking comments that make you want to snap, but don't. If they are giving you the silent treatment, accept it and find something else to do.

, If you are used to spending all day online listening to Paramore on Facebook, and your parents have taken away your computer, discover a new hobby, even if only temporarily. Read a book, organize your room, daydream, make a list of things you love/hate, try doing something fun/wacky with your hair. Being grounded doesn't mean you have to be bored.

, If your parents ground you for a week and you absolutely must accept it, then go through it. When the punishment is up, don't run out of the house. This just lets your parents know that they know how to punish you.

Get your clothes ready.,
Clear a path.,
Put clothes/stuffed animals or any kind of bulky, soft items under your covers.,
Consider ""sleeping"" downstairs.",How to Sneak Out of Your House2," This may sound like a needless point, but in the event you get caught, what you're wearing can be a huge tip-off. It's best to have getaway clothes and then something to change into once your escape is successful. You have two options:


Wear your going-out clothes under your bedclothes. If you're sneaking around the house and the 'rents wake up, you can say you were grabbing a CD or some water or simply couldn't sleep so you were killing time till you got tired.
Hide your going-out clothes outside. This can be in a grill (a clean one!) or in some area that won't be seen or discovered -- by humans or animals. An area of the garage may be your best bet.

Keep your clothes in a bag. That way, when you change, the clothes you're forced to take with you (unless you hide those in turn, too) are easily transportable.



, Now that you know what you're doing and when you'll be doing it, what stands in your way? Make sure there's nothing that can go wrong between point A and point B -- your exit needs to be as swift as possible.


Where will the family dog be? If necessary get him out of your trajectory the night before. He could cause a ruckus you aren't otherwise expecting.
If you'll be wandering around in the dark, remove any objects that you think could pose a problem. Tripping over anything, breaking something, or running into your mother's beloved wind chimes can all blow your cover.

, If/when your parents come into your room to see if you're actually in bed, they may be fooled by the decoy. If a doll has hair like yours, take advantage of it!


You may want to put a note to your parents telling them where you are under the blanket with the items. That way, if your parents actually look and see you're not there, they can at least know where you are. This strategy can help alleviate any penalty, because you were considerate of your parents' worries.

, Find a place where you can pretend you are sleeping that's nearer your desired exit. If you are caught ""sleeping"" on the couch, say that you felt uncomfortable, you dozed off watching TV, or that you simply wanted to sleep downstairs tonight.


Depending on your parents, this may only work once (twice if you're lucky). Use this method sparingly as it may rouse suspicion if used often. On the other hand, if you do sleep there frequently, your parents may get into the mindset that falling asleep on the couch is a normal occurrence and it will arouse less suspicion. In that case, it would be to your benefit to sleep on the couch some nights even when you aren't sneaking out.
If you'll be wandering around outside, consider camouflage. Not the army kind -- just simply blending into your environment. That doesn't mean wearing a black ski mask, a black sweatshirt, and black pants. Think about the colors of where you're going. How would you fit in?
Navy, dark green, brown, and dark gray generally mix in well with nighttime. Stay away from black (few things are actually black) and bright colors to avoid attracting attention to yourself needlessly.
If the streets you're going to be on are poorly lit, wear light colors anyway. You don't want to be hit by a car.

"
"
Prep your return.,
Stay cool.,
Go to a smart meeting spot.,
If confronted by anyone, have a story ready.,
When arriving back into the house, be equally stealthy.,
Clear your texts and calls.",How to Sneak Out of Your House3," On the off chance that your parents awaken and lock all the doors, take a key. To be doubly sure of your re-entry, prop open a window (or two). Just make sure you cover your tracks once inside!

, In your haste and adrenaline, it'll be easy to get excited and to make poor decisions. Try to stay calm. The consequences are plenty if you don't!


Don't concern yourself with being late for your friends. If it's taking you longer to pry out that screen, they can wait. Text them you're having problems. Do not get harried and wind up falling down stairs or breaking windows just to get there on time.

, Use a spot that is in the center of your group's houses, but is also out of sight from any neighbors. You don't want them getting suspicious or calling the police either!


Many places have curfew laws; keep this in mind. While you may feel tax-free, you aren't necessarily. Always keep an eye out for possible mishaps and lay low throughout the night.

, This all depends on where you get caught, so use your environment as your alibi. If you get caught in the kitchen, you were hungry. If you get caught in the doorway, you heard something outside and were nervous there was a burglar. If you get caught on the lawn (hopefully still in your bedclothes), you were waiting for the meteor shower to start.


Be smart about it. If you're carrying a purse or your wallet, that could be a dead giveaway. If your cell phone is in hand, you're good as busted. Make sure your story is mostly believable, even if it is a bit strange.

, The show's not over yet, folks! Leave all of your obvious materials (phone, purse, jacket, wallet, hat, shoes) in a hidden place outside your house -- it is possible that your parents might be waiting inside for you. If you have your bedclothes stuck in the grill, great! Put 'em back on. They'll think you're crazy, but they may lessen your punishment in their confusion as to what the truth actually is.


Your story is up to you. What fits into your personality? Would a casual stroll be enough of an alibi? Do you have a tree house or similar place you could sneak away to that would lessen the blow? If they ask why you did such a stupid thing, say you were very stressed about an upcoming event like a test or talent show, etc. You may still get grounded, but it'll be much better than being grounded for sneaking out.

, In the event that your parents are either waiting up or are suspicious the next day, clear your phone. They may have the bright idea of taking it when you're not looking and going through it. You don't want to give them proof!


Clear all of them. It looks less suspicious if you have an empty inbox than if you have all texts deleted from the last 24 hours. Most people do periodic sweeps through their phones to clear everything out, and you did, too.

Think of a plan B.,
Don't panic.,
Cooperate with authority.,
If your parents call, somehow let them know you're fine.",How to Sneak Out of Your House4," If you're out of the house, stranded in a cornfield in the middle of nowhere and your friends are good-for-nothings, you may need to make a phone call to get you out of there. This is where not panicking comes into play. Breathe. Who could take you home?


Weigh your options. You may not want to call your parents, but it could be your best option. Your situation may get worse, the cops could eventually come, and all hell would break loose. Or you could just call someone to get you the heck out of there now. Your parents may be glad you called and lessen your punishment.

, The world is not over. ""Sneaking out"" is not a felony -- sneaking out to rob a bank, sure, but sneaking out is not. So stay calm. Panicking will just make your situation worse.


Only fabricate a story if you're positive it would work. Sometimes honesty is the best policy in a situation like this -- or at least sticking closer to the truth. If you say a friend was having a panic attack or was contemplating suicide, make sure your parents (or the cops) will not get a hold of the friend. Your story either needs to check out or not get checked out at all.

, If a policeman shows up on the scene and stops you for violating curfew, it's in your best interest to cooperate with him. If he stops you for a more egregious crime, it's still in your best interest to cooperate with him.


If you tell the police that you are on your way home and he lets you go, go home. If you are found out and about later, your punishment will be much worse. Take that stroke of luck you were just offered and use it.

, You don't necessarily have to pick up, but texting them back and telling them you are coming home is a wise idea. If they get worried, they may alert the entire town. They may blow the situation out of proportion entirely.


If you are nearby, it's possible you can come up with an alibi. However, your parents aren't stupid. If you do come up with some outrageous story, make sure you look like what you said just happened, did. If you got into a brawl with a giant squirrel, look like you got into a brawl with a giant squirrel. If you spent the night stargazing, come in with grass stains. You know the drill.

"
"
Use different alibis sparingly.,
Get your parents' patterns down pat.,
Expect exhaustion.",How to Sneak Out of Your House5," If you say, ""I thought I heard something"" every time you are caught, your parents will begin to realize you are up to something. Change your tactics because obviously they aren't working.


Know what you have to work with. If you're obsessed with biology, tell your parents your teacher got you on this kick about earthworms and their nighttime habits. And if you're not obsessed with biology, put in the work (mentioning it in daily conversation) a few days beforehand to make your story believable.

, Adjust your technique based on what actions they take. What days are they the most tired? What days do they get up a bit earlier? And what arouses their suspicion the least?


If you have siblings, you may want to take into account their schedules, too. It's a lot to juggle, true, but the investment will pay off in the long-run.

, If you're out all night and you have school the next day or you simply have to act as if you weren't out all night, you'll be incredibly tired. So slam that coffee or energy drink and burn the 7 AM oil.


Caffeine should be part of your post-sneak out alibi, depending on your situation for the next day. You don't want your own tiredness leading to your exposure. All that work for nothing!
Some parents wait until morning and make you do a bunch of things when you're really tired from sneaking out. You got yours, now it's time for them to get theirs. Deal with it...it's better than being grounded!

"
"
Accept your punishment without complaint.,
Understand where your parent is coming from.,
Realize your parents are not perfect.,
Start your homework without being asked.,
Pick up extra chores.,
Show you have learned your lesson.,
Politely ask to be let off for good behavior.",How to Get Out of a Punishment2," By being willing to accept your fate, you make them more receptive to not punishing you as much next time, as well as maybe letting you off early this time.

, Your parent doesn't just want to make you unhappy by punishing you. He or she wants you to a learn that you are doing something wrong so that you don't make the same mistake next time. Your parent has experience you don't, so he is trying to help you avoid the consequences that could happen to you if act in that way as an adult. Once you show you understand why your parents are punishing you, they may be willing to let you off early., They may have been a little harsh in their punishment and may regret it later. If you are on your best behavior, they may let you off for good behavior.

, Show your parents that you are willing to work extra hard to please them and to do the right thing.

, Similarly, your parents will notice if you are working extra hard to be good. They'll appreciate you helping out around the house, which may make them more receptive to letting you off the hook.


Additionally, the more you complain, the more your parents will know you hate the punishment, meaning it's the perfect punishment for them to choose the next time you get in trouble.

, Write a letter detailing how you will do better in the future, and behave in a way that clearly shows you are trying to do better. For instance, if you were grounded for getting in a fight with your sister, try being extra nice to her to show you understand the problem.For example, if you stayed out past curfew, you could write a letter that says the following: ""Dear Mom and Dad, I realize now that I should have called when I was out so late. Staying out too late was bad enough, but then I made you worry by not letting you know where I was. I know you love me and want to keep me safe, and I really do appreciate how concerned you are about me. In the future, I'll try to be more considerate of your feelings in all situations, and let you know where I am no matter what. Love, Jessie""

, After accepting your punishment for at least several days (though a week is better for longer punishments), you can ask to be let off early from your punishment. If your parent has seen you've learned your lesson, they may relent and stop the punishment.


Remember not to demand to be let off. You are making a request, which means your parents have the option to say no. Also, be specific. Say something like ""Mom, can I talk to you? I know getting behind on my school work was wrong, and I have learned my lesson. I think you may have noticed that I've gotten all my homework done early this week, and I've abided by your punishment. Do you think you could please let me off a little early so I can see Julie this weekend? I have already done my homework for next week.""

"
"
Be respectful.,
Be tidy.,
Be timely about chores.,
Tell the truth.,
Keep your grades up.,
Keep the peace.",How to Get Out of a Punishment3," One key to any good relationship is respect. You respect your parents by following their rules and being polite when communicating with them. They respect you by allowing you to grow into who you are going to be, as well as by offering correction when you do something wrong.

, Cleaning up after yourself is another way to show your respect. Your parents work hard to make a home for you, and they're probably tired when they come home. You should acknowledge that by not leaving messes around and by cleaning up your room even before you're asked.

, Kids not doing chores on time is a common source of irritation for parents, which is why the phrase ""How many times do I have to tell you?"" is a mantra for many of them. If you wait until the punishment is imminent, it may be too late, but it doesn't hurt to jump up, grab the garbage bag, and head out to garbage can, even when your parent is already angry.

, You may be tempted to wriggle out of a punishment by telling a lie. However, lies have a tendency to build. That is, if you tell one lie, you'll likely need to tell more to cover up your previous one, which means digging yourself into a deeper hole. Just tell the truth. Express your regret, and accept the punishment if it happens. If your parents found out you lied on top of doing something else wrong, your punishment will be even more severe.

, Do your best, and usually, your parents will understand the grade you receive. If you fall behind, try to catch up. If you fail to study for a test, you won't be able to change the grade you receive. However, if you do flunk a test, you may be able to do a makeup test or extra credit work to change your final score. Most parents will forgo the punishment if you can improve your grade.

, Try not to fight with your parents or siblings, as arguments will land you in trouble. Additionally, yelling will stress out your parents, making them more likely to hand out punishments for minor infractions.

, Fully charge your phone, shut down or switch to silent mode, then put it in a place where your parents won't spot it.


If your cell phone is kept by your parents, better get it after they go to bed.

, Know if the door creaks if opened. Silently tip-toe out of your room, leaving the door slightly opened, when you come back.

, Beware of wooden floors or tiles, for wood may creak and tiles usually make noise from your feet (which is why you should wear socks/slippers).

, The only downside to headphones is that if somebody walks into the room, you won't hear them. If it is TV you are going to watch (or play video games), keep also a low volume, or no volume at all and put closed caption on. Be sure to set the lighting of your TV/computer on one of the lowest settings, so the people in the next room are less likely to see the light. If you are playing a small video gaming device such as a Game-boy or Nintendo DS, keep the volume down, once again, or no volume at all.

Firstly, you can sneak well no matter how much you weigh, it is all in the technique.,
Move on the balls of your feet.,
Keep low.,
Peek around Corners.,
Move Swiftly.,
Make sure you have ample time to make a move on your target.,
Wear socks or something soft-soled on your feet.",How to Sneak Like a Pro," You have to move your feet swiftly, yet carefully, It is a very delicate art.
, and then you gradually shift your weight down to your heel. The greatest factor on how well you can sneak is by far the footwork. This will keep you from stomping around. I might warn you that it only muffles the sound of a squeaky floor by a little bit, so move slowly to counter this as much as possible., This will lower how much your target can see you. If you are keeping low, (Better if behind a cover of some sort) 100% of scientists will agree that the normal human cannot see through an object made of a solid, opaque mass., Try the nose-first-using-peripheral-vision type. Poke your nose around the corner and look as far as you can in the direction of what you are wanting to look at. Try to stay below eye level, as this is where people will see you first., This is kind of hard to do if you wish to maintain the proper walking technique, but it is definitely achievable. It can make sure you make it to your target before they turn around., The person you are trying to scare will likely turn around if they hear something they are not familiar with. this can be countered by moving from one cover to another, but they will only doubt they are imagining sounds so many times, you only have a certain number of chances. Real life isn't like a video game where you can respawn if you get caught. You have one chance if they spot you., This will dampen the sounds of your steps.

Buy the candy.,

Eat it.,
Do not do this too often or to extremes.",How to Sneak Candy Into Your Room1," Bring a moderately large amount of money (10$ or so) and walk up to a close-by shop. Your parents will be glad you are going out and getting fresh air, so you can most likely go easily.


Buy quite a lot of candy, so you don't have to walk all the time, and place it in a bag or maybe a rucksack.
Make sure you get a piece of ""proof"" candy like a pack of gum to show your parents. They will only get suspicious if you say you bought nothing.;
, If you leave your window slightly open before you leave and it's on the ground floor, you can slip your candy through there then go through the front door in case they ask to look in your bag.


Or, you can just go to your room as soon as you walk through the door, slip your bag under your bed then go out and talk to your parents. Offer them some of the proof candy.

, For your health, try to not eat it all in one go, and brush your teeth thoroughly afterwards.

Make sure to scatter the candy in different parts around your room so they don't find a huge batch of it.






Don't close the door of your bedroom when you eat your candy, because they will get suspicious; just find a corner where you aren't visible from the doorway, or go under your sheets and say you were cold.

, It is tempting, but should only be used occasionally and to a small degree.

If you got a receipt from the store, make sure to throw it away so your parents don't find it!

, Once the candy is safely hidden and you arrive home, tell your parents that you really need to go to the bathroom -- no time to take your jacket off!


Then, run to your room and quickly remove the candy from the hidden pocket. Put it somewhere safe, like in your pillowcase or in your underwear drawer.
Don't forget to actually go to the bathroom -- if you don't your parents will know you were lying and up to no good! For best results, flush the toilet as if you did go and turn the sink tap on for a bit as if you're washing your hands.

, Wait until a good moment before you go back to eat the candy -- like when your parents are asleep or entertaining visitors, then they won't be checking in on you!


Just be sure to clean your face before you see them again, you don't want any tell-tale signs of chocolate or stickiness on your face!

Heavy breathing: Awake
Normal breathing: Awake or making attempt to fall asleep
Light breathing: Light sleep or normal sleep
Snoring: Deep sleep

Quietly sneak them in.,
Keep quiet, and stay inconspicuous.,

Get them out of there.,
Erase the evidence.",How to Sneak a Boyfriend or Girlfriend Into Your House," You may live there, but you’ll need to look at your home with fresh eyes to understand all of its access points, blind spots, vantage points, and tattle-tale floorboards. Take a tour of the place when you’ve got some time alone to better acquaint yourself.


Assess every door and window for viability as an entrance or exit.
Consider the field of vision offered by all of the windows in your house. If another family member sees someone in their yard at 1:00 in the morning, they're likely to call the police—or recognize your partner and their intent.
How old is your house? Older house are often noisier houses. Walking nearer to the walls or guard-rails on stairs helps keep the noise down, because there's not much else that can be done to stop those squeaking floorboards. Shaking talcum powder into the cracks of the floorboards offers temporary benefits, but will probably get you some weird looks from your parents. Alarm systems will have to be deactivated before opening windows or doors, so you’ll need the code (and have an idea about how loud the system’s noises will be while you punch the code in). Be sure to re-engage the system after your partner leaves in the morning.
Pets—dogs especially—will likely be a problem. Consider how they react to people entering your house, and what usually works for calming them down. Locking animals up in another room in an effort to block their interference rarely works well. Try training your dog to associate your partner with treats, by feeding them the treats the moment that they see your partner for several days beforehand.;
, You should decide on the window or door beforehand so you can properly test and prepare it. Consider how visible the window is, how close it is to your parents’ room, and how far they’ll have to walk through your house before getting to the relative safety of your bedroom.


Determine how much you’d need to move, open, and unlock for the person to get inside at each of possible entry point. You’ll want to prepare the chosen site beforehand, but rearranging the potted plants outside your bedroom prematurely might draw suspicion.
Think about the noise you'll have to make opening that window, pulling up its blinds, or turning a dead-bolt. Minimize these factors where you can.
If it’s a window with a screen, you’ll need to remove the screen. The ease of doing this depends on the screen’s construction, but many can only be removed easily from the outside, meaning second-story windows (and higher) are a no go. Ensure that you don’t damage the screen either, as this will give your plan away (and cost you some allowance).
Don’t get in the habit of leaving windows or doors unlocked. They’re locked for you and your family’s safety, and your parents should have an accurate idea of the home’s security.
Consider how much force might be necessary to pull a person in through the window, and whether you can safely exert this force.
Fire escape ladders and basement windows are unique advantages to some houses. Fire escapes will help your partner gain access to higher-up windows, and basement windows are often far away from the master bedroom.
It’s unlikely that you’ll use a door (it’s also, to be clear, less fun than crawling through a window) but don’t rule them out.

, Casually walk the route as though you’re sneaking in, without giving away to any onlookers that you’re pretend-sneaking. You should know roughly how long it will take your partner to get across the yard, through the access point, and from the access point to your bedroom once they’re inside.


Sometimes a longer course offers tactical advantages. Walking on carpet or rugs, for instance, is going to be quieter than tile, which is in turn going to be quieter than a path that takes you over hardwood floors.Actually walking the path will remind you of any particular squeaky floorboards you’ll need to warn your nighttime visitor about.
While outside, think about the sight lines that neighbors and traffic might have on your property. A well-meaning neighbor could blow your plans when they see your significant other sneaking through the shared alley between your two houses.

, You’ll want a hiding spot ready to go, both in your bedroom and near the access point. Leave a space in a closet, or clear out a spot beneath your bed. A messier room will give you more to work with (visitors could even, if you’re okay with it, bury themselves under your dirty laundry or sheets) but a suddenly messy room might raise suspicion.


The darkness of an unlit house can turn every corner and cubby into a decent-enough hiding space, but don’t bet too much on your parents leaving the lights off when they’re investigating a suspicious noise. If their suspicion aroused, however, take comfort knowing that parents around 50 need twice as much light as even a 30-year-old to see in the dark., You’ll want an easy way to communicate with your partner. Setting meeting times beforehand can work as a last resort, but when a parent is wandering around in the kitchen to get a midnight snack, you’ll wish you could warn your visitor to hold off for a few minutes.


Cell phones are the most obvious—and best—choice here. Ensure yours is set to silent, or vibrate only.
Home phones should be avoided on both ends. Calling your partner’s cell phone through your home phone sounds safe enough, but an unthinking callback or butt-dial can send your home phone ringing off the hook. Your parents could also pick up the phone in their bedroom while you’re already on the line, discussing your rendezvous.
If it comes to it, you might risk the old-school method of taping a message in the window, or designating a certain light in your house—one which won’t be tampered with by your parents—as a signal. If it’s off, stay away. If it’s on, come on in.

, This will be easier to verify if your parents sleep with their door open, but safer going forward if they close their door. Listen for snoring, or the slow, steady breathing that indicates they’ve conked out. Our bodies repeatedly cycle through several stages of sleep, some of them lighter and some heavier, but the periods of deep sleep decrease in duration as the night goes on. Roughly 60 minutes after falling asleep, your parents will likely be in one of the deepest states of sleep they’ll experience that night—use this information as best you can.


If your guardians’ bedroom is near the kitchen, you can train them to expect a little noise in the evening from you. Start getting cereal—or any other food you’ll enjoy—as a late-night snack for at least a week in advance. If they wake up while you’re digging around, you’ll have an innocent explanation; if they don’t, then that bodes well for the other noises you’re soon going to make.
The hour that you usually turn in is also important to keep in mind. If you always go to bed early, your family may grow suspicious if you're still up at 12:30, or vice versa if you’re usually up late but say you're going to sleep at 8:00. Try and sell the former by drinking cola and acting a bit hyper, and the latter by behaving sluggishly from the moment you get home from school or work.
You’ll want to recheck the designated entry point, to ensure that window or door wasn’t re-locked by your parents before they went to bed.

, If you use a ladder or step to reach the entry point, make sure you can put it back or pull it inside with you. Move quickly, but keep as quiet as possible. It’s recommended you “run dark:” turn off all the lights, double-check that cell phones are silent, and shut off computer monitors and TV screens.


If it’s not unusual for you, a radio at low volume can drown out some of the sounds you’ll make sneaking them inside. It's not noises that wake us up at night, but inconsistencies in noise. A droning, familiar sound can provide white noise to cover those inconsistencies.
If you’re pulling someone up a sheer wall, brace yourself so that you cannot be pulled out of where you are.
An alternative to sneaking your boyfriend or girlfriend in at night is inviting them over in the late afternoon, then stowing them away in your closet until everybody else go to sleep. Wait until your parents are in a position where they wouldn’t notice your partner leaving (like out back, or using the bathroom), then act like they left a while ago. You should ensure your partner’s car or bike is well out of sight. Equip your partner with something quiet and fun to occupy them while they hide, and with snacks for their long wait!
Lock the door and window after they’re in. It will keep your home safer and decrease suspicion if a parent gets out of bed during the night.

, If you need something from elsewhere in the house, hide the other person as best you can before you go and get it yourself. If you or your partner changes or removes clothes, keep them somewhere out of sight. This goes for anything your partner may have brought with them as well: cell phone, wallet, keys, etc.


If you need a light, rely on your cell phone's backlight, and don't shine it under the door.
If the person needs to use the bathroom: don't flush.

, If you fall asleep in your room, ensure that you’ve got an alarm set to rouse you both with plenty of time to escape. Make sure the alarm is vibration only, or quiet enough that it wouldn’t disturb your parents.


Get them out of there at least an hour before your parents would normally wake up. Consider also how visible they’ll be in the morning light, and whether their own parents will wake up and notice their absence.
If you can’t trust yourself to wake up with an alarm, don’t go to sleep.
If you use a clock radio, use the radio and not the buzzer.

, Once the other person is out of the building, have them get out of sight as soon as possible. Seeing someone leave a house in the morning can be just as incriminating as seeing them come in at night. If you’re caught, you might try to convince a parent that they were stopping by to ask for homework before school, but this is far from foolproof.

, Clean the room of any cans, bottles, wrappers, or loose clothes. Put trash from the night at the bottom of a trash can where it's less likely to be seen, and take out the trash tomorrow (but not first thing in the morning, if this is outside your normal routine).


Flushing certain items may seem tempting, but you should refrain from doing so; a clogged toilet will draw far more attention than you can risk. Besides that, it’s environmentally unsound. "

Plan your raid before you sneak out.,
Dress in dark clothing.,
If you can, schedule a time for your air conditioner to turn on during the time you plan to sneak out.,
When sneaking out, always take slow steps.",How to Sneak Around the House at Night to Eat (For Kids)," Highlight the important steps, including how you'll escape your bedroom and when you'll attack the kitchen. Take note of your parents' bedtime, and make sure your route is clear beforehand in order to avoid tripping over objects.


Unorganized raids rarely go as expected, so it is best to lay out a clear plan.
Plan for any relatives listening or trying to catch you in the middle of your raid.;
, While it isn't necessary, it lowers the chance of someone spotting you. Tight-fitting clothes are also recommended, as it prevents the fabric from being caught on something or making too much noise against your skin. If possible, wear your pajamas so that if someone catches you, you can say that you were getting a drink.


Leave pillows underneath your blankets in the shape of a body. This gives the appearance that you are still in bed. However, there is a chance that your parents may discover your trick. All in all, the best method is to not get caught.

, When the air conditioner turns on, wait a minute or two (depending on how long the AC will be on). After a while, it will provide good but limited, ambient noise that will cover up your noise. Your half-asleep family will hear the air conditioner and dismiss its noises.

, Walk with your toes first and ease back onto your heels. Another option is to use your heel first and ease your weight onto your toes. Walking flat-footed creates loud thumps. Instead of turning on the lights, bring a small flashlight, and do your best to cover up its beam. Refrain from waking up pets; otherwise, slowly wake them and provide comfort so they don't think you're an intruder. Below is a list of events you may encounter, along with tips on how to deal with them:



Someone Wakes Up. In this situation, avoid running back to your room. Not only will you lose any progress you've made but you'll also attract attention. Instead, get a drink and pretend that you're thirsty. Another option is to find a hiding spot. You could also lay down on a chair or a couch and pretend to be asleep. If your parent(s) question you, explain that you came down for a drink but became too tired to return to your room. Once your parent(s) return to his/her room, wait until he/she is asleep before continuing your kitchen raid.

Climbing Stairs. Staircases often creak underneath people's weight. To prevent any noises, take careful steps with your toes first. Always take a double step which is where you take one step with one foot before bringing your other foot down on the same step. And, to avoid creaking, plan your route in daylight, and pinpoint non-creaky spots.

Opening The Refrigerator/Pantry. Avoid using the handle to open the refrigerator, as this often causes it to creak or crack. Instead, find the crease where the door meets the body. Wriggle your fingers in between the two until it opens. Ease the door open from there. Unfortunately, the same method cannot be applied to pantries, as they often creak when opened slowly. The best is to open it quickly without knocking it into the wall.

Opening Doors. Turn the handle slowly. Using your free hand, apply a light pressure to the gap where the door meets the frame. Once you walk through the door, slowly pull it closed while keeping the handle turned so it doesn't click into place when pulled shut.

Pay for your PO box.,
Use your PO box to receive your mail.",How to Receive Mail Without Your Parents Knowing1," You might choose the closest post office to your home to purchase a Post Office (PO) box to have your mail sent to, but this could result in you coincidentally bumping into friends, neighbors, or even your parents. This might raise questions that you'd rather avoid. The safest option for secretive mailing might require you to travel to a post office farther away, like one in a neighboring town or on the other side of your city.Most national postal services have online locators to help you find local branches. You can do an Internet search for ""post office locator,"" but some common branch locators include:US Postal Service: https://tools.usps.com/go/POLocatorAction!input.actionUK Postal Service: http://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finderCanada Postal Service: https://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/fpo/personal/findPostOffice
;
, You will need to fill out Form PS 1093 to apply for your PO box. You'll also need to provide the post office with a home address, a phone number, and a list of minors who will be receiving mail. You'll also need to provide two forms of identification when you apply with at least one ID bearing your picture.


Print out Form PS 1093 before you go to apply for your PO box. This will give you time to familiarize yourself with what you'll need and fill out necessary information. This way you're not scrambling or scratching your head trying to fill out the form at the post office.
Accepted forms of photo ID include: valid driver's license or state issued ID card, armed forces, government, university ID card, passport, passport card, or alien registration card.
Accepted forms of non-photo ID include: current lease, mortgage, or deed of trust, voter or vehicle registration card, Home or vehicle insurance policy.Getting the right ID necessary for your PO box can be tricky, but minors 16 - 17 years old can apply for passports with the proper documents without parental consent.Your second piece of identification could be a state issued ID, which most states will issue you regardless of age with the proper documentation., Some PO boxes, especially those intended for commercial purposes, can be quite large. You will, however, likely have to pay extra for a larger box. A smaller box should suit your purposes just fine; even in the event you have a large package shipped, if it is too large for your box, it will be held behind the counter of the post office.


Larger packages that don't fit in your PO box will be indicated by a slip that will be put in your box by post office staff. Simply present this slip to the postal worker at the counter and your package will be given to you., Explaining why you need a PO box will likely put the postal worker helping you with your purchase more at ease. There are many acceptable reasons you might want to get a PO box; telling the postal worker handling your PO box request why you need it can help them understand your situation. Some reasons you might need to apply for your box might include things like:


""I'm a collector and I buy a lot of stuff through online vendors. My parents were worried that something valuable might be stolen so they told me to come down here and get a PO box.""
""This is part of a school assignment. I'm setting up a small business as my final project for my business class.""Postal workers are within the scope of their duties to call or mail your parents to verify they know about your PO box purchase. Even with a good reason for your box, they still might want confirmation from your parents.

, You may be nervous when you go to apply for your PO box, but the United States Postal Service allows minors to get a PO box unless your parents send a written letter saying otherwise to the postmaster.Acting suspicious or overly nervous while applying for your box may lead to a postal employee calling the phone number you provided or sending a notification to your home address.


Sometimes running through what you will say can help you be more comfortable with the situation. You might even benefit from writing a loose script of what you plan on saying when you rent your box., Cash will prevent a suspicious charge that your parents might notice from appearing on your bank statement or credit card bill. Most post offices will require you to rent your PO box for six months to a year, and the cost of your box will depend on the post office and the size of the box you are renting. In most cases, $100 should be enough to cover the cost of renting the smallest PO box available for six months.


Make sure you get a copy of your receipt for the rented PO box. This will serve as verification that you paid in case you need proof. Additionally, a receipt may be required if you decide to cancel the service and get a refund., Use the information provided with your PO box to receive all incoming mail that you want kept private from your parents. Don't forget that you'll have to renew your box. This usually is required every 6 to 12 months, and to keep suspicious activity from showing up on your bank statement or credit card, you should continue to pay for your box in cash.

Gather your materials.,
Build your sploof.,
Exhale through the sploof.",How to Smoke In Your Room Without Getting Caught1," A sploof is a tube capped with a dryer sheet that will turn the smell of your smoke into the smell of fresh laundry. The first step in building your sploof will require you to gather the necessary materials. Collect the following items to build your sploof:Find a cardboard tube or PVC tube. A cardboard tube from a toilet paper roll works fine.
Dryer sheets will be used to absorb and cover up the smell of the smoke.
Grab something to attach the dryer sheets or a sock to the end of the tube. Rubber bands will work great for this.
Some recommend adding activated carbon to your sploof. This can be found at pet stores.;
, After you have gathered the materials needed to build your sploof it's time to assemble it. Building your sploof in a certain way will allow you to exhale the smoke through it and cover up the smell of the smoke. Follow these simple steps to build your sploof.Grab about three dryer sheets and cover one end of the cardboard tube with them.
Secure the dryer sheets in place by putting a rubber band around them.
Fill the length of the tube with the rest of the dryer sheets you have.
You can also add the activated carbon to your tube at this point.

, Now that your sploof has been created it's time to put it to use. Whenever you want to smoke exhale through the sploof. Whatever smoke passes through the dryer sheets will come out smelling fresh, covering up the smell of your smoking.Always exhale through the sploof, pushing the smoke through the dryer sheets.
Change your dryer sheets if you notice their scent fading.
It's likely that some smoke will not pass through the sploof so take care to cover up the smoke in other ways as well.

Choose a trustworthy friend or relative.,
Explain your situation.,
Come up with a plan, if necessary.,
Order your item and show your appreciation.",How to Receive Mail Without Your Parents Knowing2," Your parents might not approve of your online purchase, but your friend's parents or a relative, like an aunt, uncle, or grandparent, might be more understanding. With the approval of a friend or relative, you could have your item shipped to their house instead of yours.


There's always a chance the first person you ask might say no. Make a short list of people who might be willing to help and rank them from most to least likely to help. This way you have backups ready, just in case.
You'll need to be careful about who you choose for this purpose; in some cases the person you ask might inform your parents of your plans. The simple act of asking someone to help you could get you in trouble with your parents.

, If you feel comfortable enough, or if you know for a fact your friend/relative supports you ordering your secret item through the mail, you might want to be honest and tell them exactly what you're ordering. The person helping you may feel betrayed if you lie to them about the thing you are ordering. On the other hand, a simple excuse may make your situation seem less strange.


You might say something like, ""I'm ordering something for mom's birthday. I want it to be a surprise. If she sees a package, she'll know something's up! Will you help me?"", While your friend might be comfortable with you mailing your secret item to his address, his parents might not be. And even if your aunt has no problem with you receiving a package at her home, your uncle might think it inappropriate. In these kinds of situations, you may need to have your accomplice keep a close eye on the mail until the package is received so that others don't become suspicious.


You might want to wait until less understanding people (for example, your friend's parents or your aunt's husband) are out of town or occupied with something out of the home. This way there is even less risk of your mail being discovered.
You should also discuss with your accomplice what your story will be if the item you are having mailed gets found out. This way, if your mail is found out by someone else, inconsistencies in your story and the story of your accomplice don't make others suspicious.
Mailing something to an address without the homeowner's approval and retrieving that mail could get you into trouble. Be sure you have permission before mailing anything to an address not your own.

, Without the help of your friend or relative, you might not have been able to get your item. You could show your appreciation by saying ""thank you,"" but you might want to do something special to show how grateful you are. Some ways you might show your appreciation include:


Picking out a card and writing a short thank you message. This way when you go to pick up your item from your friend/relative's house, you can exchange the thank you card for your mail.
You could treat your friend or relative to a special lunch or dinner. This can be done as simply as saying, ""Hey, I really appreciate you helping me out. Let me say thank you by taking you out to dinner this weekend.""
Showing your appreciation isn't simply good manners. Showing your gratitude will also make your accomplice will be more likely to help you again, should you need it."

Use mail tracking services.,
Discover the mail delivery schedule.,
Verify your parents schedule.,
Order your item and snag it before anyone realizes.",How to Receive Mail Without Your Parents Knowing3," Many items you order online today can be tracked online through a tracking number. You may also be able to sign up for email or text alerts so you have a better idea of when your package is arriving at your home. This way, you don't have to waste your time waiting at home for your item while it's still en route.


Economy mail services sometimes don't give you an option for mail tracking. In this case, you might consider paying a little extra for a premium shipping service. These usually include a tracking number with your mail order receipt., If you've ordered something through your national postal service, like the US Postal Service, you can usually count on mail being delivered on a relatively regular schedule. Private delivery companies, like FedEx or UPS, will likely have a less regular schedule. For these companies, you may not be able to pin down a regular schedule.


If you and your parents don't receive mail very often, you may want to place an order or two that your parents will be alright with first. Stagger these orders so each arrives on a different day. Then keep your eyes peeled for the delivery person to establish a general schedule.
To confirm the mail delivery schedule most precisely, you may need to spend the day at home keeping on eye on the mail. This might require you to faking sick so you can stay home from school.
The day your item is delivered, you might call the delivery service you are using to ask what time your item will be delivered. Simply say something like, ""I have some errands to run today but I'm expecting a package/envelope. I was wondering if you could tell me about what time it might be delivered? My address is..."", It might ruin your plans to recover your mailed item without your parents knowing if they decide to come home early and beat you to the mail. You should check in with your parents the day your package is supposed to arrive to keep tabs on their schedule. In some cases, you might need an excuse so your parents don't get suspicious as to why you're checking in with them.


You might send your mom a text early in the afternoon saying something like, ""Mom, what time are you and dad going to be home tonight? I'm starving already. When are we eating dinner?""
You could order your secret item to be delivered while your parents are out of town to eliminate the risk of having your parents show up unannounced. Even if you find out last minute that your parents are going away for a day or two, next day shipping can help you get your item before your parents get home., Even if your parents are home at the time, quick thinking on your part can still save the day. Of course, if your parents aren't home when your item arrives, there will be little to no chance of them finding out about the package being delivered. However, if you meet the postman at your doorstep or retrieve it before your parents realize, you can tuck your item away somewhere until your parents are distracted. Then you can bring it into your home in a more permanent hiding spot.


For example, if your mother's home when the mail comes and you're worried you won't be able to sneak your item past her, you might hide it under the doormat outside your home, in the bushes around your house, or somewhere else. Later, you can go outside with your backpack so it's hidden when you go back inside.
You might be able to smuggle your item into your home more easily with loose fitting clothes. Hoodie sweatshirts often have large pockets or a pouch where you can hide your item, or you could tuck it into the waist band of your pants.

Keep the smoke contained.,
Use air fresheners.,
Clean yourself up.,
Switch to e-cigarettes or vaporizers.",How to Smoke In Your Room Without Getting Caught2," Part of covering up the smell of smoke will involve keeping it contained. If the smoke drifts out of your room there is a chance that someone will smell it. Make sure any place smoke could escape through is completely covered up before smoking in your room.


If you have any vents in your room cover them with a towel.
Cracks under your door can release smoke from your room. These can be covered with a towel as well.

, Although the smell of smoke can be quite strong, introducing other scents in your room can help cover smoke up. These air fresheners won't likely remove the smell of smoke but they will make it less obvious. Review some of the following scents you can use to help mask the scent of smoke in your room:Deodorizing sprays will work best to cover up the smell of smoke in your room.
Air fresheners or scented air sprays can help mask the smell of smoke.
Burning incense can make the smell of other smoke less distinct.
Don't overuse them as this can actually cause people to become suspicious.

, Although you may have kept the smell of smoke out of the air in your bedroom it will likely still cling to you. The smoky smell can stick to your hands, hair, and clothes and will be noticeable on your breath. Even if your room doesn't smell like smoke you should still make sure you yourself don't smell like it before going out.Wash your hands after smoking.
Make sure your clothes don't smell like smoke. If your clothes smell consider changing them.

Use ventilation to your advantage.,
Keep your room clean.,
Try using air purifiers.",How to Smoke In Your Room Without Getting Caught3," While it is a good idea to plug up any areas you don't want the smoke to escape from, you may want to send the smoke in another direction. By using ventilation that you think is safe you can keep most of the smoke out of your room and away from anyone else who might smell it.Keep your window open and smoke out of it.
Ceiling vents will usually have a fan that will pull the smoke up and out of the room.
Make sure your smoke won't accidentally get carried into another room or near another open window.

, Smoke clings to everything it touches and can remain there for a long while. The longer your room smells like smoke the greater the chances of being discovered are. Keep your room as clean as you can in order to reduce the amount of cigarette smoke particles that might linger.


Wash your walls with a non-abrasive and all-purpose cleaner.Keep carpets clean using carpet cleaners and deodorization products. Vacuum the floor after you've used these products.Baking soda can be applied to furniture and then vacuumed up to remove odor.Always remove old cigarette butts from your room.

,, Don't just sneak for nothing (that's the whole point of sneaking around). A few reasons to sneak around are for a scavenger hunt, or to get your phone, food, or something that you don't have in your room and left somewhere else.

, Like going to the garden pool (your local public pool is most likely closed) and swimming to the other side and back or sneaking to the room next to your parents' room and collecting something.

Practice quickly hiding your phone.,
Be reasonable: don't stay up late on a school night, or stay up to ungodly hours of the morning playing video games.",How to Not Get Caught on Your Phone at Night," If you're sharing a room with someone, you should make the light as dim as possible so they can't see you using your phone. Do this by lowering the brightness on the device itself. If this isn't sufficient, create a cave shape with a thick blanket and sit your phone in there so you can't see the screen light from above or the sides. You may also want to stick to apps with dark colours, since white screens are the brightest.;
, Preferably, don't listen to anything. If you must, however, use headphones on a low setting- high enough to hear the audio, but low enough to hear footsteps coming down the hallway or a knock on the bedroom door. Avoid noise-canceling headphones, since it's easy to ignore warning signs of interruption.

, People may wonder why you're awake so late and jump to conclusions. Before you sleep, make sure you have all the chargers you need, have a big glass of water, go to the bathroom and even bring a small snack if you tend to get hungry at night. This will allow you to stay in bed all night and avoid waking people up.

, Your room needs to look normal from the outside, which means that you can't leave the lights on, since the light will show through the cracks in your doorway. Also, keep in mind that while closing your door will mean less people peering in, it also creates suspicion, so leave it as you normally would.

, For example, if your sibling is going to a sleepover and your parents are seeing a movie, you can have a good few hours of uninhibited alone time where you don't have to worry about being caught. However, it's important to note when they will arrive home and if they usually check on you before they go to bed, because those are times you'll be most likely to get caught.

, Get in to a position where you can quickly shut your phone off, slide it under your pillow/blankets so its hidden, and pretend to be asleep. This means it's better to be lying in bed than sitting up in a chair or on the floor.

, It's unhealthy if you do it regularly and there's a reason your parents don't want you doing it, so use these tips at your discretion.

Decide where you will keep your secret pet.,
Keep the pet at someone else's house.,
Place air fresheners in their room.,
Soundproof the room.,
Buy the necessities for your pet.,
Clean up after your pet.,
Have a backup plan.",How to Hide a Pet from Your Parents1," You should find a space that has plenty of room for the specific pet where your parents are unlikely to stumble upon it. You may want to have a back-up room if your parents need the space unexpectedly. Keep them contained within this space. Options include:


Your bedroom
A basement
An unused garage
The backyard (if it is a caged pet or a cat);
, If you cannot hide the pet in your own home, you can ask a friend to hold onto the pet for you. Make sure that you still provide food, toys, and bedding for the pet. Promise your friend that you will find the pet a new home if your parents do not eventually let you move the pet into their house. This is a better option for larger animals, such as cats and dogs.

, Animals can smell bad. If the smell is not taken care of, it will soon spread throughout the house, alerting your parents. Make sure that the pet’s room is constantly cleaned. Use air fresheners to combat the smell.


Do not leave lit scented candles in the room as this is a fire risk.

, It will be important to make sure your parents cannot hear your pet. Dogs bark; cats yowl; hamsters run endlessly on creaking wheels. While you cannot perfectly soundproof a room, you can minimize the noise.


Try hanging cork boards or foam squares on your wall. (You can buy both at a craft store).You can decorate these so that it does not look suspicious.
Place a rug under your door to prevent sound from going through the crack.
You can also cover up the noise by leaving a stereo or TV on while you're out. Keep it on a medium volume. If it is too loud, your parents may enter the room to turn it off.

, You won’t be able to ask your parents to buy your pet a bed or to supply you with pet food. Save up some money so you can buy everything your pet needs yourself. Pets generally need food, a water bowl or bottle, toys, and bedding. Some may require a cage.


Dogs will need a bed, blankets, chew toys, treats, dry kibble, dishes for food and water, and a leash.Cats need a scratching post, toys, food and water bowls, dry food, a litter box, litter, and a bed.Small rodents like guinea pigs, hamsters, and mice need a cage, dry food pellets, fresh vegetables, a water bottle, timothy hay (to line the cage), toys like wheels and tunnels, and soft bedding.Reptiles and snakes will need a glass terrarium, UVB basking lights, food (which may include pellets or live bait), rocks, and plants., Animals shed, and they can leave their fur on carpet, chairs, couches, and clothes. Use a lint roller to pick up stray fur. Vacuum to remove loose fur, wood shavings, or food pellets. Clean the room at least once a week, making sure to dust and disinfect the room.


If you don’t have a lint roller, masking tape can also work. Unroll a few inches of tape, and press the sticky side down on the furry surface. Lift it to remove fur.
Do not use disinfectants containing ammonia. Dogs and cats do not like the smell, and this can cause them to pee around the room!, Even if your plan may be working well, most pets can't spend all of their time hiding. You should keep your pet hidden for about two weeks. If you think your parents are ready to negotiate, introduce them to your new pet and explain to them how well you took care of it. If all else fails, make sure you have a good home for your pet to go to if your parents say no.

Give yourself some time to calm down.,
Approach your mom.,
React without anger.,
Explain what happened to make you mad.,
Listen to what your mom has to say.,
Get it all out.,
Ask for a change.,
Find ways to improve your relationship.,
Tell your mom you love her.,
Write your mom a letter.,
Record a video message.,
Talk to your other parent.,
Own your anger.,
Tell your mom you need some time.,
Think about why you are mad at your mom.,
Remind yourself of all the things your mom does for you.,
Write it down.",How to Let Your Mom Know You're Mad at Her," Though it may be tempting, approaching anyone when you are very upset and angry is unlikely to improve the situation. You are more likely to say things you don’t mean, and less likely to try and engage in a productive conversation about what angered you in the first place.If your mom doesn’t realize you are angry, and keeps trying to talk to you or ask you to do something, tell her you need to go to the bathroom, and use that as an excuse to calm down for a few minutes. Splash some water on your face, and just give yourself a few minutes to be alone.;
, Once you have calmed down, and you are ready to tell your mom that she has made you mad, start out by saying that it isn’t easy for you to have this conversation, and that she may feel upset when she hears it, but that you have to tell her in order to get over it.By pointing this out, your mom will understand that you are saying something that you feel you need to get off your chest, and it will sound less like you are just trying to start a fight. Hopefully, she will also not feel that she needs to react defensively.

, Hopefully by now, you've given yourself enough time to cool off. This will make it possible to have the conversation without yelling, or saying things you don't mean.Keep yourself open to hearing what she has to say, and when you speak, keep your voice even. If you start to get upset again, do your best to not raise your voice, as this will only add stress and tension to the situation.

, Here, it is very important to phrase things in terms of “I feel…”, rather than saying, “You did this, and you made me angry.” This is an accusation, and it makes the other person very likely to feel like they need to fight back.For example, if your mom made you angry because she lectured you about getting good grades in front of your friends, then say, “I feel hurt and embarrassed when you talk to me about my grades in front of my friends.” Don’t say, “You were trying to make me feel stupid when you lectured me about my grades in front of my friends. Why did you do that?!” This makes it sound like she meant to make you feel embarrassed. Maybe she did, and maybe she didn’t, but accusing her will not improve the situation.

, Hopefully your mom will point out that she didn’t mean to embarrass you, and that she will try not to do it in the future. At this point, you should also find out why your mom said or did whatever it was that angered you.You can do this by saying, “I know you probably didn’t mean to embarrass me, but why did you decide to lecture me just then? Was it something I said?” This way you can understand what triggered the behavior in the first place, and hopefully do your part to avoid it in the future.
Listen without interrupting. Give her a chance to say everything she wants to say so that you can respond to everything she has said, if need be.

, Don’t hold back anything that you want to get off your chest while you are having this conversation with your mom. However, understand that this doesn’t mean that you should bring up every upsetting thing your mom has ever done. What it does mean, is that if something about the event is still nagging at your mind, bring it up so you can talk about it together.Remember to keep things in terms of, “I feel…”, don’t revert back to accusing your mom. She loves you very much, and although she may not be perfect, it is highly unlikely she ever wants to do anything to hurt you.

, If your mom has done something that recurs over and over, ask her if you can make a change together to avoid this fight in the future. Make a suggestion about what you want to change, and how you want to change it.


Listen openly to her suggestions, too. Sometimes mom really does know best, and she may have ideas that you hadn’t thought of.

, Relationships with parents can be challenging, and if you find yourself fighting with your mom often, then it might be a good idea to take the initiative to improve it.


Try to spend some time together doing something you both enjoy. Go for a walk, have a coffee, go see a movie.
Find time to talk about things going on in your life. Your mom is probably interested in how things are going for you, so share those things. Let her share with you, too.

, If you are able to resolve everything in the conversation, and feel better, remind your mom that you love and appreciate all she does for you. Most moms are doing the very best they can, and your mom may feel sad or disappointed in herself for letting you down.


Give her a hug, and tell her not to worry. Tell her you are glad that you were able to work everything out with her.

, If your mom tends to shut you down when you try to talk to her about your feelings, then you might consider writing her your feelings in a letter. As you would when talking to her, you should try to be firm, but also respectful. Explain what happened that made you feel angry, and use the “I feel…” language instead of making accusations.


Be sure to include everything you would have included if you talked with her. Ask her why she did or said what she said. Remind her that you love her, and that you want to work through the problem together with her.
In the letter, if you are open to talking with her, tell her that. Explain that you want to have a conversation where your feelings are also respected.
You could also suggest that if she does not want to talk with you about it that she can write back to you, and you can talk about it that way.
Writing a letter has the advantage that you can get everything out on paper exactly the way you want to say it. It also gives your mom a bit of time to process what you have said, so hopefully she won’t feel the need to react defensively.

, Another option for communicating your anger without a face-to-face conversation is to record a video message using your phone or computer. This has the added advantage that you may be able to express the emotions you are feeling more clearly than in a letter.


Again, do exactly as you would in a face-to-face conversation. Be firm and respectful, and use “I feel…” language.
Avoid making a video where you raise your voice angrily. It is alright to record a video like this in order to get all your feelings out, but don’t send that version to your mom. It will be more effective if you are able to speak calmly and respectfully.

, If you have another parent, or maybe an older sibling, try talking to them if you have already tried talking to your mom without success. They may be able to give you ideas about how to deal with your mom more effectively, or they may be willing to talk to your mom for you.


In this conversation, it is important to keep all the same elements of a direct conversation with your mom. Be respectful, and don’t trash talk your mom. Don’t accuse her, but stick to “I feel…” language.
Listen to their advice and don’t expect them to resolve the problem entirely. They may be able to help you, but ultimately you and your mom will have to find a way to figure things out together, or your relationship may become very damaged.

, Acknowledge to yourself that you are angry. You should do this alone before you try to confront your mom about your feelings.This will help you begin to see things more rationally.

, If your mom has noticed that you seem upset, but you don’t feel ready to talk yet, tell her that. Explain that you are angry about something that happened, but you need a bit of time to go over it in your head, and that you would like a bit of space until you are ready to talk.


Understand that your mom may become very worried when you say this, especially if you she doesn’t realize that she has made you mad. Try to reassure her that everything will be fine, and that you only need a bit of space.

, What exactly did your mom do or say that made you feel angry? Taking the time to reflect on what she did to anger you will help you to explain to her what happened that upset you.


Remember that anger is a secondary emotion.This means that when we feel anger, we are likely protecting ourselves from a more vulnerable, primary emotion such as fear, sadness, or anxiety. Think about how what your mom said or did really made you feel? Did it make you fear that you will always have to work very hard for her approval? That is actually fear that you were feeling.

, It is easy to get angry with loved ones, especially someone like your mom, because you know she won’t leave you no matter how many time you fight. When you get mad, try to take a second and remember all the things she does for you. Without her, you probably wouldn’t exist, you wouldn’t have food to eat, or a place to live.Think about a time where she really went out of her way to make you happy. Maybe she threw you a nice birthday party, or took you and your friends out for ice cream. Remember that she did those things only to see you happy.

, Writing down everything you are feeling (whether you are upset or not) can be a really great way to let off some steam. This is especially true if you feel that you are very upset, and can’t yet talk to anyone without losing your temper. If you are upset, write down what happened on a piece of paper. You don’t have to do anything with this paper, just write it down and then throw it away if you want to.This will also give you an outlet if what you really want to do is say something mean to your mom. If this is the case, write down all of the mean things you want to say, then tear it up and throw it away. This may help keep you from saying something that will really hurt your mom.
Remember to tear up the paper into unreadable bits though! You don’t want your mom to find it, as she might feel really hurt by what you’ve written.

Walk the dog when your parents aren’t home.,
Housetrain the dog.,
Train the dog not to bark.,
Wash the dog’s bedding in a separate load.,
Wash the dog outside of the house.",How to Hide a Pet from Your Parents2," Dogs need plenty of time outside. Exercise is important, and they will need to poop and pee. Dogs are very difficult to hide for this reason; do not think that you can just keep the dog inside. Wait until your parents are out of the house to walk them. You can also wake up early before they are awake to take your dog outside. They may see your dog as you bring him in or out of the house, so be careful. Use a backdoor if possible.

, Frequent accidents in the house can be a major hint for your parents, especially if they smell or find the evidence. At first, you will have to walk your dog every two hours. Encourage them to go in the same spot every time. Give them a treat when they have gone.This will encourage them to only go outside.


If the dog leaves a mess in the house, you should be sure to pick it up right away. Use scented disinfectants to mask the smell.

, Noisy dogs will soon alert your parents to their presence. When your dog starts barking, give them a treat, and use a word like “quiet.” The treat will get them to momentarily stop barking. Soon, they should stop barking whenever they hear the command “quiet.”Dogs will bark. They bark to protect their territory, because they afraid or sick, or because they are bored. There is no proven method to stop barking completely, so make sure their room is soundproofed.

, Don’t just toss furry blankets into the laundry hamper. You will have to wash all of your dog’s bedding yourself in the washing machine. Save up dirty blankets and beds until you have a full load.

, It may be tempting to wash the dog in a bathtub, but this can leave a big mess that your parents can find. If you can, take your dog outside for a bath. Use a garden hose, or fill up a tub of water and bring it outside. Comb your dog’s hair before washing, and use dog shampoo.Make sure the dog is dry before you bring him back inside. You should probably try this while your parents are not home.

Choose dry food instead of wet food.,
Disguise the litter box.,
Wash the litter box twice a week.,
Buy a scratching post.",How to Hide a Pet from Your Parents3," Wet cat food tends to made of smelly fish. Leaving open cans of it open around the house can leave a suspicious scent. Furthermore, wet food may attract more pests, such as flies or roaches. Choose dry pellets instead.

, There are many creative solutions for hiding a litter box. An easy solution is to cut a cat sized square from a cardboard box. Place the box upside down over the litter box. The hole should form a little cat door. Drape a blanket over the box, making sure that the side with the cat door is left open. You can also stick the litter box behind other furniture. Just make sure that your cat can go in and out with ease.

, While you should be scooping out feces every day, you should change the litter twice a week.Empty the cat litter in a separate trash bag. Don’t just dump the litter into the trash can. Your parents may find it later, and it can tip them off about your secret cat. After cleaning the litter box, take the trash bag out to the curb or dumpster right away. Wash out the box with mild dish soap and water. Make sure to rinse completely.

, Cats have a natural need to scratch. If they don’t have a scratching post, they will scratch up furniture instead. Your parents will really notice your cat if they see their claw marks everywhere! You should have a few scratching toys for your cat."

Invest in a proper cage.,
Hide the cage in a corner or closet.,
Place the cage on a high shelf.,
Cover the cage with a blanket.,
Clean the cage every week.,
Turn off lights at night.",How to Hide a Pet from Your Parents4," Certain animals—such as hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, lizards, and snakes—require a cage to live in. You may be tempted to let your animal friend run freely around the room, or you may try to make a shelter out of a drawer or cupboard. Do not do this. Your pet may get loose, or there may not be enough air for your pet to breathe. If your parent sees them running loose in the house, they may think it is a wild animal and get rid of it. Always get a proper pet cage, hutch, or tank.


Guinea pigs and rabbits can have hutches or cube and coroplast cages.
Hamsters and mice can live in wire cages.
Fish live in tanks or aquariums. Some fish will require aquarium lights.
Reptiles live in glass terrariums. They will need a basking lamp with a UVB lightbulb., You can place the cage in a corner and arrange your furniture around it so that it cannot be seen. Similarly, if your closet is big enough, you can try fitting it there. Be sure to leave your closet door slightly open so there is plenty of air getting to your pets.


Some pets do not like being in the dark constantly. Leave a closet light on, or make sure that there is a small light attached to your cage.

, Few cages are small enough to fit under a bed, but you may be able to keep it out of view on a shelf. Make sure you that you can easily reach the cage without trouble. Use books and other items to hide the cage on the shelf. This works best for smaller cages, such as hamster cages, reptile terrariums, or small fish bowls.

, If you have a guinea pig cage or rabbit hutch, you can drape a blanket over the cage to hide most of it. Make sure that there is at least one wire/mesh wall free so your pets can breathe and look out. If the cage can support it, place light objects, such as notebooks or jewelry boxes, on top to disguise it.


If you have a fish tank, a wire hamster cage, or a reptile terrarium, this is not a good idea, as the top may need to be left open for oxygen, lamp wires, or exercise.

, You should scoop out any poop every day, but at least once a week, do a thorough cleaning. Remove your pet into a separate box or cage. Scoop out the hay or litter into a plastic garbage bag. Take it to the curb immediately. Wash the cage down with dish soap and water or a mixture of vinegar and water. Let it dry, refill with shavings, and put your pet back in.If you have a reptile in a terrarium, be sure to spray down the glass with a disinfectant.
If you have a fish, take the fish out to another bowl or a cooler full of water. Scoop out any debris, and replace the water with fresh before returning the fish to the bowl.

, For pets that need light, you can switch off the light when it gets dark. Most reptiles need sunlight during the day but complete darkness during the night.The same goes for most types of fish. You can give them a few hours of light at night before shutting off their aquarium light.This is convenient for you as it ensures that your parents will not be alerted by any lights at night time.


Always double check the guidelines for the specific breeds or species you own. Some need more light than others, and some may require light at night.

Find an alternate home.,
Practice what you will say.,
Sit down with your parents.,
Tell them.,
Show your parents the pet.",How to Hide a Pet from Your Parents5," When you show your parents your pet, you'll want to put its best face forward. If possible, give your pet a bath. Clean out their cage, and wash their bedding. Make sure that their room is tidy. If your parents see that the animal is well cared for, they may be more likely to let you keep it.

, Just in case your parents say no, make sure you have your back-up plan all set. Find a friend or relative who is willing to take your pet for you. Offer them all of the necessary pet supplies. Avoid taking your pets to a shelter unless you have no other option., You want to make sure you appear mature and collected when you show your parents your pet. Since this can be an emotional topic, write down what you want to tell them. Try saying it in front of the mirror a few times.

, The best time to talk to your parents is at home when no one is distracted. Tell your parents that you want to talk, and ask them to sit down with you. Do not tell them as they are driving, cooking, or cleaning. You may be able to talk with them over dinner.


Be careful about approaching them right after they get home from work. They may be tired and stressed out. Wait for them to relax before you talk to them.

, Be honest and straightforward. Let them know how well you have taken care of the pet. If they haven't noticed, point out that the pet is not as noisy or smelly as they may have thought. Acknowledge that you broke the rules, and apologize for it. Ask them if you can keep the pet. Promise to take care of the pet yourself.


For example, you can say, ""I found a cat that needed a home. For the last two weeks, I have cared for the cat in my bedroom. She is very sweet, and I have taken care of her all by myself. I hope to continue caring for her. I know I have broken your trust, but please, can I keep her?""
If your parents say no, you have to live with consequences. Give the pet to another home along with all of their bedding, toys, and food. You may be grounded or punished.

, Bring your pet out to show them. Let them hold and touch your pet. If they form an emotional bond with the pet, your parents may be more likely to let you keep it.

Do not lie.,
Anticipate your parents' reactions.,
Do something nice for them.,
Keep track of your relationship with your parents.",How to Make Your Parents Leave You Alone1," It's normal to feel hesitant when confronting your parents because you may still be dependent on your parents' finances or emotional comfort.If you need help talking about your boundary issues, then write out the specifics of what is bothering you. Showing your parents concrete examples will help them understand where you are coming from.


Remember they don't have it ""out for you"" so don't be afraid to approach them.
Be honest and open, but don't attack your parents. Restrain yourself from insulting your parents in this talk. This could potentially lead to arguments that fail at solving the real problems you're having.
Just knowing that your parents are aware of what you are going through can reduce your feelings of annoyance towards them.;
, Telling a lie can seem like an easy way out of a more complicated problem, but it'll only cause negative complications in the end. Parents are not dumb. If you tell a series of lies then you may trap yourself in a web of lies. In this situation a parent is more prone to see through your dishonesty. Lying hurts the ones you love.Parents can become angry for being mislead or even frightened for the future of your well-being.In the end, lying will only weaken your chances of having your wishes respected.

, Don't expect your parents to freely give you all the space you're imagining. You have to earn their trust. Initiating a conversation could merely be the beginning of a much longer process. If getting your alone time means hurting or causing your parents to cry, then consider if it is worth it.


Think of them as normal adults, rather than as your parents.Approaching them in this fashion could strengthen how open you are with your feelings.

, Studies show certain health benefits in response to actions of kindness whether you are the giver or receiver.Kindness can improve the immune system and increase the brain's release of serotonin.If they see that you are making an effort then they'll be more inclined to listen to your wishes. Try a few things around the house like:


Vacuuming the house
Doing the dishes after dinner
Cleaning your room
Offering to babysit a younger sibling

, Don't let things build up and allow a small problem to snow-ball into a serious issue. Communication is key for any relationship. If you act in an open and honest manner to your parents, both you and your parents could reap the benefits. A good relationship between parents and their children is powerful.

Debate carefully whether to address the favoritism.,
Avoid blaming your siblings for your parents’ behavior.,
Don’t compete.,
Work around your own favoritism.,
Go to family therapy.,
Discuss the possibility of bringing in a third party.",How to Handle Parents Playing Favorites As an Adult1," Telling your family members about your feelings might just stir up negativity. On the other hand, it could lead to a productive conversation and a positive resolution. Take your individual family situation into account as you consider whether to speak up.If you think your parents aren’t intentionally making you or your siblings feel left out, a tactful conversation might be appropriate.
On the other hand, if your parents typically get defensive when approached with critical views and tend to hold grudges against people who expressed displeasure with them, bringing up this issue may further strain the relationship. Consider whether you are prepared for that additional stress.;
, While it’s natural to resent the siblings your parents favor, try to put these feelings aside. Remember that your siblings didn’t choose to be the favored ones.Even “golden children” are sometimes negatively affected by their parents’ expectations. Your favored sibling may be suffering, too, just in a different way.
If your sibling is in agreement regarding your parent's behavior toward you, it may actually help to have them next to you as a voice of support.

, Resist the urge to compare yourself to your siblings or try to win a bigger share of your parents’ affection. This will only drive a wedge between you. Instead, focus on the fact that you’re all adults leading separate lives, and try to be happy for their successes.If one sibling likes to talk about how your parents spend extra time or money on them, change the subject, or limit the amount of time you spend around them.
Remember that your parent's approval or lack thereof does not define your success. Take time to define success for yourself and evaluate whether you are holding yourself to your own standards.

, In some cases, your parents may show favoritism towards you while diminishing your siblings' accomplishments. If you are the favored child and feel it’s not fair, consider gently asking your parents to include your siblings more often.


For instance, you could say something like, “Dad, I love it that you always come to visit during the summer, but Mary misses you too. I was thinking that maybe we could all go to see her this year instead.”
Try to support your sibling and reinforce their efforts to get your parents to balance their time and attention more equitably.

, If you and your family members are having a hard time solving your problems, family therapy might be a helpful option. Talking out your problems in a neutral environment may help you keep your discussion productive and civil, and a trained therapist may be able to help you get to the bottom of old hurts and move forward., Certain issues, like splitting up inheritance money or maintaining a vacation home, can breed resentment among siblings. Talk to your parents about whether they would be willing to hire a neutral third party to take care of any touchy financial issues laid out in their will."

Do something for them.,
Give reasons for why you need your phone back.,
Ask them what is necessary to get your phone back, if they haven't told you.,
Wait.",How to Get Your Phone Back1," Tell them how sorry you are for your wrongdoing. This might not work, but it's certainly worth a try, especially if you have made a mistake you cannot correct. Tell them what you plan on doing differently in the future. Express yourself clearly and politely., If they are trying to get you to clean your room, come home on time, or some other chore, find out what the issue it is and correct it. This will show your parents that you are sincerely sorry and are making active efforts to improve your behavior., If it is too late to correct the problem, try to make up for it. Clean a room and do a good job of it. Do your homework without complaining. Try to choose something to do that will demonstrate that you have learned your lesson.

, Communicate your needs, and tell them someone is texting you the math assignment or that you want to call a classmate for help. They might allow you to do this, but will take it back when you are done. Be patient and hope for the best.


Remind your parents that the phone is important for your safety. Ask them: What if they needed to reach you in an emergency?

, Then, do your best to comply with their requirements. Make suggestions as to how you can improve your behavior in the future if they do not have any ideas., If all else fails, wait it out. Let your friends know to contact you some other way instead. Your parents will be impressed by your patience and maturity, and you could get your phone back sooner than you expect.Ask for a time limit on the punishment and ask to know when it is. Then, remind your parents when the time is up.

Get a job.,
Stay after school to finish assignments.,
Become involved with an extracurricular activity.,
Hang out with your friends.,
Start dating somebody.,
Stay out of trouble.",How to Make Your Parents Leave You Alone2," Becoming employed can show your parents that you want to be more independent. Most parents think working instills a variety of positive traits like developing work ethic and strengthening your independence.Working will also give you time away from your parents. Getting a job shows your parents that you care about your future and might alleviate some of their concerns with your well-being.


There are various ways you can prepare yourself for getting the job that is right for you.

, Parents, in general, are usually concerned with your school work and your educational future. Finishing your assignments on time and staying up-to-date with your studies will prove that you are responsible and need less direction from your parents.


If you are struggling in school then arrange for a tutoring service provided by your teacher or school. This will both lessen your time with your parents and show them that you don't need them to bother you about school work.
If you are making good grades be sure to tell your parents.

, Staying after-school can only occupy so much time. Inquire with your school about the various extracurricular programs you can become involved with. Occupying your time away from your home life could create the necessary space you need from your parents.


If you're unsure about what programs your school has to offer, then ask your favorite teacher or councilor.

, Friends' homes can be your safe-haven while your parents are bothering you. Plan activities with your friends that will get you out of the house like:


Going to the arcade
Going bowling
Going to see a movie
Playing laser tag
A group of your friends are having a sleepover.
Their parents invited you on a weekend camping or beach trip.
Their parents invited you over for dinner.

, Dating can teach you about establishing a healthy and stable relationship that can extend into strengthening your relationship with your parents.Entering into a relationship occupies your time and lots of parents will understand that this space is necessary. It might not be easy for you to rush into a relationship. If there is somebody in mind then try asking them out for coffee or to go see a movie.


Rushing into a relationship for the wrong reasons could cause serious problems between the other person and yourself. Only follow this step if it feels natural for you to spend time with this person.
Take the time and make a plan. This will improve your chances of the other person agreeing to see you.

, Getting in trouble at school or with the law will only raise your parents' attention towards you. If you do something that could get you into trouble and caught by the authorities, then don't do it. Separate yourself from certain friends that are prone to getting into trouble. If your parents begin to notice that you've weaved trouble making friends out of your life, then they'll appreciate it.


Set high standards with your friendships and your life goals. If you dream big, then you'll feel more pressure to stay out trouble."
"
Recognize how your parents are bothering you.,
Notice your behavior towards your parents.,
Find out if anything has changed in your parents' life.,
Talk to others about your parents' behavior.,
Wait it out.",How to Make Your Parents Leave You Alone3," Try to figure out which aspects of your life your parents are bothering you in. You won't be able to get them to leave you alone completely, but you could figure out what area of your life is most important to be your time not theirs.


Keep track of your time with your parents for about a week. Write down specific events or conversations that are especially bothering you.

, Relationships are a two-way street. If you are acting rude towards your parents, they could feel inclined, out of concern, to become more involved with you. If you continue to get into a conversation or argument you dislike, then recall your language and tone. Is this different than your normal speaking voice?Even if you consider yourself to be a friendly person, recognize if this behavior is causing your parents to interact with you more than you'd like.

, Your parents could be going through a hard time at work or even experiencing a rough patch in their relationship. Try asking your parents how their day was.Inquiring about what they are going through could help lead them to admit they're recent over-involvement with you.


If you are only experiencing annoyances with one parent, try asking their friend or your other parent/guardian about the parent in question. They may have good advise on what is bothering them.

, If you have an older sibling, then find out if they went through the same thing. Ask your friends about their relationships and inquire if you're problems are common among your group of friends. Meet with a trusted mentor (teacher, adviser, babysitter, etc) and ask them about your parents being overbearing.


If you are still unsure about your dilemma, consult with a guidance councilor or ask your parents for a therapist.

, If this feeling is a recent development, then try waiting a week or two to see if their actions persist. Issues can fluctuate into an overwhelming period of time, and sometimes during this time people need help or the company of others. Remember your parents are also human beings and deserve your patience.

Make sure you know why you are getting a tattoo.,
Consider your decision carefully.,
Organize your ideas.,
Make sure to consider the placement of the tattoo.,
Do your research.,
Know what the artist does.,
Show your parents that you really understand what getting a tattoo means.,
Allow your parents to have their say on things.,
Take your parents with you when you go to look at studios and talk to artists.,
Offer to help save up for the tattoo yourself.,
Be ready for your parents to say no.",How to Get Your Parents to Let You Get a Tattoo," If you're not entirely sure why you want one, or if it's simply to show off or because all your friends have one, there's no point trying to convince your parents of its utility at your young age.;
, Wait a few weeks after you decided to get a tattoo. Make sure that this is definitely something you want to do, and that it is not something you will regret doing later. Tattoos are serious business--they are not easily ""erased"" and removal does not come cheap or painless.

, You might want to write down the points you want to present to your parents on a piece of paper before actually talking to them. The following are things you might want to include:


You might change your mind.
Why you want to get a tattoo. What are your reasons for wanting a tattoo? ""I just want to get one because it sounds cool"" or ""I want a tattoo because all of (or one of) my friends got one"" are not reasons that your parents will support. However, reasons such as ""My tattoo will be a daily reminder to me of something that happened in my lifetime"" or ""I want this tattoo to be a symbol of a value I have (or am striving to get)"" are both good reasons to get a tattoo.
What image or words you want to be tattooed onto your skin. If you want the words ""hope"", ""love"", ""peace"", or related positive, uplifting words as a tattoo, your parents will likely be more supportive of your decision. However, if you want to tattoo a ""dirty"" or ""cuss"" word on your skin, or you want a negative or ""bad"" image or word tattooed, your parents might count that as a strike against you.
What reasons should you be enabled to get a tattoo? Have you been very responsible the last month (or longer)? Have you been very nice lately? Has your behavior been decent and respectable?

, Your parents might be more willing to allow you to get a tattoo if the placement of it is relatively unseen, yet not in an incredibly private area. Good placements are on your shoulder, in between your shoulders, on your back, on the back of your lower legs, on your ankle, or even on the side of your abdominal area.

, Look around at the places where tattoos are given. Make sure that the work the tattoo artist has done is well done, and that they are very professional. You will earn points if you select a popular, professional tattoo artist that has lots of experience. Your parents will likely want to review the work that artist has done, to assure that they know what they are doing.

, Your parents will want to know about the artist's practices. Are they very sanitary? Are their tools clean? You can get all different kinds of illnesses that are passed on by the tools used to give you a tattoo.

, Explain that you understand that tattoos are permanent and tell them that you definitely want the design you have chosen on your body forever. Tell them why you like your design so much, perhaps it is a tribute to a loved one, or an image or phrase that holds personal meaning to you. This will help them to understand why you want this permanently on your body.


Present all of the information you gathered during the research phase, to address their questions before they even ask them.

, Shouting at your parents and not letting them have their own opinion will only prove you're not mature enough to have a tattoo.


Allow your parents to help you design your tattoo and give their own ideas. Don't let them pressure you into having something you don't want, but listen to them and take on board what they say. For example, if you really want a visible tattoo, your parents may suggest you get it somewhere that can be covered easily if there's a time that you don't want it to be seen. Think about what they say, you may be glad you followed their advice in the future.

, Your parents will want to make sure the studio is clean and hygienic and also look at the artists work to make sure that they do a good job and can create good looking tattoos.

, Your parents will know that you really want a tattoo if you work hard and earn money for it.

, If they do, say, ""okay, I understand,"" and then wait a few weeks and ask them again. If you start nagging them or try to ""reason with them"" then they will just say no. But if you act maturely, they will notice and think you really are ready for a tattoo!

Focus on your own life.,
Seek support for any mental health issues you have.,
Build your own support network.,
Limit the time you spend around toxic family members.",How to Handle Parents Playing Favorites As an Adult2," You and your siblings are different people, so there’s no point in making comparisons or feeling envious of them. Instead of letting a lingering sense of rivalry eat away at you, put your energy into living a life that’s fulfilling to you and true to your values.When you’re secure in yourself, you’ll have a better starting point for creating good adult relationships with your siblings.
Try to find positive ways in which you and your sibling differ. This may better help you appreciate the good things all members of your family bring into the group.

, Growing up as the disfavored child can cause mental health problems like depression. These issues often persist into adulthood. If you think your family situation is impacting your mental health, see a counselor or therapist.In addition, growing up as the favored child can place a heavy burden of expectations on you. It may help to work with a therapist to resolve these issues, too.

, You can’t choose your family, but you can choose your friends and spouse. Surround yourself with positive and caring people who will lift you up when your family situation gets you down.


If you have kids yourself, focus on raising them the way you wish your parents had raised you and your siblings., If, despite your best efforts to get along, your parents or siblings act competitive or cruel towards you, it may be best to simply spend less time around them. Know your own limits, and set boundaries for which negative behaviors you won’t tolerate.For instance, you might be able to tolerate a sibling’s petty behavior, but draw the line at verbal abuse.
You may also elect to take the lead on planning situations in which you will see these family members so that you can better control your comfort level by accounting for things like location, time, who will be there, length of the visit, etc.

Reflect on your childhood family dynamics.,
Question the driving force behind your parents' favoritism.,
Try not to take your parents’ favoritism personally.",How to Handle Parents Playing Favorites As an Adult3," Ask yourself whether Mom was always closest to one of your sisters, or whether Dad never got along with you. If your parents favored or disfavored some of their children years ago, it’s natural for the pattern to continue into your adulthood.Just because it’s a long-standing habit doesn’t make your parents’ favoritism right. However, looking at the past might make it easier to understand why the behavior is happening now.
It may also be helpful to look at the ways in which your parents were raised. It could offer insight and perhaps even empathy. If, for example, they grew up in a family where one child was favored, it may be the only family dynamic they know or understand.

, Some parents favor their children because they live nearby, share similar lifestyles and values, or have similar personalities. Other parents’ favoritism is based on financial worries about one of their children. Consider whether any of these factors could be playing a role in your parents’ behavior.For example, if you are an engineer and your brother is a teacher, your parents’ monetary gifts to him might be an attempt to level the playing field between the two of you.

, Parental favoritism can sting if you’re not the favored child. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean they love you any less than your siblings – proximity and circumstance may have more to do with their behavior.Try to look at the situation from your parents’ perspective. You may find it unfair that they bought your sibling a house, for instance, but maybe they would have felt guilty if they hadn’t given their least financially successful child a helping hand.

Resist the urge to chase the thief down.,
Call the police.,
Alert your phone service provider.",How to Get Your Phone Back2," If someone has stolen your phone, do not try to chase or follow them. You never know if they could be concealing a weapon. Simply contact the authorities as soon as you can so they can handle an escalated situation.

, Let the local authorities know that your device has been stolen, and they may be able to get it back. It is best to let the professionals deal with stolen property, especially since you may be dealing with dangerous criminals. Respect the limits of the police, as they may not be able to recover your phone, but they will try their best., They can put a hold on your account so that the phone cannot be used under your name and funds. They may also be able to track your phone, depending on whether you have made use of applications such as ""Find My Phone"" and other location services."
"
Call your phone.,
Retrace your steps.,
Ask people you know.",How to Get Your Phone Back3," Use another phone to dial your phone number. Surprisingly, if your phone is on, you may find that it isn't very far from you. Have a friend help you by going into various rooms to listen for the phone's ring or vibration.

, Try to remember where you last had the phone, and go back to the places you have recently been. If you had been at a bar the previous night, call the bar and ask about any recovered devices., Somebody you know could have recognized the phone as yours and picked it up, or could have seen where you had been last using it. Sometimes, people even turn a lost phone over to police or security, so contact them to learn if they have received any phones. Check your nearest lost-and-found and ask the customer service employees at stores you may have recently visited.

Avoid conversations while they’re drinking.,
Choose your wording carefully.,
Discuss your observations.,
Have mini conversations.,
Know when to drop the issue.",How to Deal with Elderly Alcoholic Parents As an Adult1," If your parent picks up the phone and you can tell they’ve been drinking, say that you will call back or talk another time. Talking to someone who’s been drinking can be difficult and cause you to become angry. It will also be difficult for your parent to absorb or respond appropriately to what you are trying to say to them if they are not sober and rational. Even if you’re upset, avoid expressing that while your parent is under the influence. Wait to talk about it later.If you need to end a conversation, say, “Let’s speak later, I can tell now is not a good time,” or say, “I can tell you’ve been drinking and I don’t want to talk to you right now. Please call me when you are sober.”
If you know you parent tends to drink in the evenings, plan to talk to them earlier in the day.;
, When speaking with your parent, be careful in how you speak. You may choose not to use the words “alcoholic” as this might make them feel ashamed or bad, which may lead to more drinking. The word “alcoholic” carries some stigma, so say “your drinking habits” or “alcohol use” instead.When you speak to your parent, avoid getting angry or upset and instead, focus on being gentle and loving.


Focus your words on yourself and less on your parent. Use “I” statements as a way to avoid blaming your parent and take ownership of your feelings.For example, say, “I feel sad and disappointed when you miss time to play with your grandchildren because of alcohol.” This is less accusing than saying, “You choose alcohol over your grandkids and we don’t like that.”
Remember that your parent is probably already aware that they have a problem. Speaking to them in a harsh or judgmental way will not improve the situation. Let them know that you are on their side and ready to help, if they are willing to accept help.

, If you think your parent needs help, talk to them about it. They may not realize they have become an alcoholic or may be in denial. Stating the behaviors you see can show that you are noticing changes related to alcohol.Say, “I’ve noticed our phone calls have been different lately. You’ve been slurring your words and it’s hard to understand you. Is something going on?”
You can also say, “I can tell you’re drinking again by the way you walk and talk.”

, Instead of having one giant conversation about alcoholism, have some small conversations that show that you are concerned. Before staging a full intervention, take moments to say how your parent’s drinking makes you feel. Let them know that you notice their drinking habits and the harm they are causing. If they remain hesitant to seek help, then it may be time to arrange an intervention with a professional.Say, “I’m concerned about you. I’ve noticed you drinking much more since Mom died. I’m sad, too, but drinking won’t help the pain go away.”

, If your parent refuses to accept they have a problem and their physical or emotional health is deteriorating, it may be best to take a break from talking about their alcohol use. You may need to redirect your efforts to focus on their health. However, speak to their physician about your concerns, especially about their drinking habits."
"
Talk to other family members.,
Find outlets for stress.,
Join a support group.,
See a therapist.,
Remain calm.",How to Deal with Elderly Alcoholic Parents As an Adult2," If your parent’s drinking problem is affecting many people, talk to other family members about what you can do. While you cannot stop your parent from drinking, you can have rules for family gatherings. For example, agree as a family to not serve alcohol at family functions, or to limit alcohol intake. Have a standard response from all family members if your parent’s drinking gets out of hand. Find ways to unite altogether to be firm on what behaviors are inappropriate.


For example, say to your parent, “We know you enjoy drinking, but it’s not allowed around your grandchildren. We don’t want them exposed to alcohol.”
If you have siblings, have a discussion about how they can help you deal with the situation. That way, you will not be struggling to deal with your parent’s alcoholism alone. Decide on specific roles and responsibilities that each sibling can take on in engaging with the alcoholic parent.

, If dealing with your parent’s alcoholism causes you stress and leaves you exhausted, make sure you have some time to let go of that stress. Handling stress daily helps it from compounding and allows you to blow off steam. Relaxation is a great way to handle stress and can help with depression and to stabilize your moods.Start a meditation practice, attend yoga classes, or go for a daily walk.

, If you’re looking for support for yourself, join a support group. Surround yourself with people who are in similar situations as yourself. A support group is a great place to meet other people, share your frustrations, ask for advice, and give and receive support.Speak with others who have an alcoholic elderly parent and ask them how they cope.
For example, Al-Anon, Johnson Intervention, and SMART Recovery Family and Friends are some examples of support groups for family members and friends of an alcoholic.

, If you feel like you need personal support regarding your parent's alcoholism, consider seeing a therapist. A therapist can help you sort through your feelings and help you find ways to cope. If you feel overwhelmed and unable to deal with the stress of your problems, therapy can be a great way to find some clarity and relief.Ask for a referral from a medical doctor, local mental health clinic, or your insurance provider. You can also ask friends and family for a recommendation.

, Dealing with an alcoholic parent on a regular basis may lead to frustration, anger, and feeling overwhelmed. Do your best not to respond to your parent in anger. If you notice your temper flaring, take a deep breath before saying anything. Remind yourself that anger will not take away your problems and instead, will likely expand them.Take some distance if you need it. Go on a walk, go outside, or ask someone to take over for you. If you feel constantly upset, consider having a home nurse or other caretaker so that you can get some distance.

Accompany them to medical appointments.,
Work with a specialist to help your parent come up with a plan.,
Work with assisted living.,
Don’t dump alcohol bottles.,
Keep them from driving.,
Arrange an intervention, if necessary.",How to Deal with Elderly Alcoholic Parents As an Adult3," If your parent is likely to downplay their alcoholism to a medical professional, consider going with them to their medical appointments. Raise any concerns you have with their medical professional. If your parent minimizes their alcoholism or tries to talk around it, speak up and make sure your parent has adequate information about how alcohol may affect their health.Ask the medical doctor, “Are there any guidelines you would suggest for alcohol consumption? How might these medications interact with alcohol?”

, Quitting alcohol cold turkey can cause severe or even deadly withdrawal symptoms.Talk to your parent’s doctor or other medical professionals about creating a healthy and effective way to reduce or eliminate your parent’s alcohol consumption.

Your parent’s doctor may prescribe a medication to help your parent reduce their alcohol consumption, or they may refer your parent to an addiction specialist or mental health specialist.
A psychologist or other mental health specialist may be able to help address any underlying psychological issues that might be contributing to your parent’s drinking.

, If your parent is in assisted living or you are planning to look into assisted living, check their alcohol policies. Some may serve alcohol, others may ban it, some consider alcohol only under a physician’s guidance, still others only allow it in certain areas. Think about what may be the best option for your parent. Carefully consider the options before making a choice.If you’re about to admit a parent to assisted living, let staff and physicians know ahead of time of your parent’s alcoholism.

, While you may think you are helping your parent, it’s likely they will go buy more. This can lead to anger, resentment, bitterness, fights, or large disagreements, especially if your parent is under the influence when you do it. Your parent will only stop drinking when they are ready to get help and not before, despite your best efforts.Also keep in mind that abruptly cutting off your parent’s access to alcohol can lead to dangerous or deadly withdrawal symptoms.

, If you know your parent is likely to drink, find an alternative way for them to go home. Offer a ride, find a taxi, or plan to meet at their place. If you know your parent is resistant to get help, keep them safe in the meantime. If you know your parent is likely to drink, make arrangements ahead of time.If hosting a family get-together, host it at your house and do not serve alcohol.

, Offer to help your parent get the support and assistance they need to stop drinking. If they keep refusing to get help, arrange for an intervention.Consult an addiction specialist before arranging the intervention. They can offer you advice on the best way to proceed.
Once you’ve gotten some professional advice, get together with a few of your parent’s close friends and relatives to discuss a plan of action.
Plan out what everyone will say in advance. During the intervention, all the participants should be prepared to talk about how your parent’s alcoholism has affected them, and what the consequences will be if they do not seek help.

Continue to work hard.,
Ask again.,
Make the most of what you have.",How to Get a Good Allowance," Before you ask your parents for anything, spend a couple of weeks improving your standing. Begin helping out around the house a little more than usual. Begin doing those chores you would do for an allowance for free, to give your parents a sense of what your work is worth., If you want to show your parents that you are responsible and deserving of an allowance, a great way to do this is to try a little harder in school. For at least a few weeks prior to talking to your parents, do your very best on all homework assignments and exams. Show your parents your good grades and let them see you studying., Another way to prove your value and gain your parents’ respect is to take on some volunteer work. If you are in high school, you can find volunteer work at a local animal shelter or food bank. If you are still in middle school, you may be able to find afterschool volunteer programs through your school.An added benefit to volunteer work is that it will look great on college applications later.
Additionally, if your time is filled with unpaid volunteer work, your parents will be less likely to suggest that you get a part-time job.

, Finally, if you want your parents to respect you, and be willing to fork over some cash, you need to show that the respect is mutual. Do this by following the rules at home. This may mean sticking to your curfew, picking up after yourself, doing your homework right after school, or any other household rule that your parents have set for you., Before you sit down and talk to your parents, take some time to understand the benefits of an allowance in order to make your case. Fortunately, experts claim that when parents give kids a sum of money to manage regularly, it helps their financial skills as adults. This is a big benefit! Practice explaining these benefits to your folks., Participating in household chores also helps kids to feel more connected to the family. Practice outlining these benefits., Your parents are not going to want to throw their money away. Rather than using all of your allowance as pocket money, make a plan for what you would like to do with it. Presenting your parents with a plan for what you’d like to do with the money makes for a much more compelling argument. This will make them more likely to give you a fair rate.Maybe there is a larger purchase that you would like to save for.
Maybe there is an upcoming family vacation that you’d like to have extra money for.
Maybe there is a photography class you’d like to take.
When you have a plan for what you’d like to do with the money, your parents may be likely to give you more.

, Another very compelling argument is to offer to take 10% of your allowance each week (or month) and place it in a savings account. Saving $1 per week (if you earned $10, for example) may not seem like a lot. However, putting away 10% of what you earn is an excellent habit to get into that will serve you well in life., If you are not receiving an allowance, chances are that your parents buy a lot of things for you. In addition to room and board, they probably pay for your school supplies, personal hygiene products, and favorite snacks. You may be able to convince them that an allowance is a good idea if you offer to buy some of those things yourself. This can teach important lessons.For instance, you could offer to buy your own shampoo with your allowance.
This will help to teach you budgeting practices, as well as teach you the value of certain goods.
If your parents can see where your allowance is going, it can help them see the value in it.

, Before you begin talking to your parents about your allowance, take some time to prepare what you will say. Figure out your main talking points, and practice a little with a friend or in the mirror. Do some research. What are the average allowance amounts in your area and for your age group?
If you show that you’ve really thought about this and done a bit of homework, your parents will take your request more seriously.This information will help ensure that you get an adequate amount of money.

, You want to approach your parents when they are in a good mood. It is best not to interrupt them while they are doing something else, or bother them right when they get home from work. Choose a time when they seem to be free (such as a weekend), and when they appear to be in good spirits., Make sure to be direct and clear. Explain exactly what you are asking for, and why. Be as specific as you can, and include details. Give your parents time to consider your request.


Avoid making demands. Don't tell your parents that they ""have"" to give you an allowance.
Focus on using ""I"" statements. This keeps the focus on you and why you deserve this allowance.
You could say ""I have been doing my chores, and I feel like I could earn a good allowance."" This is much better than ""You need to give me a good allowance.""

, Listening is an important part of communication. Be an active listening with your parents. Give them a chance to think, and to ask questions. When they give you an answer to your questions, try to really listen to what they are saying, and don’t immediately get defensive. If they feel that they are being listened to, they will respect you more, and may be more likely to trust you with an allowance.

, If your parents decline your request for an allowance (or a raise), don't lose hope. If you continue to help out at home, work hard at school, and respect the rules of the house, you may be able to change their minds in time. Keep working to earn your parents' respect and prove that you deserve the allowance you seek.

, After some time has passed (at least one month), make a plan to ask your parents again. Remember to plan what you are going to say, choose a good time to approach them, and listen to what they have to say.

, No matter what happens, it is important to make the most of what you have. If you are getting any allowance at all, try to be grateful. You may also consider raking leaves, babysitting, or picking up a paper route to earn some extra cash.

Be responsible.,
Make sure you’re doing well in school.,
Tell the truth.",How to Get Your Parent's Permission1," Before you even seek out your parents’ permission for an activity, show them how responsible you are. You need to be doing this for a while, too, not just in the few days leading up to your asking. Your parents are more likely to say yes to you if they perceive you as responsible and trustworthy.Here are some ways you can indicate you are responsible:


Do all your chores without needing to be asked or reminded. Take on additional responsibilities around the house.
Help out with your younger siblings and pets. Entertain your siblings, help them with their homework, or take the dog for a walk. Showing your parents you can be responsible for others helps them see that you can be responsible for yourself.Be active in your community. Volunteer somewhere, or be involved in sports or school activities. This shows responsibility by keeping your commitments or working toward a goal.
Be conscientious. Let your parents see how you take the initiative to take care of others: Rake your elderly neighbor’s leaves, call your grandma every week, or visit a sick friend in the hospital.;
, Stay up to date on your homework and class projects, and make sure your grades are good. Not only does how you’re doing in school reflect your trustworthiness, but it also gives your parents a great reason to say no. If you have bad grades, they might use that as a reason why you can’t do the activity!


Keep track of your assignments and show your parents what you have to work on.
Bring home graded papers and exams and show your parents how you did.
Take the initiative to get extra help from your teachers if you need it. Stay after school or get help during lunch. Your parents will be impressed with your willingness to work hard.

, Have a track record of honesty before you ever ask permission for an activity. Your parents need to know that they can count on you to be honest about who you will be with and where you are going.Make sure you come clean when you are caught. Apologize and be honest about your screw-ups. Your parents might be angry, but this will help them see that you want to do better and learn from the experience.
Acknowledge that you have hurt their feelings if you have been caught in a lie.
Expect it to take a while for your parents to regain their trust in you. If you were caught lying, understand that you have broken a bond with your parents. That can’t be repaired overnight. It will take you consistently demonstrating you are honest and trustworthy (perhaps by taking some of the actions above) in order to build that trust level back up."

Practice the sport around your house.,
Watch the sport.,
Read about the sport.,
Know all possible objections.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Try a Sport1," If you have the equipment you need to practice, practice the sport on your own. This works best if you have a backyard or space to move around. Doing the sport on your own will show your parents how dedicated you are to learn.For instance, if you are interested in gymnastics, try doing stretches or even routines in the backyard.
If you have no idea how to play the sport, watch videos meant for beginners. Don’t do anything that is beyond your comfort level.;
, Watch the sport on TV at your house. This not only shows how interested you are, it can also familiarize your parents with the sport. Your parents may object to the sport because they don’t know much about it and aren’t comfortable with it. Watching the sport can make your parents more comfortable with the idea of you participating in the sport.You should let your parents see you watching the sport, but don’t interrupt their television time by changing the channel to the sport. This will seem aggressive and won’t have the effect that you want.

, Read books or magazines about the sport you want to play. It will make you more knowledgeable about the sport when the time comes to talk to your parents about letting you play it. It also shows them that you are engaged with the sport, and that it isn’t something you are interested in just because everyone else is playing it., There are several reasons why parents could be against their child playing a sport. Make sure to be informed of all these arguments before talking to your parents. Also think of some counterarguments that could sway your parents’ decision.For instance, many parents don’t want their children to play football because of the risk of concussion or brain injury. Do some research and find out what measures can be taken to make playing football safe.
Doing this research beforehand will help you make better arguments for why you should be allowed to play the sport.

Ask your parents at the right time.,
Stay rational and calm.,
Explain why you think you’re ready.,

Be grateful.,
Use subtle persuasion.,
Suggest a test run.,
Give them time to think.,
Be willing to compromise.,
Accept the decision calmly.,
Wait before asking again.",How to Convince Your Parents You're Responsible Enough to Stay at Home Alone," One of the best ways to show your parents that you’re responsible is to do as well as possible in school. That means studying for tests, getting all of your homework done, and turning in reports and projects on time. If they know that you take your school work seriously without them having to push you, they can start to see that you’re ready for extra responsibilities, such as staying home alone.If you’re having trouble with a certain subject in school, show you're responsible by asking for help. See if your teacher can meet with you after school, or ask about how you might get a tutor. You can also ask your parents or siblings for help if it’s a subject that they know something about.
If you get a poor grade on a test or report, be honest with your parents about it. Try to explain why you didn’t do as well on it as you hoped. If you don’t try to hide a bad grade from them, your parents will know that they can trust you.;
, Doing household tasks without having to be reminded is another way to show your parents how responsible you are. They will definitely notice if you make your bed or take out the garbage without them having to nag you. If you have trouble remembering your chores, make a chart of all the things you have to do and when you have to do them, so you can hang it in your room as a reminder.If your parents ask you and your siblings to do a certain task, such as help bring the groceries in from the car, you can score points by volunteering.
You can also make a big impression by doings chores that you haven’t been asked to do. For example, if you notice that the yard is covered with leaves, rake the lawn so your parents don’t have to do it.
When you're parents are busy with housework or other tasks, you might offer to watch your younger sibling(s) or help them with their homework to remind them how responsible you are.
If you have family pets, it's a good idea to help care for them too. Take the dog for a walk when he needs to go, refill the cat's water dish when it's empty, or clean the bird's cage when you notice that it's dirty.

, Your parents will see you as responsible if they know that you follow the rules that they’ve set. Make sure to follow all of them without complaining too much. For example, If your parents tell you that you’re only allowed a certain amount of time on the internet each day, don’t try to sneak extra time or whine about how your friends can go online whenever they want. Be respectful of the rules, so your parents know that you respect them.If there are certain rules that you need to bend on occasion, talk to your parents about them. For example, if you’re supposed to go to bed at a certain time but the movie or sporting event that you wanted to watch won’t be over yet, ask your parents if they can make an exception that one night.

, Whenever you’re asking your parents for something, timing is everything. If you ask when they’re in a bad mood or feeling stressed, they’re more likely to say no. That’s why you choose a time when they’re relaxed and happy, so they’re more inclined to say yes.Try to identify times when your parents are usually in a good mood, such as after eating their favorite meal or waking up after a good night’s sleep. Those are the ideal times to ask about saying home by yourself.
Pay attention to times when your parents are usually cranky too. For example, they may be in a bad mood after a long day at work or their favorite team has a lost a game. Avoid asking them about staying home alone at those times.

, If you get too emotional when you're talking to your parents, they're probably not going to take you too seriously. That means no yelling, whining, or crying when you ask about staying home alone. You also should avoid complaining that all of your friends are allowed to do it. Your parents usually aren't going to see that as a very good reason to give permission.If you feel yourself getting frustrated and losing your cool while you're talking to your parents, try counting to 10 in your head. That can help give you time to get yourself under control so you don't do something that you regret., To convince your parents that you’re responsible enough to stay home alone, it’s important to explain why you think you’re ready. Point all the ways that you’ve shown how responsible you are, such as good grades on your report card and how they haven’t had to remind you to wash the dishes after dinner. You should also reassure them that you know what to do in case of an emergency, so make sure you know how to find all the contact numbers you may need.When you’re explaining to your parents, keep things simple. You might say, “I think I’m ready to stay home alone because I’m responsible enough to get all A’s and B’s on my report and remember to walk the dog every afternoon. I also know to call 911 if there’s an emergency or Mrs. Smith next door if I have non-emergency problem. You can trust me.”
Your parents may be concerned that you’ll be afraid to be home alone. Reassure them that you aren’t scared. For example, you might say, “I’m totally comfortable being home alone,” or “It doesn’t worry me to be home by myself at all.”
Make sure that you know how to work your home’s security system and that you know where certain safety equipment, such a fire extinguisher, is located.

, Your parents may be more likely to allow you to stay home alone if you explain how it will help you become more mature and responsible. Explain that it will enable you to become more independent so you're better able to take care of yourself and help out around the house.You might say something like, ""It will help me become more mature because I'll understand how important it is to be cautious around the house with things like locking the door and other safety measures.""

, When you’re asking your parents for permission to stay home alone, it’s a good idea to show gratitude to them. That way, they won’t think that you just expect to get your way whenever you ask for something. Acknowledge all the times that your parents have show trust in you or allowed you to do something that you asked for, so they know you appreciate their faith in you.Be as specific as possible when you’re showing your gratitude. For example, you might say, “I really appreciate that you let me stay up late to watch the playoff game last week,” or “It really meant a lot that you trusted me enough to go to Carly’s house on a school night.”

, In some cases, you may need to explain how allowing you to stay home alone will benefit your parents directly. For example, you might point out that they won't have to spend as much money on babysitters if you can stay by yourself. You can suggest that they can have more date nights or evenings out with friends too.Don't lay it on too thick when you're trying to use this type of persuasion. If you make it seem like you're the one doing them a favor, they're probably going to be skeptical.

, If you sense that your parents are on the fence about letting you stay home alone, it might be a good idea to do a practice run before they fully commit one way or another. See if they’re willing to let you stay home alone for a brief period of time instead of an entire day or night to see how you do when you’re on your own to help reassure them.Keep the test run short. You might suggest that the next time your parents need to run to the grocery store for milk, they let you stay home. Even if you’re only alone for 15 or 20 minutes, it may help convince your parents that you can handle the responsibility.
In some cases, your parents may need multiple test runs before they’re comfortable leaving you home alone for an entire evening. You should be willing to do it as many times as it takes to convince them that you’re responsible enough to stay alone for longer periods.

, If you put your parents on the spot and demand an answer as soon as you ask, they’re much more likely to say no. Instead, tell them that you want them to think about the situation for a while before making a decision. While they’re thinking, be patient and don’t keep bugging them about it.To help you stay patient, it’s a good idea to set a specific time that you’ll discuss the topic again. For example, you might say, “Why don’t you think about it for a while? We can talk again on Friday afternoon.”

, When your parents are deciding whether to let you stay home alone, you have to be willing to meet them in the middle. They might only be comfortable leaving you home alone in certain situations, and you should respect their feelings and agree. Even if you’re only allowed to stay home alone once in awhile, it’s an opportunity to prove that you can be trusted on your own all the time.Your parents may be some conditions on when you can stay home alone, such as only when they’re going to be gone for a couple of hours or less, or when neighbors that they trust are going to be home next door while they’re gone. The conditions may seem annoying, but it still gives you a chance to build trust.
Your parents may also want to establish ground rules for when you’re home alone. For example, they may not want you to have friends over or use the stove when they’re gone. Make sure that you go over all of the rules so you understand what’s expected of you.

, If your parents decide that you’re not ready to stay home alone, you should react to their decision maturely. Yelling or whining will only convince them that they were right in saying no. Instead, accept the decision in a calm, controlled manner so they can see how mature you are.It’s okay to let your parents know that you’re upset with the decision, but be respectful. For example, you might say, “I’m very disappointed, but I understand your decision.”
You may also want to ask if you can revisit the subject again in the future. That way, your parents will know that you’re very serious about the idea of staying home alone and you’ll have hope for the future.

, If your parents won’t let you stay home alone after your discussion, you’ll probably want to ask about it again as soon as possible. But it’s a bad idea to push the issue so soon after they’ve said no. Instead, give them some time to think about the idea further. Try to wait at least a month or two before asking again, so your parents have even more time to see how mature and responsible you are.When you’re waiting to ask your parents about staying home alone again, be on your best behavior. Maintain good grades in school, do all of your chores, and follow all of your parents’ rules. The more they see you behaving in a responsible way, the more likely they’ll be to say yes the next time.

Set a time to talk.,
Be specific.,
Be patient and polite.,
Answer their questions.",How to Get Your Parent's Permission2," Tell your parents that you have something you want to discuss with them. Ask when would be a good time to sit down and talk.It’s a good idea to set aside some time so that your parents will be focused on talking to you. If you try to ask them about something as everyone is getting ready to leave in the morning, for example, you might find them flustered and distracted.
Calling a meeting also indicates to your parents that you take their permission seriously and that you understand it is important for them to be involved in your life. You want to show them you are mature enough to accept their input.
For example, you could mention you want to talk when they get home from work. “Do you think we could talk for a few minutes after dinner tonight? I want to ask your permission for something.” If they ask what for, you could be more specific: “I want to ask your permission to go to a party.” But tell them you’d rather give them all the information at once, when they are focused and ready to hear it.

, Give them a specific event you want to go to or activity you want to do.They will be more likely to say yes if you can give them details about one particular activity.


For example, you could say “Brian has an extra ticket to the baseball game on Friday night. Can I go with him?” Your parents will be more likely to approve this request than “Can I start going to games with my friends?”

, Your parents are going to have a lot of questions. It might be annoying, but getting irritated with them is not going to help your cause. Remember, you are trying to get them to agree to something!


Answer all their questions, even if they ask them several times. Don’t say, “I already told you!” Just repeat your answer politely.
Don’t get confrontational or defensive. A bad attitude is going to sour your chances to get what you want.For example, you might want to say, “I feel like you don’t trust me when you say I’m not allowed to stay out until ten o’clock,” instead of “You never let me stay out later! All my friends can stay out until 10:30!”

, Come prepared to your conversation with all the relevant information. Be prepared to answer the following questions:Who? Let your parents know who will be at this event and if there will be parents present. Give them contact information.
What? Tell them what specific event you are interested in attending, or what specific activity you want to do. Say “I want to go get coffee and see a movie with Brandon,” not “I want to go out with a friend.”
Where? Give the location of the event or activity, including a specific house address if needed.
When? Let them know the date and time of the event, and how long you’d expect to be gone.
How (much)? Be prepared to answer how you will get to the activity, and how much it will cost.
Why? This question might not come up. You should answer it anyway. And it might be more annoying to answer, but it will showcase your maturity if you answer it thoughtfully, not reluctantly. For example, you could say, “The reason why I really want to go the party on Saturday is because most of my friends are going to be there. We don’t get to hang out outside of school much because everyone is always busy with sports or jobs after school.”

"
"
Anticipate your parents’ concerns and find solutions.,
Give them time to think about it.,
Let them talk to other adults involved.",How to Get Your Parent's Permission3," Be proactive and problem-solve ahead of time. This helps show your parents that you are responsible and understand their concerns.You might know your parents are always concerned about you being home by your curfew. Let them know you’ve thought ahead to how you will ensure that won’t be a problem. For example, “If you’re worried about my ride being unreliable, I will use the Uber app on my phone to make sure I get home on time.”
If you have a friend they don’t like who is going to be at the event, you could say, “I know you don’t like me hanging out with Kyle. He’ll be at the party, but I won’t go anywhere with him.”

, Even though it might not seem like a big deal to you, it might be a big deal to your parents. Don’t expect an answer right away. After you have your discussion, give them a day to think about it before you bring it up again.


The next day, you could say, “Have you guys had a chance to think about letting me go to Peyton’s party on Saturday?”

, Just like you may talk to your friends before you make a decision, your parents might want to learn more about what you want to do from your friends’ parents or your teachers (if it is a school activity). Be patient with them, and help them connect with the other adults if you can.


Get them your friends’ parents’ phone numbers and/or email addresses if you haven’t already.
Let them know how they can contact your teacher or coach, if this is a school-related event.

"
"
Agree to their conditions.,
Follow through.,
Ask questions.,
Accept their decision.",How to Get Your Parent's Permission4," Maybe your parents are willing to say yes to you, so long as you are willing to compromise. Remember that they have the upper hand in this situation, so it’s probably best to not argue and agree to what they want. For example:


They may want to meet your friend and/or your friend’s parents.
They may want to drive you somewhere and pick you up, instead of you getting a ride from a friend.
They may want you home at a certain time.

, If your parents gave you permission, you need to hold up your end of the bargain. Do everything you said you would do. You are building up your level of trust with them, and they will be more likely to say yes to you again!


For example, if you said you would be home at ten and your friend Jamila was driving, get home at ten in Jamila’s car. It’s okay to be a few minutes late, but more than fifteen minutes might look like you are trying to take advantage of them.

, If they decided to say no, ask them why. Do it when you are calm (so probably not right after they tell you no, since you will likely be upset). Try to keep your emotions in check and not get angry with them.


You could say, “I’m trying to understand why I can’t go out with Jackson on Friday night. Why did you decide to say no?”
Ask what you could do in the future to get them to say yes.
See if there is an alternative they would agree to. For example, “Would it be okay if Jackson comes over here?”

, It is extremely disappointing when you are not allowed to do something. However, sneaking behind your parents’ back, as tempting as it is, is not the answer. Getting caught means breaking their trust and not being allowed to do something else in the future.


Think of other things you can do instead. Find other friends to do another approved activity.
Get some perspective. It seems like a huge deal now, but this is probably not something that will matter much down the road. Think back to a time when you were younger that was disappointing (like not getting invited to a birthday party, or not making the soccer team). How much does that matter to you now as you’re older?Remember that accepting their decision means that your parents will think you are trustworthy, which means that you will have a better chance of them saying yes next time.

Find the best way to play the sport.,
Figure out how much money it will cost.,
Make sure the sport fits around your daily activities.,
Figure out how to maintain your grades.,
Draw up a plan.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Try a Sport2," Before talking to your parents, make a plan of how best to play the sport. Whether it be a school team, or lessons at a local gym, find the best location to play the sport. You will want to have all this information ready when you talk to your parents.A good place to start is your school, which will have sport teams for a wide variety of sports.
If your school doesn’t offer the particular sport, do an Internet search to find out if there are lessons or leagues in your area.

, Money can be a big objection to you playing a sport. Some sports require a lot of expensive equipment, and your parents may not think that it is worth the cost. Find out how much it would cost you to play the sport, both in terms of participating and in terms of what equipment you will need.Try to find a way to minimize how much money it will cost you. For instance, playing a sport through your school is usually a fairly inexpensive way to try out the sport, because you don’t have to pay for lessons.
If you have to buy equipment, look on sites like Ebay and Craigslist to see if you can buy something used. You can also ask friends who play the sport for hand-me-downs or advice.

, This is fairly easy for school sports, because they always go on before or after school. However, if you are interested in doing a sport outside of school, make sure that it doesn’t conflict with your schooling or your extra-curricular activities.Finding a way to play the sport on the weekends if a good way to make sure it doesn’t conflict with anything else.

, This new sport may end up taking a lot of your time. Draw up a schedule for yourself about when you will be able to study and do homework. This could make your parents worry less about letting you try a sport.

, Now that you have all the information, draw up a plan for how you will play the sport. Gather any physical information you can, like pamphlets or schedules. You want to have all this information ready when you talk to your parents. "
"
Set up the conversation.,
Tell your parents why you want to play the sport.,
Explain the positives.,
Show your parents the plan.,
Ask for their input.,
Stay calm.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Try a Sport3," Tell your parents that you want to talk to them about playing the sport. Ask them if it’s a good time to talk, or if you should set up a time to talk later. This is a mature approach, and it will show your parents that playing the sport isn’t just a whim.Say something like, ""I wanted to talk to you both about joining the soccer team. Is this a good time to talk about it?""

, When it comes time for the conversation, talk to your parents about why you want to play the sport. Make sure to express that you’re interested in the sport itself, and let them know that it’s an interest you have been developing.


For example, you could say something like, ""I've been getting really interested in cheerleading recently, and I think joining the squad would be a great way to get exercise and learn something new.""
Don’t say things like, “Well, all my friends are going to be on the team.” You want your parents to know that the sport is not just a social or status thing for you.

, Talk to your parents about why playing the sport will benefit you. You can use personal arguments that relate to you in particular, or you could explain the benefits of team sports in building leadership skills and good physical health.You can also explain why the sport would benefit your parents. For instance, if you are always bouncing off the walls, explain how participating in a sport could allow you to use your energy in a positive way and make you calmer at home.

, Tell your parents the best way you can participate in the sport, and give them any fliers or papers that you’ve picked up. Your parents will be impressed by the lengths you went to pursue the sport, and it will make giving their permission much easier if you already have everything planned out.Tell them something like, ""These are the schedules for the gym I would go to. I would take my lessons every Monday, Wednesday and Friday after school.""

, Your conversation with your parents shouldn’t be a monologue. After you have told them your reasons for wanting to play and your plans, listen to what they have to say. They may still be against the idea. If they are, try to counter their arguments.Ask them something like, ""I know that you had some questions about the sport. I was wondering how you feel about me joining the team now that I've told you more about it.""
If, for example, your parents are worried that sports could interfere with your schoolwork, show them the study schedule you drew up for yourself.
If they are worried that the sport is too dangerous, use your research to show them that the sport may not be as dangerous as they think. Try to point to specific methods that your school or gym takes to reduce the risk of injury.
If they are concerned about money, tell them how you can cut the cost of playing the sport.

, Throughout this negotiation, stay calm and respectful. You want to show your parents that you are trying to make a mature decision. Acting rude or angry will only justify their belief that you shouldn’t play the sport. Even if by the end of the discussion they still won’t give you permission, be respectful."

Don’t shut out your parents.,
Keep showing interest.,
Focus on your schoolwork.,
Participate as a fan.,
Bring the subject back up.,
Compromise with your parents.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Try a Sport4," If your parents still won’t let you play the sport, don’t act out. If you act out or shut out your parents, they will never want to revisit the idea of letting you play the sport. It may be infuriating, but try not to be to act angry or resentful., If your parents still refuse to let you play by the end of your conversation, don’t give up. You don’t want to pester them about it, but you do want to make sure that they know that you are still interested. Keep practicing the sport in your spare time. Also keep watching or reading about the sport.

, If your parents are worried that you won’t be able to handle school and sports, put some extra effort into your schoolwork. When they see you succeed, they may feel differently about a sport being too much to handle. This might help them to change their mind., If it doesn’t make you too sad, try going to games or matches. It could help you to feel involved in the sport, even if you aren’t playing. Studies show that belonging to a sports community, even as a fan, gives you a sense of belonging and makes you happier.It also shows your parents your determination to be a part of the sport and the community.

, Don’t do this until at least a few weeks, if not months, after your first discussion. Calmly tell your parents that you want to talk again about playing the sport. By this time, your parents should see you dedication and your determination. Your parents may have been looking for a sign that you are really serious about the sport. The fact that you are still clearly interested and want to revisit the subject may have changed their mind.

, If your parents flat-out refuse and do not seem like they will change their minds, try to compromise. Depending on their objections to the sport, try to find a solution that will satisfy everyone. It may not be exactly what you want, but it can be better than nothing.


For instance, if your parents don’t want you playing tackle football, suggest that you could play flag football to reduce the risk of injury.
If they are worried about the sport interfering with schoolwork, suggest that you could play the sport a couple times a week as opposed to every day.
If they are worried about cost, find a league you can join and play for free as opposed to taking lessons.

Make note of any examples or moments that really stuck with you. Then, write down your responses to, “How do you think a psychologist will be able to help you?”


Once you know that you have issues to address, you need to find a way to communicate this to other people in a controlled way. A list will help you do that.
Under the ""concerns"" area you might write, ""I feel depressed all the time,"" or, ""I am angry and lose my temper for no reason."" Under the ""How can a psychologist help?"" area you might write, ""They can show me the positives in life, like how I have a loving family,"" or, ""They can give me some ideas about how to calm down."";
, Go to a trusted friend or relative, tell them what is going on, and ask them to help you prepare. This person can pretend to be your parents as you go through a ‘mock’ conversation. Then, you can flip and you can take on the role of your parents to better understand their perspective.Don’t forget to include questions, as your parents will surely have some. They could ask, “What have we done wrong?” Or, “Why are you just telling us now?” Practicing answering will help you handle these difficult moments easier when they really happen.

, Your school counselor is trained to help students with a range of different problems. Make an appointment to speak with your school counselor and tell them what is going on.


Your school counselor can provide you with a referral or help seeking outside treatment from a psychologist.
Talking with your school counselor and getting their recommendation to see a counselor can also help make it easier to convince your parents.

, Ask your school counselor for pamphlets or information about your concerns. Print out information from online. Have something tangible to give your parents when you meet. This will show that you have prepared for the conversation and that this has been on your mind for some time.You will want to hand these papers to your parents in the middle of the conversation, not at the start or end. You should tell your story first and just use this information as back-up research.

, Look online, search the phone book, or ask your school counselor for references beforehand. Narrow it down to the three names that sound the best and write these down on a list to show your parents.Be aware that many therapists will meet with your parents for an initial time, free of charge. This gives your parents a chance to ask any questions that they might have.
Don’t get completely set on your first choice. It is very common to switch therapists multiple times. Like any relationship, you have to take a bit of time to find the right fit., Once you have a list of potential therapists, give them a call. Ask them about what insurances they accept and whether or not they arrange payment plans. Take good notes that you can pass along to your parents as well. Money is often a real barrier to seeking help, so doing some research can help to avoid this roadblock.This research can all be done over the phone and anonymously, so don’t worry about your parents finding out at this point.
If needed, you can also tell your parents that you are willing to get a job in order to pay, or supplement, the cost of a therapist. You can consider this an investment in your happiness and future.
You might even ask your parents for your insurance card ahead of time so that you can verify whether or not a therapist will accept your insurance.
Ask the therapists that you call about whether or not they have a sliding scale fee. This is often offered to clients who cannot afford to pay the full amount.
Check with local colleges to find out if they offer any free counseling sessions to community members. They may have graduate students who need to provide counseling sessions to meet the requirements of their degree program.

, Choose your time to sit down with your parents carefully. Allow for their schedules so that when you do talk, their attention will be solely focused on you. If you have siblings, bedtime or after dinner are possible windows for a chat.You might approach your parents earlier in the day and say, “I have something really important that I need to talk to you about. Can we talk after dinner?”

, After they’ve sat down, describe your thoughts and feelings leading up to your request. If you’ve been depressed, for example, try to give them an estimate of how long. This information may be shocking to them, so you want to build up the best case that you can. After you’ve discussed how you feel, tell them you have a potential solution-to visit and talk with a psychologist.Your parents will most likely ask how a psychologist could help you. You might tell them that, “I need to speak with an objective adult.” Or, “I need to talk with someone outside the family in order to better understand myself.”
Reassure them that this is about you, not them.

, If your parents feel as if you are being somehow pressured into visiting a therapist, they will go into protective mode and most likely refuse. Explain that you not only need help, you want help. You want to improve your life by taking this action.


If questioned about your goals, you could say, “I want to feel happy more often. I want to be able to appreciate all the great opportunities you all have given me.”

, Take some deep, calming breaths before starting and repeat to yourself, “I can do this, it will be okay.” Your parents will appreciate your case more if you act maturely, but at the same time do not be afraid to let your emotions show. If they disagree, speak from your heart. Don’t be afraid to cry. If, instead of starting as planned, you run into your parents and loose emotional control by crying, etc., you may want to take five minutes to compose yourself before continuing. Just say, “Give me a few minutes and we can talk.”
Do your best to avoid aggressive arguing. Disagreements may happen, but yelling or shouting really does no good in the end. If you feel as if you are headed in that direction, pause and count to five before speaking again. If your parents are yelling, tell them that you will need to talk later when everyone calms down.

, It may not be enough to tell your parents that you suffer from anxiety, for example. You may need to give them some real life examples to draw upon. This will most likely be difficult for you. Choose examples that illustrate your concerns but that are perhaps not the most raw.An example of an example might be, “I have no friends at school right now. I just don’t feel like I can trust anyone.”

, Getting what you want will probably require some give-and-take. Be prepared to negotiate a bit. You might offer to have your parents work with you to choose the therapist. You might ask that they go with you, but stay in the waiting room. You might agree to “try out” a therapist for a month.


Part of the compromise might be telling them how else they can help. You might suggest planning additional activities together or helping you with your homework., If you are uncomfortable in a face-to-face situation with your parents (a lot of people can be), then write down your feelings and reasons for seeking help simply and in an easy-to-read manner. Just like a chat, choose your moment carefully before presenting your feelings to your parents.


Remember that words (especially written ones) can hurt, so take your time when creating this letter. A good test is to ask yourself, “Will I agree with the contents of this letter five years from now?”

, If you don’t get anywhere, ask another trust adult to come in and talk with your parents. This means that you will need to reveal your private feelings and thoughts to yet another person, but it should be worth it in the end. This “mediator” can be a pastor, family friend, or another relative.


A school counselor is a particularly good choice. They can maintain confidentiality while also explaining to your parents what a therapist actually does. Plus, they most likely can back-up the examples that you have described before., Whether or not your parents agree after the first time, make sure to keep talking with them. Discuss your usual little things like what your day looks like, but also try to work in more important mentions of how you feel, etc. Part of getting them to understand is building trust and you need to talk to do that.


It may be helpful to ask your parents about their feelings too, and not just as it relates to you. Maybe say, “Do you enjoy your job? Why?”

, When your parents do agree, put your research into action and schedule an appointment with your chosen therapist as soon as possible. Expect your initial appointment to last between 45 minutes to 1 hour. They will ask you lots of questions, but also give you plenty of time to just talk.Keep in mind that your parents may be required to meet with the psychologist alone first so that they can provide their consent for the psychologist to treat you. During this meeting, your parents may ask questions to determine if the psychologist will be a good fit for you.

, Keep up your part of the bargain by trying to stay in the best mental and physical shape possible. You want to start your work with the therapist with the strongest foundation possible. You also want to show your parents that you are willing to put work into improving in other areas too.


Make sure to eat three regularly scheduled and healthy meals a day. Try to exercise three times a week, even if this just means taking long walks. Get enough sleep at night, aim for at least eight hours.

, If you are suicidal or if you are in serious need of help, then you might consider calling emergency services or going to the emergency room. You can go to the ER yourself or ask a friend to take you. This will ensure that you get medical treatment and psychological evaluation, which may help to convince your parents to allow you to start seeing a psychologist to get the help you need.


If you don’t feel that you need immediate help, try talking with a teacher, school counselor, or friend about your feelings. Just keep in mind that if you do tell a teacher or school counselor that you are thinking of hurting yourself, then they will need to report this for your protection.
In the US, you can also call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1 (800) 273-TALK (8255)."

Be clear about why gymnastics is so important.,
Ask politely.,
Listen closely.,

Explain to your mom the benefits of gymnastics.,
Show your mom you're ready for the challenge.,
Help to save money so your mom is less likely to say ""no."",
Talk openly about any safety concerns.,
Do activities that are similar to gymnastics.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Join Gymnastics," You may have seen on TV a recent gymnastics competition, or talked with a friend who recommends that you join gymnastics. Before you immediately react, and go ask your mom to join, think about what other activities and school work you have already. Can you fit gymnastics into your schedule, even if might take away from other things?


Take a couple hours or more to think about whether this is really what you want, before going to ask your mom.
Consider the pros and cons of starting gymnastics.;
, Before you actually go talk with her, think about how she has reacted in the past to your requests, and what has been going on recently when you ask her for things. Has she said ""no"" more? What were the reasons she said ""no"" in the past?


Consider possible scenarios of how your mom may react. For example, if your mom has been saying recently that she cannot afford extra things for the family right now, the issue of money may come up. If your mom needs time to think things over when you ask for something, be respectful of her wishes, and give her some time.

, If you were busy doing schoolwork, or trying to work hard on something, you might not want to talk and make a big decision in that moment. Your parents are the same way. If your mom is stressed, pick a time when your mom is relaxed, and appears to have time to talk.


If your mom is less stressed, she is more likely to listen to your reasons for wanting to join gymnastics.

, There are lots of activities that you could do, or interests to pursue. Before you try to convince your mom, you have to be confident that this is more important than swimming, art classes, music lessons, or something else. Once you commit to doing something, it will take time and money, so be honest with yourself.

, Put yourself in your mom's shoes. Imagine if you were the parent. If your child came up to you and yelled, ""I WANT TO JOIN GYMNASTICS!"" and then had a tantrum if you said no, you'd be annoyed too. So ask nicely. Be polite and positive when asking for something.


By being happy and positive, rather than stubborn, you will come across much more convincing.
Talking about gymnastics (if it's something you genuinely care about) should come from the heart, and you should show that in the way you talk. , You may get an answer you don't want to hear, such as ""No,"" ""I'll think about it,"" ""We'll look into it later,"" or ""Wait until next year."" Instead of getting immediately frustrated, try to understand why your mom said that.


Really listen to your mom's concerns. Is she concerned about paying for the lessons? Is she just not wanting to think about it right now? Is she concerned about if it's safe?
By listening to her current point of view, you'll know better how to proceed. If it's just the wrong time, ask in a few days at the right time.
If talking at a different time doesn't help, listen to the specific arguments, and how to show your mom it is a win-win, or at least a better sport to join than she may have thought. , Go through the different arguments about why your mom is hesitant to have you join gymnastics. Depending on the reasons your mom says ""no,"" you may need to identify ways to prove your argument why gymnastics is valuable, safe, practical, and helpful for your future.


You may need to ""sell"" them on all the positives for both you and your mom. Be positive and enthusiastic.
Think about what you may be willing to give up in order to have gymnastics. Consider negotiations to be a ""give and take."" Are you willing to do another after-school activity less? Are you willing to spend less time with certain friends? Are you willing to use some of your own money to help pay for classes?

, By providing your mom with the many long-term benefits of being in sports, you can help her to understand the value of joining gymnastics. Here are some many benefits that you can discuss with her:


Physical fitness. Gymnastics will help to keep you physically fit, and mentally focused.
Improved coordination and balance. These skills are also easily translated to many other sports.
Improved confidence. When you work hard and show improvement, your confidence in yourself and in doing other things will likely go up.
Team building. In gymnastics, often coaches and gymnasts work together, and learn from each other. You will be better able to work with others through your commitment to the sport.

, Gymnastics can be tough, like any sport. Talk to your mom about some of the negative things, such as injuries, rips, and time. Let your mom know you're ready committed to taking gymnastics.


Let your parents know you're ready to juggle school, gymnastics, activities, family, and friends, and still have time . If your mom knows that, then she'll trust you more and understand that you're ready for it.

, If the reason your mom won't let you join gymnastics is because they don't have enough money right now, find ways to make gymnastics more affordable.


Money is likely the biggest hurdle. Be realistic that sometimes the issue of money is something your parents cannot control. You may find more affordable gymnastic classes if you shop around and find out what is available in your city. Consider classes through a local YMCA.
See if there are ways that you can contribute to the costs, such as giving up some of your allowance, or not doing another activity that may be costing money.
Ask your gym if there are ways that you can supplement your tuition fees. Some gyms will allow students or parents to clean, organize, or help out in another way to make tuition more affordable.

, Your mom may be concerned because studies show that gymnastics injuries are as common as those in soccer, basketball, and hockey. Collect the information and provide her with ideas about how to stay safe and put her at ease.


All sports can have some risk of injury, but many facilities and trainers will have clear safety guidelines. Consider having your mom talk with the gymnastics center about any concerns.

, Gymnastics requires flexibility and coordination of the body. Consider other types of sports and activities that you can do at home, or a class that your mom may approve of.


Look into other sports and activities like dancing, ballet, track and field, yoga, and cheerleading.
See if your school may have any afterschool programs that are similar to gymnastics.

Ask yourself why you want to move.,
Plant the seed of moving.,

Use the right “moment” for discussion.,
Give your parents time to consider.,
Respect the decision.,
Get support.,
Move away temporarily.,
Switch schools.,
Find alternative activities.,
Participate in a new community.",How to Convince Your Parents to Move," Before you approach your parents with your wish to move, think about what your motivation is. Not only can this help you flesh out your feelings, but also help you more convincingly make your case to your parents.


Write down your reasons for wanting to move. For example, you can have things like “better educational opportunities for me and job chances for dad,” or it could be something like “the house is too big for mom to care for.”
Consider keeping a list of pros and cons for moving. Think about factors such as expenses, losing friends, gaining new opportunities or helping shoulder burdens.;
, Try and not spring on your parents immediately that you want to move.Take time to plant the seed at the right moments once you’ve had a chance to write out your own motivations.Avoid being pushy. At times that are not rushed, mention that moving might make life a little better or easier.For example, you could say “mom, maybe we both wouldn't be so frantic to leave every morning if we didn't live so far from school"" or “dad, maybe you’d have more energy if you didn’t have such a large space to care for.”
Point out potential new places when you’re out. For example, say to your mom and dad when you’re headed to the grocery store, “wow, look at everything in this neighborhood: schools, stores, restaurants, and it’s so much closer to your jobs.”You can also say “wow, this assisted living facility has so many amenities and is really close to our house.”, Once you’ve planted the seed that you want to move, your parents will likely start to get the message. Researching potential options before your parents start asking questions about your motivation and where you want to move can help you make a more convincing case.Go online for places you might like to live or move. Use these as a part of the hints you subtly drop hints.
Keep in mind elements such as finances when you’re searching. You may not be aware of your parents’ financial situation and how your suggestions affect them emotionally and possibly financially. Research new places to live at a variety of price points.Keep notes on different places so that you can convincingly present them. For example, if you want to move to a different city, you could include things like the standard cost of housing and living, the overall health profile of the place, and the advantages it presents to you over the current place you live., The next time a parent shows stress about the house, suggest moving. Let this stimulate an open discussion about your desire to move and the practicability of it.Have the discussion when you’re less likely to be interrupted.Start the conversation with your observations and concerns about staying and the reasons you would like your parents to consider moving.Let them know you are serious, but try and keep the conversation as honest and positive as possible.For example, you can say “I’m really interested in pursuing my interest in science and the school in New York has much better opportunities for me to do this,” or “I’m being bullied at school and feel like an outcast.”Likewise, you can say “mom, I think it’s a good idea to move so that you have a built-in community and help whenever you might need it.”Suggest that your parents talk to your friends, colleagues, or teachers about your wishes.This may help them better understand that your position is serious.

, After you’ve had the discussion with your parents about moving, wait and let them think about moving.Remember that moving doesn’t happen overnight and may require that your parents take time to consider the pros and cons for them and your entire family.Put yourself in your parents’ shoes and be sensitive.As they consider your wishes, keep in mind how it affects your parents. Although moving might be great for you, it can put financial and emotional stress on your parents.Stay away from pushing the idea on your parents once you’ve discussed your wishes. This may annoy or stress them and could end up in them dismissing the idea altogether.

, No matter what your parents decide about moving, respect the decision they reach. There may be factors about which you are unaware that influence your parents’ decision and nagging them may have negative consequences for you.


Offer to help your parents in any way you can if they decide to move.Keep your parents in the loop about your feelings if the motivation for wanting to move is issues at school. Talking about problems with them may help.Revisit the issue in the future if your parents said they weren’t sure or wanted some more time to think about it.

, If moving isn’t an option at the moment, or at all, consider getting support to help you cope with why you want to move.This may help you realize that you can formulate alternatives to moving that may make you feel better.Speak with your family, friends, and/ or a trusted person. Be open and honest with them about your feelings and ask them for advice on how best to handle your situation.Seek the help of a professional such as your doctor, a psychiatrist, or a counselor., If a permanent move isn’t in the cards, explore your options for moving away temporarily. From exchange years to staying with relatives, even some time away may make you feel better or even help convince your parents that a move would be good for the family.


Suggest going to live with family or friends in a different area. Although it might not be your first choice of places to live, it can give you a chance to move and experience something different. For example, you could say “would it be possible for me to stay with Uncle Chris for a couple of months and go to school there?” or “mom, would you like to come and stay with us for a few weeks? This will give you a chance to relax.”
Consider going on an exchange program if you are a student. Not only can going abroad let you “move,” but it may also provide you new perspectives and adventures.Capitalize on vacations. For example, if your family is having a great time on vacation, mention to your parents how much more there is to do where you’re vacationing or even how much better your family gets along.

, If your reasons for moving are related to education, such as bullying or learning opportunities, ask if you can attend a different school. This may help you handle issues when you are not able to move.Research schools in your area that have qualities that you want. For example, if you want to focus on science, find local schools that offer excellent programs in science.
Ask your parents about the possibility of switching schools. Remember that this may mean they need to drive you to a different town or area every day, which could make their lives more difficult.Be aware that switching schools can also come with disadvantages: you will be the “new kid” and may find you have the same problems at the new school as you did at the old one., Visit your local chamber of commerce or ask friends or colleagues about different opportunities in your area. This may give you a chance to see the advantages of staying in your area.


See what activities, clubs, or events are happening. In many cases, people will carpool to local happenings and this may give you a chance to meet new people and “move” without leaving your home.
Ask friends and even people you meet while you’re out about activities or events in your area.

, The Internet has made the world much smaller. If moving physically isn’t an option, you can move spiritually by joining a new and/ or virtual community of people who share your interests and beliefs.


Research different communities online. For example, if you are interested in pursuing a degree in Roman history, you could join an online forum of archaeologists or other Roman history enthusiasts.
Consider seeing what other communities exist in your local area. For example, churches may be a place to find people with similar interests or locating a horse club online may help you connect with someone else in your area with similar interests in horses.
Let your parents know about the communities or activities in which you are interested. This can help them support you and may also make them revisit their decision about moving.

Otherwise, just go with the flow.,
Another important point is to wake up with energy.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Stay Up Later," If you do already, help out some more! This is very important as you want your parents to know you're responsible.;
, It is important that you do them when expected on a timely basis.

, Your time should be shared so that just playing video games and spending time on the internet by yourself is not cool.

, This makes for a closer family bond/unit and when you return home, your parents may want to rest (or go to bed), while you may not be tired...you accompanied them and YOU BEHAVED, and DIDN'T complain, then they should be happy -- and even more so because you were such a good team player.

, If school is in session, you should be in in bed earlier than usual --on summer vacations and weekends it should be no big deal to stay up later than usual.

, Even if you are cramming to study -- you should have been studying while doing your homework (during the daytime) so that at the last minute you're not cramming for a test. A normal extension should be say 1:00 am at the latest 2 or 3 in the morning (and staying up this late only makes sense if it's a holiday or party) maybe during summer and weekends (my daughter sometimes stays up later if I am up --she knows its lights out, when I go to bed and she calls it a night! Remember this makes more sense on weekends, summer, holidays or special events only)

, Then your parents will think you aren't getting enough sleep and will send you to bed earlier!

, Do what's expected of you respectfully and your parents should be more than happy to let you stay up later.

, A common reason is the kid not getting up in the morning. Look alive when you wake up! It'll show, and make your parents think you slept well.

Express your gratitude.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Have Your Own Bedroom," This will help you organize your thoughts and remember everything you want to say when you have your conversation with your parents. It can be as short or long as you need it to be. Some reasons you may consider could include:You are getting older and would like more privacy for yourself, for inviting friends over, or for focusing on homework.
You’ve outgrown the room you are in and the two of you no longer fit.
Your sibling is messy and you would like a clean space.
You are having trouble sleeping.;
, They have set the house up this way for a reason. Maybe you can find a way that having your own room is a solution to a problem like getting along with your siblings or having a quieter home because you have your own space. Think about where your parents are in this situation and it will help you predict what challenges may arise, as well as help you communicate in a way that appeals to them. What have they said yes to in the past and why?
What are they currently using the space for which you want to have as a room?
How would giving you your own room appeal to them?

, If there is space in the house that you are eyeing to be your own room, it is likely already being used for something else. Make plans about how the house can be rearranged or you could compensate for the lost space.


If there is a guest room you want as your room, offer to let guests stay in your room when they visit and you can go back to your old room on those nights.
If the room is a shared space, you can offer certain times when you would share your room, or find a new place in the house for the public items in the room, like a television or video games.

, When you start this conversation, you will want to be sure you have enough time to finish it. Find a time when your parents aren't busy or stressed. It is best to find a time when they are relaxed and in a good mood.


Avoid busy times like getting ready for school and work, or late in the day when people are tired and getting ready for bed.
Consider scheduling a conversation in advance. Tell them you would like to talk to them about something and ask if you can have a conversation after dinner.

, You will be the one to start the conversation, but remember that it is a two way street. Allow your parents to do some talking as well and really listen to what they have to say. Don’t interrupt. Nod your head when they are speaking. Try not to judge what they are saying.Remember what they are saying so you can repeat some of what they said back to them to let them know you heard them.
Once it is your turn to speak again, give feedback about what they said.

, If you have this conversation while you are upset, it is going to reduce your chances of getting what you want. You will be unfocused and confusing, while sending off very negative signals. Stay calm and relaxed or put the conversation off until a later time.If you feel yourself getting stressed, take a few deep breaths and try to focus on something positive. Pet your dog, or sniff the smell of the great dinner you just ate. Use your senses.
Make a joke. Inserting a little humor can break the tension and relax everyone back into the conversation.
Don’t react disrespectfully in your actions and words by calling them names or slamming doors.
Ask, “Can we talk about this later? I think I need more time to get my thoughts together.”

, What are some things your parents want or need which would be provided if you have your own room? Find ways that it would make them happy and benefit them to rearrange the house.Tell them there will be less fighting between you and your siblings.
Offer the you would be able to get your homework done if you had your own room.
Promise to be responsible for cleaning that part of the house now.

, If your conversation did not go the way you had hoped, you may be better at writing your thoughts than speaking them. You can write them a letter asking them to change their mind. Try writing it like you would write a persuasive essay.Start with an introduction explaining what you want and how you plan to convince them to agree with you.
Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence explaining what that paragraph is about and how it supports your argument. You can add several of these paragraphs.
Wrap it up with a conclusion that reviews your reasons and restates what you want in light of all of the support you have given in your letter.

, Maybe it doesn’t make logistical sense to have your own room right now, but maybe there is something smaller you can ask for. Think of a simpler solution which may give you some of the things you are looking for from having your own room.You could get your own desk for doing homework, crafts and storing some of your things.
Ask to be allowed to have the room to yourself when your friends some over.

, Don’t insist that they say yes right away. You have spent plenty of time thinking about how badly you want your own room, but they may need some time to think about how to make it work. Time gives them distance from the intensity and stress of the conversation.


If they say, “no” right away, request that they take some time to think about it and get back to you later. Ask, “Will you think about it a little longer and we can talk about it again next week?”
There may come a point when you have to accept the answer “no”. If this is not the right time for you to get your own room, it is best to move on and not dwell on it. Tell them, “I understand,” and move on. You’ll have your own room eventually, just not today.

, If your room is a mess, your parents don’t want that mess to spread through more of the house. It only takes ten minutes a day and a few simple steps to keep your room tidy and fresh.Start with the big, bad stuff. Is there a bunch of trash or piles of laundry in your room? Clear it out.
Make your bed.
Put a sock on each of your hands and wet one of them, then go around your room dusting with the dry hand and scrubbing with the wet one.

, You can let your parents know that you will take care of the space by showing responsibility in everything you do. Each little thing you do will earn you credit toward getting what you want. Go out of your way to be kind and responsible by doing more than is expected of you without being asked.


Take good care of the family pet.
Take care of your siblings by playing with them and helping them with chores or homework. They may be feeling like you are abandoning them for your own room.
Do some extra chores like the dinner dishes or the laundry.
Finish your homework early and get good grades.

, It is important to be thankful for the things your parents have done for you already. Thanking them for those things will let them know that you appreciate everything they do to take care of you. They will feel good about giving you what you want when they know you appreciate it. Showing gratitude improves your attitude and behavior as well as theirs.Start a gratitude journal and write down at least on thing you are thankful for every day.
Say “Thank you” for dinner. Especially if they take you out to a restaurant for a special night.
Thank them for your favorite toy and let them know how much it means to you.
Let them know that you really appreciate them providing the house you live in, the room you share and everything that is in it before you ask them for another room.

Are you wanting to fly with your friends? Are you wanting to visit a parent or relative who lives in another state or country?


Traveling alone no matter what age can be difficult. It means that you don’t have a familiar face to guide you if something comes up.
Figure out if you are really wanting to travel alone, or just not with your parents. Those are two different things. If you are interested in traveling with a sibling or friend, your parents may be less worried than if you were traveling without those supports.;
, After you’ve talked with your parents about your reasons for traveling alone, it is important to give reasons why you are ready. Think about these ways to convince your parents that you are ready:


You’ve traveled by plane many times before, with your parents, other relatives, or other adults before.
You have shown yourself to be a “good traveler.” You handled yourself well in the past, despite flight delays, cancellations, long stretches of waiting, or navigating through big airports.
You enjoy traveling. Traveling by plane doesn’t make you feel sick, anxious, or overwhelmed.

, Show how you have been responsible at home and at school as an indication that you will be responsible when traveling alone. When talking with your parents, avoid complaining, whining, or upsetting your parents. Show them you are becoming a mature young adult.Sometimes the way you approach a difficult subject likely traveling alone requires delicacy and maturity.
Parents always worry, but they are more likely to worry if they feel you are not yet responsible or mature in handling yourself independently.
Avoid acting like you know better. Show them that you are mature in the way you respond to their concerns.

, If you've travelled many times before, you can talk with your parents about the steps involved when preparing to travel, navigating an airport, and sitting through a flight. Show them how you are already skilled as a traveler.


Walk them through the steps of arriving to an airport, getting your plane tickets, checking bags, going through security, finding your gate, waiting for your flight, and finding your seat on the plane.
Have a question and answer session with your parents about how you would troubleshoot any issues that could arise if there are delays, flight changes, or other problems.
If you are a visual thinker, consider drawing a cartoon or chart about the steps you would take when departing from an airport, being on your flight, and arriving at your destination.

, Parents naturally worry about their kids, no matter what age. It can be hard for a parent to let go of their worries. By listening attentively to their opinions on the matter, they are more likely to see you as understanding of their concerns.


Be aware that they may have valid concerns.
Provide acknowledgment that you understand their concerns. Consider saying, “I really do understand your concerns.”
By listening to their specific worries, you may be able to identify what the biggest hurdles are to convincing your parents. By focusing your energy on addressing those biggest hurdles, then you may be able to soothe their fears.

, Note that at age 15 or older most airlines will allow you to fly alone. If you are under 15 years old, you may need to find out how your age affects whether you can fly alone.Different airlines have different procedures and regulations in place. Always check with the airline that you’re planning to travel on.
If you are 15 or over, talk with your parents about how you may be able to fly alone without supervision as an “unaccompanied minor.”
If you are between the ages of 12 and 15, there are different procedures in place based on the airline. Some airlines do not require you to register as an “unaccompanied minor” status when you are 12 and over. Check with the airline.
Children under the age of 5 cannot be unaccompanied. An adult must be present. In a few cases, someone who is at least 12 years old or older (such as an older brother and sister) can accompany children under 5.

, Generally, if you are age 5 to 11, you will need to be identified as an “unaccompanied minor” by the airline, and an additional fee will be charged in order for the airlines to provide “supervision” while you are on the flight.You will need to be registered as an ""unaccompanied minor"" under all circumstances if you are younger than 12 years old and traveling without an adult.
There may also be “unaccompanied minor” regulations in place for teens, ages 12 to 17, if traveling internationally.
Once you are over 12 years old, there are few “unaccompanied minor” restrictions if you are traveling on a domestic flight, particularly if it is a non-stop or direct flight.
Talk with your parents about how you can still be supervised by the airlines as an ""unaccompanied minor"" if you are over 12 and traveling alone. Airlines generally provide “unaccompanied minor” options even for teenagers. This can provide further reassurance to your parents.

, Your parents may be hesitant still to allow you to travel alone, but consider talking with them about traveling with someone they know, such as an older sibling, an adult relative, or a family friend.


Depending on why and where you’re traveling, you may be able to find someone to travel with you. Even if they aren’t your parents.
Talk with other relatives or siblings about your plans to travel.
Let’s say you want to go to a summer camp with your friend, and your friend and your friend’s older sister will be flying to the camp. You could talk with your parents about how you want to fly to camp, but also mentioned that you will not be alone. You will have your friend and an older sibling. They may be more willing to have you travel if it is a group.

, Explain to your parents that you understand their concerns. Ask them if they would be willing to call the airlines customer service to get more information about restrictions, regulations, and supports that the airline has in place.


Remind your parents that many children fly solo each year. The airlines are equipped to handle travel needs of children, with or without parental supervision.

, There will not be someone watching you at all times, but you will be monitored more than if you were traveling with your parents or other adults.A flight attendant will be monitoring you during the flight.
The airlines will ensure that you are picked up by the approved person on the “unaccompanied minor” form.
This process provides additional reassurance and safety. Remind your parents that this provides peace of mind that someone is watching out for you, even if you are traveling alone.

, Talk with your parents about who will be there when you get to your destination. Provide them with reassurance that the person at the other end is responsible and can handle any issues that may arise.


If your parents know the person, such as a relative, then consider talking with that relative about how you would like to travel alone. See if they can provide reassurance to your parents.
If your parents don’t know the person who is picking you up, then see if the person can call your parents. Let’s say you’re going to a summer camp or a special school trip. You could have the summer camp staff or the school trip staff talk with your parents to provide support and answer any questions.

, Talk with your parents about how you understand the importance of planning if there is a change in the flight schedule, a delay, or an emergency. Discuss with your parents about how you would handle yourself if something unexpected came up in the travel arrangements. By problem-solving “what-if” scenarios ahead of time, you’ll be better prepared. Talk about who to call and where to go if something changes in your travel plans.
Show your parents that you will be knowledgeable and mature. Tell them that you would be ready if an emergency occurred because you and your parents are thinking ahead.

Make constructive suggestions to change things––with your help.,
Tell your parents which spaces are beyond cluttering.,

Expect the unexpected.",How to Deal With Parents Who Hoard," There are complex reasons behind hoarding. In the case of parents, some of the reasons might include:


A parent who has lost a lot in life may feel compelled to hang onto things out of fear of future loss––the loss may have been a job, family members or family structure, houses, items, etc.
A parent who is suffering from depression, anxiety or a mental illness may derive comfort from hanging onto things; initially the items hoarded may carry some meaning that gets lost over time but the hoarding instinct remains.
Sometimes a parent may be trying to create a sense of stability during difficult times, such as when moving around a lot or job hopping, and stuff makes up the gap in between the uncertainty of life in general and the certainty of things.
In some cases, a parent may be trying to hang onto everything in the vain hope that all these things will be useful for you someday––in this case, the challenge of hoarding may be coupled with the many dreams the parent holds for you, none of which really equate to who you are or what you wish to do in life.
Hoarding can creep up unawares on parents who feel unable to let go of all the mementos that have filled their parenting years, due to the emotional pain of letting go of their child's paintings, art projects, report cards, written work, books, toys, clothes, etc.
Finally, but very importantly, hoarding can be associated with grief, as the hoarder wants to ""hold on"" to a deceased person by keeping objects that the loved one gave to them. In some cases this can be the equivalent of an entire extra household's worth of goods!;
, It is reasonable to feel annoyed, frustrated or overwhelmed by clutter in your life, especially where you have no control over its growth. At the same time, while your feelings are important, they must be balanced with compassion. Your parents aren't doing this to hurt you––they may very well not even grasp how much their hoarding impacts you. By understanding that hoarding is a compulsive disorder, you can see that it isn't directed at you personally. For your own sake, remind yourself that dealing with this is about finding ways to cope rather than taking it out on yourself.


Be alert to the ways the hoarding impacts you, such as isolating you from friends, causing shame and preventing you from having privacy. Your feelings are legitimate and deserving of attention too; take care not to submerge your needs in caring for your needy parents.
Don't get mad if your parents hoard––anger won't solve anything.
You cannot ""make"" someone change; but you can strongly suggest that they change. This is your strength, in recognizing what is happening and being prepared to help do something about it.

, Remember, you're not trying to attack them; you are rather trying to re-channel their actions into more positive ones that will help both them and the family as a whole. Instead of being an antagonist, see their side of the story first. You might try some of the following:


Ask them about their feelings toward the objects they're hoarding and what the objects represent. This can help you to form ideas about ways to display or rearrange things in a way that minimizes them (and their impact) while still honoring the essence of the objects.
Gently find out how they feel about life generally. Have you noticed if your parents seem sad, down, grieving, lost or any other feelings that might cause them to remain stuck in the past or overwhelmed about something? In some cases, getting them away from the home environment for a trip or for events might prove beneficial if your parents spend most of their time housebound.
Identify the signs of hoarding. Do your parents constantly make shopping trips for items they don't need and, in many cases, don't even unwrap? Do you find a bunch of older objects that they don't need stacked in the house? Do Mom and Dad refuse to give these items up?

, While it's important to acknowledge their feelings, it's also important to express your own feelings. You might not be sure how these will be received––that depends on how well your parents listen and are prepared to face what is happening. In some cases, they may not really get how this is affecting you, or they may be tempted to diminish the impact on you. Try not to take this personally––your parents have a compulsive disorder that isn't directed at you but is a symptom of their own broader malaise. At the very least, air your feelings to help you make sense of how the hoarding impacts you. Using ""I feel sad when you hoard"" is appropriate. If they are invested in you, they will at least value your feelings.

, As part of your discussion with your parents, it may help to explore some basic facts that go beyond feelings, such as:


The risk of injury from clutter. The more clutter in the home, the more danger that can result when items fall down, when people trip over them, etc. This is especially of concern for the less nimble, elderly parent, who may be trapped by items that fall onto them. However, it can impact people of any age, such as keeping things on the staircase making it hard to go up and down the stairs, which could potentially cause someone to fall and be injured.
Fire danger increases with clutter. Flammable materials such as newspapers, magazines, paper stacks, etc. can present a fire hazard when accumulated. The danger intensifies if the materials block access or they're stacked near sources of heat, such as furnaces, stoves and heaters. Blocking the air flow of appliances with stacks of clutter can cause them to overheat and spark a fire.
Inability to clean the house properly increases allergies and health problems. A build-up of pollen, bacteria and dust that cannot be cleared away due to clutter presents real health problems that can even result in health code violations if the clutter becomes too unsanitary.
The house can begin to go into disrepair if people aren't allowed to come in and repair for shame of the state of the house. Ultimately this can lead to the house losing value and becoming less safe to live in.

, While you can't change your parents, you can offer to alleviate some of the burden surrounding them. For example, you might offer to clean up certain parts of the house, donating items to charity so that they don't feel compelled to keep them. Or, suggest that they take digital images of all those childhood mementos but let go of the physical objects. Realize that while it may feel simple to offer help and to pitch in and do the hard lifting, this will remain an emotional issue for your parents and you may meet a lot of resistance or fobbing off. Take it gradually and offer to do things here and there, rather than aiming to fix it all in one fell swoop.


Show your parents how to digitize their paper piles. They can take photos or scans of bills, magazine articles, pamphlets, children's artwork, souvenir cards, etc. and keep the memories forever without keeping the piles. If they're worried about losing the digital information, make back-ups for them, both using cloud computing and external hard drives. The less excuse they have for hanging onto these items, the better!
Digitalizing isn't just for paper––music, videos and photos can go this way too. You may meet cries of indignation about digital files lacking the quality of the old vinyl but with a little perseverance and persuasion, you might be able to get at least some of the collection reduced to digital forms so that there is room to move again! If you don't have the time to help, there are plenty of services available to transfer hard copy music and images to digital formats.
Help your parents establish systems that get those invoice piles off the dinner table and into paid files instead. In many cases, invoices can now be sent electronically, so that there is no longer any need for paper clutter––ask them if they'd like you to set up an electronic system for them, including direct debiting where relevant.
Tell your parents stories about people who really need the clothes, shoes and other items they're clinging to but do not need. Tell them about the neighbor's children with bare feet, or the school without pens, or the friend who has just taken up baking and is looking for cake pans. Tell them about Freecycle, a way to match their accumulated stuff with people who will really do something useful with it (but beware they don't start chasing after other people's junk and bringing it back home!). Offer to drop off excess items to people in need.
Provide storage space for objects that your parents don't seem to be able to part with. Find magazine racks, cupboard space, plastic bins, etc., to at least make things tidier and easier to move. Suggest that they place a monthly paper clear out on the calendar, for recycling newspapers and magazines. You could even schedule recycle day as a monthly dinner party event!
Encourage borrowing of magazines over purchasing. Your parents get to read, not keep, the magazines. Set alarms on their electronic calendar for the return date or keep an eye on it yourself and remind them. If this doesn't work, subscribe to digital issues for them. A cluttered computer is better than a cluttered home.
Reduce isolation. In some cases, isolation may be the cause of hoarding. Find ways for your parent to interact with other people if he or she is living alone. Are there social groups in the area? Can you hire someone to call on your parent regularly? How often can you stop by or call and have a chat? Set up a Skype account for your parent and try to check in regularly, encouraging as many family members as possible to do the same.

, If you live with your parents, your own space needs to remain uncluttered. Tell your parents that they cannot use your room, your study space, food preparation areas or your relaxation space for their clutter. If they seek to place items in any forbidden zones, assert your preference and gently but firmly remove the items to their own space. Repeating this will help them to realize that you mean what you say, as well as reinforcing the fact that you need areas that are not cluttered.


Obviously, this involves an issue of power imbalance. If your parents are caring and are willing to listen, your boundary delineation should be accepted, perhaps with resignation, but at least respected. On the other hand, if your parents become abusive with you for asserting your right to a clean space, you will need to tread carefully and seek external help immediately. Remember that no matter what pain or difficulty your parents may be experiencing, you do not deserve to be subjected to harm or abuse.

, If you live with your parents, spend less time at the cluttered home. This is important to give you a sense of space and freedom, letting you think freely without being confronted by the clutter. Places to visit include libraries, friends' houses, coffee shops, parks, public galleries and museums, study rooms, etc. Go for long walks and perhaps take the occasional overnight hike or sleepover. This part is about ensuring that you don't stay feeling overwhelmed by all the clutter, allowing you to develop your own sense of place.

, If you can, suggest ways for your parents can seek help. Make it clear to Mom and Dad that their hoarding won't get any better if they don't obtain proper counseling. Offer to accompany them to the counselor if they're reticent or drive them there if they're not able to get there under their own steam.


The more that a person clings to objects and refuses to let go of them, the less likely this person will be willing to seek help voluntarily. It helps to understand this because it will possibly be an uphill battle to convince a hoarder to seek help. Even if you do manage to get the hoarder to counseling, there is no guarantee of repeat visits or of changed behavior. Some of this will depend on how vigilant you're prepared to be and how much effort you're prepared to put in both emotionally and physically to help the behavioral change.

, Understand that it will take a long time (probably even forever) for your parents to cure. Never expect change to happen overnight. Don't think instant miracles will happen; because they won't. The effort usually needs to be a team one (not just family members but also involving outsiders and possibly professionals) and it needs to be ongoing. Just do your part: encourage help, and be patient.


Use positive feedback to acknowledge all the changes your parents do make. Exclaim how wonderful it is to be able to walk in a certain space again, or how much cleaner the house feels, etc. By acknowledging the good in having less clutter around, you reward the steps that they have taken to make a difference.

It might feel embarrassing to talk about the changes that you're going through. Don't worry. Most people feel pretty shy when talking about puberty. Take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that everyone goes through this.


Remember that your parents are there to support you. Don't worry that they won't understand what you're experiencing. They have gone through the same thing.
Give yourself a pep talk. Look in the mirror and say, ""I am confident that I can handle this conversation.""
Your parents may even be impressed by your maturity in wanting to know more about such important changes to your body.;
, What are you hoping to get out of this talk? Puberty is a big change in your life, and there are many different ways that the conversation could go. Pick a few major points of interest to start out. If you want to focus the conversation on learning about sex, for instance, figure that out ahead of time. You should also decide whether you want your parents to simply listen to you or if you want them to offer advice.Try making a list of what is important to you. For example, if you're concerned about preparing for your first period, make that your top priority.
If you want advice from your parents, prepare a list of questions to ask.
If you just want them to listen to your feelings, say, ""I know you guys are more experienced than me, but for now, could you just listen?""

, This is an important conversation, so you’ll want to be ready for it. Don’t run the risk of being caught flatfooted. Once you figure out what’s important to you, figure out how you want to phrase it.


Try writing down some things you want to say. You can even make note cards to have with you during the conversation.
Rehearse what you plan to say. Try looking in the mirror while you ask potential questions.
You will feel more calm and confident if you have a game plan.

, It’s OK if you only feel comfortable speaking with one parent in particular. If you’re male, you may want to talk with your dad. If you’re female, you may want to talk with your mom. Or you may be all right talking with both of them. But figure that out before beginning the conversation.Make your decision clear to your parents. Try saying, ""Mom, could you and I have a private talk after dinner?""

, You don’t have to tell your parents everything. And if you’re not close with your parents, or if you know they won’t want to talk about anything sexual in nature, it may be a better idea to talk to someone else. Consider talking to an older sibling, or even a grandparent. An authority figure to whom you aren’t related, like a school counselor or nurse, could also be a good choice.You could say to your older brother, ""Brad, I'm nervous to talk to mom and dad. Could you answer some questions for me?""
If you decide to talk to the nurse, ask if there are any pamphlets you could read. A medical professional is a great resource for this sensitive subject.

, You want to make sure that your parents have time to be fully present for this important talk. Don’t ask them when they’re busy with something else, or when they’re running out the door to get to work on time. Pick a time such as the weekend when you know that they will have an hour or more to talk with you.You should also consider letting your parents know ahead of time that you have something important to talk about with them. You don’t need to say exactly what you want to talk about. But by asking them something like “Hey, can we talk about something tomorrow? It’s private, so I’d appreciate it if it’s just us” you can increase the chances of them taking the conversation seriously., Your parents may not want to talk about anything at all if they’re tired or overly preoccupied with another matter. By starting off a conversation with a question about a more trivial topic like the weather or how their day was, you can get a better sense of their mood. And by starting the conversation off in this way, you can more easily move on to a more serious topic than if you brought up the serious topic first.You could start by saying, ""How was your day?""
Or you could try lightening the mood by telling a funny story about soccer practice.

, Remember that everyone goes through puberty. It is totally appropriate to want to talk about this subject with your parents. Be open and honest with them. They might feel awkward at first, too, but you can work together to have a productive conversation.


Try saying, ""Dad, I have some questions about the changes that are happening with my voice. Can you explain some things to me?""
You can also be upfront by saying, ""I'm nervous, so please be patient with me.""

, Remember that an effective conversation is a two-way street. You want your parents to show you respect and understanding. You owe them the same treatment. Listening is one way to show this.Make eye contact. Even if you feel awkward, look at your parents when you talk. It shows them you are listening.
Ask questions. If you don't understand something, ask. This demonstrates that you are serious about learning more about the subject.

, While you should listen carefully to what your parents say, you should also make sure that they don’t turn the conversation into a one-sided lecture about appropriate behavior or sexual abstinence. Remember that this conversation should be an opportunity for you to learn more about what’s happening to your body. Politely but firmly let them know that while you care about their views, you were hoping to have an opportunity to express yourself as well.You can try saying, ""Puberty is more than about sex. I also want to know what changes I can expect in my mood.""
Another tactic would be to say, ""I understand you want to ensure my safety. The best way for me to stay safe is to gain a clear understanding about sex.""

, Don’t lie or hide the truth about anything. Explain your situation and any concerns you have fully. If you are as open and honest as possible, there is a much greater likelihood that your parents will respond in kind.You can say, ""Mom, I got my period yesterday. Can I talk to you about how I feel?""

, If you act irritable around your parents, they will probably act the same way towards you.In the event of a disagreement, stay as calm and collected as possible. Say what’s on your mind, but remain mature when you do so.


If you get frustrated, take a time out.
You can say, ""I'm getting emotional. Would you mind if I go to my room for a little bit?""

Determine what you want and why.,
Provide evidence.,
Play to your audience.,
Anticipate counter arguments.,
Exploit your parent’s weaknesses.",How to Convince Your Parents1," Many parents are incredibly patient. Others are not patient at all. If you want to ask for something, know exactly what that something is. If you fumble over your words, your parent might grow impatient, which will reduce your chances of success.


Be able to justify your side. Do you want to borrow the car this weekend? Why do you need to borrow the car? Why should your interests be taken into consideration? Consider these questions before you broach the subject with your parents, because they will most certainly ask.;
, If research will help you make your point, do it. Ask others for their advice. Research specific materials online concerning your point. For example, if you want a new iPhone, iPad, or any other Mac product, be able to tell your parents why you want that specific product. Does it run faster than any other device? Does it offer specific features that will help you in school, work, or life in general?

, If you know that your parents care about one thing more than another, be sure to anticipate those preferences. If your parents have been hounding you about your grades for weeks and you want to get a new laptop, stress how the purchase will help you earn better grades. If your parents want you to get a better job, stress how a new car will help you get to your future job.Remember that your parents want to see you happy, but they also want to see their ideals in your life choices. Find a middle ground between your desires and your parents' ideals.

, Sometimes you’ll think that no one in their right mind will disagree with your point, but there are always counter points to consider. If you know your audience (or your parents), you'll probably be able to guess what concerns they'll have. Think about how to reduce opposition. Most likely, you’ll have to gradually chip away at their defenses.


One way to reduce your parent’s opposition to your request is to meet them halfway. If you want a new car, offer to match their funds. If your parents pay $X towards your new vehicle, you’ll match it. If your parents are willing to pay for the car, you’ll gladly pay for insurance and gas costs., This sounds strange, but everyone is susceptible to different types of argumentation. Some parents will succumb to shows of emotion. If you cry when you ask for something, they’ll be overcome with empathy. They just want to make you feel better and will give in immediately. Others want to feel like a hero. Make these parents feel like they are saving you in some way and they’ll give in. Other parents are simply self-interested. For these parents, you’ll have to find ways of bargaining with them.

"
Ask nicely.,
Flatter your parents.,
Find the right time.",How to Convince Your Parents2," Request. Don’t demand. Some subjects are delicate. If you are asking for something that requires the other person to sacrifice, don’t approach the matter in a negative way.For instance, if you want to borrow the car over the weekend, say “I know you wanted to use the car this weekend, but I would really like to go see my friends at the mall.” In this example, we started by recognizing the needs of another person and then framing our request against those needs. Make sure that you use appropriate respectful language and are simply polite.

, Compliment their appearance and their actions. Recognize what your parents take pride in and then focus your compliments on that subject. Then make your case politely. Don’t make it obvious. Don’t just run up to your mother and say “I like your hair today. Can I have a new video game?” Your compliment will seem disingenuous. Get your parent into a good mood with compliments. Then wait a couple of minutes at least before you ask for something., Timing is everything in comedy and convincing your parents of anything. Parents are human beings too. Everyone makes decisions based on their emotions. There is no helping it. Wait until your parent is in a good mood.


Don’t ask for things when they get home from work. They want to be appreciated when they walk in the door. They don’t want to be hassled at that exact moment.
Don’t make your case when your parent is in the middle of something else. We’ve all seen commercials of children bugging their parents for something while they’re on the phone, paying bills, or watching their favorite television shows. It never works out for the child. Learn from this. Wait until the ideal time to ask your parents.

Clearly state your goal.,
Bargain.,
Ask for a delayed response.,
Understand your parent’s argument.,
Re-evaluate.",How to Convince Your Parents3," Thoroughly explain what it is you hope to get and why you hope to get it. Depending on the nature of the subject, you can ask your parents to hear your entire argument before responding. If they agree, then you can lay out your goal, present your evidence, anticipate their counter points or concerns, and then conclude.Hopefully, your parents will hear you out until you are finished. If not, you'll need to be able to present your points in the form of a conversation. Make your point. Hear their counterpoint and then rebut. Don't lose your cool. Don't resort to condescension or screaming.

, Don’t just take from your parents. Give back. Since you are asking a favor of them, it would be nice, if you offered something in return. Your parents want to see you be happy, but they also have to get other things done.


The strongest strategy for bargaining with your parents is offering to do chores. If you want to borrow the car over the weekend, offer to do chores at home or around town. Make your request worth more to them than just making you happy. If they feel like they are making you happy and getting something else out of it, they’ll be more likely to acquiesce to your request., “Don’t answer yet.” “Just think about it. No rush. Get back to me when it is convenient.” No one likes being put on the spot, especially if it concerns a more serious request or issue. Your parent’s gut reaction will be to say “No”. To avoid getting a rejection immediately, give your parent some time to decide and to consult with your other parent. This will also show your parents that you are mature and not impetuous.This tactic only works with requests that aren't time specific. If you need to borrow the car this weekend. You don't want to put off getting your parent's answer because then you won't have time to secure other transportation. If, for example, you want to get a new pet, this strategy might work better. Because getting a new pet is such a commitment, it is best to not rush your parents into it.

, If you want to retort or convince your parents of your side, you'll need to discount their argument. So even if they say ""no"" this doesn't mean that they'll always say ""no"". Ask for an explanation. Hopefully, your parent won’t just play the parent card — “because I said so”. Hopefully, they’ll explain their side of the debate. If they do, try to understand what is driving their reasoning. Then make counter-arguments or proposals that undercut those arguments and support your own.For example, if your parents say no to getting a new dog based on the premise that you are not responsible enough, find ways to show them otherwise. Start behaving more responsibly and when they notice, bring up getting a new dog again. ""Look I am responsible. Now that you recognize my ability to be responsible, can we get a dog?"" Remember that one of the best ways to counter a parent's argument is through your actions.

, There may be other ways of convincing your parents. Take a moment to regroup and to re-evaluate alternate strategies. You might conclude to let it go. Hopefully, you've succeeded, but if you haven't, your desire to convince your parent might wane. It might not be worth it to you any more to convince your parent. Some parents won’t think about changing their opinions once their mind is set. If this is the case, you may have to consider alternative avenues to getting what you want.For example, if your parents refuse to help you buy a car, you will need to get a job and save your money to buy one yourself.

Ask yourself, are you simply afraid of what is familiar? Or are you trying to avoid negative behaviors that your parents exhibited, such as neglect or violence?If you're afraid of what's familiar, you may be able to proceed on your own. However, if your concerns are trying to avoid negative behaviors, you may need to recruit the help of a qualified therapist.;
, The first step to avoiding becoming like someone is to recognize what it is about that person you don't like.It's not enough to just say that you don't want to be like someone. You'll need to determine the specific behaviors, characteristics, or parenting methods that you yourself hope to avoid.


Make a list of your mother's characteristics or behaviors that you hope to avoid.Are you afraid that you'll become judgmental or argumentative? Give unwanted advice? What is your mother doing that you're afraid of doing in your own life?
Recognize what triggers precede your mother's negative behavior. Think about what sets up your mother's undesirable behavior: is her behavior a reaction to the behavior of others around her?, If you truly believe that your mother's behavior has a negative impact on your life, it may be best to limit your contact with her as much as possible when she is behaving negatively. If you still live at home, it may not be feasible to completely limit all contact, but if you are an adult and you want to avoid taking on negative behaviors your mother exhibits, you may want to try to avoid spending too much time together. Even as a child or adolescent who lives at home, you can limit/reduce your time spent directly together during periods when your mother is behaving negatively or inappropriately.If your mother says something that you know will start a fight, tell her you don't want to argue and leave the room. You can go for a walk, or just sit alone in your room until things cool down, but engaging with someone who is trying to provoke an argument will not be productive.
Be aware that limiting or cutting off contact with a parent may be devastating to them. If you have an otherwise healthy and loving relationship with your mother, it's best to try to work things out with her. Limiting contact is best left for situations where a parent has a history of abusive or neglectful behavior., Once you've identified what characteristics you wish to avoid, you'll need to learn to police your own behavior. Think about how you typically react to the triggers that precede your mother's undesirable behavior. Are you able to detach yourself from the emotional response you're afraid of exhibiting? Or do you feel helpless and stuck in the behavior you've learned from your mother?If your mother is very judgmental, for example, it may be helpful to identify the moments in which you lapse into judgmental thinking or say judgmental things. Some of these moments may be easy to identify on your own, while others may require an outsider's input.
Ask your friends or relatives to help you become more aware of how you react to the triggers you've identified. This may help you gain an awareness of behavior that you engage in without thinking.

, As much as you may want to think of yourself in terms of being unlike your mother, it's important to establish a firm set of positive values for yourself. Knowing what you believe in and hold important will help you determine the kind of person you'd like to be, which in turn may help shape the types of friendships and relationships you cultivate.To help you figure out your values, it may be helpful to reflect on:


who you respect, and whywhat objects hold the most sentimental value to you, and whywhat times in your life felt the most rewarding or fulfillingwhat issues you would most like to resolve or address in your community, or in the worldwhat social or cultural issues you feel the most passionately about, or talk about the most, and why those issues are important to you, Even though in an ideal world a parent would always be the parent and the child would always be the child, sometimes in reality a child must be the mature one. The most mature thing you can do to avoid arguments and defuse tension with your mother is to step back and assess how you respond to conflict. If, like many people, you have a reactive personality, you may need to work on changing your approach to conflict with difficult people.Reactive people tend to reach emotional conclusions very quickly. These individuals may feel completely out of control when it comes to emotional responses, because a reactive person's response and behavior are, essentially, determined by the other person.If you find yourself having an elevated pulse during verbal conflicts with your mother, or talking over her, or starting fights at the drop of a hat, you may be a reactive person.Distance yourself from the problem before you react. The biggest problem for reactive people is that they tend to respond immediately to conflict or the perceived initiation of conflict with an angry, emotional response. Give yourself a moment to breathe and consider what would be a positive, constructive response before you say or do anything.Learn to be mindful. Practicing mindfulness and mindful meditation can help you gain greater insight into the roots of your problems and find more constructive ways to deal with those problems., Whether your mother has a tendency to make things about herself that you are fearful of inheriting, or you simply want to stop taking the things your mother says or does to heart, learning to disengage from what's being said to you may help. It is not an easy, overnight transformation, but with time and effort you can learn to let go of the resentment and personal frustration you feel in response to your mother.Step out of your perspective. It can be difficult at times to imagine a situation from someone else's perspective, but it's an important part of distancing yourself from frustrating or damaging behavior. If your mother's behavior is getting on your nerves, or if you worry you'll end up behaving like your mother, try to see things from your mother's perspective. For example, do you really believe she is engaging in over-protective behavior to ruin your life, or is it her way of trying to show you she cares?Resist your intuitive reactions. Many people react emotionally without giving proper time to assess the situation or process what's been said. Rather than allowing yourself to respond immediately with an impassioned rebuttal, take a few seconds to process what you've heard or seen and what an appropriate, level-headed response might be.Avoid jumping to conclusions. If you're feeling insecure or frustrated with your mother, it can be easy to assume that anything you interpret as a criticism must actually be critical. However, it's possible that you're reading too much into things, or entirely personalizing something that wasn't meant to be directed at you. Even if your mother does say something critical or hurtful and it seems deliberate, the underlying cause is probably something very emotionally troubling to your mother that she hasn't figured out how to deal with., As much as you may fear growing up to be like your mom, you're still your own person. You may inevitably pick up certain behaviors or traits that you unconsciously learned from your mother, but ultimately, you are not the same person.Think about the things that make you a unique individual. Whether it's your taste in music, your hobbies, or your hopes and dreams, celebrate the things that make you who you are., If you feel completely helpless in identifying and changing your own behavior, consider talking to a qualified therapist. A therapist can help you work through behavioral issues and learn to respond in a more healthy, constructive way to situational triggers.


Search online for therapists near you, or ask your primary care giver for a referral/recommendation.

, Think about whether your mother's undesirable behaviors are something she learned from her own parents. Many people pick up behaviors and characteristics from their parents. Just because you're aware of your mother's undesirable behavior, it doesn't necessarily mean that your mother is aware of her own behavior. It's entirely possible that she was taught to behave that way by her parents.Even though it's easy to blame your mother for her behavior, it may not be entirely her fault. If at all possible, try talking to your mother about the behavior you resent. You might learn more about your mother, and find that she herself regrets behaving the way she has.
Ask your mother open-ended conversational questions. Try something like, ""What was your relationship like with grandma/grandpa?"" or ""What were grandma/grandpa like as parents?""

, Many psychologists believe that, to some extent, it's impossible to completely avoid becoming like our parents. The best we can do is identify the negative traits we most resent, and work to become more aware of our own behavior.Some studies suggest that most people begin to act like their parents around the age of 32.The reason most people grow up to become like their parents is because our brains are wired to do so. During stressful situations, the neurons in the brain seek the most familiar paths, even if those paths are not what we would consciously like them to be., If you resent your mother for certain undesirable behaviors, it's important to work towards avoiding those behaviors in your own life. However, there's a good chance that you may have inherited some positive behaviors or characteristics from your mother. As you grow older, it can help you come to accept the adult you've become if you learn to appreciate the good inherited behaviors your mother passed on to you."

Shield your parents.",How to Persuade Your Parents Into Letting You Go to a Late Night Event," Timing is key in popping the question, so you’ll want to put some thought and effort into when and how you’ll do it. Wait for a moment when you know your parents will be relaxed and happy, and ask them then.Don’t ask your parents if they’re in a bad mood. Wait till later when they’ve cooled off.
Don’t ask your parents if they’re rushed or in the middle of doing something else. Wait until you have their undivided attention.;
, If you think your parents are going to say no to letting you go for safety reasons, give them examples of how safe the event will be. Tell them about any chaperones or other parents that might be there. Tell them who you’re going with, how long you’ll be there and any other pertinent information.Tell the truth. If there aren’t going to be parents or chaperones there, don’t lie.
If they’re concerned about how late the event is, tell them you’ll go to bed early the next night to make up for it.

, Your parents have a lot to keep track of, so the easier you can make this on them, the better. If you have a flier of the event, give them a copy. If you have a phone number for the adult who is supervising, write that on the flier.If you’re feeling ambitious, make a list of everyone who is going to be there and include their phone numbers.
Hang the flier on the fridge so the information is easily available to your parents and so that it doesn't get lost.

, Your parents are responsible for your well-being, but they are not required to let you do the things you want to do. If you want your parents to grant you a favor, show them that you appreciate all the things they already do for you.Don’t just come out and say, “Mom and Dad, can I go to this event?”
Try saying something like, “Mom and Dad, I know you don’t usually let me go out late on a school night, and I understand and appreciate why. But it would mean lot if you would consider letting me go this one time.”

, You may feel like you don’t have any power in this situation, but that’s actually not true. Try offering your parents something you know they want: foolproof options include offering to do extra chores or offering to do better in school.Make your offer very specific. Say something like, “If you let me go, I’ll do everyone’s laundry this week.”
If you make a promise to do something, actually do it. Otherwise, your parents will remember the next time you want a favor.

, If this event costs money, offering to pay will show your parents just how important this event is to you. If you can’t afford to pay the whole amount, at least offer to contribute. Your parents will appreciate your responsibility.Your parents may be so impressed by this that they may offer to pay for the whole thing.
If the event doesn’t cost money, offer to give your parents money for the gas they would use driving you there. They’ll appreciate how thoughtful the gesture is.

, You don’t want your parents to feel pressured to rush into an answer: if they feel this way, they’re more likely to turn you down. Tell your parents to take a day or two to think it over.Make sure you plan it out so you’re asking at least a week in advance. Any later than that and your parents will feel rushed.
Don’t ask too far ahead of time. This increases the chances that your parents might change their minds about letting you go.

, If your parents turn you down, don’t give up yet. Ask them why they said no, then try to think of ways to turn that no into a yes. Your parents will be impressed that you care enough to try to change, and that may be enough to sway their decision.If your parents don’t give a clear-cut reason as to why they’re saying no, dig a little deeper. You can’t change something if you don’t know what it is.
If your parents say no again, accept it. If you make a big stink about it, they’re even less likely to say yes next time.

, Your parents aren’t likely to give in to your request if your usual behavior is obnoxious or rude. Show your parents you’re deserving of their trust by acting as grown up and responsible as you can.Go out of your way to be extra polite and helpful. They’ll notice and appreciate that you’re making an effort.
The longer you can keep this up, the more your parents will see you as a grown up who they can count on.

, If you own a cell phone, don’t let it die. Keeping your cell phone with you and charged is a great way to show your parents that you’re responsible and that they can easily contact you if they needed to.Always pick up the phone when your parents call. You want to prove to them that they can easily get ahold of you if they give you more freedom.
Same thing goes for texting. Answer as promptly as possible.

, If you want to go to a late-night event, but you’ve never slept away from home before, your parents might be a little apprehensive. Start by asking if you can have a sleepover at a friend’s house. Ease your parents into it and they may be more likely to give in to a bigger request later.If you have a curfew, try coming home on time consistently. This will show your parents that you’re reliable.
If your parents ask you to call and check in when you get somewhere, make sure you do this every time. The more trust you can build, the better.

, In the event that your parents do agree to let you go, make them feel appreciated for their trust in you. Thank them after they say yes, and then again after the event. Remember, they didn't have to let you do this, and you don't want them to regret it.If you're looking for bonus points, make your parents a thank you card or get them a small gift to show your appreciation.
If you're going to someone's house for the event, send them a thank you note as well.

, If you told your parents you would call them at a certain time to check in, do it. If you told them you'd be home at a certain time, don't be late. It's not enough to intend to follow through on your promises - you have to actually do it.Talk with your parents before going out. Ask them to remind you what's expected of you, then write it down so you don't forget.
The more you can follow through on your promises and put them at ease during this event, the easier it will be for them to let you go next time.

, If your parents are easily alarmed or on the stricter side, you don’t want to give them any reason to doubt or worry about you. Be aware of what you’re putting out there on social media, and try to keep from letting your parents see anything that might freak them out.Delete your browser history when searching for things online.
If you use Facebook, change your settings so that you have to approve everything that gets posted about you.
This way your friends can’t tag you in something that might get you trouble later.
If you need to hide things, pick a good spot where your parents won’t find them. Your attic and basement are usually a safe bet.

Go onto her blog website and write about her.,
Consider why it bothers you that your mom is using you as ""blog-spiration"".,
Check in regularly to see how often you are the topic of her blog fodder.,
Consider what you could live with.,
Meet with mom about the blog.,
Provide a resolution.,
Provide other amusing topic ideas for her to write about on a regular basis.",How to Get Your Mom to Stop Blogging About Your Life," She will be annoyed and stop when she feels her private life has been exploited.;
, If your mom is recounting your life in full technicolor, along with your name, this could be awkward and potentially embarrassing. On the other hand, if your mom is being fairly discreet and isn’t calling you out by name, it might not be quite such an issue. Indeed, if her blog is generally read by other adults (most likely other moms) and not even many at that, it's a good idea to reflect over what's making you so shy or upset. Some reasons might include:


You might feel as if your mom is making fun of what you consider to be very personal events in a public sphere. Although it may be okay to joke around with immediate family members about the time you responded amusingly or even embarrassingly while trying to be cool in front of a group of girls (or guys), you don’t want the world to be in on the “family joke.” Sometimes you need private family jokes to stay that way.
Your friends’ parents read your mom’s blog. You really don’t want your buddy’s mom to know about your trials and tribulations of dealing with geometry or that your mom busted you during your first kiss. Even though some parents would know better than to go back to their child and share the information, others may talk about it immediately, especially to illustrate points they're trying to make as part of the blog (in which case, it may be done without really thinking things through). You don’t want to leave it to chance that all your friends will know your deep dark secrets.
It's simply annoying. At this point, you feel as if you can’t do anything without having it go up on the blog. It’s like being on a reality show without signing up. You're annoyed that she takes everything you do and writes about it, no matter how trivial or dull.

, Is her blog generally all about you or does she simply sprinkle stories she finds to be hilarious about you every now and again? In some cases, her entire blog could be how crazy it is to be a mom––and if that’s the case, you may have more to deal with than just an occasional post. Conduct a random sampling of her blogs and count the number of posts that are dedicated to “humiliating” or exposing your personal exploits. Compare your posts to the number of overall blogs to arrive at a general percentage or average. If it seems like she is perhaps overdoing it, then it's time to talk.

, If mom’s blog is dedicated to the hilarity of being a mom, you may need to consider first whether it's you who needs to lighten up. If that's not the issue, then consider which topic areas you could tolerate being posted about you, so that you can go into your discussion with her with some solutions rather than a blanket ban on you as a topic. Make a list of topics that are on or off limits for mom. Try to be fair––while you probably just want her to stop altogether, there could be areas that won’t cause any damage to your street cred and allow you to save face with your friends. Some areas to consider include:


Embarrassing kid stories. Such as the time you cried your eyes out at Disney World when Mickey Mouse said “hi” to you. If old stories about when you were little embarrass you, let her know.
Sharing pictures. Mom may think the picture of you in the sailor suit is adorable, but you are mortified. Either ask mom to stop posting any pictures of you on her blog or limit them to a few “approved” choices. Alternatively, have her run the choices by you prior to publication, so that you can vet them.
Academic status. If you got a “D” on the last history test because you accidentally numbered your paper incorrectly, ask her to eliminate any posts that will make you look like a total idiot. Unless she wants to blog about your 4.7 GPA, let her know what she can and can’t say about your smarts. You'll be spending the rest of your life trying to improve your status and online discussion about poor marks can sully your reputation enhancement.
Relationships. There’s nothing more embarrassing than having your mom talk about a girl or a boy you like in school––or find out that she was lurking around the corner when you were making out. Banish any posts about your relationships, both former and current. In this case, you might like to suggest kindly that maybe she can blog about what’s going on with her life and relationships instead. There are limits!

, Once you know exactly how you feel about her blogging about your life and which areas you would prefer she not discuss online, ask her if she could spend some time with you. Choose a time and day when your siblings aren’t in your business or even later in the evening when the younger siblings are in bed.


Tell mom how you feel. Your mom loves you and most likely doesn’t know her blog bothers you. Tell her that you think her blog is funny (or interesting––give her a compliment) but that you feel embarrassed whenever you see a story where you are involved.
Explain your feelings. Tell her that you feel embarrassed or anxiety ridden when you see stories about certain topics because you know your friends’ parents read the blog and tell their kids about it.
Tell your mom where you have concerns about your reputation with employers, peers, professional contacts, etc. She'll understand because every mom wants her child to be successful.

, Instead of just telling mom to stop writing about you, provide her with that list of “off limits” topics created before the talk. Be frank about what would make you comfortable, so that she knows the extent to which she is at liberty to include you in her blog.


Suggest a vetting process for anything she isn't sure about and for images.
Request that she ask your spouse/partner/date before assuming they want to be in her blog. Give an email contact to make it easier.

, Since you're no longer mom’s prime blog muse, give her hand by finding other topics for the blog. If something funny happens at work or college, tell her the story. However, don’t disclose names or personally identifying details, as it's vital to protect the innocent. If it's going to be too obvious, don't give her the material. Other ideas to help her out include:


Scan some of the funny news headlines and send her links.
Send her stories related to her blog topic regularly.
Show her how to set up Google Alerts or a similar service to help her see what's current in her area of interest.
Offer to read over her work if she's concerned that it's not up-to-scratch. Be sure to set a deadline on this though, as she needs to trust her own writing skills sooner rather than later.

Plan in advance.,
Identify the concert and get as much information about it as you can.,
If your parents are unfamiliar with the venue, try to find some pictures of the place to show them.,
Your chances of getting to go to the concert may be better if you buy the ticket yourself, rather than asking your parents to spend the money.,
Know how you're getting to the concert.,
Make it very, very clear to your parents that the person doing the driving will not touch alcohol or drugs on the night of the concert.,
Introduce your parents to the friends you'll be going with.,
If you have a sibling that's older or close to your own age, offer to take them along if it wouldn't completely spoil your evening.,
Going to concerts is a privilege, not a right.,
Your parents may be concerned about the way you're dressed, especially if you're a girl.,
Consider avoiding the ""mosh pit."",
Pick out some things about the band or their music that your parents could appreciate.,
Consider agreeing on a curfew.,
Tell your parents that at the concert, you will carry a cell phone, keep it with you all the time, and check it every hour or so.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Let You Go to a Concert by Yourself," For best results, it's ideal to start at least two weeks before the concert you want to attend is scheduled, and the longer in advance you prepare, the better.;
, Write down (or print out) where the concert is taking place, how much it costs to go, when it is happening, and who is performing.

, The more they know about it, the more comfortable they will feel about you being there.

, However, discuss the concert with your folks before you buy the ticket, because if they say no after you've bought one, then you might be stuck with an expensive ticket you can't even use!

, Get clear written directions if you have never been there before. The important thing is who will be driving you there and back. Your parents will feel better letting you go if the driver is a reliable, respectable person. As a rule of thumb, the older the driver is, the happier your parents will be.

, (Make sure the driver knows this too!) It may seem dorky, but consider asking your parents to drive you. Riding a bus or other public transportation would work well too.

, Try to make sure your friends don't look too scary when they first meet your parents, and get them to act polite.

, You're safer together than you would be alone.

, Your parents may want you to ""earn"" the trip to the concert. So if you don't get along well with your parents, make sure your behavior is very good for at least a week before you mention the concert. Be considerate. Do chores without being asked more than once, say ""please"" and ""thank you,"" smile, and tell them a little about how your day at school was.

, The concert is your time to have fun, but consider choosing an outfit that is reasonably modest and low-key. Your parents don't want you to attract ""the wrong kind of attention."" Remember, the music will be just as good no matter what you're wearing.

, Mosh pits are actually somewhat dangerous, and your parents may not want you near one. Tell your parents you won't go in the mosh pit, and they will be more likely to say yes to the concert. (But don't say it unless you mean it.)

, Play one or two of their more positive songs, tell your parents about the band's great charity work in Africa, and so on. Be truthful, but show the band in the best possible light. Explain why seeing them live is so important to you.

, Again, your parents like to know where you are and what you're up to, and knowing you'll be home at a certain time gives them assurance.

, You won't be able to hear it ring during the show, but you will be able to keep in touch with your family if there is a problem. Call your parents after the concert, when you're leaving to come home.It would be better to text during the concert.

Talk to your parents more often.,
Follow the rules.,
Treat family members with respect.,
Do what you saying you're going to do.,
Show responsibility.,

View your parents as being in the same boat.,
Ask your parents to sit down with you.,

Listen to their concerns.,
Talk about possible solutions.,
Stay calm.,
Accept their decision.,
Bring up the topic at a good time.,
Tell them how you know you will be safe.,
Accept their conditions.,
Try not to whine.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Let You Go Out on Your Own," If you're at a stage where you are wanting to get out more, you may not feel like talking to your parents much. You want to get away from them, not spend more time with them. But if your parents are going to trust you, they need to know who you are as a person. Spend time talking to them each day about what's going on in your life and what interests you.You don't have to talk about the big, serious stuff every day. Talk about the little things. Tell your parents what cool thing you saw today or what made you think.
If you learn to talk about the little stuff, talking about the bigger stuff won't seem like such a big deal.;
, If you want your parents to trust you more, you have to show them that you respect what they say. Obey the rules they set out for you and the household. If you constantly break the rules, your parents are not going to trust you to be out on your own., Being able to go out on your own means you have a certain maturity. Part of being mature is showing respect for the people around you, even when they make you mad. Treat your parents and siblings in a kind manner, and resolve issues without throwing a temper tantrum.For example, say your sister borrows something without asking and breaks it. An immature response would be to yell at her, tell her she's awful, and that she needs to fix it. A mature response would be to confront her calmly. You could say, ""I'd appreciate it if you'd ask to borrow things in the future. That item was really important to me. Would you please help me repair it?""

, One way to build trust is to follow through on your word. If you say you're going to do the dishes, do the dishes. If you say you're going to the library to study, actually go to the library and study. Your parents will notice when you don't follow through, and they'll be less likely to trust you., To get your parents to give you more independence, you need to show that you already have independence. Take responsibility for the things you need to do in your life. For instance, you should do your chores before you're asked by your parents and even take on extra chores that you see need doing.It also means doing things like getting your homework done on time without being nagged by your parents.
You could also volunteer to take care of your siblings so your parents can have a night out or cook dinner as a surprise for your parents.

, Before you sit down with your parents, know exactly what you want from them. Having specifics can help your parents understand what you need, while also giving you a place to start negotiating from.For instance, maybe your specific goal is to be able to go out on Friday nights with your friends.
Alternatively, maybe your goal is to go to the library to study by yourself or to go to the mall with your friends. Maybe your goal is to walk or drive to school by yourself.

, If you view your parents as your enemy or a barrier in the way of what you want, you're going to end up fighting. Instead, think about your parents as being on your side, because they are. Be willing to work with them., If you want your parents to treat you with respect, you have to present your case in a mature and reasonable manner. Choose a good time to sit down and talk to them. In fact, it's better to ask them when would be a good time.If you choose a bad time, your parents probably won't be as able to hear what you have to say.
You could say, ""I'd like to discuss something important with you. When would be a good time for us to sit down together?""

, Once you sit down with your parents, lay out why you wanted to talk to them. Express what you want and why you think you are ready for it. However, make sure to use ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements.For example, you could say, ""I feel like I need more independence. I've been wanting to go out with my friends on Friday nights for a while, but I know you have concerns about it. However, I feel like I'm ready to do some things on my own.""
Using ""I"" statements is better than saying, ""You never let me do anything."" That will just put your parents on their guard.

, When you sit down with your parents, you need to be willing to put yourself in their shoes. Actually listen to what they have to say and try to understand why they feel the way they do.If your parents have been limiting your independence, it's likely because they are worried about your safety.
Let them know you understand what they're feeling. You could say, ""I know you care about me and that's why you don't want me to go out. I know you just want me to be safe, and I'm thankful for that.""

, Once you've heard their concerns, you may be able to come up with solutions together that make both of you happy. Think about ways you can help them be less concerned about you and be willing to compromise.


For example, if your parents are concerned about your safety, ask what you can do that would make them feel better. Maybe you could check in every hour to let them know you're safe. Maybe they'd feel better if they get to meet the people you're going out with. Figure out ways you can both feel better.

, You may get angry at what your parents have to say, and that's okay. You have a right to your feelings. However, you don't have a right to do whatever you want with your feelings. You can say that you're upset, but you should do so in a calm manner. Yelling or arguing will make the situation worse.For example, if your parents don't think you're ready to go out by yourself, you could say, ""I'm sorry to hear that. I feel upset about it. How can I work to gain your trust?""

, If you whine or complain, that's only going to make matters worse, as you're showing you're not mature. If you show maturity in accepting their decision, you may have better luck in the future when you make the request again., Just like when you're having a big, serious discussion, it's best to ask permission to go out at a good time, too. Don't pick a time when your parents are busy making dinner or trying to get out the door. Plan ahead a bit, and ask early. If you don't, your parents may just say ""no"" out of instinct.Instead, pick a time when your parents seem to have time to talk, such as at dinner or when they're relaxing.

, Your parents want to know that you will be safe while you're out, so you need to tell them how you know that will happen. Having details about the event will help calm your parents' fears.For example, you could say, ""I'd like to go to a party at a local club. I know that worries you, but this club is just for kids under 18. They have security guards posted all around the club, and no drugs or alcohol are allowed. The club closes at midnight, and I will come home right after. I'll also be with Jess, Joan, and John, and we will all watch out for each other. I can check in every hour if that makes you feel better.""

, If your parents are willing to let you go, be willing to accept some conditions. For instance, if you're going to a club, they may want to drive you. While you may not like it, you should give a little, so that they feel better about you going. Part of being in a family means meeting each other in the middle.

, If you get a ""no,"" try not to whine about it. Accept it, and move on. If you have maturity in accepting the decision, maybe your parents will have a different answer next time. You can't force your parents to change their minds, and whining will only annoy them.For instance, you could say, ""Even though that upsets me, I understand why you said 'no.' I hope I can prove I'm trustworthy enough to go do something like this in the future.""

Talk over the plan with your friends and your parents.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Travel with Friends," Before talking to your parents, you and your friends should get together and all figure out the details of the trip. The most important part of your trip to figure out is where you are going to go. Even if you already know your destination, make sure you know exactly what region or area you want to visit. If you plan to visit multiple locations, make sure you know exactly where they are and how far apart they are from each other.For instance, even if you know that you want to visit California, you can narrow down your trip to visiting San Francisco and San Jose.
If you and your friends disagree on where to go, try to reach a consensus. If your parents pick up on the fact that you and your friends have different thoughts about the trip, they will be less likely to give their permission.;
, Once you know where you’re going, figure out how long your trip will take, including travel time. Make sure that you and your friends check a calendar and pick the exact dates you will be leaving and coming back.Check in with your friends about their schedules and coordinate a time that works best for everyone.

, Make a comprehensive day-by-day plan that details exactly where you will be throughout your trip. This is especially important if you are visiting multiple cities or countries. You need to know exactly what days you will be in each location. You also should figure out what main activity or activities you will be doing each day.For example, one day in your schedule could be: “Monday, September 12: 3rd day in Mexico City. Visit the Anthropology Museum and the Casa Azul. Eat dinner downtown.”
Hear your friends out and compromise when you are planning your activities.

, Once you know exactly where you’ll be on each day of your trip, you can start to figure out how you will get from place to place. If you are travelling a long distance, you will have to fly to your destination. Then figure out how to get from place to place based on the plans that you laid out. Note the cost of the transportation. Don’t actually buy any tickets, just write down how much a ticket would cost.

, Figure out how where you will stay overnight for each part of the trip. Ask you friends if they know of anyone in the place you are visiting where you could stay. Also check out the prices of hotels and hostels, and write down several options.Aim to be economical, but don’t stay somewhere that isn’t reputable just because it’s cheap.

, Add up the price of your transportation and lodgings. Then add the approximate amount you expect to spend per day on food and souvenirs. Add a little extra in case something comes up. This should give you a good estimate of the cost of the trip., Either type up or write down your itinerary. It should include everything that you have already worked on, and should be organized by day. Each day should include the main activities of the day along with the price of each hotel and method of transport., Make sure that your parents are familiar with your friends before you show them the plan. If they’ve never met your friends, have your friends over for dinner and introduce them. If your parents have already met your friends, invite them to your house a couple times so that they can get more familiar with them and see that they are responsible.

, Don’t spring the trip up out of the blue. Find a good time to sit down and go over your plan with your parents. It may be best to tell your parents that you want to talk about something and ask them when would be convenient for them.It may be best to talk to your parents alone instead of with your friends. Especially if your parents don’t know your friends very well, they may feel more comfortable and willing to agree to the plan if they are talking just with you.

, When you and your parents have sat down, tell them that you want to go on a trip. Let them see that it is something that you are passionate about and have been wanting to do for a long time. Also tell them which friends are coming on the trip with you., After you tell your parents that you want to go on the trip, explain why this trip would benefit you. If your parents have qualms about you going on a trip, they want to know that it’s worthwhile. Don’t mention partying as a reason why you want to go on the trip; instead talk about how it would enrich you as a person.You could say something like, “I really want to go to Spain because I’ve always been curious about my Spanish heritage, and I also want to actually use the Spanish that I’ve learned.”

, Give your parents the physical copy of the itinerary, and run through each day while they are looking at it. Explain your ideas about transportation and lodgings. Also describe the main activities that you are going to be doing on each day of your trip.You want your plan to appear as ordered and thought-out as you can, so present it chronologically instead of skipping around.
Make sure that you mention why each activity you are doing is enriching or beneficial.

, Tell your parents what budget you arrived at. Let them know that it is only an approximate budget, and that it can be worked down. Break down the budget into parts, showing them how much money is going towards transportation, hotels, etc., It’s important to have a back and forth conversation with your parents. After you have gone through the entire plan, ask them what they think. Listen carefully to any questions or concerns that they have. By this time, your parents should see that you have planned thoroughly and thoughtfully, and should be on board. If not, you may have to make a few compromises to arrive at an agreement., The budget may be what is giving your parents pause. If they are worried that the trip will cost too much money, suggest a few ways that you can save money. This includes splitting hotel room costs between your friends, using inexpensive methods of transportation, or shortening your trip.If you have enough money saved up, you offer to pay for a portion of the trip, which will help save your parents money. If you have a lot of money saved up, offer to pay for the whole trip.
You can also suggest postponing the date of the trip so that you can save up money in the meantime.

, Safety might be another concern for your parents. Let them know all the ways in which you will be staying safe. This could include getting vaccines, picking hotels instead of hostels, using various methods to keep your passport and wallet secure, and sticking together with your friends instead of splitting off., Your parents will want a way to communicate with you. Let your parents know that you will always be by your phone when you travel. If your parents want to check in with you every day, suggest a time of day when they can call and see how you’re doing.If you are travelling internationally, see if you can use your phone in the country you’re visiting or if you can rent a phone.

, Your parents may like the fact that you would be traveling alone, but want someone a little older to travel with you. Consider asking an older friend or sibling if they want to join you on the trip. It could give your parents peace of mind if they knew that there was someone older going with you, especially if that person has done travelling before.

, Your parents could simply feel that the place you are traveling to is not safe or suitable. This can be a hard objection to work around. First, give your parents more information about the city or country that you want to visit. Try to see if any of your friends or acquaintances have travelled there, and tell your parents about their experiences.Videos of the city or country work well, because they can give your parents some idea of what the place is actually like.
If you absolutely cannot get them to embrace the place you want to visit, you may have to think about changing your plans to another destination.

, Get your friends and your parents together to talk about any changes that you may have made to your travel plans. It will make your parents feel better to know that everyone is on the same page, and that you and your friends are taking the trip seriously.

Consider why you want to walk home alone.,
Know your situation.,
Develop a talk before having it with your parents.,
Address potential problems.,
Ask to talk to your parents.,
Answer questions maturely and without getting annoyed.,
Ask for a graduated trial.,
Accept your parent's answer.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Walk Home Alone," Most of all, you must feel ready and capable to do so. This includes knowing how to cross roads safely, how to deal with traffic in general and feeling safe in your neighborhood. Understand the dangers that your parents are trying to guard against. Be smart about walking alone, don't just do it to rebel or be cool.;
, Are you truly going alone, or are you going with friends? Think about the reasons as to why your parents won't let you walk alone too, as you'll need to address these in order to convince them that it is safe for you to do so.

, This will allow you to gather your points together and gives you the opportunity to rehearse both the talk and your answers to their potential concerns. If you address the concerns now, you won't be stuttering when they raise them during the talk. Consider the following:


Use your reasons from the previous part to explain why you want to walk home.

, Set out a list of the likely objections and write the solution next to each one. Some examples may include:


Your parents say that it is unsafe to cross the roads by yourself. Tell them that you will only ever cross at pedestrian crossings or traffic lights, that you will never cross a main or busy road anywhere else. Tell them that you know to look both ways and to wait for cars to slow down at crossing points, and to make eye contact with drivers before crossing.
Your parents are worried you might dawdle and spend time on the streets instead of at home. Reassure them that you will walk straight home and that if you want play dates, you'll set these up beforehand so that they know and can confirm it with your friends' parents.
Your parents are worried about strangers. Tell them that you will not have conversations with people, that you will not go anywhere with people you don't know and that you'll avoid anyone showing suspicious behavior you see and report it to your parents or the school. Tell them that you're walking home with a friend.
Your parents are worried that you're not ready yet. Explain to them that you think you are and that having gone through all the possibilities and reasons, this demonstrates you are able to think about it in a responsible way.
You might find other things to bring up, such as the age a sibling first walked home, the fact that you'll be walking with someone or a group or that you don't have to cross any roads, etc. You could also let them track your progress using a smartphone app, or at least make it clear you can be contacted by phone anytime during the walk.

, Choose a time when they're happy to sit down with you and have a chat. Let them know what you would like, namely to walk home by yourself. Explain why you want to walk home, how long it will take, who you are walking with, and any other information that they may need to know.

, They are genuinely trying to determine your readiness and asking questions isn't an outright no yet. Use the preparation you did before the talk to give reasons that cover their objections.

, A parent who remains unconvinced might be okay with letting you walk some of the way, perhaps with a friend for that portion of the walk, then meeting a parent or older sibling for the rest of the way home. This could be gradually extended over time until you're walking all of the way home alone.

, If they say no to begin with, don't fight. They probably need time to think through what you've asked for and just need time. It can be helpful to ask again in a few weeks. Understand that your parents just want you to be safe, they don't want to ruin your life.


Never be immature. If your parents say no, don't throw a tantrum, as in running around screaming, No!

Introduce your parents to your friend's parents.,
Let your parents get to know your friend.,
Call your parents if you want to be taken home.,
Let your parents know how the sleepover went.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Spend the Night," Responsibility means doing the things that need to be done. It also means being honest and reliable. All of this plays into what parents will say when you ask them for a sleepover. If you want to be treated maturely, be mature., Whether you have your parents' trust or not, permission often depends on the night you're planning the sleepover for. If you want to sleepover on a school night, parents are usually unlikely to give you permission. On the other hand, a night during summer vacation will stand a better chance. If you want to increase the chances of getting permission, you should plan to spend the night when there's nothing happening the next day.


Sleepovers are generally harder to get permission for if they're co-ed. Moms and dads can be uncomfortable if boys and girls are sleeping over together, and may have firmer rules depending on their values., It can be very difficult and slow to rebuild if it is broken. In order to have trust between parent and child, you should be talking to them every day. Let them know about everything that's happening in your life. It's good to make this a normal thing for your relationship with them. This will help a lot more than your chances for sleepovers.

, In your case, keeping up with homework and household chores will prove that you deserve to go out and let loose. If there's anything that needs to be done before you ask them make a point of doing it first. Don't let an unfinished chore be used against you when you ask to spend the night.

, As unfair as it may seem, part of what depends on whether your parents give permission is the mood you're in when they ask. If they're already upset about something before you approach, it's almost guaranteed that they will say no. This is because they do not want to deal with any added stress.


One thing you might do is see what you can do to help your parents out before asking. That way, they'll be in a better mood, and you'll have proven yourself deserving in their eyes.

, Asking your parents can be stressful depending on the kind of relationship you have with them, but it needs to be done calmly. Above all else, you need to say it in a way that isn't going to make it sound like a negative interaction. If you go into it with a pessimistic mindset, it's all the more likely your parents will deny you.


It can be good to offer a few details before asking the question. This can help avoid a quick 'no'. Say something like this: ""My friend is having her birthday tomorrow, and wanted to have a pizza sleepover to celebrate. Would it be okay if I went over there and spent the night tomorrow?""
Sitting down next to them while you ask can be a helpful trick, as it will make them feel less rushed in their decision.
If possible, it's a good idea to ask the question a couple of days in advance. Parents are usually more likely to react positively to a request in advance, rather than a last-minute plan.

, If parents are feeling nervous about letting their child out for the evening, giving them all the details will put them at ease.Giving them a run-down of the plans and things they may want to know will be a great help. Being honest and upfront about it will give you the highest chance of getting their permission. Here are some things you should tell them:


Where you'll be staying.
Whether you're planning on leaving your friend's house at some point in the evening.
What kind of parental supervision is expected. This is a big one.
Whether anyone else will be the home. That includes siblings of your friend or other relatives.
What your friend's family situation is like.

, Even if you're going to a sleepover for the sake of having fun, there are a lot of extra benefits to a kid sleeping over. Letting your parents know the benefits can ease them into thinking it's a good thing for your upbringing. Try bringing up some of these if they're having a hard time budging:Children at sleepovers learn new social skills. They have to be flexible in a new environment.
You're going to get a fresh perspective of another family during a sleepover.Try not to make this one sound like you want to escape from your own family!
A child being out of the house gives parents a chance to relax.
Sleepovers can be an enjoyable treat once in a while.

, Ask about the main issue that they're worried about, and ask what can be done to solve it. Keep your focus on finding a solution, rather than letting yourself get angry.


Popping a question about this should be straightforward and calm. Say something like: ""I understand that you may be worried over me going out tonight. What in particular is bothering you? Maybe we can find a way to fix it.""

, Contact info is important, both for the child and the parents. Your parents will want to be able to get a hold of you no matter what. Even if they never call the number it will put them at ease to have a number they can call if they don't hear anything from you.This should be the home phone of the house you're staying at, or the cell number of your friend's parents.


Don't give fake numbers. Even if you manage to make it out this time, messing around with your parents will ruin their trust and your chances for future sleepovers.

, Parents can feel helpless if their child if sleeping somewhere else. If you replan the sleepover to happen at your place, you can stand a chance of making things work. That way, you'll have time with a friend, and your parents will still feel like they're in control.Some parents are automatically against any friends staying the night at their home, so don't take this as a surefire alternative plan.

, It can be risky to ask for a sleepover once you're already there, but impromptu plans do happen. If you want a sneakier approach, you can ask to go over for dinner, as dinners are usually easier to get permission for. After dinner, you can get relaxed and call up your parents to ask. Sometimes, a parent will have an easier time giving permission for something that is already happening. If you choose this however, you should be prepared for disappointment. Some parents won't take kindly to you trying to pull a fast one under their noses.


It's a good idea to pack your sleepover things just in case.
In order for this to work out, your parents will probably have to know the family you're staying with well. It also helps if you have had successful sleepovers at that place before.

, Parents like set plans. Give them a rough idea of when you'll be back. That way, they'll be able to relax for the time being. Set plans are a good thing, as they help to fight stress and worry.


At the same time, you should be flexible with when they can pick you up. A lot of adults have a lot going on throughout their day, so it should be up to them when you are picked up the next day., If you tell them you're going to do something and do something else, you risk ruining trust. Especially if you're not used to spending the night out, it's important to show them you can be trusted.

, Part of your parents' decision depends on what they think of the friend you want to sleepover with. In most cases however, their ultimate concern is your safety. They want to make sure you'll be taken care of. That's where the friend's parents come in. If your parents can put a name to a face, it will set their minds at ease when you ask to sleepover., If your parents don't already know your friend, it's a good idea to put a name to a face. By introducing them, your parents can see that your friend isn't near as bad as they may have feared. Even unruly friends tend to be well-behaved when other parents are around.


Your parents will probably be trying to decide the sort of danger your friend may put your in. If your friend is known to be belligerent and irresponsible, you'll have a very hard time convincing them that it's a good idea to stay the night.

, By taking a leave from your own home, you need to take responsibility for yourself. That includes knowing to leave if you don't want to stay anymore.If you feel sick or don't feel comfortable spending the night anymore, call up your parents. Even if it's late, your parents will probably be happy that you decided to call rather than sit through something unpleasant. If anything, it will prove to them that you can be trusted to call out a bad situation when you see one.

, Keeping your parents up to date with everything will make them feel more at ease. When you're either picked up or get home, talk to your parents a bit about how the sleepover was. What sort of stuff did you get up to? Was it fun? What was your friend's family like to be around? All of these can help show your parents that a sleepover is a healthy activity.


Remember: You don't just want to make this sleepover work. You also want to ensure future sleepovers. Making it a pleasant experience for everyone involved will make sure you have the highest chance of more sleepovers.

Non-judgmentally ask your parents why they feel this way.,
Take some time to consider what they have told you.,
Research autism and its symptoms.,
Rid yourself of any misconceptions.,
Read how autistic people describe their experiences.,
Read about disabilities and conditions that could be mistaken for autism.,
Consider the possibility that you are autistic.",How to Convince Your Father You Are Not Autistic1," Listening closely will help you understand exactly why they have come to this conclusion. If you understand it, then you can be ready to refute it. Here are some questions it may help to ask:


What symptoms have you noticed in me?
What sort of research have you done?;
, Where, exactly, could they be mistaken, and why? Is there any truth to their words? Take some time to think about it.


Could your symptoms be explained by something else? Social anxiety, dyspraxia, avoidant personality disorder, sensory processing disorder, generalized anxiety, and simple introversion may be confused for autism.
Not all sources are reliable. Anti-vaxxers and quacks are known to distort and invent facts, and Autism Speaks (the most prominent autism organization) has an entire boycott movement against it. Your parents may have read misinformation.

, Read the diagnostic criteria, and various articles describing autism. Read how autistic people describe their brains (not only what non-autistics observe in them). Here are some of the general symptoms:


Difficulty with communication (understanding and/or speaking)
Trouble understanding what others are thinking; upsetting them by accident
Fidgeting
Difficulty staying organized and getting things done
Trouble managing emotions
Out-of-sync or lopsided development (e.g. reading long chapter books before learning to ride a bike)
A few extremely passionate interests
Sincerity, literal thinking
Sensory sensitivity, or under-sensitivity (e.g. loud noises hurting you)

, If you spout inaccurate information to your parents, they'll correct you and you'll feel like a fool. You can also correct any misconceptions they may have.


Autistic people do care about others, often quite deeply. However, not all of them know how to show this in ways that others understand.
Autism is not a childhood disability. It is lifelong. There is no ""cure.""
Autism is not limited to white boys. People of all ethnicities, ages, and genders can be autistic.
Autism is not an epidemic. It isn't contagious, the word ""epidemic"" is misleading, and autistic people have many unique gifts to offer the world.
Each autistic person is different. Some need a lot of support, while others go for decades without knowing why they're different. The degree to which they have different symptoms may vary.

, As you read, notice what you relate to, and don't relate to. Keep an open mind.


If you relate to most of the experiences, there's a good chance you're on the spectrum. Because each person is a unique individual, no one relates to every single experience.

, Research each one the way you've approached autism, spending more time on the ones that sound more like you. Consider whether you might have one or more of these instead of autism (or if you have some of these in addition to autism).



Social Anxiety is characterized by overwhelming fear around people, not cluelessness. You might fear judgment and rejection, and have a hard time talking to people whom you don't consider ""safe."" You can make eye contact with ""safe"" people easily, but not others.

Dyspraxia is a movement disability. You might be clumsy, have a hard time in sports, have difficulty with fine motor skills (writing, drawing, cutting food), and hurt yourself more often.

Sensory processing disorder distorts your senses. You may be especially sensitive, or under-sensitive. It often co-occurs with autism, but can occur without it.

Avoidant personality disorder is similar to intense shyness. You might fear people, avoiding new situations for fear of humiliation, be unable to bear criticism, and have no close friends or lovers.

Introversion is a personality trait, not a disorder. If you're quiet because you enjoy solitude and thinking, but don't have many autistic traits, you might only be an introvert.

, If you find yourself relating to a number of the things you read, you could be on the spectrum.


It's possible to have most, but not all, of the common symptoms. It's also possible to not realize right away that you have a symptom (not recognizing that your breakdowns are meltdowns, not realizing that your constant finger-tapping and bouncing is stimming).
Autism isn't an insult. Being autistic wouldn't mean that anything's ""wrong"" with you, or that you should feel ashamed of your brain.
Diagnosis in teen or even adult years is possible. Some people have more obvious symptoms than others.

For instance, you could read the book and then see the movie, to compare differences between film and literature representations. Or you could see the movie as an example of some kind of social problem. (Like how Fight Club deals with male aggression.)

,, Then comes Language, Drugs, and Violence in that order. So don't spend as much time covering language with your parents as sex and nudity!

Be sure that you are certain about your conclusion that you aren't autistic.,
Tell your parent(s) that you'd like to talk to them about something important.,
Explain the research you've done.,
Discuss why you conclude you are not autistic.,
Agree to see a specialist, if all else fails.",How to Convince Your Father You Are Not Autistic2," If you have lingering doubts, you aren't going to argue effectively, and there's a chance you could be wrong. Do your research until you're sure.

, If they are busy at the moment, then you can schedule the conversation for a later time, when they can give you their complete attention. Good times to talk can be...


During a long car ride
While doing chores together (laundry, cooking, cleaning)
After a scheduled event, like supper

, It helps to let your parent(s) know that you've listened to them, taken their concerns seriously, and put thought into your conclusion. This demonstrates maturity, and makes you sound more convincing. For example:


""Mom, I heard what you said about Asperger Syndrome. I was confused, so I researched it. I looked up a variety of autism-related organizations, read the DSM criteria, and read what autistic people had to say.""

, Explain the symptoms that you don't relate to, and the symptoms that could be described by something else.


""I read about autistic people's experiences, and they all sounded so intense. I couldn't relate to their confusion about social situations, meltdowns, or dislike of eye contact. I love meeting people, and it energizes me. It didn't sound like me at all.""
""I don't feel clueless around people. I feel scared. I worry that they're going to judge me. I avoid eye contact with strangers and people who might judge me, which is why I can look my little sister and my friends in the eye, but not Dad or other adults. I researched social anxiety, and this sounded closer to my experiences.""

, While autism specialists aren't perfect, they can offer an educated and authoritative opinion. Your parent(s) are more likely to listen to them.


Be completely honest with the specialist: why your parents think you're autistic, and why you don't agree.
Read Be Ready for an Autism Assessment, adapting the steps to provide evidence that you aren't autistic. For example, reflect on your life to recall anecdotes that provide evidence how you don't have certain symptoms (e.g. your parents' surprise at how independent you are).
Many autism specialists are also therapists, who know how to deal with difficult people. If your parents are refusing to listen, the specialist can help convince them.

Be aware of your parents' knowledge of conventions.,
Be mature.,
Explain why you want to go so badly.,
Explain that conventions aren't for ""weird"" kids.,
Introduce your parents to a friend who also likes anime.,
Work for it.,
Try going only if you're 13 or older.,
Try going with a group.,
If all else fails, just wait until you're older.,
However, if you are able to convince them... Congratulations!",How to Get Your Parents to Let You Go to an Anime Con," Do your parents know what a convention is? Do they have the wrong idea? Perhaps they've seen something like it on TV, and they might think it's a festival of women wearing skimpy outfits and men wearing tights. Tell your parents exactly what a convention is if they don't already know. Make sure they don't have the wrong idea!;
, Just as with asking for anything else, be mature with your parents. Whining, begging, and complaining might lessen your chances of getting what you want.

, If your parents aren't aware that you're an anime fan, let them know. If they are aware, express your desire to go and why it means so much to you. Portray it as an event for you to meet new friends who like the same things as you.

, Tell them that conventions are not for abnormal people, and that perfectly normal people cosplay and go to conventions.

, If your parents meet another person who likes anime, or has been to a convention, they might come to realize that you aren't the only one.

, If it's the money part they're worried about, then pay for it yourself. Find a job, like babysitting or doing chores, to earn money for your convention, and maybe even your costume. This will show your parents that you are mature, responsible, and can work for things you really want.

, If your parents are worried about the appropriateness of the convention, try to wait until you're 13. Also, tell them that skimpy outfits usually only appear in conventions meant for superheroes, not anime.

, If you and a group of friends are planning to go to a con, perhaps having your parents chat with the other parents about it will widen their understanding, and they will be reassured that other parents allow it as well.

, Perhaps by then, you will be living all by yourself, and you can go to as many conventions as you want!

, You now have officially convinced your parents to let you do something, which is not an easy task! Kudos to you.

Accept their decision.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Go on a Trip Without Them," The best way to lay the groundwork for your request is to make sure you’ve been on your best behavior for the days and weeks ahead of time. If you’ve behaved well, your parents will have a more positive view of you and may be more likely to grant your request.


Do well in school.
Obey curfews.
Do your chores.
Don’t talk back to your parents.;
, By showing your parents that you are responsible, they’ll be more likely to trust you on your own in the future. Thus, you should make it your policy to always act responsibly so that you can establish yourself as a responsible person in the eyes of your parents.


Don’t break the law. For example, don’t engage in underage drinking.
Avoid friends who are irresponsible or prone to getting into trouble. For example, if your best friend is constantly breaking curfew or getting arrested, your parents may see you as irresponsible because of the association., In addition to responsibility and good behavior, you need to establish a track record as an honest person with your parents. If you’ve lied in the past, your parents won’t be able to trust that you are presenting them with the complete truth about the trip.


Tell your parents where you go and who you attend events with. If you tell them you’re sleeping over at a friend’s house, but instead you go to a beach party 100 miles away, and they find out, they’ll won’t trust you in the future.
Stay away from what you think are harmless lies. For example, if you’re dating someone who is 3 years older than you, don’t tell your parents that the person is just a grade ahead of you., One of the first things your parents will want to know is the cost of the trip. This is important, as what you think is a reasonable and small expense could break your parents’ budget. Thus, you need to know the total cost and have all the specifics written down before you approach your parents. Some costs to consider include:


Lodging.
Air, train, or other transportation expenses.
Money you’ll need for food and incidentals. For example, if you’re going to a weekend concert in the Adirondacks, you may want to buy a t-shirt. This should be factored in.
Entertainment expenses, like the cost of a ticket to a concert., Before asking your parents about the trip, make sure you know the detailed timeline of the trip. Without a timeline, your parents won’t feel comfortable giving you permission to go on the trip.


Present your parents with a written timeline, detailing when you’ll leave home, when you’ll arrive at your destination, and when you’ll return home.
Be able to answer specific questions about the timeline., After cost, perhaps the most important thing your parents will want to know is who will be in charge. Without an authority figure or chaperone, your parents may be unlikely to allow you to go on the trip.


Establish the chaperone or authority figure as someone who has a good reputation and is trusted. If you’ll be going on a trip with your friend’s family, point out that your friend’s parents are reliable people that your parents have met.
If you’re going to an overnight concert or something similar without an adult, point to the most responsible person as an example of someone who will keep the group grounded. For example, if your friend Alex’s 17-year-old sibling who has already been accepted to Harvard is going, tell your parents.
If your parents don’t know the adults or the group of kids you intend to travel with, they’ll probably be unlikely to let you go., Perhaps the most important way to prepare yourself for the discussion is to make sure you’ve thought about how they will respond. In addition, try to sympathize and emphasize with what you think their initial position will be.


Accept that it is legitimate for your parents to worry about you. After doing this, try to think of ways you can respond to their worries. You may, for example, bring up the fact that your super responsible and successful friend is also going on the trip.
Understand that if you don’t have a good past track record – if you’ve lied, broken curfew, or gotten into trouble – your parents may be very reluctant to grant your request.
Try to think about specific dangers your parents may focus on. For example, if you want to go on a whitewater rafting trip with friends, they may think you’ll fall overboard and hit your head. Anticipate this, research it, and let your parents know you’ve already thought of those problems., Timing is one of the most important factors in getting your parents to agree to your request. Thus, make sure you pick the moment you ask carefully.


Don’t ask right when your parents get home from work. You won’t know the type of mood they’re in. They could have had a bad day.
Try to ask after you’ve done something good or achieved something your parents are proud of. For example, wait until you’ve received your report card that shows you’ve earned all As.
Try to ask during a happy, non-stressful time. For example, you might want to ask during the weekend at a family picnic.
Never ask after you’ve had a fight with your parents or have gotten in trouble for something., You need to be prepared to answer serious questions your parents have about the trip. Without doing proper research, you won't be ready to talk about the trip, and your parents may judge that you are either irresponsible or not serious.


If your parents are concerned because the trip will include boys and girls, let them know that you’ll be chaperoned and there will be separate sleeping arrangements.
If the trip is expensive, and they can’t fund it, be ready to explain how you’ll pay for it. For example, tell them you’ve saved up several hundred dollars from mowing lawns or babysitting, and you’ll use that money.
If your parents are concerned that you’re too young for the type of trip, be ready to respond with examples where you’ve handled a similar level of responsibility., It is really important that you focus on reasons your parents might agree the trip is important, rather than the specific reason you think it is important. Some examples include that:


The trip represents an experience you’ll remember for a lifetime. For example, say something like ""I think that this trip will be a growing experience for me and will be something I look back to for years.""
You’ll be left out and isolated from your friend group if you don’t go.
The trip will be enriching for you. It may be an experience you haven’t had yet. If you’re going camping in Great Smoky Mountains National Park with friends, focus on how you’ll be experiencing and learning about a unique ecosystem.

, A great tactic to use is to promise your parents that you’ll stay in regular contact on your trip. This way, even though they won’t be around, they won’t be constantly wondering about where you are and what you’re doing.


Tell them you’ll call or text them regularly throughout the day. It’s probably best to agree to any contact regimen that they suggest. If they want to talk to you every three hours, you should probably agree.
Assure them you’ll keep your cell phone charged and on you at all times. For example, say ""I promise that I will keep my phone charged and on me at all times.""
Let them know you’ve researched the location and there will be cell phone coverage or some other sort of communication available., After you’ve explained the trip and why it is important, you need to stop talking and allow your parents to respond. Once they’ve started talking, you need to listen to them. This is important, as you won’t know their response without listening.


Don’t cut your parents off.
Listen to them instead of answering the response in your mind while they’re talking.
Pause before you respond to them. For example, count to three in your head before saying anything., Even if you don’t like the outcome of their decision, you need to respond in a mature way. By responding appropriately, you’ll show that you are a mature person and may be able to handle trips on your own in the future.


Don’t become defensive and act is if their questions are a personal attack.
Avoid uttering phrases like “that’s not fair” or “you always say no.”
When responding to a point your parents made, start by saying ""I understand your concern"" and then answer them thoughtfully and respectfully., Once they’ve come to a decision, you should accept it with grace and maturity. By accepting their decision, you’ll show that you deserve trust in the future. Perhaps next time they’ll grant your request.


Assure them that you respect the decision they’ve made.
If they’ve granted your request, thank them and promise them you will keep your word.
If they’ve denied your request, tell them you understand the reasons why, and in the future you hope to better address their concerns.
Don’t try to go on the trip without their decision. If you do, you’ll likely get in a lot of trouble. You may be grounded, lose your allowance, and be denied similar opportunities in the future."

Tell them you want to talk about having a coed sleepover and ask when would be a good time to talk. Respecting their time will show them your maturity and ability to handle a sleepover with boys and girls.Make sure that you choose a good time when your parents are not tired or stressed. For example, if your parents are tired when they get home from work, then that might not be that best time to ask.
Try asking during dinner time or on the weekend when your parents are in a good mood.;
, Don’t dance around the question, mumble, or lie. Just ask your parents about having a coed sleepover in a direct, clear way. The will be more likely to say yes if you ask them in a direct way.


Try saying something like, “I was thinking about having a sleepover, and a couple of my best friends are guys. How would you feel if I had a coed sleepover?”
Also, make sure that your parents know that you are not romantically interested in any of the guys coming over. Try saying something like, “All the guys I am inviting are just my friends. I am not interested in dating any of them.”

, Reassure your parents that you’re aware that they might be worried about the potential for sex, alcohol, or other delinquent activities. Tell them that you will not be taking part in these activities.Try saying something like, “I know that you might be thinking I just want to have a sleepover to fool around with guys, but I just want to have fun with all of my friends, and some of my friends are guys.”

, Make sure that your parents know that you expect them to be around during the sleepover to chaperone you and your friends. This will show them that you do not intend to do anything that they would not want you to be doing.


Try saying something like, “Even though we won’t be doing anything wrong, you can check on us any time you want. You won’t have anything to worry about.”

, Whining may cause your parents to treat you like a kid, so it is important to avoid whining. Act like a mature, young adult by asking your parents about having a coed sleepover in a calm voice.


If it looks like your parents might say no, don’t lose your cool. Continue to speak respectfully and let them finish speaking before you jump in and defend why you want to have a coed sleepover., If you want to host a coed sleepover, make sure that you have all the details they might want. Asking your parents to have a coed sleepover before working through the details may make them think that you’re not mature enough to have a coed sleepover.

Have a time and date available when you ask your parents to have a coed sleepover.
Make a list of all of the people who you want to invite to the sleepover.
Figure out where everyone will sleep. Your best bet is to tell your parents that the girls will sleep in one room and the boys will sleep in a different room.

, Don’t pressure your parents into making a decision right away. They may want to weigh the options of having boys and girls sleep over, so give them space and time to think. Don’t bug them or they might become irritated and just say no.Offer to let them talk to any other parents in the meantime to find out procedural issues

, Do all of your chores and make sure all of your homework is complete so your parents don’t even need to ask. Working in advance to show your maturity is a good idea so your parents don’t have to ask you to do anything.


Do all of your homework in advance so that you don't fall behind on schoolwork.
Offer to help out your parents with things like cleaning, cooking, and running errands.

, If your parents still seem reluctant, then you might consider asking if you can have your girlfriends sleep over and just have the guys come and hang out. Your guy friends could stay until a certain time, such as 10pm, and then head home.


Keep in mind that this will mean that your guy friends will have to arrange to get rides home. Tell all of your guy friends in advance so they can make arrangements for rides.

, Before you invite people over, make sure you identify some clear rules for your guests that your parents will agree on. You and your parents can sit down and make a list of rules beforehand and post the list somewhere visible to your guests. Some things your parents might want you to put on the list might include:


No sharing blankets or sleeping bags.
No kissing.
No sitting on laps.
Girls stay out of the boys bedroom and boys stay out of the girls bedroom.
No leaving the house.

, It will be easier to convince your parents to let you have a sleepover if it’s on a weekend. That way, the sleepover will not interfere with your sleep and make you and your friends tired at school the next day.


Having the sleepover will probably also be easier on your parents too, as long as they have the weekend off of work.
Arrange to have the sleepover on a Friday or Saturday night.

, Late night games like flashlight tag or scavenger hunts are great ways to get everyone involved in the party. As a host or even a guest, you never want anyone to feel left out or bored.


Movies are a safe and easy option for sleepovers. Pick movies that your parents will be okay with you and your friends watching. For example, you might want to stick to PG or PG-13 comedies and adventure movies.
Depending on your age, games like Spin the Bottle or Seven Minutes in Heaven could be perfect to break the ice or make things really awkward.Keep in mind that your parents probably will not approve of these games, so you may want to avoid these.
Video and board games are always a fun option that everyone can get involved in. Put out a stack of board games or set up a game console in your family room.

Give them details about your date.,
Set up a meeting with your date.,

Accept their decision.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Go to Homecoming," Whenever you’re asking your parents for something, choosing the right time is key. You don’t want to approach them when they’re in a bad mood because they’ll be more likely to say no. Instead, try to talk to them when you know that they’re relaxed and happy.Avoid asking your parents when they’re tired or stressed. For example, you don’t want to ask your parents about homecoming when they’ve just gotten home from a tough day at work or when they’re running late in the morning and in a hurry to get out the door.
Try to pay attention to your parents’ moods, so you can choose the right moment. For example, if you notice that they’re always in a good mood after eating a tasty meal, plan to ask them after dinner. If they seem most relaxed after they go for their evening walk, wait until then to talk to them.;
, Before you bring up the topic of homecoming, make sure that your parents know you’re appreciative of the things they allow you to do. If you act like you’re entitled to go to the dance just because you ask, they’re probably not going to let you go. Instead, make it clear that you are grateful for the things that they give you or allow you to do.For example, you might say, “I really appreciate that you trusted me enough to go to Carly’s party last month,” or “It means a lot that you let me go into the city with Kyle and his parents last summer.”

, Your parents are going to want to know all about homecoming before they make a decision about whether you can go. Give them all the information that they’re going to want, such as the date, time, and location of the dance. It’s very important to mention what type of supervision that there will be too, so tell them if teachers and/or parents are going to be chaperoning.You also should tell your parents how you plan to get to and from the dance because they’ll probably worry about transportation.
If there are activities after the dance that you want to attend, such as a party at a friend’s house, be sure to mention that as well. Give the name of your friend and their address, and let them know if their parents will be home.

, If you want to convince your parents to allow you go to homecoming, you should explain why it’s so important to you. You might say that it’s your first year in high school and you really want to have that experience -- or you might say that it’s your last year in high school so it’s your last chance to go. Be honest about why you want to go to help your parents understand.If you’re not sure what to tell your parents, you might say,“I really want to get dressed up and have fun with my friends,” or “I have some friends on the football team and I really want to celebrate with them.” You might even say, “All of my friends are going, and I really feel like I’ll be missing out if I don’t.”

, If you’re excited about homecoming, you’re probably going to want an answer from your parents right away -- but it’s important to be patient. If you demand an answer right away, it’s much more likely that they’re going to say no. Instead, tell them to take some time to think about your request before they make a decision.When you bring up the topic of homecoming, you can make it clear right from the start that you don’t expect an answer right away. You might say, “Don’t say yes or no right away please. Just listen to what I have to say.”
Staying patient can be difficult so you may want to suggest a specific time when you’ll take about homecoming again. You might say, “You should think about this. Why don’t we talk again tomorrow afternoon?”

, If you’re excited about homecoming because a special person asked you to go, it’s important to be honest with your parents about it. You may think that will make them less likely to say yes, but you’ll show maturity if you tell them the truth and don’t try to hide it.If you’re not sure how to tell your parents about your date, keep it simple. You might say, “Someone really special asked me to go to homecoming, and I’m really excited.”

, In most cases, your parents are going to want to know everything they can about your date. Provide as much information as you can, such as their name, grade, and what activities they participate. You might even explain how you two met and what you like so much about the person.Share whatever details you know about your date’s family. Your parents will probably want to know about them too.
Your parents may also want to know what kinds of grades your date gets too, so don’t be caught off-guard by that.
If you have a picture of your date, it can sometimes help to share it with your parents.

, Even if you give your parents all the information about your date, they may still not be ready to allow you to go to homecoming. However, meeting your date in person can often make them feel comfortable. Invite your date over to talk with your parents, so everyone can get to know one another.To take some of the pressure off, make the meeting as casual as possible. You might invite some friends who your parents already know and like over too, so your date doesn’t feel like they’re being interrogated.

, If your parents still aren’t sold on the idea of you going to homecoming with your date, you may need to arrange a meeting for them with your date’s parents. That way, they can discuss details such as transportation and post-homecoming activities, and your parents may feel more comfortable if everyone is on the same page.Having your parents meet your date’s parents also allows them to exchange contact information.

, If your parents don’t seem comfortable letting you go to homecoming, ask them to explain why. They may be concerned about drugs and alcohol, or they may be worried about who’s driving you. Listen to them calmly and patiently, so they have a chance to express themselves.If you're not sure how to start the conversation, you might say, ""I know that you're unsure about homecoming. What are you concerned about?""
It may be difficult, but don’t interrupt your parents when they’re talking. Be respectful and show that you take their concerns seriously.

, Once you know what your parents’ concerns or objections are, you can try to find ways to address them. In most cases, that means being willing to compromise. For example, they might not want you to go to the post-homecoming activities, so agree that you’ll just go to the dance and come straight home. They may be concerned about your transportation for the evening, so you might suggest that they drive you to and from the dance. Find a way to make you and your parents both at least a little bit happy.Another way to compromise with your parents about homecoming is to suggest periodic check-ins over the course of the night. For example, you might agree to text or call when you arrive at the dance, at some point in the middle, and right before you leave. If you’re headed to post-homecoming activities, you can check in again when you arrive at the locale and when you’re on your way home.

, If you behave in a mature, responsible way, your parents are more likely to trust you and allow you to go to homecoming. Make a habit of always obeying your curfew, so they know that you'll be home when you say that you will. If they give you chores around the house, do them without your parents having to remind you. You should also be kind to your siblings, and try to resolve conflicts with them without having your parents intervene.Your performance in school can also help convince your parents to let you go. Work to get good grades so they know that you take your responsibilities seriously.

, If your parents ultimately decide not to allow you to go to homecoming, accept the decision calmly and maturely. Avoid whining or yelling because you didn’t get what you wanted. That will only make your parents angry, so they’re less likely to allow you to attend other events in the future. It can also help convince them that they made the right decision.If you feel yourself getting upset about your parents’ decision, take a moment to count to 10 in your head. That can often help you calm down.

, Things such as good grades, you know a friend who you can go with, etc. If you've thought it through, your parents will see you as mature, and may consider it more thoroughly.

, Maybe things such as it's far away, or expensive. Try to think of ways to overcome them, in case your parents bring them up - Things such as paying for yourself, or getting the bus.

, Make sure they're in a good mood, and preferably that you haven't asked for anything in a long time. Start by pointing out something good you've done recently, or that you rarely ask for anything. Slowly explain what you want to do, and keep calm. Show them your list of reasons, and maybe even offer to pay for your ticket - Or at least pay for some of it, especially if it's very expensive.

, They may say they'll have to think about it, but don't pester them or go on about it - This is a sign of immaturity, and they may think that you're not ready to go to a concert or convention on your own.

, It may take several weeks; do chores around the house without being asked, don't bring up the subject at first and don't yell at them if they tell you no. Just stay calm.

, They may see that you're talking the mature way of looking at it, and change their mind. Alternatively, if you wait a while and it's not brought up again; try writing them a letter. Explain how much you want to go, how you can pay for your ticket and who else would go with you. Leave them letter, and hopefully; their minds will be changed, once everything is perfectly understood.

Form a solid plan for your trip.,
Find examples of other people your age who travel alone.,
Plan what you're going to say.,
Pick the right time and place to talk.,
Be direct.,
Show gratitude.,
Listen to your parent's perspective.,
Avoid arguing.,
Promise to stay in touch.,
Offer to do something in exchange.,
Request your parents take time to think it over.,
Accept a ""No"" for now.",How to Convince Your Parents to Go Somewhere Far Away Without Them," If your parents see you have put a lot of thought into traveling, they're more likely to agree. Spend some time researching where you want to go and make sure you give your parents all the basic information, including practical considerations like cost. If your parents know what they can expect, you can answer any questions and ease any of their anxiety about the situation.For example, say you want to go on a class trip. Get all the information about the trip such as how much money you will need, how you will get there, who will chaperone, how long the trip will be, and where you are staying.
You should also let your parents know what kind of things you'll do. Tell them you plan to be safe when going out and let them know how you'll get around.;
, Your parents may worry about you traveling alone if you're very young. Do you have friends who have taken trips without their parents? Ask them about their experiences and use them as an example. This can help show your parents traveling without them can be a safe, rewarding experience.For example, maybe your best friend went on a trip with their church group. Ask them to tell you a little about their experience and how it benefitted them. Ask how they stayed safe and responsible on the trip. Use this friend's experience to help ease any worries your parents may have about you traveling alone.

, You do not need to plan your speech word-for-word. However, it can be helpful to jot down your thoughts and try to figure out how to best formulate them. You can practice making your request by rehearsing in front of a mirror first. As you may be nervous when asking your parents' permission, it's a good idea to have some idea of what you will say ahead of time., Where and when you talk can increase your likelihood of getting a yes answer. Look for a place free of distractions and talk during a time when your parents are not distracted.Do not try to talk in your living room which is full of electronic devices. Instead, talk in the dining room where it's relatively quiet.
Pick a time when your parents are free. A busy Tuesday night is probably not the best time to talk, but you may be able to catch your parents on a Sunday afternoon.

, Get straight to the point when you ask. Introduce the topic directly and make your case right away. Stop your parents and say something like, ""I wanted to ask you about something.""From there, introduce the topic right away. For instance, say, ""My class is going on at trip out of state this summer and I really want to go too.""

, Your parents will be more likely to agree if you don't come off as entitled. When making your request, make sure to let your parents know how much you appreciate them. If you show off your appreciation, your parents are more likely to feel you truly understand the worth of a vacation.For example, say something like, ""I know how hard you and dad work, and that what I'm asking costs a lot of money. I really, really appreciate all the vacations you have taken me on, because they've taught me the value of traveling. I think this could be a great experience for me.""

, As you expect your parents to hear you out, show them the same respect. Remember, your parents may have genuine questions and concerns about you traveling without them. Calmly hear them out and wait to respond until they're finished.Listening can help you figure out how to reach a potential compromise. If your parents are worried about the money, for example, you can offer to get a part time job to cover some expenses.

, You do not want to argue with your parents, as this can make them less likely to say ""Yes."" Even if you believe their argument is unfair, allow them to make their point without complaining, whining, or being argumentative.For example, do not fire back with something like, ""It isn't fair! Other kids get to go on this trip.""
Instead, say something like, ""I understand you're worried about me being responsible, but is there any way we can compromise?""

, Your parents may be nervous about you traveling without them. They likely want to know where you are and what you're doing at all times. Promising to stay in touch can help them feel more comfortable about you going off on your own.Be specific about how you will stay in touch and how often you will contact them. For example, you can promise to e-mail every and send a text message each night when you get home for the evening.

, Your parents may want you to understand the expenses and responsibilities involved with traveling. You can offer to do something to earn the trip. For example, offer to do extra chores around the house or pay for part of the trip yourself.Try saying something like, ""If you want me to earn the trip, I can definitely do that. I can get a paper route and save up some of the spending money myself.""

, Your parents may be hesitant to give a ""yes"" right away for a variety of reasons. Letting their child travel without them is a big decision. If you push them for an answer prematurely, they may get frustrated and say ""No."" Propose giving them time to think it over.Say something like, ""I can see this is a big deal for you. If you want, I would be happy to give you time to think it over and we can talk later.""

, If your parents still say ""No,"" despite your efforts, accept the answer for now. If they see you are able to accept their decision maturely, they may be more likely to agree to a similar request in the future.For example, say something like, ""I understand you don't want me to go, but thanks for taking the time to listen to me anyway.""

Tell your parents you want to talk to them about dating.,
Communicate clearly with your parents.,
Listen carefully to what your parents have to say, and try to understand their point of view.,
Do not argue!,
Negotiate if you have different expectations for dating than your parents.,
Be prepared for your parents to say no.,
Maintain a good relationship if your parents agree to let you date or if they say no.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Date2," Find a safe and distraction free space where you and your parents can talk. Make sure both of you have time to have a full discussion about dating. Starting the conversation is always the hardest part, but once you get started talking it gets easier.


You can say, ""Mom and dad, can I talk to you about dating? Is there a place we could talk just the three of us?"" You may want to make sure that it is only the three of you talking, if you have siblings, don't discuss dating with them. If there are other people there, they can make the conversation more complicated.

, Be as direct and honest as possible and remember to remain calm. Consider starting off the conversation by saying, ""The reason I want to talk to you about dating is because I am wondering about it and want to talk to you about a few things."" Your parents will probably appreciate that you know what you have thought what you want to talk to them about.


Write down what you want to say to your parents. You can write down all your thoughts and feelings and then circle the main points. After you have your main points rephrase them so that they are clear and direct. Remember to leave space in the conversation for your parents to talk. If your parents interrupt you often, calmly explain that you want to explain each point you are making fully, before the discussion begins. Say, ""I have some things to say, but I want to finish what I want to say before we start discussing it together, is that okay?""

, You might assume that you know their views when you don't know for sure how they feel. Show them that you care about their feelings and concerns. They probably just want the best for you, and may need time to understand that you want to date.


At first you may find it difficult to listen because you are talking about that you really care about. However, if you can focus on what they are saying you will have a much more productive discussion.
If you are unclear about what they are saying or want to show them you understand them, you can reframe what they are saying understanding what they are saying correctly. You can say, “So what you are saying is that…” and re-explain their most important points.

, It is easy to become emotional and irrational when you are talking about things that really matter to you. Arguing will not help you communicate clearly and could end up hurting your chances of getting through to your parents. If you find yourself arguing stop and back away from the topic you are talking about and move on to a more neutral topic of conversation. If your parents start to argue and getting angry, back away from the issue and talk about dating at another time after they have calmed down.

, Negotiations are a process and they might take a few conversations before everything gets worked out. Work to find compromises that make both parties happy.


For example, maybe your parents will be okay with you going out on a group date, even if they don’t want you to go on dates one-on-one, yet. Also, if you are able to respect a compromise you have made with your parents, maybe later they will allow you even more freedom to date.

, Remember, you may initially feel angry, frustrated, or discouraged, and that is okay. Try your best to stay respectful to your parents, even if you feel frustrated. If you need to take some time to yourself go to a quiet place where you can be alone for some time and write in a journal about your feelings, this will help calm you down.


After some time has passed, feel out the situation and decide when/if you should bring dating up again. If you can remain mature and calm through the discussions about dating, this might show your parents that you are more grown up than they realized. If your parents say no it might be negotiable later or it may be completely non-negotiable. Whichever the case, consider spending more time with your parents rather than less. Your first impulse may be to pull away but your parents, however, maintaining a strong relationship with your parents is going to help you in the long run. , Continue to talk to your parents regularly about your relationships, either casually or in a one on one conversation. Set up parent dates where you can go out with your parents and catch up on life and how you are doing.


If you start having problems due to your relationship, have another talk with your parents. This is natural because dating is going to bring up a lot of new situations you need to talk through. Go through the same processes of communication that are described above.
You may have to talk through the same issues several times before you both parties feel good about the situation. Remember, it is a growing process, and working through dating issues in a healthy way may end up strengthening your relationship with your parents and your partner.

Let your parents know what dating means to you, and ask them what dating means to them.,
Explain the who, what, when and where of you and dating.,
Talk to your parents about sex.,
Ask your parents how old/mature they think you should be to date.,
Ask your parents who they would, and would not, be okay with you dating.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Date3," Dating to your parents might mean something very different than what it means to you. If you are both talking about the same thing you will be much more likely to have a productive conversation.


If by dating you mean going out on group dates with your friends on the weekends and being home by ten, your parents may not have a problem with you dating.
If, on the other hand, you want to see, or talk to, the person you are dating every day and go to their house, then you parents will need to know that is what dating means to you.
Telling your parents more about the context of what is going on in your life with dating, it may help them understand you and why you want to date. For example, if many of your friends have been dating for the past four years and you haven't dated yet, you may want to tell them that.

, Going through the details of what dating is going to look like for you will give your parents an idea of what to expect with dating. Talking through the details can clear up any misconceptions about what you want from dating; and it might bring up things that you need to negotiate, like the time you are expected to be home or how you will get home from your date.


If you think that your parents might be okay with you dating the person you are interested in, tell them about what the person you are interested in, how you know that person, and maybe even why you like that person.
Tell them what it will be like when you go on a date. Explain who you will be out with, what you will be doing, where you will be going, how you will get there, and what time you will be home.
If you plan on hanging out with the person you are dating on a frequent or regular basis, let your parents know how that will look. Let them know where you will be expected to be, the adults or people that will be there with you, and how they can contact his/her parents, if something comes up.

, It may feel awkward at first but your parents may respond better than you expected. You may have some false assumptions about how they feel or what they think about sex. You can say, ""I know it is awkward to talk about sex with your parents, but I think it it is important that we talk about sex."" Some parents are going to be okay with you having sex, as long as you use protection and are old or mature enough. Other parents don’t want their children having sex until they are married. And there is a wide range between those two parent types.
Finding out how your parents feel about sex will help you decide how to have the conversation. For example, if your parents do not want you to date because they do not want you to have sex, you may want to think about asking to go on group dates before you ask to go on dates alone.
If your parents are concerned about pregnancy, let them know that you want to be safe. Consider learning more about sexual health by going to sexual health clinic, like Planned Parenthood, or by talking to your doctor about sex. Let your parents know that you are knowledgeable and prepared. If you can talk to your parents about sex in a healthy and informed way, this may show them you have matured more than they realize. If you are not sexually active and do not plan to be sexually active, tell your parents that you have decided you are waiting to have sex! This will probably make your parents relieved, if they are concerned about sex. , Your parents may not have a set answer to this question, which may work out in your favor. You can ask them how you could show that you are ready to date to them. Maybe if you take on more responsibilities or improve your performance in school, they will feel like you are ready to date.


If your parents are concerned about your maturity, make sure you come home when you are supposed to, send them texts telling them where you are, and act responsible about whatever it is that they typically get on you about. Your parents will be more likely to let you date if they see you acting maturely, consistently.
If you are much younger than they want you to be to date, you may want to think about ways you can happily live single while you wait. The link here talks about how to have fun living the single life. If you are close to the age they want you to be, ask them if they are willing to negotiate and let you go on group or family dates.

, This is important information to know, because you may assume that you are allowed to date someone who is out of high school, while your parents think that you should only date people your age. If you don't clear up this confusion, you may end up accidentally upsetting your parents later.


Find out how old your parents think is too old for you to date, or young. Ask them if they have any other specifications of who you are (not) allowed to date.
If your parents are not okay with you dating someone based on gender, skin color, ethnicity, class, ability, appearance etc., this may because some of their attitudes are discriminatory and not about keeping you safe. See step 1.2 for more information about what to do in this scenario.

Find out when your parents have a few minutes to sit down and talk with you about your plans. Be accommodating to their schedules, not your own time.


If your family is usually all together for dinner, that would be a good time to ask. Or if your family does relaxes together on Sunday afternoons, that could be an ideal time to talk.Plan accordingly for big events. If you’re asking about a concert that’s weeks away, don’t wait until the last minute to ask. Parents appreciate preparation, especially when money and transportation will be involved.
Last minute plans usually won’t fly with parents, but sometimes you may be able to get permission to go to a low-profile hangout at a friend’s house if you spring it on them.;
, More than likely your parents will say no to you regardless of the situation of they’re stressed or tired. Wait until any storms blow over and then ask if you can go hang out with friends.


Definitely make sure that you’re not in trouble or grounded before you ask for permission.
You’ll need to work your way out of being grounded before you can expect your parents to let you do anything extra. Cleaning your room is a great way to show that you are mature. Additionally, it shows you can be organized and helpful.
A good time to ask would be when you've finished your homework and chores for the week. Or to sweeten the deal, do all of those things on top of cleaning up after dinner.

, Bugging them incessantly will deter them from wanting to say yes to you. Annoyed parents are less likely to be very giving and you’re more likely to get in trouble if you push them too far. Give them a few days to think about your questions.

, Whatever your plans are, it’s in your best interest to try and plan things around your family’s day to day life. Don’t ask to talk with your parents about serious plans when it’s a busy errand day. Instead, wait until everyone is at home and enjoying the evening so that there is time to discuss your plans.


For example, if you mom is dropping your sister off at soccer practice, you could ask to then be dropped off at the nearby mall since it’s on the way.
Coordinate your plans with your parents’. Try not to ask for extra rides too often and instead think about how you can combine trips around town.
Avoid asking to skip out on family events to go hang out with friends. Overloading your parents will make them less likely to yes in the future.

, Have all of the details ready when your parents have time to talk. The more information you have the better your argument will be.Tell them where you are going, who will be with you, how long you will be gone, and what you will be doing.
Be completely honest the whole time. If you get caught in any sort of lie, you will lose your parents’ trust.
You can’t have too many details. Find out beforehand if you will need transportation, spending money, or reservations if you want to go attend a scheduled event.Start small and work bigger. Before you ask to go on a big week-long trip, try asking to sleep over at a friend’s house for one night first. They may see that you can handle little things and then trust you going out for longer periods of time.

, It might be obvious to you that you don’t want to miss out on the big camping of the year or a super sale at the mall. Your parents on the other hand might not know why it’s a big deal, so be clear when asking them for permission. Explain why this opportunity is exciting for you.If there are educational benefits, make sure and mention them since your parents will want you to succeed in school.

, They care about you and your safety and want what’s best for you. Reassure them that where you are going is safe and that you aren’t foolish enough to do anything dangerous or illegal. Promise to keep a charged cell phone with you and communicate with them periodically while you’re out.


Inform them of any adult chaperones you’ll be with so they know you’ll be looked after.
Even if they already trust you, telling the that you are trustworthy will help strengthen your case.

, Being dramatic and raising your voice are only going to show them that you’re still too immature to go out. You can show excitement, but don’t let that enthusiasm turn into rage if things aren’t going your way. You still have a chance to convince them so don’t blow it by losing your cool.Even if it looks like your parents are going to say no, try your best to not yell, scream, or cry out of frustration.
Don’t threaten or make demands. You won’t be able to convince your parents by threatening to stop doing chores if you can’t go out. You’ll only end up in more trouble.

, After presenting your parents with your plans, let them think. For example you could say, “Thank you for listening to me. If you would like some time to think about your decision I understand.” This will prove to them that you are being patient and mature, even if you just want to go spend some time at a friend’s house playing videogames., Offer to bring your sister or brother along with you if your parents are still unsure about letting you go out. Sometimes having a sibling buffer will convince them that you won’t be misbehaving.


Siblings have the tendency to report back to parents. This can work in your favor when negotiating since parents will be more trusting if a sibling accompanies you.
However, make sure that you do behave if they come along because they still might tattle on you to your parents., Even if your parents say no, you can still benefit. Thank them for talking with you and don’t get angry or yell at them. If you show maturity and understanding even when they say no, it’s possible that the next time you ask for something, they’ll be impressed by your behavior and say yes.

, Make the effort to clean your room and finish any school projects before going to your parents for permission. Don’t give them a reason to question you, just have everything done so they will be impressed with your mature time-management skills.


If you don’t have time before asking, promise that you will have all of your responsibilities done before going out., Chances are your parents will want to know if there will be any adults when you go out with friends. Give them the opportunity to call and talk with the other parents. Showing your parents that you will have supervision will help convince them to let you go out.If you don’t have adults going with you, don’t lie to your parents and say that there are some. They will find out the lie eventually.

, If they've never met the people you want to go out with, they may be wary. Invite your friends over to your house first to let them get to know your parents. That way, when you ask to go out with them, your parents will know and trust who you're with.

, A little groveling or dignified begging can go a long way. While you’re waiting for your parents to give you permission, let them know how much you appreciate them by writing notes or simply telling them. Be on your best behavior helps, but it also doesn’t hurt to do things like bring home flowers for your mom or letting your dad have the last piece of cake.Be subtle and not too obvious. Parents will pick up on lies that you make up about them just to get them to give you something.
Don’t overdo it. Butter up your parents but don’t go so overboard that they think you’re faking it.

, Do extra chores on top of what you’re already expected to do. Wash their cars, mow the lawn before they even ask, or help make dinner for a few nights to get on their good side. Doing their work will let them relax more and they’ll be in a better mood for you to ask and get permission to go out., Thank your parents no matter what they say. Be grateful if they let you go out with friends. If they say no, still thank them. Remember, your parents want you to have fun but they also want what’s best for you overall. Be grateful for their love and protection regardless."

Most states have curfew laws in place.",How to Convince Your Parents to Give You a Later Curfew," If you have to get up as early as 6:00 am on school days, then to get 7 hours of sleep you need to be in bed no later than 10:30 pm. Some say that you're supposed to get 8 hours of sleep, however some teenagers need more sleep than that. While teens want to stay up later, parents may not change your curfew if you can't wake up on-time or without complaining and dragging your feet in the morning. If you wake up easily in the mornings and get ready for the day without complaining 7 hours of sleep is still reasonable. So before you start asking for a later curfew, see whether you still feel well-rested when you get less sleep. Only start asking for a later curfew if you know you can handle it, and you know you will still be getting around 7 hours of sleep.;
, Show your parents that you're responsible enough to handle a later curfew. Chances are, if you've earned a bad reputation for responsibility with your family, they're not going to extend it. If that's you then you may need to work a little harder. That means clean your room, don't talk back, walk the dog, and so on. Getting good grades never hurts either. When your parents ask you to do something, do it without major complaining. Do your homework, do your chores, and most importantly, be responsible with your current curfew! If you don't keep what you have already, they won't be willing to extend it. Being early will really surprise them too!

, However, don't be annoying and don't be rude with it. Instead of asking them every 5 minutes, ask every other night or every once in a while. Also be polite with how you ask. Act mature, and don't whine or complain.

, Instead of saying, ""The curfew I have is really stupid. I'm going to stay up later!"", say something like, ""I think my curfew is a little too early. Could you think about extending it a little?"". If you tell them your going to stay up later, that just proves you're immature and tells your parents you're not ready for a later curfew. Plus, parents are much less likely to agree on something you demand of them. Think about it, if someone came up to you and said, ""Gimme some of your money, I have to buy this!"", would you give them some money? Probably not. But what if they said, ""Can you loan me some money? I promise to pay you back later""?

, If they say no, tell them why you need a later curfew. Reasons could be: 1. I need more time to finish homework/study at night. 2. I'm so busy, I need more time to relax. 3. I think I'm old enough for a later curfew, etc. Also give them reasons why you think you should be able to have a later curfew, like: 1. I think I'm responsible enough. 2. I've been doing much better in school, so I think I an handle it, etc. Don't give them reasons like, ""My friends all have later curfews,"" because this just seems like you're giving in to peer pressure.

, Tell them, ""If you extend my curfew 1 hour, I'll be nice to my sister"". You could do the dishes, do your homework earlier, babysit a younger sibling, or let them lower you're allowance a little. If they say yes, make sure you keep your part of the deal. Show them you're responsible and maybe they won't make you keep your part of the deal.

, If your parents aren't budging try setting a curfew that you are both somewhat happy with. If you want your curfew at 11:00, but your parents want your curfew at 10:00, then go 10:30 for now and show them you're responsible enough to handle it. If you're responsible and show your parents you could handle it eventually they may go ahead and extend it to 11:00.

, If your parents are being impossible and none of these steps are working, then you're going to have to give up at some point. If they say no and mean no, then don't throw a tantrum or give them the silent treatment. Be responsible and mature and show them they've made a mistake. Ask them again in about 2 weeks and see if they've changed their minds, but know when enough is enough.

, This may be one reason why they may not extend your curfew, because they may want you to be safe. They may not want anything bad to happen to you, and most bad things happen outside at night.

, This may also be one reason why your parents may say no, because they could get fined if you are out too late, so make sure the curfew you ask for is not later than the state curfew for your age.

Ask your parents to reconsider.",How to Ask Your Parents to Let You Go to a Concert," Concerts are typically announced well in advance of tickets going on sale. This provides you with plenty of time to demonstrate to your parents that you are deserving and responsible enough to attend the concert. Before tickets go on sale:


Work to improve your grades
Fight less with your brothers and sisters
Do your chores
Help out extra around the house
Keep your room clean
Do your best not to break any of your parents’ rules;
, Concerts are expensive events. In addition to purchasing a ticket, you may have to buy food, pay for transportation, and/or contribute to a hotel room. As a result, most teens can’t cover the cost on their own and require financial help from their parents. You can approach this hurdle in a variety of ways. After the concert is announced:


Start saving money
Find odd jobs around the house or neighborhood
Ask for less from your parents, When you ask your parents if you may attend the concert, they’ll want specific details about the artist, concert, and venue. To prepare for their questions, answer the following questions:


Who/what group is performing?
What type of music does the artist/group perform? Is it appropriate for your age group?
Who listens to their music? Is it mainly people your age?
When is the concert?
Where is the concert? Is it close to your house? Do you need to pay for a hotel room?
What time does the concert start and end?
How expensive is the ticket?
Are your friends going? Will one of their parents serve as the chaperone?Do they sell alcohol at the venue?
Does the venue provide a free parents room?
Are you allowed to bring your cell phone?, Before the tickets go on sale, you need to speak to your parents. Asking about the concert at the “right” time may increase your chances of hearing “yes.”


Talk to them when they are free. “Hi, Mom. Do you have a few minutes to talk?” “Hey, Dad. Are you free right now?”
Avoid asking them about the concert if them seem stressed, distracted, or busy., Asking outright to attend a concert might result in an immediate “no” from your parents. You can soften your request with a few kind, appreciative words.


“Thank you for working so hard to provide for me.”
”I really appreciate everything you do for me.”
I am grateful for all of the opportunities you’ve given me.”, Once you’ve told them how much you appreciate them, it is time to mention the concert. Provide your parents with the basic information:


Who is performing?
Where is the concert
When is the concert
What time is the concert
How much will it cost
”My favorite artist, ____, is performing in ____ on ____. The concert starts at ____ and ends at ____. Tickets cost ____.”

, The goal of this talk is to get permission from your parents. Instead of telling them you are going, ask them if you may go.


”May I go to the concert, please?”

, Before your parents say “yes” or “no,” they may ask you questions about the concert. As you answer their questions, remain respectful and calm. Don’t get defensive.


Let them know if your friends are planning to attend.
Let them know if someone is chaperoning.
Tell them more about the artist/group and the music.
Explain how you plan to pay for the concert.
Let them know if there is a designated “parents room” at the venue.

, Your parents may be reluctant or unable to pay for the concert. You can overcome this obstacle by:


Offering to pay for part or all of the cost
Offering to do work around the house in exchange for money towards the concert
Asking for a loan from your parents
Asking for the ticket for a holiday or your birthday present, Did you intended to go to the concert without a chaperone? The thought of you at a concert without an adult might make your parents uncomfortable. Rather than insisting you are old enough, mature enough, and responsible enough to go to a concert without an adult, present them with a few alternative solutions. Suitable options might include:


An older sibling or cousin
Your parents or a friend’s parents
A trusted babysitter or nanny, At the end your conversation, your parents may say “no” to the concert. Rather than throwing a fit, remain calm, cool, and collected. Ask them to spend some time thinking about it. In a few days, ask if they’ve reached a decision.


While you wait for them to decide, remain on your best behavior."

Dress appropriately for the occasion.,
Wear clothing that aligns with your personality.,
Choose an ideal dating venue.",How to Win a Guy over on the First Date1," This may help you feel more at ease and comfortable, which will appear more attractive to your date. For example, if you are attending a sporting event with your date, you may feel more comfortable wearing jeans and comfortable walking shoes as opposed to a cocktail dress and high-heels.;
, This will help your date learn more about your tastes and personality as he gets to know you. You will most likely feel more confident in clothes that you enjoy wearing.


Select your favorite outfit that accentuates your best features to help you feel more confident. For example, you may want to wear a color or outfit that you consistently receive compliments on.







, Selecting the right activity or location for your date will set the appropriate tone for your experience together.


Select a location that will allow both of you to talk and get to know each other; such as a lounge or a restaurant with an upbeat atmosphere. You may not want to visit a movie theater that requires you both to be quiet and prevents you from learning about each other.






Choose a location that won't put any strain or pressure on getting to know each other. For example, you may want to refrain from meeting in a quiet library where conversation is forced, or from visiting a dance club in which the music is too loud to hear one another.

"
"
Keep your conversational topics neutral.,
Direct your conversation to topics that are upbeat and positive.,
Ask your date questions he has never been asked before.,
Practice active listening techniques.,
Use body language to convey your interest in him.",How to Win a Guy over on the First Date2," This will allow you to become more comfortable with your date until you get to know each other better, and prevent him from becoming turned off immediately if you disagree on important topics.


Talk about fun, neutral topics such as movies you enjoy, vacations you have taken, or other types of funny, entertaining stories. Refrain from talking about topics that may initiate a debate; such as politics or religious and spiritual beliefs that he may strongly disagree with.







, This will help set an overall positive and fun tone for your date.


Talk about your ambitions and dreams without speaking of marriage or future children. These topics may make your date feel uncomfortable, pressured, or rushed into having a relationship with you.






Refrain from complaining about things in life that upset you and from talking about ex-boyfriends or ex-spouses. Negative topics or discussions may not be fun for your date or engender enough excitement that will motivate him to ask you out a second time.

, This may make you look unique and cause you to stand out from every other date he has had in the past.


Ask him about specific interests of his that you may have noticed, instead of asking questions about topics that may seem general; such as his profession or the type of car he drives. For example, if he is wearing a t-shirt with a band logo, ask him if he likes the band, or where he obtained the t-shirt.







, This will show your date that you are genuinely interested in him and what he is saying.


Ask him questions in response to what he is sharing with you. For example, if he talks about how much he enjoys attending baseball games, ask him where and when he attended his first game and what his favorite teams are.







, Non-verbal cues may indicate to your date that you are genuinely enjoying his company.


Express subtle flirtations by leaning forward as he is talking to you, playing with your hair, crossing your legs, or blinking your eyes slowly. These types of gestures may excite him without coming across as too aggressive or overbearing.

Get a weekend job if you’re old enough.,
Stay truthful and abide by your parent’s rules.,
Improve in school in exchange for dating privileges.",How to Convince Your Parents That You Are Old Enough to Date1," If your parents have to constantly remind you to do your chores, they may not think that you’re responsible enough to start going on dates. When you’re dating, it’s important that you make responsible decisions and prioritize what’s important, because the choices you make when you’re young can impact the rest of your life.Maintaining a clean room and helping with the dishes or laundry is a great way to get on your parent’s good side.
Taking care of a household pet by walking it or feeding it is another way to show you’re responsible.;
, Some parents believe that dating is a distraction from school. If your aren’t maintaining good grades, then this may be the reason you’re not allowed to date. Social factors actually do affect academic performance, so stay on top of your studies.Make sure to not skip class and do your homework so you can maintain a good GPA.


Put school as a priority over your social life, if you’re struggling with your grades.
Get a good night's rest before you have to go to school, so you’re sharp during the school day.
If you’re still having trouble with a subject, consider getting a tutor to help you.

, Even though it may feel frustrating that you can’t date, it’s important that you keep your cool. Don’t yell or say hurtful things to your parents or other family members.


If you have younger siblings, make sure to be a role model and don’t bully them.
If you feel yourself getting mad, take a step back and revisit the conversation later.
Being more kind will not only be appreciated by your family, it will also make you feel better emotionally., If you’re working and can afford to buy your own things, this will be a sign to your parents that you’re old enough to date.

Look at online job boards to see local openings.
Talk to your parents about your desire to get a job before you start applying.
Remember to figure out reliable transportation to and from your job.

, If you can’t follow your parent’s rules while they are around, it’s unlikely that they will trust you.

, A good way to negotiate with your parents, and show them that you’re mature, is to offer them something in return for the ability to go on dates. Set a goal you know is achievable and say “I will raise my grade in science, if you let me date.”


It might take a long time for your parents to see results in your grades. Have patience and bring it up during report card time.
If you keep getting in trouble in school, promise to improve your behavior and aim to be more respectful to teachers and other students.
You can improve other things in exchange for dating privileges, such as promising to wake up for school on time or being nicer to your brothers and sisters.
You can’t just do something positive once and then forget about it. If you want to be able to date, you need to maintain it over the long run.

Cell phone - No, not so you can receive an ""emergency"" call in case you need to beat a hasty retreat.,
Texture - Here’s a top tip from friend-boys: wear something soft and touchable — a velvet top, angora sweater, silky pants.,
Breath mints - Specifically those cool, paper-thin strips that look like plastic but magically melt in your mouth.,
Discretion - Do not mention dud dates, evil exes or lingering loneliness.,
Perspective - Though having a string of unappealing dates can be wearing, it’s almost never a waste of time.",How to Succeed on a First Date," That trick predates the rotary phone; it's insulting and frankly unnecessary. Why? Sure, some first dates are worthy of quick escapes, but that's why you plan them to be brief in the first place. Just a drink or coffee before the next thing on your schedule. A first date does not merit a five-course meal or even a dinner and a movie. You like him, you hope for a second, open-ended date; you don't like him, you'll live through one latte. Wait, then what's the cell phone for? To call your best friend with a report from the ladies' room. No matter how the date is going, checking in for a giggle moment makes the date fun, no matter what. And isn't that kind of the point of this whole dating thing?;
, Drives 'em nuts, but let them wait until Date #2 before they actually get to touch.

, Win-win-win-win: They're (a) strong enough to combat even the fiercest garlic attack, (b) a great topic for a lagging conversation, (c) a perfect ""conversation piece"" if your date has breath issues, and (d) a potentially sassy flirting move (""Gee, isn't that a wild feeling on your tongue?"").

, Not one word. Positivity — even a little mystery — is the better part of valor.

, For one thing, the worst that can happen is a good story (see Tip #1). And at this stage of the dating game, you should be most interested in quantity; you have to go on lots of first dates so that your judgment and perspective remain intact, so that you don't overrate someone's appeal by thinking ""He's the one! when in fact he’s only the one who called! For now, quantity begets quality. Each date, no matter how taxing, counts. So even the worst first date gets you one step closer to the best!

Set limits on the time you spend with the person you’re dating.,
Ask your parents if you can go on date during the daytime.,
Go to a public place for your date.,
Go out on group dates instead of individual ones.,
Text your parents every hour to let them know you’re okay.,
Ask your parents if they can drive you to the date.",How to Convince Your Parents That You Are Old Enough to Date2," Your parents might be worried that you’ll be coming home too late if you are dating.Make sure to negotiate a reasonable curfew with them to ease their minds at the prospect of dating.


Don’t bring up the conversation after you’ve come home late.
You can say “I’m going out, but my homework is done and I promise to be home by 9 p.m.”
If you’ve broken curfew in the past, the only way to build trust back is to stick to it in the future.

, One of the greatest fears for many parents is that their children will become physically intimate too early in life. Talk to your parents about what is acceptable under their rules in regards to kissing, holding hands, and sex. Assure them that you’re responsible enough to make the right decisions, and ask them any questions you might have. Don’t rely on TV, the internet, or friends for advice around this because the advice they give can often be inaccurate or misguided.You can say “I know you’re worried about me getting physical with someone, but I’m way too young for that and I think it’s gross. I just like this person and want to spend time with them.”
If you talk to your parents about physical boundaries and show that you agree with them, they may allow you to date.
Don’t just talk about sticking to the rules, make it a point to prove it to them through actions over time.

, If your parents think that dating someone will occupy too much of your time and take your focus off studies, then make sure to have an in depth conversation with them about setting limits. Stick to the limitations you set yourself by getting off the phone early, or only agreeing to go on one date a week. If your parents say “I don’t want you dating because it’ll take too much time from your studies,” respond by saying “I have some free social time each week, and I’ll make sure not to monopolize my time with this person. I just want to go out and have a good time, but my responsibilities and school is my top priority.”


You can start by setting limits on how much you talk or socialize with your friends to prove to your parents that you can do it.
Remember to discuss this with the person you’re dating as well.

, Your parents may not like the idea of you being out late, and this could be a reason why they prevent you from dating. Instead of going on a date later in the night, try asking them if it’s okay that you go to the park or museum during the day.


It’s easier to go on daytime dates during the weekend, when you don't have school.
Other daytime date ideas include the mall, a matinee, a hike, or a trip to a community garden.

, Going to a public place for your date is not only more fun, but it will ease parental concerns about intimacy between you and your date. If your parents are restricting you from dating because you’ll be alone with the person, reassure them by telling them you’re going to a public place and won’t have time or space to be alone.


If your parents say “I don’t want you alone with them,” you can respond by saying “We will be in a public place the entire time, and won’t have to be alone in a room unsupervised. I’m just trying to have fun with this person, not be physical.”
Being alone with your date in their room or house unsupervised may bring up concerns about sex.
A music concert, a play, or amusement park are a ton of fun and in public places.

, Hanging out with a bunch of friends doesn’t seem as serious as an exclusive date, but you’ll still have the opportunity to spend time with the person you like.


You can all go to the movies, a restaurant to eat, or to the bowling alley.
Going out with friends you’ve made in the past will make your parents feel more comfortable.

, Although it may be tedious and embarrassing, this is a good way to compromise with your parents. Once they start letting you go on dates, you can have a conversation about limiting the texting.


Say “I want to go on a date, but I promise to keep you informed and in the loop so you know everything is okay.”
The more that you go out without parental supervision, the more that they will trust that you can handle yourself.

, Some parents don’t like the idea of their child in the car with an inexperienced driver.Other parents may not believe that you’re telling the truth about your destination, so they will prevent you from catching a ride with your friend. A great way to get around this is to have them drive you and pick you up on the date.


Allowing your parents to drive you will ease their mind about where you’re going, or what you’re doing.
If your parents can’t or won’t drive, ask them if it’s okay for another parent to drive you.

Make sure this person is worth introducing to your parents.,
Talk about your date before you introduce them to your parents.,
Introduce your potential date as a friend at first.,
Prepare your date for your parents possible reactions.",How to Convince Your Parents That You Are Old Enough to Date3," If you’ve had trouble convincing your parents to let you date, you want the first person you introduce to them to be worth it. Think hard about how much you like this person and if it’s worth it to try to date them. If you think you’d be embarrassed by them, it’s a good sign they aren’t the right one.


Being able to move on from a person you know isn’t the right fit is a sign of maturity.
Make sure that you want to date the person, instead of being infatuated with the idea of being in a relationship.

, You can subconsciously make a good impression on your potential date before your parents even have a chance to meet them.Talk about your date’s achievements and other things that are positive about them.


Try to think about what your parents like. If they like good grades, saying something like “I know this person in school, and they are great at math and English.”
Don’t talk about your date getting in trouble or doing bad things.

, Your parents might be more accepting to you dating a person that they know and trust. Dating a friend will also show your parents that you actually like the person, instead of just being obsessed with the idea of dating.


Introducing your future date among a group of friends is a good way to start off.
Introducing your date at a public place may ease tensions., If your parents are stern and overprotective, it’s a good idea to let your date know so they can prepare themselves. Never surprise your date with an unexpected meeting from your family because it could damage the relationship.


You can put your date’s mind at ease by saying “This may not go well, but I’ll still like you and want to date you, even if their reactions are bad.”
If the introduction goes badly, make sure to call your date later that night.

Give them a reason to say yes.",How to Convince Your Parents to Drive You to Places1," Sometimes, you need your parents to drive you somewhere for a school or club related reason. Your parents might be more willing to drive to these events since the events will better you in some way.


If you need your parents to drive you to school for a meeting, concert, or club meeting, explain to them that it is school-related. Tell them that you have a band concert or a drama club meeting. Most parents will be happy you are involved in extra-curricular activities and want to support you. If you need to go to the library to meet with your classmates for a group project, make sure your parents understand the ride is for a graded assignment.
If you need a ride to sports practice, let them know. Explain to them that you have practice and need a ride to practice and games.;
, If your parents are unwilling to take you despite your explanation, emphasize how important it is that you go. Sometimes, letting your parents know how important something is to you can be very persuasive.


If you need to go to a friend's house to study, tell your parents you are afraid you will fail the science test if you don't borrow your friend's notes and have them explain the concepts to you.
If you need to go to practice, explain that missing practice can result in you getting kicked off the team, out of the play, or not being able to perform in the concert.

, If you have many after school activities or sports commitments, provide your parents with a schedule. This schedule should list days you have practice or meetings, the times you will need to be dropped off and picked up, and the locations. Giving your parents a schedule allows them to plan ahead for your rides, so you are not springing requests for rides on them all the time.

, Sometimes you might just want your parents to drive you to the store for a new game, or to a friend's house to spend the night. You don't have a pressing need to go, and your school work or place on the team isn't a factor. If this is the situation, ask your parents politely. Being mature, respectful, and polite instead of bratty, whiny, and demanding will yield better results for you.

, If your parents say no, don't lose your temper. Getting emotional, acting upset, and yelling are some of the least persuasive techniques.This could make your parents angry and make them believe you are a not mature.


Refrain from accusing your parents of being unfair. If you believe they are being unfair, then calmly talk to them about it. Accusations, anger, or tears will make your goal of getting a ride more difficult.

, When you approach your parents, make sure you do it at the right time. Don't talk to them right after they've walked into the door from work, don't ask them when they're rushed, and avoid asking them when they're stressed or in a bad mood. Choosing these times could result in you getting an answer of no, which may have nothing to do with you.Instead, ask them when they have time and everyone is relaxed.


One suggestion is to ask you parents if they have time to talk to you. Ask, ""Mom, got a minute?"" or ""Dad, can I ask you a question?""
Another good option is to ask them over family dinner. Since everyone is sitting at the table for a meal, you have some time to discuss your request, and everyone should be relaxed and in a good mood.

, Demanding your parents do something for you is a recipe for disaster. Instead, express your appreciation for what they do. Don't limit the appreciation just to what they do for you when you ask. Thank them for the things they do without you asking, like cooking dinner every night, driving you to school, and buying your school clothes.


Make sure you are sincere in your gratitude and appreciation. Don't be sarcastic or fake. Your parents will probably be able to see through that, and that might make them mad.
Try saying, ""I know you already take me to and pick me up from school, which I really appreciate. It's so much better than taking the bus"" or ""I really appreciate you taking the time after work to drive me to baseball practice. I love playing baseball, and I appreciate you driving me."" Letting your parents know they are appreciated can go a long way. It may also help you obtain whatever you ask for afterwards., Instead of demanding an answer on the spot, let your parents think about it. Maybe they have to check their schedules, see if they can rearrange some appointments, or something else. Other parents may just want to make a rational decision that they've fully thought about. Rushing your parents may irritate them and cause them to say no.Suggest that they not answer right away. Say, ""Don't answer right away, but I was wondering..."" or ""I want you to think about this before you answer.""

, If you have two parents, approach the one that you feel closest too or who you think might be more likely to agree. Present your case to this parent, and see what happens.


If your parents have said no, go talk to one of your parents. Ask them to explain why they said no. Then, ask if there is something you can do to change their mind to yes. Maybe try to gently explain your case again, focusing on why it's so important to you.
Just remember, don't try to play your parents against one another. This could end very badly for you.

, Remember that your parents are very busy people, with jobs, obligations, and many times other children. Maybe the reason they said no isn't because they don't want you to go or because they can't take you, but because they don't have time.

, Continue asking your parents for rides. Each time you ask, remember to be calm and respectful. Just because they can't take you to your friend's house this week doesn't mean they won't be able to next week.


Don't annoy them. If they have said they won't take you to the store, don't badger them. This can just annoy them and make them never to want to take you anywhere.

, Think about whether or not you deserve your parents to drive you. Have you been good? Have you been respectful and minded your parents, or have you acted out and caused undue stress on them? Have you completed your chores, done your homework, and done your best in school? Think about your parents driving you as a reward for being good. Your parents may take that into consideration when making their decision.

Propose to do a favor in return.,
Do something nice before you ask.,
Offer to pay for gas.,
Suggest a carpool.,
Compromise.",How to Convince Your Parents to Drive You to Places2," Make a deal with your parents. Tell them that if they drive you to the store, you will wash the dishes after dinner. Since they are taking time out of their day to drive you, offer to do something that will give them one less thing to do that day.Offer to do the favors ahead of time. If you want them to drive you to the dance Friday night, offer to do laundry on Thursday so they know your word is good.

, It might not hurt to butter your parents up a little bit. Clean your room, complete your homework, or vacuum before you ask them for a ride. This might help you get on their good side and show them that you really want to go.


By completing chores and schoolwork before asking, you put yourself at an advantage. If you ask your parents to drive you somewhere and they ask, ""Is your homework done?"" or ""Have you cleaned your room?"", you can say yes.

, If the gas money is an issue, offer to pay for the gas. Use your allowance or money from your paper route to cover it. This shows you are responsible and willing to share some of the responsibility for the ride.


Don't offer to pay them for the ride. This might be seen as a bribe or make them feel like a taxi service, which is not what you want.

, If you are trying to get rides to frequent events, like practice, meetings, or rehearsal, suggest setting up a carpool. Have your parents come together with a few other friends' parents. Decide on a carpool schedule that benefits everyone. That way, you get rides to all the things you need, your parents give you a ride, but the responsibility is spread among multiple people.

, One of the best bargaining strategies is compromise. Maybe your parents can't take you to the movies this week, but they can next week. It's not exactly what you want, but it's not a no. Your parents are still willing to give you a ride. Accept that gratefully.


Another compromise might be deciding on which ride to take. If you need to go to practice, the store, your friend's house, and the movies, your parents might not have time to take you to all those places. If your parents offer to take you to practice and one other thing, then compromise with them.

Determine if one parent will stay at home to raise the baby or if both parents will continue to work. Many couples have already had this talk before they conceived. Some couples with lower paying jobs may not have the option of taking time off from work. Other couples may decide that even though they need both salaries, it may not be worth it for both parents to work because of the high cost of child care. Determine what your financial needs are and what your best route is for meeting your financial demands.;
, It is a good idea to start paying off your debt while you are pregnant so that you are not faced with financial burden and added stress when the baby is born. It is even better if you can start paying down debt before you conceive.


Pay off student loans, car loans, and credit cards. Some financial experts recommend first paying off your biggest debt to start chopping away at the high interest of the large loan. Others believe it is best to pay off your smallest debt first to eliminate one bill entirely. Determine which method works for you and make the payments.






Put away enough cash equal to three months of living expenses.
Instead of buying a new car for your baby, put that money away for other important things. Just because you are having a new baby does not necessarily mean you need a bigger car. As long as you have a backseat big enough for a car seat, you should be fine.

, Instead of spending up to $100 a month on baby formula, take advantage of the fact that you can provide free food to your baby. Some new moms want to purchase nursing gear, but you should be aware that there are places that provide free support to new breast feeding moms, such as The La Leche League. Many hospitals and birthing centers rent out breast pumps to nursing mothers. Depending on the type of pump you need and how long you need it, the cost of renting can be as much as half the cost of purchasing your own breast pump.

, It is important to make sure your family is taken care of if something should happen to you. New parents need to prepare for the worst and have a will specifying where they want their assets to go in the event of their death. They also need to specify who they want taking care of their child in the event something were to happen to both parents.


To be extra safe, new parents may also want to think about taking out life insurance and possibly setting up a trust for their children. A trust can be important because it specifies what you want to leave your children if something should happen to you before they turn 18. This can be a tedious process, but the reward in knowing that your family is taken care of is worth it in the end.







, Just because you are trying to save money doesn’t mean you shouldn’t treat yourself to that really nice rocking chair you’ve had your eye on, or that prenatal massage you’ve been wanting. It can be really worth it to do something for yourself and get something you want, so budget for those extras.

, There are so many new and unnecessary products out there being marketed to new parents. It can be tempting to spend money on these products, but most of them are things that babies do not need, like satin crib sheets. This is why it is important to ask yourself how long these products have been around. If you lived without prenatal learning systems when you were a baby, chances are your baby can do without it as well.

, Just because you are having a new baby doesn’t mean you need a new car or a new house. You don’t necessarily have to have a bigger house or a bigger car right away. Children can share a room for a while when they are small. It can also save a lot of money to buy secondhand toys and clothes. Children grow out of things so quickly that buying secondhand can make a lot of sense.

, During the pregnancy, it can be very tempting to buy all kinds of new baby gear. However, when the baby is born, parents can find that a lot of the things they bought do not suit their baby. Just buying the necessary items at first, such as a car seat and a crib, can help save money. Buy things that fit your baby’s size and temperament after the baby is born.

, It is very important to know what policies your workplace has when it comes to maternity or paternity leave. You don’t want to be surprised that these leaves can come with no pay or a reduction in pay. This also means checking your health insurance coverage for the pregnancy as well as baby checkups. It also can’t hurt to take a look at your company’s long term disability plans and life insurance options.

, It can be helpful to start a savings account before having a baby to help make the financial transition into parenthood easier. This way you will have some money to fall back on if you find it hard to adjust to the new costs of an expanded family.

, It is important to try to cut your budget in half for a month to see if you can make the financial adjustments necessary to have a child. Also, if one parent is thinking of quitting work and staying home with the baby, it can be important to try to live on one income before the baby arrives. This can help you see the extra expenses you will have to cut or change once the baby arrives.

, Sometimes you may have to do things you never thought you would once you have a child. Some single parents have to move back in with their parents for a while when having a new baby. It can also mean staying in that apartment a little longer if it fits your budget instead of buying that new house you want.

, Wear clothing that is eye-catching and complements your figure. Choose an outfit that is appropriate for the venue where you’re meeting for your date. If you’re going to the opera, for instance, break out the fitted suit or evening dress, or wear neatly pressed khakis. A simple button-down shirt or a tasteful skirt and blouse will look great if you’re going somewhere more casual. Your clothing choices should be stylish yet comfortable so that you can look and feel your best all evening long.There’s no need to dress to the nines for a light lunch or a coffee meetup. Dress for the specific occasion so that you can show that you’re ready for any situation.
Wear some color. Research suggests that clothing yourself in bright colors can give you the appearance of boldness and vibrancy., After you’ve cleaned yourself up and selected the perfect outfit, take a last look to ensure that the rest of your appearance is in order. Style your hair to make it neat and attractive. Trim your fingernails if they’re too long, or paint them to be more eye-catching. And, of course, remember to put on deodorant before you head out the door.Assume that every detail of your appearance will be noticed. That way, you won’t miss anything when getting ready.
Feel free to spritz on a subtle scent before your date, but go easy. Too much cologne or perfume can be overpowering.

, Be prepared to do a lot of smiling. If you’re nervous or feeling uncomfortable, don’t let it show. Instead, keep smiling and act natural. Not only will smiling make you more attractive to your date, it can improve your own mood, as well.Smiling displays positivity and trustworthiness, and tells people that you’re fun to be around.
If you’re nervous before or during the date, smiling can help keep you at ease.

, For your first date, plan an activity in which you can both get involved, rather than just sitting and staring at each other while trying to make conversation. Dinner and/or a movie is a time-honored option, but there are dozens of others: go for a long walk outside, try a new bar or restaurant, get tickets to a sporting event or find a quiet place to sit and watch the sun set.It’s a lot of pressure to try to sit and talk for hours with someone you just met. Attending events or participating in fun activities together will help you both loosen up, and you can reserve some time afterward to have some one-on-one interaction.
The date will also be more memorable if you have something out of the ordinary planned.

, Make sure you’re there when you say you’re going to be. Call your date to confirm whether you’re to meet them at a previously agreed upon location or swinging by to pick them up. Give yourself plenty of time to take care of last minute tasks before you have to leave. Punctuality is an extremely important quality, as it shows that you’re reliable and can be taken at your word. Showing up late is a surefire way to ruin a good first impression.Be a little early, if you can. Not only will it demonstrate that you’re taking the date seriously, it can also give you a chance to get comfortable with the setting and mentally prepare for your introduction.

, In addition to simply acting friendly, show your date that you’re a gentleman (or a lady) by being considerate. Guys should hold open doors, pull out chairs and offer to pick up the check, if it pleases the girl. Both people should practice good manners when eating and speaking to keep from making the other uncomfortable.Common courtesy is a must, but it may be off-putting to some people to have things done for them. See how your date reacts to little gestures before forcing more of this kind of behavior on them.

, Ask your date questions about themselves to find out more about them, but don’t confine your topics to just work, hobbies and personal beliefs. Inquire about their family, pets, favorite music and places they like to vacation. Be enthusiastic about getting to know them. You might pose questions sure to capture their imagination, like ""what's the most interesting thing about you?"" or ""if you only had one day to live, what would you do?"" Treat your date like a date, not a job interview.You don’t want your date to feel like they’re being interrogated. Be careful about asking them point-blank questions about their preferences or hangups.Assume that your date doesn’t want to talk about work stresses or past relationships; find something unique to talk about.

, Give your undivided attention to your date so that they know you’ve taken a genuine interest in them and what they have to say. Maintain eye contact when talking, and nod or make small verbal confirmations like “mmhm” and “I agree” to signal that you’re really listening. When people feel that they are interesting to others, they become more confident, and more comfortable as a result.Don’t dominate the conversation or constantly turn it around to be about yourself. Let them talk while listening intently, then share your thoughts when the discussion comes around to you.
Get a feel for your date’s mood during the course of the night. Be mindful of considerations like “is he/she comfortable?” “Am I talking too much?” etc.

, Remember to relax and think of the date as a treat rather than an obligation. First dates can sometimes be nerve-wracking, but stay positive and try to have fun. Keep your date (and yourself) laughing and don't take the occasion too seriously. Get absorbed in your conversation and shut off the part of your brain that's constantly analyzing whether the date is a success. Whatever your reasons are for dating, the most important thing is for you and your date to enjoy each other’s company.Too often, people go on dates with motives other than simply getting to know someone, and it can make things feel strained. Keep your expectations in check and be glad to spend time with your date.
If you feel like your date isn't having a good time, switch up your activities. If you both feel awkward talking over drinks at a fancy bar, for instance, pay the check and go for a long walk outside, or find something else to do to take the pressure off. You may just need a change of environment.

, As you’re talking to your date, pick up on similarities between the two of you. Perhaps you're both dog lovers and can bond over pictures of your pets, or you might discover that you're both die hard supporters of the same sports team. Highlighting what you have in common is the best way to establish a deeper connection. It can also take some of the pressure off conversation starting out, as you’ll find that you have much more to talk about.Learn to appreciate your differences, too. If your date doesn’t happen to share your viewpoint on something, don’t automatically count in as a strike against them. Think about how their opinions speak to their character., If things have gone well, ask your date if they would be willing to see you again at the end of the night. Be assertive and make it known that you’ve had a good time with them. Leave your phone number with your date and encourage them to call or text you, or ask for their number if they seem open to giving it to you. If you’ve made a good first impression, you could be on your way to forming a strong, lasting relationship.Try to get a sense of how much your date has enjoyed themselves before asking for their phone number to avoid coming off as pushy.
Call or text the other person within a couple of days after the date to let them know that you had a good time with them."

Wash yourself, put on antiperspirant/deodorant, brush your teeth, brush your hair, and don't forget to wear clean clothes! Make a list of conversation starters and questions you can ask them if you're having trouble finding a topic. Questions about their pet(s), taste in music, good books they've read lately, favorite thing to do outdoors, would you rather questions, are all good ideas. Remember these and read the front page of the newspaper, too.;
,, If you're not sure what he or she will like, ask. You may want to take him or her out to eat someplace out of the ordinary (don't go overboard, as this can set a bad precedent).

, For example, a small box of chocolates or a single rose. This is even better if you know what types of flowers or candies are your date's favorites. Never try the single red rose on a casual first date, you may come on way too strong, as this signifies passionate love. Try baking a nice treat, getting a small stuffed animal, or something else that is unique to them. Never do anything big on the first date. The best gift you can give is your company.

, Talk to your date during dinner and listen to what he or she has to say.

, They are trying to be nice. If you are a gay/lesbian couple, just ask them what they prefer to do and explain what you prefer to do and then compromise. A lot of gay/lesbian couples run into this problem because both sides want to pay for themselves, the best bet is to either take turns paying or pay for yourself. If you were the person that suggested the date it is generally accepted that you at least offer to pay for both yourself and your date.

, Do a lot of listening, it's important not to over-chat them, try to listen a little more than you talk, but don't let the conversation just die out.

, Eye contact shows interest.

, But don't lecture.

, Find one or more qualities in which to sincerely compliment them.

, Don't do anything huge, just go for a stroll in your neighborhood or offer them cocoa, show them your favorite constellation, something interesting that you alone will be remembered for.

, As you escort your date to their place of residence shift the conversation to something romantic like the moon, or the stars or something. Use visual cues and body language from your date to let you know when the time is right to ""make your move"".

Plan an escape route.",How to Survive a Blind Date," Get the other person's e-mail address through your mutual friend. Contact the other person using a friendly tone. Don't ask for the phone number or make plans to meet right away. Exchange a few e-mails then politely ask if it would be okay for you to call to make plans to meet for a drink.;
, There are many ways of initiating relationships. There is no rule for who should make arrangements for when and where to go. In a heteronormative context, the man may choose two to three places to meet and ask the woman to choose among them, but it doesn't have to work this way. Regardless of your gender, you may like to make arrangements, or mutually discuss with the person who you're going on the date with about what you would both prefer.

, Set a specific day and time you will meet. Dress well for your date. Prepare a few questions you might ask in case there's a blank in the conversation. Some of these questions might stem from the email conversations you've been having.

, Remember, you don't know this person yet, and just because they agreed to go on a date with you doesn't mean they have to necessarily be the love of your life. Go to your date with the idea to have fun and get to know the other person, instead of testing whether they are a potential life partner. That way, you will probably feel more relaxed and conversation will be more fluid.

, Reserve a place to sit and talk, and avoid looking bored while you're waiting for the other person to arrive. Read a book, talk on the phone, or look at the menu (if it's a dinner date).

, Ask questions, but nothing too personal. Try to ask open-ended, engaging questions instead of one's which will just require a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. Get to know them, smile and laugh a lot, and at least look like you're having fun, even if you're not.

, Don't mention anything about meeting again unless you really mean it. If there is really no attraction, then politely decline. Since there is a mutual friend involved, dragging something on could cause some problems.

, Plan for a friend to call you 45 minutes into the date. If its going terribly tell your date its an emergency and you have to go. If its going great just say you accidentally left something at your friends house and they were calling to see when you could get it. That way you don't have to sit through a terrible date.

One contributor suggests putting a light amount of cologne on, but use it extremely lightly as overdoing it is a real turn off. Some nice shampoo and conditioner or fragrant botanical body lotion are a valid alternative if you're not prone to body odor.


Choose your best clothes, make sure that they are spotless (means no stains) otherwise you will not give a good impression. (This could backfire by giving off the impression that you're desperate, so don't overdo it.)
Take the time to make yourself ready, you do not want to look sloppy.
Shave and have a clean face.;
, You can make a comment on her clothes, her hair or something else. Be as specific as possible, then it sounds like you've paid attention. But don't over-do it either, you really need to mean it; otherwise it will sound fake. If you can't really find anything great to say just tell her that she looks nice or pretty or even go as far as saying gorgeous, but try not to sound too desperate.

, You score with her and it will sweep her off her feet and also adds to a great first impression.She will love it when you act nice

, If she makes a fuss about it and offers to pay for it herself then just ask her if she's sure.


She may just be saying that so she doesn't look like a gold digger.
Though she may actually just want to buy the ticket herself. If she keeps persisting to let her buy the ticket, ask if she is sure, but offer to buy the popcorn . Also, pay with an appropriate amount of money. If you pay for a grand total of something that is fifteen dollars with one dollar bills, you will appear cheap to her.

, It is thoughtful and otherwise you'll risk the chance on having an awkward date.

, Partway through the movie if you notice that she is getting suspiciously closer and flicks her hair a lot or isn't really concentrating on the movie then she is most likely thinking about how the rest of this date is going to go.


If she gets very close and somewhat cuddly (how cuddly can you get with an armrest jabbing you) then put your arm around her, if she tries to shrug it off and make it look like she was shivering or something then take your arm back, she's not ready for that.
Ask if she likes the movie so far.
If you feel comfortable enough, hold her hand during the movie and it doesn't have to be during the whole two hours. This will reassure her that she is not completely forgotten during the movie. Plus it will put you both in a better mood for the rest of the date.

, Comment briefly on the movie, and ask her if she wants to get a cup of coffee or a hot chocolate at a coffee shop (e.g. ""Hey that was a good movie, do you want to talk about it at Starbucks and get a coffee?"" or, ""That movie was... interesting, do you want to go to Tim Horton’s and talk?""


If she declines brush it off and take her home or wait for someone to pick her up(if you don't drive). If you act hurt about it then she'll just think that you're a bit pathetic and ditch you there.
If she accepts then go get some coffee and try to keep the conversation about her. She may not like all the attention so if she tries to switch the conversation to you then go along with it, maybe she doesn't know much about you or she thinks you’re a bit of a stalker.

, If she says she had a really nice time or something like that then say you had a good time too and ask if you can call her sometime.

, After she's in her house, leave. If you catch her looking out of the window, smile and wave at her. It'll give her the lasting impression that you want to go out again.

, This could be difficult for some, but in order to accomplish this you don't have to know everything, but having a little knowledge about a lot things will help with this.

, This should be a place where you feel most comfortable. One could hope that upon meeting her you got a vibe from her or a conversation with her that could help in your choice as well. The location also says a lot about a person.

, If a woman finds very little attractiveness in you physically, then when you make her laugh you will have her.

, If you are meeting her at a location, try to get there early to scout the place out. Most restaurants have great ideal locations that promotes closeness.

Introduce yourself first.,
Do not be easily offended.,
Make sure you have a few fall back questions to ask.,
Answer questions fully.,
Listen as much as you talk.",How to Make Conversation on a Blind Date," Say your name. Say it proud and do not mumble! This should be something you have practice doing whenever you meet a new person. If your name has an interesting story feel free to tell it only if it is non-offensive or cute. .


Don't launch into how your father was drunk when you were born and came up with your name based off of the liquor bottle in his hand. Those types of stories can wait. If your date has questions or comments about your name make sure you entertain them.;
, At least not if you want the conversation to flow. The person may be as nervous or more nervous than you. If you want them to cut you some slack be sure you do the same. The quickest way to make things awkward and kill conversation is to shoot them down for cursing, telling an embarrassing story, or telling a vulgar story.

, Being inquisitive on a blind date is not offensive or too forward. In fact, asking questions and being prepared to answer them yourself is a very easy way to keep the conversation flowing.


Here are some example questions:

What do you do for a living? (Guard your nonverbal communication! You do not want to shame them with a judging look when they say they flip burgers or are currently unemployed.).
Where did you grow up?
What is your perfect Sunday?
Do you have a favorite vacation spot?
Do you have hobbies?
What is one fun fact about you?
What are you best at?
Favorite food/restaurant? (If you picked their favorite restaurant kudos to you!) What would you do if you did not have to worry about money? etc.


The sky is the limit. Just stay away from deep probing questions for the blind date. Since you know so little about one another, it is possible to spend the entire date covering the basics in detail without a dull moment.

, Stay away from brief answers and miles away from one word answers. If you are not comfortable answering a question just say something witty and true to your personality to lightly deflect the questions. If you are not a witty person you can always just casually say ""Lets save that topic for later.""

, Never interrupt. If you do get into one of those situations where you both talk over each other by accident, graciously yield the floor to your date. If they do the same, it is then safe to proceed with what you were going to say. Make sure that you bring things back around to your date when you are done voicing your thought. Simply say, ""What were you going to say?""


Listening is a skill that many people forget to show on dates and if done poorly can frustrate your date. A frustrated date does not lead to good conversation.

, Corny jokes may lead to an awkward moment. Laughing often breaks the ice, and everyone loves someone with a sense of humor. Most people love funny stories, but nothing too dirty, especially on a first date.

, Unless you are taking her to the beach, you probably should not be wearing flip-flops or shorts on a first date. No matter what you do for a living, let him or her know that you enjoy what you do and take pride in it. Don't be too boastful - people usually find that to be rude and offensive. Don't get dress up for basic events, like wearing a ball gown to a local movie theater, or a tuxedo on a picnic in the park. For the girls who are having a trip to the movies maybe a floral dress and a blazer would be nice. ]Be sure to accessorize for a small splash of personality, but don't overdo it! Follow the rule: before you walk out the door, take a look in the mirror and remove one item. Less is more.

, Family, friends, work, boss, car, weather, taxes, and gasoline prices should stay out of the conversation. Instead, try to smile and let your date know that you are a fun person - not someone boring who he/she has to talk to.

, Girls love to receive them. If you want to get her something small instead, buy a candle or a picture frame (not with your picture in it). You want her to know that you were thinking about them while you were apart and that you remember what she likes. Just don't go overboard with the gift. Keep it simple and sweet.

, Hold the door and help her with her coat; pull out chairs, do not interrupt her, do not talk on the cellphone on a date, and do not look at other people in the room.

, Try not to be too nosy - don't ask any personal questions. Make your date feel good about his/her career, hobbies, interests, and opinions. Listen attentively as well. People generally hate it when they are asked the same question twice because it tells them that you were not listening the first time. Do not pry into personal matters, and do not tell about private matters in your life.

, Tell her she looks lovely, smells good, is intelligent, has a beautiful house - anything that will make her smile. It counts.

, Talk about her interests as well, and try to focus on mutual interests, since both of you will be able to contribute. Who knows? She may like the things you like and know a lot more about them than you thought she would. What about history, cars, music, movies? Your date may very well share some of your interests, and it could make for a great conversation and allow you both to find some common ground.

, Some people will prefer not to kiss on the first date, unless they have kissed before. When kissing in a public area, you need to respect the other people around you - don't go overboard with the kiss! You might want to kiss at the end of the date to close it off. Bring a mint or breath spray, but do NOT bring gum. It's unattractive to chew in front of your date! Keep the kiss quick and sweet - don't French kiss unless if you have done it with your date before, and you are in a secluded area. Remember - your date may be just as nervous as you are about kissing!

Last, but not least, be sure to correspond with her after the date to give closure.",How to Impress a Girl on a First Date," The place of the date definitely sets the tone for the date. If you are trying to be more romantic and lavish, reserve a table at a fancy restaurant. If you want to be more casual, consider taking her out for ice cream or to a casual bar.


If you do decide to go for the casual date, be sure the place won't be too crowded. You don't want to have to deal with the frustration of waiting in line for the entire time. It can also make it difficult to talk if the place is too crowded
If you decide to go for the fancy date, be sure the items are within your price range. It is silly to spend hundreds of dollars on a first date if you don't have the money for it.;
, Generally, it is a good idea to pick her up from her house because it shows that you really care about the date.


This will also give you a chance to talk on the way. It is an especially good place to ask her about her music tastes since you will be able to easily play music in your car.

, If you would like to be romantic, buy her flowers and give them to her when you pick her up. It is a nice gesture and shows that you have been thinking about the date for a while.


Roses are always a good choice if you are unsure of which type of flower to buy.
If you feel this is too forward or old-school, skip it.

, It is key to make sure you dress appropriately for the occasion. If you're going to a fancy restaurant, wear nicer clothes than if you were taking her to a movie and ice cream. Take a shower, fix your hair, put on deodorant and cologne, brush your teeth, carry gum, wear a nice clean shirt, pants, and shoes, and don't forget to shave your face. Your time and effort in your looks will let her know that you care. If you are unsure of what to wear for where you are going consider these different dress codes:



Casual: This is what you would likely wear if you were getting ice cream, going to the park or to a bar. Check out our article on how to dress casual. A good outfit could be a polo, nice jeans or khakis, and reasonably nice shoes.

Semi-formal: This is a good option for dinner and a movie at a nice restaurant and theater. Check out our article on how to dress semi-formally.
Try to wear clothes that you reserve for nicer occasions, instead of everyday street wear.

, Getting stood up is no fun for anyone, so try to make sure it doesn't happen. This will also show her that you have been thinking about the date and that you want to make sure it happens.


Sending a quick ""Looking forward to seeing you at 7"" should be sufficient.

, Checking your phone for texts or emails during the date will show her that you do not truly care about the date. It sends the message that she is not as important as your phone.


If you are expecting an important call, tell her beforehand.

, This will show that you are confident and that you care enough about her to get out of her car. You should also give her flowers at this step if you have bought any

, This is a gentlemanly gesture which some think is antiquated. Your date may or may not like it, so consider what sort of tone you want to set for the date.


If you open the door for her and she reacts negatively, take note of it and possibly let her close the door on her own.
Walk around the front of the car to get back to the driver's side so you aren't awkwardly making a long walk.

, This is expected of men and is thought of as polite. Unless she is really against you doing so, continue this practice throughout the date.


Some women do not like it when men open doors for them because they feel it diminishes their abilities as a person. Your date will likely tell you if she thinks this way.

, This will make it easier for her to get in. Again, some people think this is an antiquated practice but others find it very gentlemanly and polite.

, The most important thing you can do on a first date is to be genuinely engaged and interested in what she is saying. When she is talking, listen to what she says. Smile and ask questions to show you are listening to her. If you don't understand what she's sharing, ask her to clarify. Share experiences of yours that relate to what she shares with you. People like to be heard and understood.


Be sure to look her in her eyes while she is talking. If you feel uncomfortable maintaining eye contact for a long time, as many people do, try looking right in between her eyes.

, Try to avoid controversial topics like religion or politics. These topics are almost guaranteed to make the date go poorly. Instead focus on FORD:



Family. Ask her about siblings, parents, cousins, and uncles.

Occupation. Ask her about her job and what she thinks of it.

Recreation. Ask about what she does in her free time. Does she play in a sports rec. league? What are her hobbies? What shows does she watch?

Dreams. What does she want for her future? This is a good way to prompt her to talk more deeply about herself.

, If you've found a common interest between you and your date (i.e. you both like gardening) focus on that interest. Talk about funny experiences, tips and tricks you've discovered, and your favorite parts of that common interest. Try turning the conversation back to your date by asking questions, listening, and asking follow-up questions (How did you get interested in that? Why is that your favorite? etc.).


Share funny and relatable stories from your past. Talk about the same topics that you asked her about, such as your family, occupation, recreation, and dreams. If you have a plan for achieving your dreams, share that with her. It will come across as confident and passionate.
Avoid dwelling on negative things and experiences. You will have time for sharing negative experiences later on in the relationship, but try to keep things positive initially.
Be polite when she is speaking. Don't interrupt her when she is talking and try not to argue with her.
Speak passionately, and be honest about, your interests. It is best to be honest about what you like because she may find the same things interesting. If you are honest with your interests, you will also be able to speak with greater passion.
In general, just try your hardest to be kind and polite. Pay attention to table manners such as keeping your elbows off the table and not chewing or talking with your mouth open.

, Offer her the option of letting you pay for her meal, ticket, etc. Some women don't like men pay for her while others do. The safest way to not offend her is to just ask.

, Take things slow at first. Most girls don't even want to be kissed on their first date. If she makes it clear that she wants to move quickly, or if she wants to hold hands, you'll definitely know.


It is also more respectful to take things slow because it sends the message that you care about more than just her body.
Try not to act too needy. If you have been obsessed with her since the moment you saw her, try not to explicitly say that on the first date. Instead, imply it by saying things like, ""I'm so glad you decided to come out with me tonight!""

, It doesn't matter what medium you choose: texting, email, or phone call, but just make sure you tell her that you had a good time. Also, if it is true, make sure you mention that you would love to go on another date with her.

Dress suitable for the weather but try to look cute and attractive.,
Agree on what to see when you get there.,
Don't overdo it on popcorn, The only attractive way to eat popcorn is piece by piece, so, in order to look cute, eat and enjoy your popcorn slowly.,
Be polite and courteous Thank him for the good time, especially if he paid for the movie.,
Make sure you offer to pay, if you don't it will make the guy feel obligated to pay for you which is a MAJOR turn off.,
Be on time!,
Let him know how you feel about the movie, if its scary cuddle into his shoulder and he will wrap his arms around you.",How to Go On a Great Date at the Movies (for Girls)," If it is snowing, don't wear a huge parka in a color that looks like a traffic cone. Instead, replace it with a turtle neck, an oversized belt, and a dark pair of jeans. For summer, a sun dress with an over sized necklace and some medium sized hoops would be appropriate. Remember you will be sitting down the whole time (maybe) so dress to impress, but keep comfortable. Don't try too hard.;
, A romantic comedy is appropriate for a date, but if you are set on seeing a movie, tell him! He'd appreciate it more if you made the decision because that takes the pressure off of him, but make sure he's okay with seeing that movie.

, Or, you can get candy. Mints are a good candy to get because they make your breath smell good, and if you're going to kiss, you won't have bad breath. Stay away from chocolate!

, If things are going well, tell him that you'd like to see him again sometime soon. If you didn't enjoy the date so much, don't mention anything about a second date. In this case, thank him for the good time and don't go in for a kiss. This may lead him on which isn't fair to him.

, Let him know you have money but flirt in a way he will pay for his girl.

, Guys do like a girl being a little late but not 45 minutes late! Be fashionably late but on time.

, If its romantic hold his hand and stare into each others eyes if you can see them. If its comedy don't hysterically laugh your brains out! Just have the quiet giggle.

Don’t panic during awkward silences.,
Read both yourself and your date for cues about the end of the night.",How to Have a Successful Blind Date," If you’re asking someone to set you up, make sure that the person knows you well and, perhaps more importantly, knows what you want in a partner. Your close friends might have the same social circles as you and might not be able to set you up with anyone new. Don’t be afraid to ask people you don’t know as well, such as friends of friends, to set you up. Pick someone who you think would have fun, interesting friends., You will need to communicate with your date beforehand to talk about logistics. If the person setting you up insists on coordinating logistics, ask to at least chat with the person on the phone for a few minutes with the matchmaker there. Ask your date a few basic questions, such as where they are from or what they like to do on the weekends. That way, when you talk to the person on your date, you’ll have one small conversation to reference., Choose a start time that you can make with plenty of leeway. Choose an end time that leaves time for lingering if you want to keep talking with your date. Keep it short. If you like your date, you can always see them again. A bad date that’s too long is worse than a good date that’s too short!, Restaurants, bars, parks, movie theaters, and mini golf venues are all good examples. Let a friend know what time you’re leaving and when you’ll be back. Check in with her at the end of your date so that she knows you’re safe., When deciding what to do, pick something that is easy and stimulates conversation. Feel free to abandon the “dinner and drinks” mold.Here are some ideas that are more interesting than dinner (but also pair well with dinner, if you are hungry!):


Hiking
Mini golf and ice cream
Aquarium
Jazz club
Karaoke bar
Canoeing or kayaking
Cooking class
Dance class, Don’t feel the need to try out a new outfit. Wear something that you know you like and that you know looks good. Dress appropriately for the activity you’re doing on your date. Wear athletic clothes if you’re going hiking or more formal wear if you’re going out to an expensive restaurant., Try not to expect the perfect partner right from the outset. Your blind date might surprise you in a positive way. When you think about what you hope to get from your blind date, turn your mind to something else immediately. Don’t have low or high expectations. Aim for no expectations instead., Do not stay at your blind date if your date is rude, mean, or otherwise extremely unpleasant. In the unfortunate case of an emergency, rehearse what you’re going to say. Maybe your roommate is sick, or your landlord called with an urgent issue regarding your apartment. It’s good to have an emergency plan in case the date goes horribly awry., Before you leave the house, double check that you’ve put on deodorant, flossed, and fixed your hair. A little bit of hygiene goes a long way when you’re meeting someone new!

, Ask your date questions without “yes” or “no” answers so that they don’t feel like they’re being interrogated. Get to know your date’s personality and lifestyle. Does this person seem like someone who shares your goals and complements your personality? See if your date likes the same things that you do, or if your date could introduce you to something you’ve always wanted to try. Here’s a list of questions to get you started:


What do you like to do on weekends?
What is one thing on your bucket list?
What’s the best book you’ve read in the past six months?
What in your life are you proud of?“What do you do? Do you enjoy your job?”
“What is your best friend like?”
“Do you want to try some of my food?”
“Are you a morning person?”
“Do you have roommates? Who are they?” , Give your date realistic information about yourself, your life, your interests, and your thoughts. Your date is here to get to know you. Don’t dominate the conversation, but do express yourself as you would in typical conversations with friends or potential partners. Find connections between your date and yourself., Make eye contact with your date. Smile. Practice good posture. Nod at what the other person is saying.Occasionally, summarize what the other person says and show an interest in the other person’s interests.


For example, you could say, “It sounds like you have a great relationship with your mother! When was the last time you saw her?”
Or, “You seem like you really love your job. How did you get interested in public service?”

, Tell your date if you want to see them again. Get their number and call them within a couple of days. If you don’t want to see your date again, tell them that you had a nice time and that you hope they have a good rest of their evening. Don’t be overtly cruel about rejecting someone, but don’t feel as though you have to give them false hope by saying you want to see them again when you don’t.

, If you get to your date and find that you’re not attracted to the person at all, don’t bail immediately. You committed to these short plans and might form a great friendship with the person. Don’t imply that you want to have a romantic relationship, though. Say something at the end of the night that implies friendship rather than a romantic relationship.


You could say, “I had a great time tonight and think we could be great friends.”
Or try, “I had a nice time tonight. Enjoy the rest of your weekend!”

, Regardless of convention, offer (at the least) to split the bill with your date. Do not choose an activity or restaurant you can’t afford if you end up paying the entire bill.Here are some ways you can approach that awkward moment when the bill arrives:


Say, “That was delicious. How do you feel about splitting the check?”
Or, “This one’s on me!”
Or, if your date offers to pay: “I’m happy to split the bill with you!”
Or, if your date insists upon paying: “I’m happy to split the bill, but thank you so much!”

, Just because you aren’t talking doesn’t mean a moment is awkward! Feel free to take a few seconds and reflect on what’s happened so far. If you feel that the silence is awkward, have a backup list of open-ended questions (see above) to ask your date. The silence is probably much shorter than you think it is., Start thinking about that dreaded end-of-date moment before it actually happens. Do you want a handshake, a hug, a kiss? Read, too, the signals that your date gives you throughout the date. Does your date sit close to you, or do they seem like they’re in a hurry to leave? Whatever happens at the end of the date should be something you’re both comfortable with.If your date makes an unwanted advance, just step away and say no. You don’t owe your date any physical contact.
If you accidentally make an unwanted advance on your date, don’t panic. Apologize for reading the situation incorrectly and continue talking with your date.

, Wear something that suits the date, weather and your personality. Know what you look good in and emphasise your got parts e.g. nice legs (wear shorts if it's sunny), big boobs (low cut top). But don't show too much skin; you want to look modest and mature. Don't try to look older than you are.

Reward yourself every now and then.",How to Survive Your Teenage Years (Girls)," Now that you are a teenager, it is important that you take care of yourself. Wear deodorant every day, and put some in your gym bag. Also wear perfume or body spray. Shower every day and wash your hair every 2 days. You may also be starting menstruation at this time, so be sure that you pack supplies in every bag, no matter what time of the month it is, in case you get a surprise. Also, even if you don't have your period yet, bring some supplies. You can never be too prepared.;
, You may be cranky a little more often. A good night's sleep can help ease that, and little sleep can actually just add on to your bad mood.

, It is important that you watch what you eat. You should eat vegetables, fruits, grains, as well as protein, but don't be afraid to treat yourself to something sweet every once in a while! Don't go on one of those diets where you starve yourself. If you really want a sweet but healthy dessert, then try putting sugar on some strawberries. It's delicious, and your body is getting fruit and sugar that it can use for energy.

, There's no such thing as being ""too cool for school"". It is very important that you pass your classes. If you really hate school, then look at it like this; don't spend 3 years in 7th grade when you could be done with school quicker.

, You may have mood swings, but you can try and somewhat control them. Try not to blow up over little things. A good way to be kind is helping others. The teenage years are also a good time to start volunteering.

, Let your family and friends in. Don't be secretive. When you're open with your parents, you tend to get more freedom. With your friends, not being secretive will show that they can trust you and they will think of you as a better friend.

, Caffeine makes you hyper and jittery, which is a false sensation of energy, but it's bad for your body and will most likely only make you more tired. A little caffeine every now and then is okay, but don't overdo it.

, Say please, thank you, you're welcome, and may I. Listen to directions and if your parents say no, then that's it. Don't pretend to go to a friend's house but really go to the party they said you couldn't go to.

, Keep your bedroom and living space clean and organized. It builds stress when you're digging around trying to find things.

, Drama is common in the teenage years. Sometimes, it may be unavoidable, but try your best not to associate with those who tend to create drama.

, Sit down with a parent and discuss a good curfew, bedtime, and waking time, as well as what a good age for you to begin dating is.

, If you feel like someone or something is sketchy, it's always better to stay away from it. Alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes are the farthest things from cool, and being addicted can get you in major trouble, not just with your parents, but potentially the law. This doesn't apply to just teenagers, it is good for adults to follow this rule too.

, Have a day with your friends to go to the movies, the beach, the mall, the park, or anywhere you would like to go! Just have fun. Your teenage years may be hard, but they don't last forever, and they are some of your best years.

Don't be afraid to change.,
As an alternative to step 4 you could always try acting like your enemy is your best friend.,
Beat them at their own game.,
Respond with one word answers when they talk or ask you questions.",How to Get Subtle Revenge on Your Enemies," This is the ultimate way to hurt your enemy! Especially if your enemy is smarter and more competitive than you. There are many ways that you can gain intelligence, but the one thing where we all get our intelligence from are books. Read as many books as you can. It can be science, mathematics, English, history, or even magazines and newspapers. All of these things will help you gain information. By being smart, you will totally fire up your enemy. Some of you may be too lazy, but all you've got to remember, is your enemies face when you beat them in exams and in life. Remember being smart will open you lot of doors in life. You will have a well-paid job and live a happy life with lots of friends. People will become interested in you and want to be your friend. Even the people that don't like you that much, will ask for your help. You will be respected and popular for your intelligence and that will burn up your enemy inside, although they may not seem to be on the outside. Eventually maybe they will realize what an idiot they were for leaving you and ask to be your friend again.;
, They will only be happier if you give up doing things that you used to do. Continue life as normal. This may be hard, but try your hardest to live life to the fullest. This will, of course, take time, but eventually like everything else in life, you will forget about them. Time goes by. . You can do it!

, Don't ever let people bring you down. Remember that if you don't respect yourself then others won't.

, Even when you see them from time to time or everyday. Just pretend that they are not there. This will also get them angry! A simple way to do this by not looking their way. Even if they stare at you just pretend that they are not there. This may be hard but keep trying and eventually you will get there.

, By being nice to others you will be liked and this will annoy your enemy. You can do this by helping someone. Only do this if the person or people you are being nice to respects your kindness. If they have mistreated you before then know the depth of your kindness. If what they have done is forgiven and forgotten then just be normal with them. Treat people like they treat you.

, Do more activities and projects.

, This is also another big way to get revenge back on you enemies. Once again it is not easy to be confident. But just remind yourself that you are human. No one else is better than you. You are the way you are and nothing can change that.Beat Your Enemy in everything in which you play against each other. Don't be too afraid of your enemy. Respect yourself for who you are. Remember that people don't judge you by the way you look they judge you by your character.

, Change things that you did wrong. Don't think that just because people know you like this doesn't mean that you can't change. It is never too late to change. Try to improve on the bad habits that you have.

, This will drive them insane! As it will be a negative reaction they will be looking for out of you, rather than a positive one.

, Do to them exactly what they do to you, so they get a taste of their own medicine.

, This will make them feel that they have to make more conversation and soon they will look like they are trying to get your attention and therefore will make you look more popular than them, thus giving you a bit of power over them.

Think about why you don't like the person.,
Apologize if appropriate.,
Figure what you like about the person.,
Try spending time with him outside of class.",How to Survive Sitting Beside People You Hate in School1," Take a moment to consider why you don't like the person. Did something happen? Is it just a trait in the person that you don't like? It's important to figure out why because it can help you make amends.Sometimes, we don't like people because they are a bit too much like us. In other words, you may not like that the person is a bit snobby without realizing that that's a trait you don't like in yourself. Coming to that realization can help you accept the other person.Part of the solution is forgiving the trait in yourself, too, and working to be better. One way you can be better is trying to make friends with the person you dislike. It isn't easy, as even adults have trouble with these kinds of relationships, but you can work to make it better.;
, If you dislike the person because you had a blow up, consider if it was partially your fault. Most of the time, when two people have an argument, both people are at least partially to blame. Try apologizing for your part in it to make amends between you two.For instance, you could say, ""I know we haven't been getting along since we had that huge fight. I really hate that. I really am sorry for the names that I called you and the things that I said. I'm sorry for my part in our fight. I messed up, and I'm truly sorry. Can we be friends again?""

, Now that you've figured out why don't like the person, try figuring out what you do like about him. Figuring that out means you have to talk to him and observe the things he does. Start with something small if you have to. Maybe you like his handwriting or the way he styles his hair. As you look for things you like, the hate you have for the person will lessen.It doesn't hurt to mention what you like to the other person. Try offering a compliment to him once you notice something you do like. You might get a hostile response, but you've opened a positive bridge of communication.

, Many times, if you get to know a person, you may find you have things in common that you never knew you did. Try inviting the person to sit with you at lunch or to go with you to the mall. You may find that you actually like being around the person, or at the very least, that you can tolerate him."

Use the A-B-C data to determine the function of the behavior.,
Consider whether the child was trying to escape, avoid, or postpone something.,
Consider whether the child was seeking peer or adult attention by engaging in this behavior.,
Consider whether the child was seeking to gain or avoid sensory input.,
Consider whether the child was trying to gain access to tangibles.",How to Write a Behavior Support Plan2," The function explains why the student engaged in the behavior. What was the student seeking to gain or avoid? Consider the possibilities.

,


Was the behavior an attempt to escape, postpone, or avoid a non-preferred or difficult task or assignment?






Was the child attempting to stop a transition from one activity to another?
Did the child want to leave the situation?
If so, the child was engaging in escape-motivated behavior.

,


Was the child attempting to gain positive or negative attention?






If so, the child was engaging in attention-seeking behavior.

,


Was the child seeking to gain sensory input by accessing taste, touch, feel, or smell objects?






Was the child engaging in self-stimulation (i.e., ""stimming"")? This includes flapping arms, clapping, spinning, pulling on ears, mouthing objects, humming loudly, and standing.
Was the stimming harmful or disruptive?
Was the child attempting to escape or avoid sensory overload-- loud sound, overstimulating situation, uncomfortable clothing, crowds, etc.?
If so, the child was engaging in sensory-motivated behavior.

,


Was the child motivated to have demands met immediately?






Did the child attempt to overpower or control someone?
Did the child grab an item from someone else?
If so, the child was engaging in tangible behavior.

Focus first on antecedent interventions to prevent behaviors.,
Include coping skills in the plan.,
Emphasize communication options.,
Incorporate social skills teaching.,
Make plans consistent across settings whenever possible.,
Stay Positive.,
Do regular evaluations and revisions.,
Stay child-centered.",How to Write a Behavior Support Plan3," Whenever possible, antecedent procedures are preferable, because they can help to keep this behavior from re-occurring.


For example, if the student is seeking sensory input, you can implement sensory diet activities like compression vests, weighted blankets, vestibular seats or balls, and proprioceptive activities like jumping on a trampoline or playing with putty.






If the child is seeking to escape or avoid overstimulating activities, you can provide ear plugs or headphones during loud activities or give the child access to a quiet space.
If the child is seeking to escape difficult works tasks, you can implement procedures for asking for breaks or help.

, Relaxation methods like yoga and counting may help.

, Teach the child to use communication skills to verbalize wants and needs appropriately.

, Use social stories to teach clear expectations and involve peers to model appropriate behaviors.

,


At school, the child will be assigned a case manager, and the school team and parents may convene for a meeting to develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to help support the child's behavior in the school setting.






Parents of children who are not school aged may also wish to consult Early Intervention (EI) services.

, Do not get discouraged if you try a behavior plan that is not successful, or if you find that a behavior plan stops working after two weeks.

, It is recommended that behavior plans are constantly assessed and updated to reflect preferences, motivation, and maturity. Think of a behavior plan like your favorite dessert-- No matter how much you enjoy it, you may eventually satiate on it and want something else. This is natural. Give it time, and stay positive.

, Children with challenging behavior need our love, positive attention, guidance, and support. It is already apparent that you are willing to provide those, as you have already begun to seek out resources to help your child.

Ignore the person's hostility.,
Look for why he may be mean.,
Be polite.,
Learn to stop when asked.,
Ask the teacher to be moved.,
Stay focused.",How to Survive Sitting Beside People You Hate in School2," If you can't make friends, you have to move on to more drastic measures. One way to deal with a person you dislike is to simply not deal with him. That is, if the person is openly hostile to you, don't respond to the hostility. Simply keep doing what you're doing.For instance, you can try concentrating on your own work or counting to ten in your head., People are often mean for reasons you'd understand. That is, sometimes people are mean to try to make themselves feel better because they feel bad about themselves. Maybe they don't have a very good home life, or maybe they don't do as well in school as they'd like. If you can figure out why a person is mean, you may be able to feel compassion towards the person instead of hatred., It's always good to be polite, even when you're dealing with a person you don't like. It's still important to say please and thank you or to pass a paper over when asked to do so. Don't be openly rude to the person. You don't have any reason to be mean, even if you don't like the person.Remember, even if you don't like the person, he has feelings, too. If you're mean, you might be the one who's doing the bullying. Being polite shows you're the bigger person.

, If you're doing something annoying, such as kicking a chair or tapping your pencil, you may not even realize you're doing it. That's fine. Everyone has nervous or fidgety habits from time to time. However, if the kid next to you asks you to stop, go ahead and stop. Don't try to keep going just to annoy him. It will only make it worse., Some teachers will not agree to this suggestion. However, if you tell him or her that sitting next to that person distracts you, some teachers might agree to move you. Remember to be as polite as possible and to accept whatever decision your teacher gives you.

, Remember, you're at school to learn first. Friendships and classmates come second. Stay focused on what you're studying, not on what the person next to you is doing."

Recognize bullying.,
Tell the person to stop.,
Laugh at the meanness.,
Talk to an adult.",How to Survive Sitting Beside People You Hate in School3," Sometimes, you just don't get along with people. Maybe your personalities don't click or you're not interested in the same things. It's fine not to like someone, as long as you are still polite to each other. However, if someone is being mean to you, taunting you, or harming you in a physical way all the time, that crosses the line into bullying.Bullying can include the other person calling you names or threatening you. It can also mean that the person is tripping you, shoving you, or kicking you.They might spread rumors about you or your family.
Know that bullying doesn't just happen in face-to-face conversations. It can also happen through notes, graffiti, or on the internet.

, If the person is consistently being mean to you, tell the person to stop. That is, in a clear voice, tell him to stop calling you names, stop kicking your chair, stop laughing at you, etc. Try not to use an angry voice. A calm voice works better in this scenario. Count to ten before you speak to calm yourself down if you need to do so., That is, if the person calls you names, try laughing at him instead. Sometimes this simple act will get a person to stop., If you feel like you're being bullied, it's important to talk to an adult. Talk to your teacher or coach. Also, talk to your parents. Your parents are your advocates, and if no one else is standing up for you, they will."

Know why they’re being mean.,
Stand up for yourself.,
Kill them with kindness.,
Like yourself.",How to Deal With Girls1," Girls can be bullies for a number of reasons, and it usually has nothing to do with you.


The need to be accepted and in control sometimes causes girls to be mean. They might not feel accepted at home, or feel out of control in another part of their lives. They might act mean to feel like they are on top for once.Girls are sometimes mean to another person just because the person is different. If someone is a little taller or quieter or better in class, it can be threatening to a mean girl, so they make fun of that person. This has to do with their own insecurities, not with the target of their bullying.;
, It might not be easy, but mean girls often don’t expect someone to question them.


If they’re making fun of you, immediately tell them to stop it. Showing confidence and strength lets the mean girl know you are not an easy target.
Say something like, “Hey, stop! You’re being rude and I don’t have to listen to it.”
Have your friends stand up to the mean girls with you. Like dealing with anything else, a little backup helps! It’s easier to stand up to a bully if you have some support., A mean person does not expect to get nice words in return. Being kind to a mean girl can throw her off balance.


If a girl is being mean to you, you can ask something like, “Are you having a bad day?” Showing concern and care might stop her in her tracks.
Being nice when someone is being mean will, at the very least, get on their nerves. It might also make them think about their behavior.Being kind also shows that you are confident enough to ignore their meanness and be the better person.

, Be confident in yourself and surround yourself with people who care about you.


There is nothing wrong with being smart, short, a little overweight, or different in any way. When you love yourself and have friends who love you, the mean girls don’t matter.
When someone is mean to you, it is really their problem, not yours. If you respect yourself, then the mean things they say aren’t important."
"
Read her face.,
Look at her body language.,
Notice how her friends act.,
Notice how she behaves towards you.,
Notice how she behaves about shared plans.,
Listen to her tone of voice.,
Notice what words she uses.,
Find out if she's talked about you to other people.,
Give her space.,
Examine your actions.,
Apologize.,
Be courteous.,
End the relationship.",How to Know That a Girl Hates You," Although this isn't a perfect method, a lot of what people feel is expressed in their face. Faces can show a lot. She might always squint her eyes when angry, so if she does whatever physical action that you know she does in a certain mood that is most definitely helpful. There are lots of other different things you can look for. Usually, just having one of these won't mean that the girl hates you, but having more than one can indicate that there is dislike on her part.Crinkling her nose could be an expression of disgust at your presence (unless, of course, there is a bad smell).
Narrowed eyes, or eye rolling when you're around (especially if you're speaking).
If she doesn't make eye contact with you that could mean she is shy, but it could also be an indicator of dislike.;
, Body language is another good indicator, although you have to remember that it is not an exact science. Look at what she is telling you in how she physically reacts to your presence. It can tell you a lot about how she's feelings about you.


Arms crossed over chest is often considered a closed off gesture. There's a possibility if she stands or sits with her arms crossed across her chest when she's around you that she's trying to keep away from you. Of course, some people simply stand that way, so the gesture, taken by itself, might not mean anything.
Another good thing to look for is if she's consistently turning away from you. If she's not meeting your eyes and angling her body in a direction away from you, it could be that she wants you to leave her alone and she's seeking some way to escape from you.

, Chances are, if she hates you, she'll have told her friends so. They'll be looking to protect her (because they will be on her side). Watching how her friends behave towards, like if they ignore you when you try to talk to them, you will give you a pretty good indication of her feelings.If you both are at a party and you are trying to get across to her, but keep finding her friends running interference and stopping you from talking to her, that's a pretty good sign that she wants nothing to do with you.
If you two are somewhere by yourselves and her friends keep popping to drag her away, or interrupt, that's another pretty good sign that she might dislike you and her friends are trying to protect her from having to be around you.
If you see her smirking and laughing with her friends while looking at you, that's another good sign that there's some dislike on her side. Of course she might not be looking at you, but if it happens consistently, and with the other signs, that's a pretty clear signal of dislike.

, Obviously there is more to her behavior than just her body language. Her actions will also help you figure out how she's feeling about you and whether she hates you.


Every time you try to talk to her, she pulls a Houdini and disappears. This means that the minute you try to speak to her, she's managed to be somewhere else. Now, if this only happens once or twice that doesn't mean anything, but if it happens more than that, it's likely that she doesn't like you, or is upset about something.
She never answer when you call or text. This is a big one, because it's pretty easy to shoot back even a quick text in reply, but if she never replies to you, or if she replies only in one word answers, that's a good sign that something in up.

, If the two of you have made plans together, even simple things like a coffee shop study session, or other and she always manages to hedge about meeting you for the plans, that's a good sign that she doesn't want to spend time with you.


If she blows off plans by not showing up and doesn't say anything, or apologize, again she probably doesn't want to spend time with you.
If she's constantly 'forgetting' plans, then she isn't wanting to spend time with you. Some people are pretty flaky, but not that flaky.
Remember, this doesn't necessarily mean that she hates you. You might annoy her by pestering her to do things with you, or she might be completely indifferent to you.

, Tone of voice is a huge indicator of someone's feelings. It doesn't matter what they are saying, because people lie or say things they don't mean all the time, but the feelings often come through how she says things.


Using a flat tone of voice when she talks to you means she's probably not that keen on the conversation (unless of course, she always speaks in monotone). Usually when a girl is with someone she likes, there will be inflections in her voice.

Sarcasm can be a great way for her to tell you that she doesn't like you without actually having to do so. It's all about the inflections in her voice. If she says something like 'That'd be fun' if you ask her out to coffee, notice how she says it. Couple this with facial expressions and body language and you should get a pretty good idea how she's actually feeling.

, The words she uses can often tell you how she's feeling, even if she doesn't come right out and say 'I hate you' (since few people actually do that). However, if she is saying 'I hate you' and she's serious about it, that's another great sign that she does, indeed, hate you.


If she's replying to your questions and conversation with one word answers, either you're talking way too much, or she's not very interested in having this conversation.
If she never initiates conversation and it's always you doing the talking, again she's probably not that interested in talking with you. Although, it doesn't necessarily mean she hates you it is unlikely that she likes you.
'Yeah, whatever.' 'Fine'

, Even though she might not have told you directly that she hates you, it's likely that she's told other people, like her friends, or even some of her acquaintances. Ask around to see what she's been saying (if anything) about you.


The best people to ask are her friends. Although it might be difficult to talk to one of them alone, if you have the chance simply ask the friend if everything is okay between you and the girl and if there's anything you did wrong. If you're polite about it, chances are the friend will be more likely to tell you.
Just remember that whatever people tell you will be skewed by their own interpretations and so shouldn't be your only evidence that she hates you.

, If someone hates you, it's a good idea to give them some time and space to cool off. If you're constantly around her, she's probably going to start hating you even more. Giving her space, can even remind her why she liked in you the beginning (if she did).


This means don't pester her with invites to go places, or ask her why she's mad at you. Just let it be for a while.
There is not proper amount of time to wait. You'll have to use your judgment, but depending on how deep the hatred goes, it could be anywhere from a few weeks to a year.

, People don't just start hating someone without some sort of cause, whether you feel it's legitimate or not. Think about how you've acted towards her and try to determine what might have caused her to feel the way she's feeling.


Think about things you said. It could even be something as simple as a joke that she took the wrong way. Or it could be that your way of showing like for her is to ridicule her and tease her (the pulling pigtails on the playground thing).
Perhaps she feels that you're suffocating her with your attention. If you're always around her trying to talk to her, it could get on her nerves. In which case you're best off giving her space.

, Even if you don't feel you've done anything wrong, but you like this girl and you want her to stop hating her, you have to apologize. Don't try to tell her to 'lighten up' or 'can't you take a joke?' and especially never ever do the faux apology 'I'm sorry you felt that way.'


It's best to apologize in private. Having an audience might force one or both of you to act in a certain way that you wouldn't in private.

, A good way to show her that you're wanting reconciliation and that you're worth reconciling with, is to be courteous to her, even as she's hating you. You'll show that you're a good enough person to take the high road and not get sucked into the potential drama.


So when you see her around, say hello and ask how's she's doing. Leave it at that. Just enough interaction to show that you care and are interested in her well being and not enough interaction to get on her nerves.

, At a certain point you can't keep trying to have a relationship (whether in a friend way or a romantic way) with someone who consistently hates. There could be good reason for her hatred or no reason at all. The best thing for you to do if you've tried the other steps and failed is to end the relationship.


If you've tried apologizing and giving her space, and being courteous and nothing has worked to get her to change her mind, continuing to try is just going to be unhappy business for both of you. Walk away.
Remember, it doesn't matter what she did, or said, or anything, you're going to have to be the better person in this instance. So don't start badmouthing her to other people. If people notice the friction between the two of you, and ask about it, simply say 'That's between the two of us.'

Approach the girl with confidence.,
Start a conversation.,
Listen to her.,
Point out what you have in common.",How to Deal With Girls2," Girls are more likely to be attracted to a person who is confident in who they are.


Smile and be in control of yourself. Even if you are nervous, a smile will show that you are friendly and approachable. Try not to fidget or show that you’re nervous.
Stand up straight and make eye contact. Standing up straight will make you feel stronger, and eye contact lets her know that you are paying attention.

, Asking her questions about herself is a good starting point.


This will show your interest and get the conversation flowing. Try asking her if she likes sports, if she’s seen a new movie, or how her day has been.
Think about some things you’re interested in, and ask if she’s interested in these things too. You might find that you like the same soccer team, or both love hip hop.
Ask to borrow something, like a pen, even if you don’t need it, to get her talking., Genuinely hearing and responding to what a girl says lets her know that you care.


Pay attention to how the conversation is going. If you are doing most of the talking and she is barely responding, she may not be interested., If you like the same kinds of books or even have the same classes, talk about it!


If you both take Spanish, ask her to help you with that day’s assignment. If you both have dogs, offer to go to the dog park together.
You probably already like her because you have some things in common. Having the same favorite book or movie will make a girl feel more connected to you."

Be genuine.,
Look for telling behaviors.,
Give a girl some time and space.,
Know what you want.,
Have open, honest communication.,
Have fun together!",How to Deal With Girls3," People can tell when you are faking interest in them.


Genuinely pay attention to what a girl says and does. Showing true interest in her life will let her know that you respect her.
Remembering small things like her favorite food or the name of her dog will show that the things she says are truly important to you., If a girl isn’t showing as much interest in you, she may not be friend or girlfriend material.


If she isn’t asking you questions, showing interest in your life, or giving you all of her attention, then you may not want to spend any more time with her.If you try to make plans to hang out and she doesn’t seem interested or changes the subject, then she might not be the person for you.

, Don’t follow her around and bombard her with questions. If she wants to be your friend or girlfriend, she will also seek out conversations with you.


Being clingy with a girl can be annoying, and may make her change her mind about hanging out with you. She needs time to be alone or hang out with other people, just like you do.If you've given her some space and she comes to talk to you, then she is probably interested in having a relationship with you.

, Pinpointing what kind of girl you are looking for can help you decide if she is the right person to spend time with.A friend or girlfriend is someone you can freely talk to and trust. If a girl makes fun of other people or is disrespectful, then she is not friend material.
Make sure you actually like the person and don’t just want to be around her because she’s popular. Relationships are based on shared interests and respect. If you want to be someone’s friend only because of social status, then you are trying for the wrong reasons.
Friendships and relationships are special bonds. You should only spend your time with someone who respects and cares about you as much as you care about her.

, Relationships that are built on secrets and lies will eventually crumble.


Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not. From the beginning, friends should accept each other for who they truly are. Relationships are built on truth and honesty, and they will crumble if you aren’t being true to who you are and honest about what you want from the other person.Being open with one another can prevent fights in the future. Tell each other when and why you’re getting annoyed or mad, when it's actually happening. Then things will not build up over time and boil over into a huge fight later on., The best part about relationships is doing fun things with someone else.


Go to the movies, hiking, shopping, or dancing together. You and your friend or girlfriend have similar interests, so do things that you will both enjoy.
No matter what you’re doing, blowing off steam with a good friend is the perfect way to balance all of the challenges and hard times in life. Your girlfriend should be there for you in the bad times, but also in the good."

It’s not as unusual as it may sound—many people prefer feeling unrestrained when they go to bed at night. If you share a room with someone else, be considerate before you simply bare it all. You may have to have a talk with your roommate about your preferred sleeping arrangement to find out if they would have an issue with you being naked in the same room.Sleeping naked can keep you cooler and make you more relaxed as you’re drifting off to sleep.;
, Take advantage of an empty house by shedding your clothes when you’re the only one home. You can prance around in the buff all you want without having to worry about offending anyone. Just make sure you know when everyone is expected back to prevent any awkward surprises.You could also wait until everyone else is asleep to get loose of your garments.
Avoid open windows while you’re naked at home. There’s a big difference between going natural and giving the neighbors a show.

, If you have your own room, make it known that you prefer to go naked when you’re alone. You might put up a sign announcing that if you’re in your room with the door closed, you’re probably not wearing any clothes. You could also simply inform your family members about your choice to go nude and request that they knock before barging in.Depending on your family’s own privacy rules, you could always just lock the door when you need to let your body breathe.
Have some clothes nearby that are easy to slip in and out of in case you need to go back and forth from your room frequently.

, Assuming you’re not the shy type and don’t mind your loved ones seeing you at your most vulnerable, take small steps toward gaining your family's permission to go without clothes. Ask the people you live with how they would feel about casual nudity before trying it out to avoid creating an awkward environment. If they’re agreeable to the idea, you can appear naked more often, little by little, until it just becomes a fact of your household.Breach the topic by asking an earnest question like ""would it bother you if I wore fewer clothes around the house?"" By being straightforward, your family will understand that you're showing consideration for their feelings.
If someone around you seems put off or makes a critical comment about your nudity, it may be best to go clothed around them from then on.

, Make your family aware of your nudist tendencies by warning them when there’s a chance they might see more of you than expected. If someone knocks on your door or tries to come in to talk to you, for example, tell them flat out that you’re not wearing clothes, and that they should enter at their own risk. Choosing to come in anyway shows that they don’t mind, and even if they do, you’ll still get to enjoy being naked privately.


After a while of going naked in your own private space, it will start to seem less unusual to your family.
Try not to catch your loved ones off guard. It could be traumatizing for some to see a parent, child or sibling naked.

, The best way to prepare your family for seeing you naked after getting permission is to work your way up to it. Try lounging around in your underwear or a more revealing outfit than you normally wear. When you get out of the shower, tie a towel around your body and linger for a minute in the kitchen or living room where you’ll be seen. Once they get over their initial squeamishness, it won’t be a big deal for them to accept that you prefer to be naked at home.


Don’t go from wearing clothes to walking around naked overnight. Begin wearing less and less over time so that the transition isn’t so jarring.

, Once everyone has come to terms with your new behavior, it may be okay to reveal yourself briefly out in the open. Stroll by the family room with no fear, or creep down the hall to the bathroom in the middle of the night while you’re not wearing any clothes. This may come as a surprise the first few times if your loved ones aren’t used to it yet, but as long as you've made sure they're okay with your actions, they'll start to get used to it.Never blatantly parade your nudity in front of your family, or do it just to be seen.

, Bring up the fact that you’ve been going naked regularly as a source of humor. It will help alleviate the awkwardness and tension that a relative might be feeling if they’re persuaded to view it as something quirky or funny. Most topics lose their taboo aura when you can laugh at them.Treating your nudity as a joking matter can give you a chance to bring up the subject in a way that doesn’t feel weird.

, Talk to your family directly about why you feel more comfortable when you’re naked. Make it known that you don’t take issue with the ways that they choose to unwind, and that they should at least be considerate of yours. They may not understand at first, but you can help put them at ease with your decision by being direct.Explain that being naked is a healthy way of expressing appreciation for your body.
Be ready for your family members to disagree with your philosophy. Not everyone feels the same way about being naked around others.

, Pacify whatever protests may arise by sharing your belief that going nude is freeing. There’s nothing inherently dirty or immoral about being naked. And, since you’re family, you should already be used to seeing one another at your least presentable. Getting used to various levels of nudity around your family members might even make you feel closer.If you don’t treat nudity as an ugly, profane thing, there won’t be any reason to feel shame when you or a loved one isn’t wearing clothes.

, Your family might be accepting of your habit, but there may be certain times when they feel it’s inappropriate. Compromise by coming up with a set of conditions about when, where and around whom it’s acceptable to be naked. It might be okay if it’s just you at home, or if you keep it confined to your bedroom and bathroom. However, you should plan on putting something on when the grandparents come to visit or your parents are hosting a dinner party.


You should always make sure there are boundaries in place, even when it’s just your family around. Remember, you’re not the only person living in the house.

, Despite your insistence, your family simply might not like the idea of you walking around naked. Be conscientious and respect their wishes. You can still go naked when you’re alone, but you shouldn’t force anyone else to witness it. There’s a time and place for everything—it just may not be under a shared roof.The people around you have just as much of a right not to have to see you naked as you do to actually be that way.

Identify your leadership style and the role that you naturally tend to gravitate towards in groups.,

Attend all meetings, especially if you are the group leader.,
Listen to your colleagues.,

Be prepared for all group meetings.,
Practice before group rehearsals.",How to Be Good at Group Work," Consider your answers to the following questions:


What do you enjoy contributing and volunteering to do? What skills -- art, programming, writing, typing, etc. -- do you possess that could be valuable for the group?
How would you approach a brewing conflict between other group members? Would you step in and attempt to mediate it, or would you step back?
What are your dominant personality traits? Are you impulsive or cautious, creative or direct, outspoken or reticent, practical or idealistic?
What have others praised and criticized you for in the past?
What contributions have you made to past group projects that were influential in the direction the group ultimately took? Thinking about your past successes and failures will help you see concrete examples of your contributions.
What are your weaknesses? What are personality traits that you hope your fellow group members would possess in order to round out your weaknesses? How would you minimize the impact of your shortcomings in a group dynamic?;
, Brainstorm ways to adapt your traits in order to be a better fit with the group. Think of weaknesses that the existing group members collectively produce and find ways to fill in those holes by taking the initiative in assuming needed roles. As any effective group leader would, being proactive about predicting and tending to group needs will make you a dynamic, valuable and appreciated group member.

, This will keep you abreast of group proceedings and allow you to do your best work. You can't make contributions beyond your assigned responsibilities if you are absent from group discussions, as you won't have a clear big-picture view of your group's progress. Moreover, consistent attendance is the best way to demonstrate to your group that you are taking the project seriously and that you are invested in its success. This creates a positive feedback loop in which your colleagues will also care about the project because they see that everyone else cares; similarly, pushing the group to the lesser of your priorities risks demoralizing other members.

, You can't respect everyone unless you take their suggestions and comments seriously, and you can't do that unless you listen to the words coming out of their mouth. Resist the temptation to write people off at first glance. People are so much more than what they come off as, and the person who keeps staring out the window while others talk may actually be a creative genius.


During group brainstorms, write everything down, no matter how silly you may think the idea is. There's no need to cross things off early, and bad ideas will be thrown out eventually. You want to make sure that everyone is respected and thus feels comfortable shouting out their thoughts during brainstorming sessions. Moreover, ideas that may be unfeasible on their own can be seeds for a greater idea or combined with other ideas to be amazing.
Make sure that interruptions are minimized and that everyone has a chance to speak out. If outspoken people repeatedly trample over others, consider instituting some sort of hand-raising or rotating system so that everyone gets a chance to talk. After any discussion, ask if anyone has a last comment or question before moving on. Create opportunities for group members who may not feel comfortable speaking up to also get their comments heard. Sometimes when you force people to talk (i.e., if at the end of a meeting, you create a system in which everyone has to share their thoughts about the meeting), they'll provide some valuable insights that they might otherwise feel is unimportant to offer.

, Make sure everyone is taken seriously and that their assigned task reflects the fact that they are a valued group member. This is the best way to promote group harmony and ensure that everyone's talents will be taken advantage of to create the best product possible.


Asking for volunteers to complete tasks is a good idea because others may not be aware of a person's hobbies and personal talents. However, if no one volunteers after awhile, it may be prudent to ask if someone will take on the task. You may want to choose to make assignments in private discussions to avoid embarrassing someone who may really not want a particular task -- this is your call based on your assessments of the group dynamics.
People who are shy, quiet, etc. may initially be perceived as less valuable group members, but resist the temptation to act based on those judgments. You should not assume that someone won't take the group seriously unless they have repeatedly skipped meetings, failed to complete tasks, or otherwise bring nothing to the table. Give everyone a chance. Let their actions, not your or others' judgments, determine their commitment to the group.

, This means completing your assigned tasks before the deadline, knowing how to succinctly explain your progress, recognizing any weak spots for which you may need to solicit assistance from others, and preparing samples of your progress for the rest of your group to visualize.


If you can't make a deadline, it's important that you communicate that to your group leader or task manager a few days in advance. You should be proactive about predicting your responsibilities and not plan to leave things for the last-minute. With enough advance notice, your group can adjust its progress and potentially alter task delegations in order to still remain on track. Otherwise, you risk jeopardizing the success of your entire group.

, Too often, groups convene before presentation day in order to do a dress rehearsals, but group members assume that is the deadline for completing the project and leave no room for practicing individually beforehand. It's not. You should show up to dress rehearsals having already practiced your part of the presentation. You don't want to be the weakest link who's hindering the team's progress and wasting everyone else's time.

Do not yell, scream, or lash out violently.,
Stop and think about why you are mad at them.,
Channel your energy into a physical hobby or sport.,
Treat your family members as you would want to be treated.,
Consider all of the loving things that they do for you.",How to Be Nice to Your Family1," If it's become normal in your family to lash out by raising your voice, it's time that you work on changing that behavior for your entire family. Verbal and physical abuse can come in many forms and includes yelling, screaming, berating, hitting, slapping, or trying to humiliate someone.Instead of letting the argument escalate to that level, talk in a calm voice and get your opinions and views out without yelling or screaming.


Instead of getting personal just say something like ""I really didn't like that you went into my room and read my diary. Those are my personal thoughts and I want to keep them to myself.""
Older family members should set the example. The more that you yell and scream in your house, the more likely that children will emulate the behavior.If you are a younger person in the family whose elders yell and scream, it doesn't mean that it's the right thing to do. Remain calm and talk to your family members.
Saying things like ""calm down"" or ""it's not a big deal"" may make someone angrier. Try to see their point of view and the reasons they are mad instead of dismissing their feelings.;
, If you get angry often, it's important that you start to understand your anger and work towards reducing it when you're in conflict. Being angry consistently can take a physical and mental toll. Over an extended period it could lead to insomnia, high blood pressure, digestion problems, and depression.Be honest with yourself and think about why you are angry, then come up with potential solutions and compromises instead of losing your cool.


For example, if your parents asked you to raise your grades and you get angry, think about why you are angry. Are you angry that your parents are asking you to do something, or are you angry because you're having a difficult time in school and may need help? In the end they are looking out for your best interests.
Let negative feelings of entitlement go. Don't think things like ""It's not fair"" or dwell on not getting your way. It will make you angrier over time.Do not hold back your feelings or emotions to try to come off friendly or polite. If something bothers you, speak up, or else you may repress your anger, and it could come up at a later time., Engaging in physical activity releases endorphins in your brain that make you happier.If you find yourself getting mad frequently, it may be because of a lack of physical activity. Join a local sports team or club, or take up a hobby that involves exercise.


If you are child or teen, then join a sports team at your school or an intramural sport at the local community center.
If you are older, some hobbies to pick up include hiking, mountain climbing, biking, or going on a jog.
Being heavily involved in a hobby or sport will also get you away from your family more often, which may allow you to appreciate them.

, Sometimes known as the ""Golden Rule,"" treating others as you would want to be treated is a common expression in many religions and cultures.Think back to times where people have been mean, dismissive, or have tried to humiliate you in the past and work to re-live the emotions that you felt during that period. This should help you relate to your family members and how they feel when you are mean to them.


Think about a time when someone at school made fun of you in front of a crowd. Chances are you felt humiliated, embarrassed, and depressed. Realize that this is how your family members feel when you yell or scream in public, at them.
Treating others poorly encourages people to treat you in a similar way.

, If you have negative thoughts about people in your family, and you build resentment towards them, it's hard to break away from the mindset and consider all of the positive things that they do. Think of times in the past that they sacrificed to make you happier or times where you all enjoyed each other's company instead of concentrating on the negative moments.


If you're a teenager, think about what your parents provide for you like food, clothing, shelter, love, and education opportunities. If you are a parent, think about the joy that you felt when you first had them and try to be more understanding.
Another method you could use is to imagine how you would feel if you lost that family member that you have negative feelings for. This may make you appreciate them more."

Present the issue to your boyfriend.,
Use ""I"" statements to discuss your feelings.,
Ask him to change his behavior.",How to Get Your Boyfriend's Attention4," Initiate the conversation with a statement that plainly describes the issue you are having. Do not attach any feelings, interpretation, or blame to the statement. State it as a fact, not a option.


For example, ""Mike, we haven't spent much time together lately"" or ""Rowan, we aren't connecting like we used to."" , Expressing yourself with ""I"" statements allows you to take sole ownership for your feelings. Instead of saying ""You make me feel ____,"" you're stating ""I feel ____"".


For example, ""Over the past month, I felt like I wasn't a priority to you"" or ""Since school started, I feel like you have focused more on football than on our relationship."", Once you've explained the situation and how it's made you feel, it is time to ask him to take action. Think of what he needs to do to make you feel differently about the situation.


For example, ""Mike, I would really appreciate it if you would make time to hang out with me"" or ""Rowan, I know you are busy with practice and we can't see each other much during the week. Will you try to call me on your way home for practice everyday so we have a chance to catch up?"""

Do things around the house without being asked.,
Purchase or make gifts.,
Apologize when you're wrong.,
Support them through the rough times.",How to Be Nice to Your Family2," If you are a child or teen, then that means doing the chores or helping your parents or older siblings with tasks like taking out the garbage or cleaning the dishes. As an adult, you can do your best to create a positive environment for your family. You could prepare a freshly cooked meal, buy flowers to lighten up the mood, or make improvements on the house to improve everyone's life.


Clutter can create stress and tension. Make sure that you clear away clutter and do things around the house to improve your family's mood., Getting family members surprise gifts can lift their spirits and put them in a good mood. Buy something that they enjoy or something that they told you they wanted. A gift that has sentimental value will remind a person that you care and appreciate them.


Gift ideas include chocolate, flowers, a new video game, an instrument, or a Blu-ray of their favorite show.
If you don't have any money you can make a card, write them a note, paint them something, or pick a flower from a garden.

, When you realize you've done something wrong, it's important to apologize. Instead of letting time pass, approach the person you hurt and say you're sorry. Don't think about the act and whether you think it's justified or not. Instead, concentrate on how your actions made the other person feel. Take personal responsibility  for your actions and don't place the blame on others.


You can say something like, ""I'm really sorry about forgetting to let out the dog yesterday. It was really my fault and I'll try not to do it again.""

, Everyone goes through tough times and needs support. One of the best places to receive that support is through your family. Try to understand your family member's perspective and consider how they feel and why they feel that way. Give whatever support you can, but don't push the issue. Make them realize that you're there for them whenever they are ready to talk.


If you are an adult, try to stay away from being dismissive or saying things like ""get over it"" to younger family members. Even though the issue may seem trivial to you, it could be causing them immense stress.
If you are child or teen, try supporting older family members through rough times by helping out more around the house and doing nice things for them.
Be on your best behavior when your parents are working a lot or someone in your family is sick.
If a younger family member needs advice, make sure to be there for them.

Be open, honest, and polite.,
Listen to them without interrupting.,
If you get angry, walk away and talk to them later.,
Be respectful.,
Try to understand their point of view.",How to Be Nice to Your Family3," People in healthy, happy families have good communication. This begins with being open, honest, and polite to one another. Talk about everything from how your day went to your future aspirations so that you can better get to know each other.If you don't like something that they do, make sure to tell them. The more that you communicate, the less you'll have to guess what is on their mind because they will freely tell you.


Start by saying ""Hey how was your day?"" when you see family members when you get home.
You can communicate disapproval by saying something like, ""Jimmy, I know that you like to play games, but you need to limit it to three hours a day. It's cutting into your homework time and it's not good for you.""
Don't be afraid to tell your parents the truth if you've done something wrong. If they find out, and you didn't tell them, the consequences may be worse.

, Hearing someone out and truly listening to someone's problems strengthens your relationship with someone. Unfortunately, many people have never learned how to listen truly to someone else. Active listening involves giving them time to talk, acknowledging their problems and emotions, and trying to offer meaningful feedback.Silence is sometimes the best way to get someone to admit their mistakes. People will typically work problems out verbally when explaining something.
Don't act judgemental when someone is admitting or confessing something to you. This will prevent them from being open and honest in the future., One of the best ways to avoid an argument is to disengage in whatever conversation is making you angry. Disengage in a non-confrontational way and tell them that you will talk to them later. This will give you the time to cool down, and time to think about the situation.Say something like ""I need to cool down right now, but I do want to talk about this later. Do you mind if we talk about it in an hour?""
Make sure to revisit the point of conflict once you calm down. Do not totally avoid it or resentment could grow.

, As a child or teen, there are rules and regulations you should follow. Elders have more life experience and will likely know more about a situation than you. Speaking in a snide, sarcastic, dismissive, or angry tone is disrespectful, and many parents will get mad.Children and teens should learn from older people's mistakes and try to absorb as much information as they can.


Speaking in a negative way creates a negative environment which will hurt you in the long run.

, If you are teen or child, realize that much of what your older family members do is in your best interests even if it doesn't seem obvious at first. Their priority is to keep you safe, happy, and successful, and this may include forcing you to do things that you don't like to do. As an adult, remember to set guidelines for younger family members, but also try to relate with them. You don't have to be their best friends, but understand that they have a similar emotional range, even if different things trigger their emotions. Even if an issue may seem silly to you, fear, depression, anxiety, and anger are all emotions a younger family member could feel."

Accept that she's taller than you.,
Don't mention it.,
Be confident.",How to Date a Girl That Is Taller Than You1," There is nothing either of you can do to change the fact that she's taller. Think about what is really important in a relationship--Do you get along? Do you have chemistry? Do you have similar interests? Don't let something superficial and beyond your control ruin what could potentially be a wonderful, fulfilling partnership.Think about who actually cares about your height difference. Are you afraid people are going to laugh or make comments? Don't let other people's pettiness stop you from finding happiness.
If you truly can't get over the fact that she's taller than you, you may have some soul-searching to do. Ask yourself why it matters to you and if it truly makes a difference in the quality of your connection with someone.
If she turns you down because you're not tall enough, then forget about her. If she's not willing to see beyond a superficial difference, you're better off finding someone else.;
, You may think it's cute or cheeky to tease her about her height--opening with a line like ""What's the weather like up there?"" or ""Wow, do you play basketball? Can you dunk?""--is going to make you look insecure and make her feel awkward or even angry.She knows she's tall, and she's probably heard those lame jokes a million times. Make it clear you're interested in getting to know her and her personality and that you're not hung up on something superficial like her height.


One tall lady suggests treating a tall woman's height as you would a woman with an ample chest--even if it's part of her appeal, you would never walk up to a woman with large breasts and ask about her bra size.Unless she brings it up first, don't mention her height until you've gotten to know each other. Then you can tell her how her long legs are super sexy.If she addresses your height difference, tell her you don't think it's an issue. Let her know you think it's an asset, but it's not something you spend a lot of time worrying about., The most attractive characteristic in a man or woman is self-confidence and feeling good about who you are. If you are insecure about your height and constantly remind her of how much taller she is, or if you ask her not to wear heels because it makes you feel uncomfortable, you're going to look like you're not secure with who you are. It may also make her feel like you think something is wrong with her.Dating a tall woman will actually make you appear more confident. If you're a short guy and you're comfortable with your tall lady wearing heels, it will be clear that you feel good about yourself and your relationship, and that you have a great connection that is greater than stupid taboos.
Don't try to always stand somewhere so you're taller than her--like on a curb or one step above her on an escalator. She will notice what you are doing and it will suggest to her that you are not comfortable with yourself or the fact that she's taller."
"
Appreciate her height.,
Treat her like a lady.,
Remember that she likes you.,
Dress to look taller.",How to Date a Girl That Is Taller Than You2," The height difference is not something to just put up with, it's another quality to appreciate in your amazing partner.Even if you are comfortable being shorter than your girl, she may still feel awkward or worry that you are self-conscious about it. Once she knows you like her for her awesome personality, let her know that you think her height is just as cool as her wicked sense of humor, her ability to quote your favorite movies, her incredible math skills, and all the other things that make her special.Don't try to get her to slouch so she appears shorter or ask her to wear only flats.
Compliment her height and her long legs. Remind her that her stature only adds to her appeal.

, Most women will say they prefer a taller man because it makes them feel more feminine, since she's probably heard most of her life that to be bigger than a man in any way is a turn-off.If a tall woman has any insecurities about her height, it usually boils down to feeling like she's intimidating or ""mannish.""Make her feel feminine by putting your hand on the small of her back or around her waist. Put your arm around her when you're sitting next to each other. Don't discourage her from wearing heels if she wants to.She may appreciate it if you behave with a certain classic masculinity. Be assertive (but not rude or controlling). Make the first move and kiss her first.You can still be the big spoon while cuddling, you may just need to adjust how you would normally lie next to her. Or why not take a turn as the little spoon?, Certainly you are both aware that you're shorter than she is, but if she's going out with you, it means she doesn't care about that. She sees something in you that is more important that your physical appearance. The fact that she's not about to let the opinions of others stop her from dating you should make you feel confident in your relationship.

, You should only do this if you and your girlfriend have discussed the height difference and you both still feel uncomfortable with it. If you start trying to be sneaky and wear shoes that make you look taller just so you feel better, she's going to notice and think you're insecure.Wear boots or sneakers with a thicker sole. You can also get lifts to put inside your shoe, which makes you appear taller without having to wear a heeled shoe.
Wear tailored clothes with vertical stripes. Loose, baggy clothes can make you appear smaller or shorter in stature, and vertical stripes will make your body appear longer.Style your hair in a pompadour or spike it up with gel. The key is to keep it short on the sides but leave lots of volume up top.Stand up straight! Not only does good posture just look better, but you may find you're not that much shorter than your girlfriend after all. Keep your shoulders back and your head high. You'll even look more confident."

Spend time together.,
Make sure you spend enough time apart.,
Stay safe, both emotionally and physically.",How to Enjoy a Relationship in High School," This is a given in any relationship. Remember, since you're in high school - you have weekends off (Saturdays and Sundays), breaks off, (Thanksgiving break, Christmas break, Mid-winter recess, and Spring Break, etc.) as well as other days off. Use them all to your advantage. (Plus Summers). Even if you have stuff to do like schoolwork, chores, after-school activities/clubs, friends and family, you should be able to make time for each other. Even if you have to mark it down on your calendars, you should do it. Togetherness is a good thing for your relationship. Basically you have to spend face-to-face, quality, frequent time together to make it work. Carving out times for dates (etc). IF you go to the same school don't overdo the time together thing!;
, You need to have a separate life outside of your relationship. You need to be able to make sure that your boyfriend or girlfriend doesn't interfere with your chores, schoolwork or family or social life. Keep things in balance. Your romantic relationship can't get all of your attention, focus, energy and time, but you also need to make sure that you are capable of being an independent person.

It is also worth considering that the time apart will make you want to see the other person much more. If you are together all of the time, you may begin to become annoyed and irritated with each other and even start to bicker, which could be detrimental to your relationship.







, Your boyfriend or girlfriend should not hit, scream at, shout at, yell at, smack, punch, kick, bite, scratch, push, grab, shake, or throw you. You shouldn't do any of that to him or her either. Your boyfriend or girlfriend should not force you to have sex with him or her (i.e. rape), make you touch him or her, pressure you, or do anything else. You shouldn't do that to him or her either. Neither of you should tell the other's secrets and private info (between you two as a couple) to anyone else, blackmail you in any way, threaten you, call you names, or anything else like that. If a person is hurting you (emotionally, physically, sexually, or otherwise) you shouldn't put up with it. That's not healthy at all! The abuser has to get help or change. The victim must get out fast! Tell your parents. Many people and things can help (restraining orders, telephones to call police or 911, etc). Also, you should feel that your boyfriend or girlfriend will do anything in his or her power to protect - not hurt - you and your feelings and body.

Notice if she displays closed body language.,
Listen to the tone of her voice when she speaks to you.,
Check if she is not answering your calls or texts.,
Ask her close friends if she is upset.,
Reach out to her parents or other close family members.,
Talk to your mutual friends.,
Find a quiet, secluded place to talk.,
Bring a peace offering.,
Ask her directly what you have done wrong.,
Apologize and make amends.",How to Find Out if a Girl Is Mad at You," When you get angry or mad, you tend to display it non-verbally through behavior and body language. You should observe the girl for any signs of closed body language, such as clenched fists, a clenched jaw, and a lack of eye contact when you try to look at her or catch her eye. She may also cross her arms over her chest or position her body away from you when you try to approach her and speak to her.Other angry signs of behavior are shaking or trembling of the body as well as sweating and a red or flushed face. The girl may also frown at you, stare at you with a cold expression, or roll her eyes when you are around her.;
, If the girl speaks to you or about you when you are around her, pay attention to the tone of her voice. If she uses a mocking or strained tone, as if she is speaking through clenched teeth, she is likely not impressed with you. Similarly, she may use a sarcastic tone when you are mentioned in conversation or when you try to speak to her. She may mock you or make fun of you as a way to show you she is angry.

If the girl is very mad at you, she may display her anger more overtly by yelling at you or shouting at you. A raised voice is usually a sign of anger.

, The girl may express her anger by dropping her communication with you through phone calls or text messages. She may ignore your calls and voicemails and be unresponsive to your texts. You may find yourself sending out texts to her and not getting your usual quick reply or no reply at all.If the girl is texting you back, you may want to look at her messages more closely. Your usually funny stories via text may be only getting one word responses from her or the eye roll emoji. Your casual “what’s up” question may get short answers or answers in the form of a rhetorical question, such as, “how do you think I am?” This is likely a sign of passive aggressive anger on her part.You may also notice she is using punctuation in her text messages, specifically a period at the end of her messages. The use of a period at the end of a text message could be taken as a sign of aggression or anger., If the girl has cut off communication with you, in person or otherwise, you may want to contact her close friends to find out if she is mad. You may try getting in touch with her close friends at school or in the workplace. Ask her friend, “Have you spoken to her lately?” and “Do you know if she is upset at me?” The friend may be able to respond in the affirmative or contact the girl for you to get an answer.


Be respectful when you approach the girl’s close friends and do not pressure the friend if she does not want to share any information with you. She may advise you to try to speak to the girl directly, rather than trying to go around behind the girl’s back. Respect this advice and do not make the friend feel bad if she does not tell you what’s going on.

, You may also want to talk to members of the girl’s family, especially if she is close to her family and confides in them. Contact one of her siblings who knows you and is close to the girl. Politely ask the sibling if she knows if the girl is upset with you.


You may also want to reach out to the girl’s parents, especially if you know her parents well and have a good relationship with them.

, If you and the girl have mutual friends in common, you may want to approach the mutual friend to get more information about the girl’s state of mind. Ask the mutual friend if she has noticed that the girl has been acting aggressive or upset towards you and if she has said anything negative about you lately. This can help you gauge if the girl is upset.


If your mutual friends also seem upset at you or express anger towards you when you ask about the girl, this could be a sign that you are in hot water. The girl may have confided in the mutual friend, and as a result, the mutual friend may also be mad at you.

, Perhaps the most direct, and the most difficult, way to find out if the girl is mad at you is to speak to her one on one. Though it may be challenging, having a serious and honest conversation with her can help to address her anger, determine the cause of her anger, and potentially resolve the issue. You should speak to her in person, if possible, and ask her to meet you in a quiet, secluded area where you can talk privately. This could be in your apartment, in a park, or in your favorite hang out spot on campus.You may want to also give her the option of choosing the meeting spot, especially if she is upset at you. This will allow her to dictate the setting of your conversation and give her a level of control over the situation.

, It’s never a bad idea to bring a peace offering with you to a potentially emotional conversation, especially if you may be in the wrong. You may bring her something small and thoughtful, like her favorite drink or item of food. Or you may bring her flowers as a sign that you know she is upset and you feel bad for what you may have done.


Having a peace offering can also make starting the conversation with her easier, as you can hand her something she might appreciate and ease your way into the discussion.

, If you are not sure what you have done wrong, you may want to start the conversation by asking her directly why she is upset at you. You may say, “I’m aware you’re upset at me, but I’m not sure why. Can you tell me why?”Only do this if you are not aware of why the girl is upset at you. If you have a suspicion of why she may be upset, such as something you did recently that was unkind or something you said that was inappropriate, avoid asking her this question as this will likely make her even more angry at you.

, If you are aware of what you have done wrong, you should make a heartfelt apology to her. Start by acknowledging what you did wrong and then go into a clear apology. For example, you may say, “I understand that you are angry at me for missing your birthday last week. I got caught up in my work and neglected your special day. I am so sorry I did that and I promise it will not happen again.”Once you have apologized, you should ask her, “Will you accept my apology?” If she says yes, you should show your gratitude and be humble.
You should also make amends for your mistake through action. This could be making it up to her for missing an important milestone or event by taking her out for a special dinner or night out, just the two of you. Or you could adjust your behavior in the future so you do not do inappropriate things that will make her upset.

If you normally wear conservative clothing and think a low-cut shirt will make him want you more(and vice versa), it will probably just make things more awkward because you'll be uncomfortable, which will cause you to act out of character.;
, One might like a lot of enhancing makeup, while another might enjoy you more natural. One might think that your crop top is cute, another might think it makes you look too over the top. A lot of people don't go on blind dates, so you should get a feel for what they like. It is okay to wear a V-Cut shirt if you think he might like it, but be careful to follow the step above as well.

, Make an effort to hold a conversation with him, or else he will feel like it's his responsibility. Don't force conversation, but don't let him keep it up alone. Dripping over his every word is fine, but don't be such a ditz that you can't pick up the topic yourself and move with it.

, Avoiding the gaze of your date may be cute or flirty in your eyes, but he may see it as discomfort on your part. Staring is a little creepy, but looking into his eyes often is a good thing.

, Guys love it when you pay attention to them. Talk about his classes, any sports he's involved in, his friends, and anything else you can think of.

, This isn't too hard. If you really like the guy, little things like smiles, glances, and touches will come naturally if you overcome shyness.

, Guys love confident girls, for a lot of reasons. One is because a girl who is always isn't confident, or just acts that way, gives a lot of mixed signals. A confident girl who speaks up gives guys a good idea about what she wants. Don't mix up confidence with heavy independence. While you should say what you want, be careful that you don't seem too independent. It might turn a guy off if you always want things your way, or if he thinks if you will never really need him.

, Don't be too demanding on your choice of food or items if the guys is buying for you.

, The first time you look at your reflection and say, ""Ugh, my hair will not work today!"", he'll see one of those people. The kind that always primp in the mirror, always need to lose just three more pounds, or are always shopping for a cute new top. It will make you seem shallow and not worth it.

, Perfectly romantic dates are rare. If you really want to date the guy, kissing will come soon enough.

If you love the way that you look and are proud of your appearance, then the boy will be able to tell and will start to love how you look, too. If you are not happy with your appearance, you may need to spend some time working on loving yourself before you try to attract a boy.


Wear clothes that make you feel pretty and comfortable. If you feel uncomfortable or self-conscious in tight clothes, then it'll show.
Take good care of yourself. Doing things like working out, eating well, getting your hair and nails done, and taking time to put on scented lotion will increase a man’s attraction for you and make you feel better about yourself as well.;
, Any boy will be much more likely to fall in love with you if you love what you do and feel more positive about the things in your life. If you make it known that you're happy pursuing your interests, schoolwork, or career, then he'll be more inclined to want to get to know you.If you're in school, don't complain about your classes and teachers. Instead, focus on the things you do love and why they make you happy.
Love your extra-curricular activities and interests. Don't complain about soccer practice; instead, talk about how excited you are for Friday's game. Who wants to be around a person who doesn't like anything she's doing by choice?

Stay positive. Whenever you talk about what you're doing that weekend or what your day looked like, say five positive things for every one negative thing. It's okay to complain once in a while, but complaining all of the time is a turn off.

, Getting someone to love you if you don’t love yourself may be impossible. If you want a boy to fall in love with you, then you have to love who you are and be proud of the person you're becoming. To love yourself, try some of the following techniques:Understand your strengths. Think of the top five things that make you remarkable -- write them down, if you have to. Then, use them to your advantage. Make the most of your good attributes by showing them off as much as possible. For example, if you know you have an amazing sense of humor, then flaunt it in front of your boy.
Address your flaws. Loving who you are doesn't mean thinking you're flawless -- in fact, if you're aware of at least three qualities you need to work on, then you'll only love yourself more as you try to improve your problem areas.

, As you work on loving how you look, loving what you do, and loving who you are, your confidence will skyrocket. If you're confident and comfortable with yourself, your boy will feel more confident about you as well.To project your confidence, learn to speak clearly, stand up for yourself, and be comfortable enough with yourself to laugh at yourself now and then.


Remember that there's a difference between being confident and being arrogant. If you end up bragging about how great you are all the time, then that will be a turn off as well.

, If you want a boy to love you, then you have to look like a fun person to be around. Whenever he sees you, you should have a big smile on your face, do something silly, and be giggling or laughing with a group of friends. If you're a fun person, you'll become magnetic, and more people will want to hang around you because it'll be a guaranteed good time.Be adventurous. Fun people are okay with going out of their comfort zones to have a good time. Are you afraid of riding a unicycle, learning to do the foxtrot, or going hiking? Well, transfer your fear into positive energy, and you'll get more out of life.
Don't be afraid to be goofy or just plain silly. You don't have to be an aloof model type to get a guy to fall in love with you. Show that you don't take yourself too seriously by wearing silly t-shirts, dressing up for theme parties, and even telling jokes that make people groan.
Just look like you're having a good time. Be the person that everyone at the party gravitates toward by being animated, gesturing, and being excited whenever an old friend walks through the door. If you look like the most fun person in the room, your boy will notice you for sure.

, Your body language can be essential in grabbing your guy's attention. Your body can get your guy interested before you even say a word, so it's important to get it right and not send him the wrong message from across the room. Here's how you can get a guy's attention with a few subtle moves:


Don't be afraid to make eye contact. Lock eyes with the boy, let him know you see him, and then smile and look away. Don't stare -- just make eye contact for long enough to get the guy's attention. You can also try raising your eyebrows at him for a quick second to get his attention.Don't cross your arms over your chest. Keep them at your sides or use them to gesture. This will make you look open and approachable.
Stand tall. Good posture will show that you're confident, and that you're comfortable with being who you are.
Tilt your head. Tilting your head shows interest in a conversation and let’s him know you are engaged and listening.

, Don’t be afraid to blush. Blushing is caused by blood rushing to the cheeks which makes them a pink or red color. This is attractive because it mimics the body’s response to sexual activity, and is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation to attract the opposite sex. You can try creating this effect with some pink blush and red lipstick. Go easy with the make up so you don’t end up looking garish.

, If you want the guy to start falling in love with you, you have to show that you're interested by flirting a bit. You don't have to come on too strong to be able to keep up light banter with the guy, tease him a bit, and just be playful when you talk to the boy.


Keep up a light banter. If he says something quick and funny, don't just laugh -- fire back an equally cute and funny comment. Then you can laugh to show him how much you're enjoying the conversation.
Tease him. If you and the guy are comfortable enough with each other, then you can gently tease him for one of his interests -- like his obsession with his dog or guitar -- or even lightly poke fun at something he's wearing while obviously letting him know he looks good.
If you really want to flirt, touch him lightly on the shoulder from time to time to get closer to him. Many guys find soft touches attractive., If a boy falls in love with you, then he has to think that you're completely special in some way. Otherwise, why should he love you and not someone else? Let him know what makes you a unique person who is worth loving.Be yourself. Let him see who you really are, even if you think you're a bit nerdy, a bit shy, or just afraid to really open up to any boy. He can't love you if he doesn't really know you.
Open up. Let him know a bit more about your dreams or your fears. You should only do this once you get to know him better. If you've always wanted to be a pastry chef or event planner, let him know.
Talk about your interests. Let him know what makes you want to get up in the morning -- whether it's learning French, volunteering at the local homeless shelter, or just spending time with your best friends.

, One way to get a guy hooked on you is to demonstrate that other guys find you attractive too. This does not mean that you should flirt with other guys in front of him or try to make him jealous, but keep seeing other guys if he has not committed to you yet.If he complains about you dating other guys, just let him know that you would be happy to just see him if he wants to be in an exclusive relationship with you. But don't stop seeing other guys until it is clear that he is also going to stop seeing other girls.

, If you want him to stay in love with you, then you can't just let him worship you. You have to show that you care about who he is as a person too.After all, you want to be in love too, right? Here's how to show that you really care about him as a person:


As you get to know each other, ask him questions about his personal life. Talk to him about his childhood, his family, and his background.
Take an interest in his work or studies. If he's really into science or history, talk to him about those subjects instead of brushing him off.
Ask his opinion. Ask what he thinks about different subjects, from your newest outfit to world affairs. Show that his perspective really matters to you.
Understand his moods. Learn to be extra supportive if he's having a bad day.

, You don't have to smother him with praise to let him know that he's truly special, but you should give him a sincere compliment now and then. You can compliment him in person, through texting, or by leaving a note at his desk or his locker. This will let him know that you're thinking about how great he is.


Try complimenting him for something he excels at. For example, you might say something like, ""Dinner was delicious! You are such a good cook!"" Or, ""I really enjoyed your show last night. You are such a talented musician!""Only compliment him when you really mean it. Don't give him false praise just because you think it'll make him like you more.

, If you want to keep the guy hooked, then you should not only let him know how unique he is to you, but make him love picking your brain and talking to you about almost any subject. If he's only attracted to you physically or just thinks you're a fun girl, he won't stay in love with you forever.


Try playing board games together. The mental challenge and competition of games like Scrabble or chess will peak his interest in you.Be up to date on current events. A lot of boys love politics and reading the paper, so you should do this too so you can keep up your end of the conversation.
Read more in general. Reading more will expand your mind and will give you more to talk about in general.
Don't ever be bored. Only boring people are truly bored. Be excited about your life and the world around you, and he'll only want to spend more time with you.

, Though you may think that the boy will only stay in love with you if he sees you every second of every day, the opposite is actually true. Your boy will be much more likely to stay in love with you if he sees that you have a life of your own, that you have some of your own friends, and that you're OK with just spending some time alone.Don't try to have the exact same schedule as the boy. Keep up your sports, outside friends, and hobbies. If you drop everything just to be with him, then it'll look like you don't value your own goals very much.
You and the boy don't have to have the exact same friends. Continue having ""girl time"" and let him have his ""boy time"" -- your relationship will be healthier if you don't spend all of your social time together.
Stay busy. He'll want you more if he knows that your schedule isn't wide open and that you can't have him whenever you want.

, If you want the boy to stay interested, then you have to keep mixing it up. Don't do the same old thing every day or he'll begin to get tired of the same old routine. You should try to make the relationship always feel new and exciting no matter how long you've been together.


Pursue a new hobby together. Pick a new hobby to do together, whether it's learning how to make the best cupcakes in the world or becoming master golfers. If you do something new together every month, then your relationship will continue to feel new.Discover new places together. Don't go to dinner at the same restaurant every Friday night. Find a new place to eat and keep things interesting.
Go out of your comfort zones together. You should both do something that makes you feel squeamish -- whether it's learning to surf or conquering your fears of spiders.
Find a new way to tell your boyfriend how much you love him. Don't just say ""I love you"" every time -- be creative when you tell him how you feel.

, If you're falling out of love, or not really feeling the love to begin with, then there's no point in forcing something that just isn't there. This will only make you both miserable. It's better to cut things off once you both know it will never work instead of letting the relationship die a slow, painful death.


Be honest. If you really think it's not working, sit down and have a talk about parting ways.
Don't be discouraged. Most people fall in love more than once in a lifetime, and you have a whole lifetime of falling in love with boys -- and one day, men -- ahead of you.

You probably won't be winning the girl over if she's head-over-heels in love with her current boyfriend. If the two of them are just so happy together that it makes you gag, then it'll be hard to find your opening. But if you find her looking or acting unhappy or unsure in her current relationship…that's when you can start to make your move. Without acting like you're prying too much, try to get a sense of how the girl is really feeling about her relationship to know if you should move forward.


If you hang out with her and her boyfriend, see how they are together. Does she seem bored, not that interested, sad, or the opposite -- like she's trying too hard to look happy? Of course, it's hard to really get a sense of a relationship from the outside, but if you carefully observe them together, you may get a clue.
If you know she has a boyfriend, see if she'll mention him around you. Give her an opening by saying, ""What are you up to this weekend?"" or asking something seemingly innocent about her day. If the girl is not into you or is trying to ward you off, then she will definitely mention the boyfriend so you don't get the wrong idea. But if you hang out for a while or have a long conversation, and her significant other never comes up, you may start to wonder how happy she really is...;
, Give her an opening. If you do learn that she has a boyfriend, try to get her to open up about it without creeping her out. The worst thing you can do is try to bad mouth her boyfriend, say he's a loser, or just talk about how much better you are than him. Remember that subtlety is key -- you want her to figure out what an amazing guy you are all on her own. So, instead, casually giver her opportunities to talk about him, and see if she begins to complain about him on her own. Here are some innocent questions you can ask or things you can say:


""Wow, three years is a long time to be with one person. You must really like each other.""
""It must be nice to spend so much time with your boyfriend.""
""It's cool that you and your boyfriend don't hang out all the time.""
""Being in a relationship must be pretty comforting…""

, This is key if you want to make your move. If the girl just isn't all that interested in you, then you won't have a chance to really get her to see you as boyfriend material. You have to look for the clues and hints that let you see that she really does like you and think of you as more than a friend. If she just looks at you as a friend and confidant, then you're in trouble (more on that later). Here are some signs that she really does like you as more than a friend:


She goes out of her way to talk to you, even making excuses to do it
She stays online for a while on Facebook or gchat when she knows you'll be on, as if she's waiting for you to message her
Her face lights up when she sees you
She starts opening up to you, revealing personal information
She compliments you a lot, maybe even telling you what a great guy you are
She starts to reveal that she's not happy in her relationship
She flirts with you by laughing, being playful, and teasing you

, You may think you have the girl wrapped around your little finger, when she says something like, ""It's so great to have such an amazing friend like you."" If you hear this -- run away as fast as you can! Once you've gotten in the Friend Zone, it's pretty hard to get out of there. Make sure that she sees you as a potential romantic partner, not as one of her BFFs. Here are some signs that you may be in the Friend Zone:


See if she treats you like a brother instead of as a romantic prospect. If she's too comfortable around you, belching, not caring about what she's wearing at all, making kind of gross comments, and generally getting all buddy-buddy, then you may be in trouble.
If she does talk to you about her boyfriend, see how she does it. If it's in the tone of, ""I'm not happy with my boyfriend, and I like you so much better…"" then, cool. But if it's more like, ""Will you be my BFF/sounding board/surrogate mother as I complain about this guy I'm going to inevitably marry?"" then, not so good. Either way, don't let her complain about her boyfriend to you too much, or she may really be taking advantage of you as just a friend.

, Of course, you should give yourself the benefit of the doubt, assuming you're a good judge of character who knows that this girl is different from the rest and that she's really worth fighting for. But just in case you're getting a little too close to have a good sense of the situation, you should know which types of girls with boyfriends are poison and are to be avoided at all costs. You want this to go somewhere, right? If so, then here are some gals you may want to steer clear of, no matter how cute they are:


The girl who is just using you to make her boyfriend jealous.
The girl who loves to flirt with you. If she's been flirting with you for months and it hasn't gone anywhere, then it probably won't go anywhere.
The girl who wants a new BFF. Maybe she's sick of all her female friends and needs a new buddy. Watch out if it's you.
The girl who lets you wine and dine her and then goes home to her boyfriend. Don't waste too much time or money on her if she's not actually going to leave the man who should be taking her out.

, If you want to get the girl to like you, then you can't hit on her, touch her, or be disrespectful to her. After all, she officially has a boyfriend, right? She wants to be with a guy who takes her and her relationship seriously, not someone who is careless about crossing boundaries. Let her see what a gentleman and a nice guy you are, without seeming too nice, like someone she can walk all over. Basically, if you make her like you by being kind and caring toward her without hitting on her, she'll start falling for you.


She may think, ""So many guys hit on me while knowing I have a boyfriend. It's so cool how different he is…""
Again, this doesn't mean you should get into the Friend Zone. It does mean that you should let her see that you like spending time with her and care about who she is, not about stealing a kiss.

, Leave just enough hints that you like her and wait for her to take the bait. Sure, you can invite her to a party or a group thing, but it will be even better if you give her time to ask you to hang out or to spend time together. If she takes the initiative, then you'll have a better sense that she really does like you and wants to get out of her current relationship.


Casually mention a movie or a band that's playing soon. See if she asks you to go.
If you have class together, you can talk about it and get her to mention that she wants a study buddy.
Maybe you're both walking out of the same place together. If you mention that you're hungry or could use some caffeine, she may ask you to grab something with her.

, Soon, you'll start hanging out together a bit more, and you should make the most of that time. Let her see how funny, charming, chill, and all-around great you are. This doesn't mean you should hide your true self, but it does mean that you should put your best foot forward. Let her see that you're someone who treats her right and someone she really clicks with. Bonus points if you find yourself doing something she really loves.


Try to get some alone time with her without being too forward. This is the best way for her to see what it would be like if you were really dating.

, When the time is right, let her see that you do like her as more than a friend. You don't have to come out and say that you're falling for her, but you should make it clear that you have at least some romantic intentions. You can let her know this through simple compliments, or through your actions. Here are some ways you can get the message across:


Give her meaningful compliments. Say something like, ""I've never met a girl like you before,"" or ""It's just so easy to talk to you. I can talk to you for hours."" Let her know that she really stands out to you.
Be thoughtful around her. Bring her a cup of coffee when she needs one. Text her to check in to see how her math test went. Let her know that you're thinking about her -- without coming on too strong.

, Find a way to make things new and exciting when you're together. Don't just be the sounding board for all of her complaints about her boyfriend. Instead, do something fun and spontaneous. Start singing in the middle of a conversation to make her laugh. Act like a goofball if a kid starts trying to play with you at a park. Show that you don't take yourself too seriously, and she'll be falling for you.


If she's in a bad relationship, then she's probably tired of the tears, the doubts, the crying. She wants something fun, easy, and lighthearted. Don't get into serious talks about ""the status of your relationship"" before you're in one!
When she's upset, try to make her laugh. She may not want hours of soul-searching conversation with you, just yet.

, You want her to see you as something completely new and different. Don't act like you think her boyfriend acts but better -- act like yourself. If her boyfriend is a sports fanatic but you're more into your guitar, then great. She probably wants something new anyway. If her boyfriend is loud and a scene-stealer and you're more mellow, she may be looking for a more calming presence.


Be yourself and show her how different you are and how a relationship with you wouldn't just be a better version of her current relationship, but like something completely different.
If her boyfriend comes up, don't ever compare yourself to him. You don't want to look insecure or jealous.

, If she's not happy in her current relationship, then chances are it's because she doesn't doesn't feel that loved and appreciated anymore. That's where you come in, showing her that she really is special and that everything about her stands out to you. Make comments or give her compliments that make it clear that she's one of a kind (without freaking her out, of course). Here are some things you can say:


""I've never met a girl who is as confident as you are.""
""You're so good at talking to new people. How do you do that?""
""I feel like I can talk to you about nothing for hours. That's a real skill.""
""I always feel so happy when I'm around you.""

, Once you've made your intentions clear and it's pretty obvious that she likes you, then it's time to get serious. You have to read the situation to get the best sense of what to do, but it's probably best to have a conversation where you tell her flat-out that you like her and would like to be her boyfriend. You don't have to convince her that you'd make a great boyfriend; she should be able to see that for herself just by being around you. Let her know how you feel and wait for her to take it from there.


Though it's scary to put the ball in her court, you can't tell her to dump her boyfriend and be with you. All you can do is make your feelings known and trust that she makes the right decision. If she's not ready to make a big move, then you have to give her time and space. And if she's really not ready, then it may be time to back off. After all, you can't wait for ever and have your own life to live.

, You did it! You made a girl who has a boyfriend fall for you. Now she broke up with her boyfriend, and the two of you can live happily ever after. Unfortunately, that may not be exactly how it pans out. After she ends her relationship, she will probably be very upset and may need some space, no matter how bad it was.


You may feel like you waited for this so long that all you want to do is to spend time with her, but if you want it to last, then you have to respect her privacy and give her the distance she needs.
She may claim she doesn't need any space and will want to spend 24/7 with you, but you can't let this happen. You don't want her just moving from one guy to the next without processing what happened.

, Sure, you may be curious about what happened during the breakup or what her boyfriend is up to, but in the end, it's not really your business. She may not be ready to talk about what happened, and if it was a long relationship, it could take months, or even a year or more, for her to really open up to you about the relationship. She may have feelings of guilt, confusion, or sadness about it, and may really just not want to talk about it. Don't push it by bringing it up.


You may be dying of curiosity to know how it ended and how everything was between her and her boyfriend, but you have to focus on your own relationship instead of getting sidetracked.

, Though it may feel artificial, at first, you should stop talking about how you got together, how you courted her while she had a boyfriend, and how unhappy she was in her past relationship. Instead, work on talking about how you're doing today, and all of the fun things that lie ahead for you. The past will come up naturally from time to time, but if you obsess over it, then you won't be able to move forward.


Don't get jealous or paranoid, wondering if she's talking to other guys, either. This just won't work for you (unless you have real reasons to care, of course).
Work on living in the present and planning ahead when you need to, not rehashing what happened two months ago.

, Find things that you and the girl like to do together that are completely different from anything either of you have done before. Maybe you both get really into hiking. Maybe you're determined to try every sushi restaurant in the city. Maybe you start your own book club or get obsessed with the same TV show. Whatever you do, find things that you two can do together that remind you of each other and each other only. Enjoy exploring life together and finding a love and passion for (some of) the same things; this will build a strong foundation for your love and will keep it going.


Work on finding ways to make your relationship as fresh, exciting, and romantic as possible while also giving each other some breathing room. Remember that you don't have to do everything together to be happy.

Rethink telling her that you were with your guy friends the other night when you were really with a girl from class as a part of study group. Never answer a question with a lie.
Betrayal, even the smallest kind, can derail a relationship and cause your girlfriend to distrust you completely, especially if it touches on a scar from a past relationship that hasn’t yet healed. And it is hard to recover from.

, Healthy relationships are a result of healthy, honest communication.It’s always better to hear firsthand what happened, and to seek forgiveness then. Being open extends to letting her know pertinent information as well.


Not presenting facts from the start makes you look deceptive and like you were hiding something. Even something small could look ten times worse if you aren’t honest about it from the start.Keeping your girlfriend in the loop to support you during challenges is equally important in moments of joy as well. Not only will you feel like you matter, but she’ll feel like she matters too because you share those special moments, like getting a promotion or receiving an acceptance letter from a school you’ve been dying to get into, with you too., Grabbing an innocent cup of coffee with a female friend can raise suspicions for a girlfriend having trouble with trust if you gloss over details and she has to hear it from someone else.


Just be forthcoming and, on the day of, state: “I’m grabbing coffee with Sasha today. Cool?” It is a simple way to be honest while showing her that her opinion matters at the same time.
If you aren’t hiding, she doesn’t need to be unnecessarily concerned so keep her up to date on what you’re doing with the opposite sex, even if you are just friends.

Where do you usually pass each other in a hallway?,
Be sure to make eye contact so he knows you are talking to him.

,
Use his name.,
Write a note during your class and drop it on top of his books.,
Talk about something that just happened in class.,
Remember: if you feel awkward being around him, consider your relationship.,
If you are in the same class as him try to sit next to him, then make a joke about something in the room, the posters, the students, or the teacher.",How to Catch Your Boyfriend's Attention when Passing Him at School," Is it during the bustling time when people are pushing each other around or starting a mosh pit? Make sure your timing is good so that chances are he will hear you.;
,, Instead of saying ""Hey!"" which could be meant for anyone in the hall at the moment, say ""Hey Ryan!"" (or whatever his name is)

, Passing notes in the hall can't get you a detention and it shows him that you are interested in talking to him. In the note, write him your new number, a place to meet after school, or just tell him you are so happy to be with him.

, You may just want to say hi, but he may think you want to strike up a conversation (albeit a very short one).

, Do you guys talk enough? Do you go on dates? Give your relationship sometime but if these feelings continue, it may mean that you should think about breaking up. A relationship is about two people who feel a great bond between each other that is more than ""buddies"". In some cases this may get confusing but ""just friends"" may be better than dating.

, He will probably laugh, and chances are that he will make an even funnier joke as a response. Soon you'll be having one of the best ever conversations with your bf.

Make sure you trust her.Without your trust for your girlfriend, she definitely won't be able to trust you.,
Tell her things that no one else in the world knows about you.,
Be your girlfriend’s support system.,
Practice patience with her trust issues.,
Be consistent with how you show her love.",How to Earn Your Girlfriend's Trust2," Understand that some things fall beyond trust, including putting yourself into tempting situations.

, Actions like that paired with your consistency in following through with your words will help her slowly but surely develop trust in you.

, As the boyfriend of someone who has trust issues, it is not your job to fix her or her situation. Instead, it is your job to play a supportive role.Ask her for her story and listen to her fears. From a place of concern ask her: “I know you’ve been hurt before, can you share with me what exactly happened?”
Suggest that she see someone professionally or read books to help her with coping strategies and to assist her in discovering why her past plays such a huge role in the present relationship you have with her., Your girlfriend is more than likely trying just as hard as you are to get over her lack of trust, so trust her and the process. Asking her to trust you is not going to create trust. Instead, rely on patience to be your guide in helping the relationship rise above trust issues. The road to trust is a long process that will encounter setbacks and obstacles along the way. It is a slow process as well, so don’t expect an overnight turnaround in her ability to trust you more.
If it takes her a while to take down her guard for you, be understanding and patient about it. Encourage her to share more parts of herself by sharing more personal details about yourself.

, Make time for your relationship. Give her love, appreciation, and support in some form or other daily.Ask her how she is doing or about her day. When she is feeling distant or withdraws out of fear, ask her gently how you can help: space, closeness?

Be apologetic and own up to your mistakes.,
Explain your motivations in your betrayal.,
Forgive yourself for what you have done.,
Ease the relationship back to normal.",How to Earn Your Girlfriend's Trust3," Reveal whatever secrets you might have been keeping, but note that she does not have to know every detail about your indiscretions.

For example: “I know I lied about who she was to me and I know that dishonesty hurt you, but I promise nothing happened and I really want to make things work with you because I love you. You’re the only woman I want. I’m sorry I jeopardized that with my actions. Please forgive me.”Give her space. If she would like time to decide what her next move is, allow her as much as she needs.

, It lets your girlfriend know that you have a reason behind why you did what you did and helps to rebuild the trust that was lost.Talk about what made you do what you decided to do. What were you feeling? Scared? Overwhelmed? Insecure? Relay those feelings to your partner to gain sympathy and understanding. For example: “I felt like it was okay to go out with another girl because honestly, I’ve been feeling disconnected from our relationship lately and I’ve just wanted a break. Maybe it was self-sabotage in a way…”
Talk about why the betrayal won’t happen again in the future. Disclose how her pain has made you feel – how awakening it’s been, etc. For example: “I see how distraught and offended you feel by my actions. I don’t want to be the one that hurts you ever again. I don’t want to do this to us ever again. It’s really opened my eyes about what I have with you and what I don’t want to lose.”

, If your girlfriend is able to move past the betrayal, accept your apology, and forgive you, but you aren’t, only half of the relationship is being sustained. , Embrace whatever leftover awkwardness there may be. Go back to who you were as a loyal, loving boyfriend.Note how much more difficult it is to earn back trust once you are the one who caused to be lost.
Rely on the negative feelings that came about as a result of your betrayal and the potential of the loss of the relationship to keep you from doing it again.

Be there for her.,
Be tender with her.,
Talk about how she's feeling.,
Be an active listener.,
Remind her of what's true.",How to Cheer up Your Girlfriend1," Whether your girlfriend is experiencing a bad day, has been hurt by someone, is stressed, or is angry, be there for her in her present mood. It can be easy in times when someone isn't really fun to be around to ignore them or spend your time elsewhere. However, no matter what mood your girlfriend is in, you can be the most supportive person by sticking by her side.If your girlfriend is looking down in the dumps, don't assume she doesn't want to be with you. Continue to try to spend time with her, inviting her to do things with her or just sitting with her while she mopes. You can ask her if she needs anything, but mainly you just want to show her that you aren't going to desert her in her time of need. Don't be too pushy though -- give her the space she needs. Feel out the situation and see if she wants your company or not.;
, Sometimes all your girlfriend may need is a sweet hug or tender touch from you. If you notice that your girlfriend looks upset or is feeling down, embrace her in a strong hug or hold her in your arms. She may not speak or open up much during this time, but just sitting next to you and being comforted by your physical touch may be enough to help lighten her mood.The most important thing to do when your girlfriend is upset is be patient with her. She may act a little more moody, or may be more prone to become irritated by things you do. Just give her time to recover and cheer up and don't try to force her into a cheery mood. Also, if it is taking longer than you anticipated for her to cheer up, don't ask her ""When are you going to cheer up?"" That's likely just going to make her more upset., Your girlfriend may be going through something difficult, or she may be just experiencing a gloomy day. Either way, some people just need to vent and talk about their feelings so that they can ease their mind a little. Ask her how she's feeling and if she wants to talk about it. If she does choose to open up, don't try to fix her problem or pity her. Just be understanding and try to encourage her.Some questions you can use to initiate this conversation are ""How are you today?"" ""I notice you aren't acting like yourself... is something wrong?"" ""It seems like something is bothering you... do you want to talk about it?""
If your girlfriend is hesitant or doesn't want to talk about something, don't pry. Give her the time she needs to think through things. She may just be having a bad day and doesn't really have much to say about it, so don't assume something is terribly wrong.
If your girlfriend is upset or mad about something, you may just need to give her space. She may not be in the mood to talk about it or she may get angry if you probe her too much. If you are sensing this is the case with your girlfriend, don't ignore her, but try to allow her to come to you with whatever is bothering her before you ask her.

, Sometimes in relationships you want to fix the other person's problems or you feel so burdened by them that you want to take them upon yourself. If your girlfriend is opening up to you, don't immediately try to fix her problems. Many times people don't want a solution to their problem -- they just want an ear to listen. Focus your energy on listening well and encouraging her by telling her things will be all right. Don't give her suggestions for how she can fix her problem.One way to show your girlfriend you are truly listening to her is by summarizing what she said, so that she knows you are paying attention. After your girlfriend has expressed something, pause, and then say something like ""so you're saying you are feeling this way because...""Validate your girlfriend as she talks to you. Explain to her how you appreciate her opening up to you.

, Your girlfriend may be in a situation where she is feeling insecure about herself or believing lies about herself that society or others have tried to push onto her. In those moments, remind your girlfriend of what is true.


If she is really stressed about a test and doesn't feel she can handle it, remind her of all of the ways she has succeeded in school. If she was rejected from a job, remind her of all of her good qualities and that the job hunt just takes time. If she is feeling insecure about her looks, remind her how beautiful she is.
If your girlfriend is experiencing personal loss, like someone in her family or one of her friends died, you don't need to remind her of what is true. Comfort her, be a listener, and express your sympathy. You can ask her if she wants to talk about it or how she is doing, but don't try to present the ""glass is half-full"" approach. You don't need to dwell on the loss, but you also don't want to undermine it by just reminding her things will get better, or of all of the good things going on in her life. In this situation just love her and comfort her."

Go on a walk together.,
Make her laugh.,
Watch a marathon of her favorite show with her.,
Go out dancing.,
Learn a new skill together.,
Offer to give her a massage.,
Take her to her favorite restaurant.,
Make her dinner.,
Take her to a puppy store.,
Buy her a special gift.,
Plan a special day together.",How to Cheer up Your Girlfriend2," A walk is often a great way to rid the mind of stressors and provide a relaxing time to reflect. Being out in open air can often refresh people and it gives them exercise which can create endorphins (which help boost your mood). If your girlfriend is feeling down, go on a walk with her and allow her to vent if she needs to, or talk about things that will help distract her., Nothing can lighten a heavy mood more than laughter. Crack some jokes around your girlfriend that you know she would laugh at. If she's feeling especially down, she may have a hard time laughing, so just keep on trying until you get her to crack a smile. Don't make light of whatever she is experiencing, but throw in some humor that is completely unrelated to her circumstances.Sometimes the bad jokes are the best jokes to make someone cheer up. Tell your girlfriend a ""dad joke"" or something really corny. She may laugh out of the fact that he joke is so bad or pitiful.

, Sometimes when people are upset, they just need some time to be lazy and veg out. If you and your girlfriend have some extended time together, ask her if she wants to watch her favorite show. Grab some popcorn, snacks, and candy and spend hours in front of the tv.


Sometimes this is a good approach to cheer someone up for the time being, but it doesn't always help in the end. After you have indulged in hours of tv, consider doing something that will refresh and revitalize you. Go on a run or take a walk outside for some fresh air and exercise.

, This is a great way to distract your girlfriend from any hurt or pain she may be feeling, and it will give her a fun night. Take her to her favorite dance place, whether that's country western dancing, salsa dancing, swing dancing, or dancing in a club. Spend a few hours there and help her let go and just enjoy her night.Even if you're not a very good dancer, your girlfriend will appreciate your effort and will be able to take her mind off things for a little while. If you don't want the sole responsibility of dancing with her, consider inviting some of your mutual friends so that she has a group to dance with.

, This may seem like a strange time to take on a new task, but if you girlfriend has been upset about something for a long time, it could be good to introduce something new into her life. Choose a hobby or skill that you both are interested in, and begin learning and perfecting it. Learning something new will be a good way to distract her and provide something fun in her life.


Maybe your girlfriend has always wanted to learn how to play a certain instrument, wants to take up cycling, or is interested in gardening. Be by her side as you two learn this new hobby and support her in it. If she seems uninterested in learning something new, encourage her slowly. Don't force her to pick up a hobby, but slowly show her how good it can be for her. Start learning the new skill or hobby on your own and share your experience with her. This may motivate her to join you.

, If your girlfriend is feeling especially stressed about something, or something that has upset her has made her body tense, a massage is a great way to ease her mood. By helping her to relax her body, you may be helping her to relax her mind as well. Ask her first if she wants a massage and then work out any tension in her muscles.As you do this you might consider playing some soft music so that she can fully rest and relax. She may just need to keep her mind off things for a while, so a comforting massage and peaceful music may just be the trick.

, Food is always a great way to distract someone or cheer them up. Very few people can resist their favorite dish or dessert, so try taking your girlfriend on a night out to her favorite restaurant. Let her order and eat whatever she wants. She may just need a night to indulge and veg, so be by her side and veg with her.


Some people lose their appetite when they are upset about something. If your girlfriend seems really upset about something, ask her first if she is up for going out. She may just need a night in or time to herself, so do whatever will suit her best.

, If your girlfriend doesn't seem up for going out and just needs a night in, prepare her favorite dinner -- and dessert! Surprise her with a delicious meal when she comes home from work or school. If your girlfriend enjoys cooking, ask her if she wants to cook along with you. It may be a good distraction for her., What girl doesn't get cheered up by holding puppies? Find your local pet or puppy store and take her there for an hour or so, so that she can love on some puppies and they can love on her back., Think about the things in your girlfriend's life that she enjoys or mean a lot to her. Maybe she really likes a certain band, or has been wanting a specific piece of jewelry or clothing for a while. Surprise her with a special gift on a day when she's feeling especially gloomy.


You can also take her shopping, so that she can pick out some things herself. Spending a few hours with her at her favorite stores can go a long way, and it will likely help cheer her up, especially if she finds something she likes.

, Instead of just going on a short date, plan an entire day with your girlfriend. Try to incorporate some of her favorite things and also some things that will refresh her. Plan a picnic or spend some time at the beach. Go to an amusement park for some exciting rides. Visit some touristy areas in your town.

You may notice that you sweat a lot more or that you smell very bad. These are not attractive qualities so be sure to shower and wear deodorant every day. Also remember to brush your teeth and style your hair. Keeping basic hygiene makes sure that she does not get grossed out.


Always stay fresh and clean even when you're not in school because if you run into her friends in the mall and they think that you smell, the rumour will spread quickly back to her. Without even knowing it, you may have already blown your chance.
Take deodorant to school with you, if allowed, in your sports kit on P.E. days.;
, While each girl will like her own specific style, take pride in how your dress. Have confidence in your appearance and know what works for you. You want to feel comfortable in your outfits so that it will be one less thing to worry about.

, This does NOT mean forcing your friends to ask out a girl on your behalf but it can mean using them to help you look better or find out information about her.It also has the added effect of showing that you are a sociable person and fun to be around.

, If you aren't friends already, introduce yourself when you are working in a group or when you are sitting next to each other. Talk to her in class, but don't be obnoxious. Don't talk to her too much, just say hi when you find yourself around her or wave if you see her around school.


Talk to her whenever the opportunity presents itself. Start by simply asking, ""How's it going?""
Don't be creepy or awkward by lingering at her location without saying something. If you have nothing to say, don’t force it. Just greet her and move along.

, Make sure to make a good impression on them as they are her first line of defense.If she is much more popular than you, or in a different social circle, more effort will be required. Try and talk to that group to get closer to her, and be seen in a different light.

, A girl is much more likely to go out with you if you have gained her trust and respect on a friendship level. Start slow and chat as acquaintances. Don't be too eager to please her. Leave her intrigued and looking forward to her next encounter with you.Becoming friends can happen by sitting next to her in class, teaming up with her for class projects, interacting with her friends, or getting her number or social media handles to chat.

, Find a topic that interests you both and chat with her as often as you can. Don't be afraid to ask questions and to change topics so that you can continue the conversation and, more importantly, get to know more about her. Don't try to force a conversation and make things awkward with silence. It's okay to end a conversation if you don't feel like it's flowing in your favour.


Try to find common hobbies and interests. For example, you may chat about video games because there are a surprising number of girls that enjoy them as much as boys.Local sports teams are also a great topic to chat about. For example, you can say ""Hey, did you catch last night's game?""
If she's sad ask ""What's wrong"" and if she doesn't want to tell you about it then say ""We're friends, you know I would understand""

, Know that you are you're own person and that she should like you for who you are. It's okay to have your own opinion. Disagreeing with her or not liking something that she likes is okay. If she doesn't like you for your opinion then you know it wasn't meant to be, but always respect others and yourself. If your opinion is rude or disrespectful, you may have other problems to address.


If you make body jokes, do it in moderation. If you do it too much you will come off as crude and immature. if you do it in moderation you may make her laugh and come off self confident if you joke about yourself.
Do not be a disrespectful or a bully. People are allowed to have their own opinion. Make sure that you're able to have an open conversation without turning it into a shouting match or worse.

, Open doors for her and help her carry her books without her having to ask for it. Girls really love these small sweet gestures of kindness and they will notice it.


You don't have to buy her an expensive gift for her birthday to make her happy when you can give her something sentimental like a small key chain of a funny joke you two shared.

, Make sure it's a good time to ask her out. Get some alone time and wait for a good time in the conversation. Great signs to look for are laughter, when she's revealing something about herself, or when you are looking into each other's eyes.Say something similar to, ""I have to admit that you've been on my mind a lot and I was wondering if you wanted to go out, just you and I. I think it would be fun.""


Don't immediately ask her to be your girlfriend. Ask her to go out to enjoy an activity with you so she doesn't feel pressured or, worse, creeped out. If she knows that it will just be the both of you and that you have been thinking about it signals that you want to take the next step past friendship.

, If you're shy or want a different approach, slipping a note into her locker is a fun way to ask her out. The note can say ""I like you, do you like me? Place your answer at my locker by the gym, #23.""


If written well, she will find your note cute and amusing. It also doesn't put pressure on her or make her feel any commitment. Be careful because she might also wonder if you're too shy or lazy to ask her in person.

, Avoid asking her out when she's around her friends or other people. She may get very self-conscious that people are there or, worse, her friends might tease her and make her feel awkward by teasing, ""He wants to marry you"". Friends may also voice their disapproval if they think you two don't make a good match., Invite friends to a fun activity like a movie, walking around the mall, or to just hang out at your house. You can either get a mutual friend to invite her or, if you feel like you're at that level, invite her out yourself.Don't be too obvious about your feelings when you're in a group. Make sure you include everyone in the conversation and activity. It will be easy to notice if you pay too much attention to her over the others so choose your time wisely.

, When you feel that you've got a connection, ask her to go out with you. Don't get someone else to tell her how you feel because she may find it weird or feel confused. You can also call her or have a video chat as long as you ask her casually.Texts are easily misinterpreted especially if you're trying to joke or if she doesn't take things seriously.
Don't wait to make the first move. Cease the moment and ask her out when it feels right.

, Find out if she already has a boyfriend and let her know that you want her to feel comfortable. For example, you can say, ""Do you wanna go out? It can be our secret and I promise not to make things awkward by trying to kiss you.”


If she hesitates but agrees, follow the rule that you have set together. If she doesn't want anyone to know then don't tell anyone. Don't pressure her to kiss if she has told you that it is not okay.

, A matinee is a fun and easy date because it is in a safe public location but still gives you time to be together and have something to discuss afterwards. If you have a shared interest like sports or a favourite band, plan an event around it. You can even just walk around the mall and talk about the places she likes to shop.


Let her know that her parents are welcome to join and that you will meet her there so that she knows you aren't planning to do anything her parents won't approve of or that will get her into trouble.

, If your parents are not okay with you having a girlfriend, you should not lie to them. Communicate with them and maybe you can find a compromise.


Doing something your parents do not allow make it even more difficult if you’re caught.

, Take any opportunity to build their trust. Go to bed on time and do your chores when you’re told. Also, improving your grades shows that you are focused and understand your priorities.


Getting your parent to support you will make things much easier down the road. For example, they can give you rides when you want to meet her or extra allowance if you want to buy her a small present to show her you like her.

, Respectful behavior is important to provide an example of how you will treat their daughter.


A confident young man who does well in school and has aspirations for the future will keep most parents from stopping you from going out with their daughter unless you ever prove dishonest or impolite.

, If she says she is unsure or not allowed to date in middle school, it's not the end of the world. As much as you want to go out with her, it's much more important that you establish respect early on.


Do not suggest that she lie to her parents or goes behind their back. That will only get her into trouble and make you seem selfish for disregarding what her parents want. You can suggest that you have a non-date at her house under her parents' supervision if her parents initially say no. Show them that you respect them and will follow their rules.

, If someone rejects you, tell yourself ""I'm a nice guy. I do well in school. I have hobbies and interests and I treat people well. I have a lot to offer"" If someone doesn't want that, a guy with a lot to offer will not care. After all, it's their loss.


Girls who initially reject you can change their minds after a short time. If you think that they are sincerely apologetic, thank them and consider taking them out. In other cases, you are allowed to move on and let them know they had a chance.

, Do not start blaming her, freaking out, blaming yourself, insulting her and generally being disrespectful.


There could be a number of factors that made her say no. 7th graders are very nervous about everything and especially what friends say. Even if she wants to accept, she is likely to reject in order to avoid the joking and ridicule which is so common.
She may fear that her friends will laugh or that you aren't good enough somehow.

, In 7th grade, kids often say what they don't mean. Always be a good guy and do the right thing. Never lash out because it not only will damage any chance you have with her but it may also give you an unwanted reputation with other girls. Treat others with respect and keep your rejection to yourself.


It's also important to remember not to take these relationships too seriously. Chances are that you haven't found your soulmate in middle school, so don't place more value on the relationship than your schoolwork.

Wait a day or two.,
Text only to make contact.,
Remind her about seeing you last.,
Pay attention to her texts.,
Watch what you text.,
Tell her you would rather talk than text.,
Test the waters for a phone call.",How to Get a Girl to Call You Back1," You don’t want to look desperate by texting immediately, but you also don’t want to wait too long. Many women say they lose interest if they don’t hear from a guy pretty soon after that initial exchange of numbers. About 24 to 36 hours is a good rule of thumb., Use text messaging to communicate to her that you are interested in talking with her. Don’t allow texting to become an habitual exchange between the two of you. In addition, texting a lot with someone you don't know well can be awkward and she might read it as a sign that you're not really that interested., If you just met, re-introduce yourself; if she is someone you know or knew, but haven't texted with, mention that she gave you her number.


If she doesn't have your number, she may not have any clue who you are when you first text. Try saying “Hi Stella. It’s me, Stanley, we talked on Monday.”
If you exchanged some small talk, bring it up. Remind her that there was a spark of interest when you both met.
Stay away from anything negative about the situation when you met. If she was irked about the long line at the DMV, don’t remind her of feeling irritated.
Tell her how great it was talking with her. Say something like “Chatting with you made waiting in line actually fun.”

, Follow her lead in terms of text lengths and complexity. Mirroring her sentence structure can strengthen a connection, because it suggests that the two of you are in sync with each other., The biggest drawback about texting is probably that it can’t communicate things like facial expression, tone of voice, or body language. So don’t make sarcastic remarks, or make remarks that read as critical, complaining, or insecure. She won’t be able to be charmed by your self-deprecating humor without seeing your cute grin and adorable shoulder shrug too. , Let her know that texting with her is great, but you are hoping to talk on the phone with her. You could try saying something like ""This is fun texting with you, and I'm sure talking with you will be even more fun.""

, Don’t try to pin her down by making a phone date, but do let her know you intend to call. You want her to be sure about your level of interest, so when you sign off say something like ""Let's talk soon.""

If he is, that's awesome, but don't force him to go to the dance if he doesn't want to; if you force him to go, he won't ask you to dance anyway, since he'll be afraid of you. If he isn't going, that's okay. There will be other dances.;
, Even if your crush isn't going to the dance, you never know who you might run into, so you still need to dress to impress. Remember to dress appropriately for the dance. Since you're in middle school, most of the dances will be casual/semi-formal. If the dance is casual, wear a pretty top with some plain skinny jeans. Make sure that your outfit is age-appropriate. You don't have to dress like a stripper to get a guy to notice you. If the dance is semi-formal, pick out the prettiest dress you have in your wardrobe. Your dress should be something whimsical, festive, and comfortable. Don't choose a poofy Cinderella ballgown, because you'll end up looking silly. Add a touch of makeup to complete your look. Don't go over the top with the makeup. You're in middle school, so keep it natural, otherwise you'll look like a clown. Wear some light colored lip gloss and some blush that matches your skin tone to keep it natural. If your parents won't let you wear makeup, that's okay. You look beautiful without it. If you normally wear glasses, wear contacts for the dance, just for something different. But don't if you don't want to.

, Some girls think that it's best to sit in the corner and look like a loner, but usually, that doesn't attract guys. Guys like girls that are whimsical and ready to stand out. They don't want to dance with a loser sitting alone in the corner! Have fun! It's a dance, after all. Look confident and dance with your friends. Don't go over-the-top crazy, but look like you're having fun. However, make sure that you're within eyesight of 'pretty boy'. He'll never be able to notice you if you don't stay in his sight. Throughout the dance, sneak a few peeks at him to see if he's noticed you too. If he moves around a lot, follow him secretly. Make sure that you don't look like a stalker, however! If he doesn't move around, stick close to him so that he'll notice you. If he catches you looking at him or vice versa, smile at him. Look cute, friendly, and approachable. If he approaches you at any time during the dance, don't freak out and make a fool of yourself. Smile and introduce yourself if you don't already know him. If you do know him, say hi.

, Stay close to him so that if he wants to dance with you, he can find you easily. If he's dancing with another girl, wait through the song. If he's not dancing with anybody, that's even better. Wait out the song to see if he'll ask you to dance. If he doesn't, don't get upset. The night is still young. If he asks you to dance, that's GREAT! If everyone else is doing the simple version of slow dancing (the guy's hands are around the girl's waist; the girl's hands are on the guy's shoulders) put your hands around the guy's shoulders and sway slowly to the music. If everyone is ballroom dancing (this doesn't really happen in middle school), take his hand and let him whisk you across the dance floor. Don't dance silently! Talk to him a little bit!

, If he's dancing with a girl, look to see if it's the same girl that he was dancing with last time. If it is, that's most likely his girlfriend, so he probably won't dance with you. If it isn't the same girl, you're in luck! He doesn't have a girlfriend, and is therefore a good person to dance with. If he's alone again, stay within his view and see if he'll ask you to dance. If he doesn't, that's okay. Wait for the next slow song. If he offers to dance with you again, EVEN BETTER! You're one step closer to getting your kiss, because he's obviously into you! Dance with him again.

, If he's dancing with different girls, you need to make your move. The guy doesn't always have to ask the girl to dance! This is the 21st Century! Walk up to him and casually ask him if he wants to dance. He'll most likely say 'yes'. If he does, great! If he says 'no', that's okay. Find another guy to dance with. If he's still not dancing with anybody, ask him to dance, just like we said above. If he asks you to dance again, you're golden.

, You're the girl he'll remember the most if you dance with him last.

, If he just says goodbye or nods and walks away, it means that he doesn't really like you that much (not enough to kiss you, anyway). That's okay. There will be other dances and other boys, and he could just be shy! If he smiles and says something back, like ""I had a nice time too"", things are going well. If you're walking home after the dance, ask him if he wants to walk home with you (since you're in middle school, neither of you will able to drive on your own, so he can't really drive you home). If he says that he already has a ride, smile and say 'see you later' or whatever you want, then catch a ride home with your friends. If he says that he'll walk with you, you're doing great! Leave with him and start a conversation with him if he doesn't talk for the first minute or so. Talk about whatever; sports, teachers, homework, pets, family, friends, the dance...just keep the conversation flowing. If you're really lucky, he'll hold your hand on the way home. This basically guarantees a kiss. If he doesn't hold your hand, that's okay too. There's still a big chance of getting that kiss. You've come this far, after all!

, Before knocking on the door/ringing the doorbell, tell him that he's a really nice guy, or that you had a great time with him, or that it was nice meeting him, etc. Finally, say ""Thanks for walking me home."" Be daring and give him a kiss on the cheek. You both will probably blush a bit here! Now, stand back, look into his eyes, and smile at him. If he wants to kiss you, he'll do it now. If he does, enjoy it. If he doesn't, don't start making out with him. He might not be ready for a kiss, and he may still be fazed by the kiss on the cheek (for many middle school boys, this is potentially their first kiss). Just smile, say goodbye, and go into your house, leaving him wanting more. This will make for a great school dance the next time one rolls around. :-)

, After the kiss, blush a little bit. It's okay. Look cute and say goodbye. Don't look like you've made a mistake, because then he'll feel like you don't like him. Look like you enjoyed it, because hopefully you did!

, If he kissed you, the guy will most likely ask you out, which means that you've really attracted him. But if he doesn't, try to be friends with him. A friendship is a good start of a relationship, because once you two are friends, you'll feel more comfortable around each other, and more ready to take your relationship to the next level (maybe in time for the next school dance!).

, When you are near him, try not to talk about your super romantic kiss. Talk about other interesting things. Look like you're having fun so he'll think you're a fun person!

Have a reason for calling.,
Pick a good time to call.,
Plan what you will say.,
Set aside time for calling her.",How to Get a Girl to Call You Back2," Don’t call just to call, or just because you texted that you would call. You can come up with something to say from your previous conversations, and from information she has given you about herself.


Try checking on something she was involved with or trying to get done. You could say, “So, how did your driver’s license photograph turn out?”
Ask her if she likes or frequents the place where you two saw each other last.
Check on how her day or week is going.
If she mentioned her pet or pets, ask about how they are.

, If you got her number while she was at lunch, or while she was commuting to work or taking a coffee break mid-morning, try calling then.


Don’t call early in the morning. Most people have a pretty tight morning schedule and can’t really take time for a phone conversation.
Immediately after work might be a good time, but be aware that end of day routines are more variable than start of day. She may be meeting friends, or going to a class, or just looking forward to getting home and in front of the television.
Don’t call past 7:00 or 7:30 pm. Just like morning routines, evening schedules can be very packed and very tight. You don’t want to interrupt her, and possibly annoy her, with a phone call when she’s trying to wind down for the evening.

, Write it down and have it ready when you make your call. You need to have a plan for what you will say if she picks up, or what message you want to leave if she doesn’t. Have a script for the conversation if she answers, and one for leaving a message. This will keep you from stammering or rambling, and knowing exactly what you are going to say will help you focus more on how you sound rather what you are saying., Pick a time in your day when you can be calm and focused, and when you have plenty of time in case she answers. Also, make sure you aren't in a noisy space that makes it hard to hear what you are saying.


Do not call her while you are in distracting or stressful situations. Driving, waiting for your train or bus, or being in the middle of something else are all bad times to try to call. You don’t want to be tempted to yell at another driver or lose your train of thought because of multitasking.
Do not call her just because you have some time on your hands. You don’t want her to think that you’re calling just because you haven’t anything better to do at the moment.
Call when you're sure you won’t be interrupted by anything or anyone else.
Turn off the television, shut down your computer, and turn your music off or to a very low volume. Focus your attention on the phone call and nothing else.
Do not call from a crowded bar or restaurant, or while standing or walking in busy places like city streets or train stations. The chances of being interrupted or needing to hang up suddenly are huge, and you will be distracted as well as fighting to be heard over the noise.

"
"
Don’t leave a message with the first call.,
Leave your name and and your number.,
Refer to earlier texts.,
Set a timer.,
Check in about when to call.,
Keep it light.,
Give her a reason to call back.",How to Get a Girl to Call You Back3," If she doesn’t pick up, hang up and wait to try again later or on another day.


If she doesn't answer, figure out another possible time to try when she might be available. If you call during lunch, consider calling later at around 7:00 or 7:30.
If you’re pretty sure she’s often available during the time you called, try the same time again in a day or two.
Don’t wait more than one or two days to try again.
If you have tried her a couple of times on different days or during different times of day, leave a message after the third attempt.

, Speak clearly and with a relaxed tone when you're leaving your message, and don't talk too fast; she might not get everything you say and you will sound nervous.


Also refrain from talking in an exaggerated manner or too slowly.
Leave your number twice, once at the beginning of your message, and once at the end.
If this is a new acquaintance, remind her of who you are and when you met. Say something like “Hi Wendy, this is Peter. We met during lunch at Le Restaurant Cool on Monday.”

, You can say that you’re interested in hearing about how her week has been since texting, or mention some personal information she texted about, like a pet or a project at work.

, Your message should be no more than 30 seconds. A voicemail that goes on for more than that feels like it will never end, which is tedious. In addition, if you limit the amount of time you have, you won’t be tempted to ramble or find yourself stumbling over how to end your message.

, Don’t say “Hey I tried you at this time and that time. What’s up? When can I get you on the phone?” She knows that you called, and when you called. Just say “I hope this is a good time to call, but if not, really sorry and I’ll try another time ok?”

, Do not talk about anything negative. Don’t complain, and don’t whine about how hard she is to get on the phone. You want to make sure she has nothing but positive feelings associated with you, and nothing but positive expectations about calling you back., Don’t ask her out, or tell her that you want to make plans. Instead, ask a question or a small favor.


Ask for information about the place where you saw her. For instance, you could say “I’ve been thinking about taking that class at the gym, and I’d love to hear what you think about it.”
Tell her you have some point of interest about something she’s told you, like a good dog walking service or a great place for sushi.
Check in about how some project or activity is going.

Don’t make repeated calls.,
Set a time limit for waiting.,
Accept it if she doesn’t call you back.,
Don’t take it personally.",How to Get a Girl to Call You Back4," Make a plan about when you will call, and how much time you will wait between calls.


Make no more than two calls on any given day, and then only if you’re trying to figure out when she might be available to talk.
Don’t make more than three calls in one week. Give her a chance to find time to get back to you.
Don’t call on consecutive days unless you’re trying her at a time that you think she’s available. Even in this instance, make calls on consecutive days only once during the week.
Wait for the next week before any follow up calls.

, After you have left an initial message, and made a follow up call or two, wait a couple of weeks before contacting her again., There may be any number of reasons why she hasn’t called back. Although it’s not carved in stone that she will never call back, it should be clear that she isn’t calling back at the moment. However, if you show her that you are the scary desperate guy that doesn’t know how to let things go, it’s pretty much guaranteed you will not hear from her ever., Don’t hold a grudge or indulge in negative self talk about yourself or her. Don’t demonize her, and don’t feel embarrassed about your interest in her. Life is long, timing is everything, and you never know where she might turn up one day. Meanwhile, get on with things."

Go for a casual but flirty dress.,
Bring along a sweater.",How to Dress and Groom Yourself for a Movie Date1," You shouldn’t dress formally for a movie date, but you also shouldn’t show up in yesterday’s t-shirt and shorts. Go for an outfit that is comfortable, a little bit flirty, and well put together., You will be sitting in the theatre for several hours. Tight clothing can affect your circulation and make you uncomfortable. Instead of wearing tight jeans, opt for a pair that give you some room to breathe while still flattering your figure., Button down tops look put together without being too formal.

Tell him you want to focus on your schoolwork.,
Schedule dates in advance.,
Support your boyfriend in his studies.,
Stand your ground.,
Cancel plans in advance.",How to Date Your Boyfriend and Still Do Well in School1," Find a time when you can speak to your boyfriend privately. Do this face to face, not over the phone or text.Make it clear that you want to work on your grades. This does not mean that you are avoiding him. Rather, it shows that you consider your schoolwork to be important too. Be gentle as you tell him this. Do not blame him, but do let him know where your priorities stand.


You can say, “I really want to hang out with you, but I have to make sure that my grades stay up. I won’t be able to hang out every night of the week, but we can still have fun together.”
It might help to be specific with your boyfriend upfront. For example, at the beginning of the week, say something like, “I have a biology test on Thursday and an English paper due on Friday. I’m going to have to work all week on this.”;
, Your boyfriend may be just as concerned about his schoolwork as you are about yours. Each week, plan ahead of time when you will hang out. Look over each other’s schedules, and see what works for you. If you plan ahead, your boyfriend will know that you are not ignoring him and that you still want to spend time together.

, Sometimes, people may get jealous or frustrated when their partners succeed or perform better than they do.Your boyfriend may be struggling at school himself, and it may make him feel bad to see you so dedicated. The solution to this is to support your boyfriend and to encourage him in his own studies.


When he is stressed, let him know that you are there for him. Instead of trying to solve his problems, gently comfort him instead.You can suggest, “Hey, maybe once you take your test, we can go see a football game together.” This will give him something to look forward to so that he does not burn out on studying.
If he struggling with his own grades, offer to help him study. Do not do his homework for him, and don’t give him the answers. You can, however, quiz him or proofread his essays.

, If your boyfriend pushes back, do not give in. He might try to guilt you or plead with you. Be firm but nice. Let him know that you understand how difficult the situation is but that you have to focus on your schoolwork. Do not let him make you feel bad, insecure, or guilty.


You can say, “If I want to get into college, I have to make good grades” or “If my grades start to slip, my parents won’t let me date.”
If he tries to tell you something like “If you loved me, you’d hang out with me more,” turn it around on him. Say, “If you loved me, you’d want me to do well in school.” If a boy starts using guilt tactics like this, he is trying to manipulate you. This is usually a red flag.

, If you know that you will have to cancel a date, tell your boyfriend as early as possible, and always try to reschedule it. You should try to avoid canceling plans at the last minute. Do not stand him up without telling him.


You can say, “I have a history test on Monday. I think I need to study over the weekend. Can we move our movie night to next weekend?”

Get her phone number.,
Say hi — but don’t just say hi.,
Say something timely and relevant.,
Talk about her interests.,
Use smiley faces!,
Keep going!,
Stop texting her if she's not into it.,
Call or talk in person if you have something important to say.,
Be smart about what you text.",How to Start a Text Conversation with a Girl," Try to get it from her yourself; it can be a little awkward to get a text from someone if you have no idea how they got it.


An easy way is to mention a funny video or photo and tell her, “I’ll text you the link/photo. Wait, I don’t have your phone number! Can I get that from you?” Be casual and don’t make it a big deal, and she’s more likely to feel comfortable giving it to you.
If you need a little more help getting her phone number, check out How to Get a Girl’s Phone Number.
If she doesn’t want to give you her phone number, don’t try to get it from somewhere or someone else. This is simply a matter of respecting her boundaries. Maybe wait to ask her again until you know her a little better in person.

, A simple “hi” is hard to respond to, and can come off as lazy or boring. Ask a question, or even just ask her how she’s doing.


Questions are great because there is an expected response to keep the conversation going. If you ask her what the English homework is, she can respond with the answer and you can ask another clarifying question, keeping the conversation moving.... as opposed to if you just say “hey,” and she has no idea how to respond.
Open-ended questions are usually better than simple “yes-or-no” questions because there’s more you can say. For example, “Do you like comedy movies?” will likely garner a one-word response, whereas “What kind of movies do you like?” will probably get a longer, more specific response and make it easier to continue the conversation.

, If you're trying to break the ice for the first time, it is important that she doesn't feel like your text is coming out of the blue with no reason or motivation behind it. Talk about something that you both share in common or that affects both of you.


For example, if there is a school function going on that night, you can ask “Are you going to that game/play/dance tonight?” You could even ask if she wants to come along with you (or with you and a group of friends, if you're feeling a little shy about jumping in on that first date).
You could also make small talk about some experience you've both had, like saying ""It was so crazy running into you at Starbucks today!"" or ""Can you believe how Mr. Smith yelled at that student in English class today?""

, If you know she likes a specific band, TV show, or movie, ask her about it! Ask her what she thought of the most recent episode, or if she has any song recommendations for that band. This will show her that you take enough interest to care about her opinions and remember her likes and dislikes.


These topics are especially great because people can be really passionate about their favorite bands or shows. They love talking about them, watching them, and learning more about them. It can be really exciting to meet someone who shares the same interest.
If you disagree over something, don’t freak out! A little playful debate over “Which Beatles Song Is The Best” can help you two get to know each other, as well as be funny and enjoyable. Just don’t insult her or say something mean in the process.

, Smiley faces can be fun and flirty, but are also innocent enough that it won’t come off as too bold or forward. Just throw in a smiley face, and she’ll notice ;)


If you’re really unsure how to use a smiley face, start by just tacking one on at the end of a text, like “Have you seen the new episode of ‘New Girl’? It was really good :)”
In general, winky faces are more suggestive and used with flirty texts and double-entendres. Don’t use a winky face where you’ll normally see a smiley face because it might seem misplaced or even confusing.
Try not to overdo it with the emoticons, as that can be confusing and off-putting.

, Now that your conversation has started off on the right foot, make sure it keeps going just as well!


Check out How to Text Message Someone You Like if you need some more ideas.
When you're ready, you can advance to the next level by using your text messages to set up a real live in person get-together-- whether it's a date, casual meet-up, or group get-together. Texting is fun, but talking in person is the way to take a relationship to the next level.

, If she doesn’t seem interested (i.e., taking forever to respond, responding rarely, or sending trite, one-word texts), you should consider not texting her; if she directly asks you to stop, stop.


If she doesn’t want to talk to you, you’re wasting your time. Find some other cute girl to text.
If you keep texting her and she's asked you to stop, you could risk being accused of harassment or stalking.

, While texting is a great way to get to know someone casually or to break the ice with a new person, there are many conversations that are just not appropriate for texting. These include:


Asking her out. If you want to ask someone out, do it face to face or over the phone, but don't do it over text unless it's very casual and insignificant.
Breaking up. If you want to end a relationship with someone, do them the courtesy of talking to them about it in person or on the phone, but don't use a text to do your dirty work. It's lazy and immature.
Offering comfort or advice for serious problems. If she's recently lost a relative that she was close to, or if she's experiencing some very difficult personal problems, texting can be a great place holder or way to say ""I will call you later to talk about this."" But don't let texting stand in for personal interaction during difficult times. Your friends need to hear your voice to know that you are there for them.
When in doubt, ask yourself if the topic is very important or meaningful, or if the topic is casual or laid back. Text messages inevitably come across as less important and/or more casual than phone calls or person-to-person conversations, so if you want someone to take you seriously or know that what you have to say means a lot to you, then avoid texting., Remember that texting creates a written and sometimes photographic record that you cannot delete. Never text anything that you wouldn't want to get into the wrong hands, whether because the recipient forwarded or shared the message or because her phone was stolen or lost.


Don't sext or text nude images of yourself unless you are over age 18 and the recipient has consented to receive it. Distributing a sexually explicit image of a minor is a felony, even if the minor is yourself, and asking for another minor to send sexually explicit texts is also a felony.Sending unsolicited naked pics can result in criminal charges of harassment.
Never send requests for or discussions of illegal activities, as a phone text record can be admissible in court proceedings.It is not smart to use texting as a way to vent about your boss, mother, teacher, or anybody else that you would not want to see the text message. While you might trust the intended recipient of the text to not tell anyone, you can't control what happens if the phone gets stolen or lost or if one of her friends snoops or sees her messages inadvertently.

Shower before the date.,
Wash your hair.,
Apply deodorant and/or antiperspirant.,
Style your hair.,
Try wearing simple makeup.,
Brush your teeth.",How to Dress and Groom Yourself for a Movie Date2," You want to be fresh and clean for your movie date. Make sure you take a shower or bath as close as possible to the time of your date. Try using a soap or body wash with a neutral scent, or one that matches your perfume or cologne.

Avoid strong scents - you'll be sitting next to your date for a couple of hours, so keep things neutral to make the experience comfortable for your date, too.

, You should also make sure that your hair is clean for your movie date. While you are taking a shower or bath, wash your hair with shampoo and then condition it as you normally would. Avoid using dry shampoo, which does not clean your scalp or hair.Make sure you dry your hair with a hairdryer or leave enough time to let it air dry.

, Once you bathe and finish washing your hair, apply a deodorant or antiperspirant to help control body odor and/or perspiration. Try wearing deodorant even if you think you don’t need it., While you don’t want to go over the top with your hairstyle for a movie date, you should at least make sure your hair is combed and looking neat. If you have longer hair, try a simple ponytail or braid. You can also go for a more involved up-do like a bun or topknot. If you have shorter hair, you can just comb or brush it and set the style in place with a little gel or hairspray., A movie date is an opportunity to look your best while still looking casual. Less can be more on a movie date as far as makeup is concerned. Instead of wearing intense eye makeup and bold lip color, try more neutral tones. For example, go for a taupe eye shadow, mascara, and a little lip gloss., You will want to make sure you have fresh breath for your movie date. Right before you walk out the door, brush your teeth. You can also floss and use mouthwash if you desire. Avoid eating anything that might give you bad breath after you brush your teeth."

Your hormones are going wild, and you're likely noticing members of the opposite, or the same sex, for the first time. But dating in middle school should not be your priority. Focus on things like friendships, school, and developing your own unique personality more than you focus on finding someone to date.


If you want to date, talk to your parents about it and seek their guidance. Make sure you're allowed to date before you move forward.
If you don't want to date, that's perfectly fine. Most middle school relationships exist largely online and in the imagination, anyway, which means you should take what other people are saying with a big grain of salt. Don't date if you don't want to.;
, Who are you crushing on lately? Who seems like they would be nice to be around, more than a regular type of friend? Who are you attracted to? Try to find someone you think would make for a fun date, someone you can imagine hanging out with, maybe a lot. Someone you wouldn't mind kissing.


Make sure they don't have a date already, and aren't going with anyone. It can be awkward to ask someone who is already going out with someone.
Make sure that you already talk to this person during the week, so asking them out won't be as awkward, and the relationship will work out better, since you already know a decent amount about the person.

, While it's always fine to ask something as simple as, ""Will you go out with me?"" it's sometimes even better to have a specific reason in mind, so you can have an excuse to talk.


Is a dance coming up? Asking someone to a dance is one of the most common ways of asking someone out on a date. If it goes well, you can sometimes stay a couple afterward. If not, you'll have fun anyway.
What about a homecoming game? Or another sports game? Ask if you can go together?
Maybe a new movie is coming out soon that everyone's talking about. Ask someone to go with you to the movie.

, If you're going to put yourself out there, you want to make sure you're looking your best. Make sure your clothes are clean and nice, so you can look good and feel confident enough to ask someone out.


Shower that morning and do your hair, paying attention to it a little more than normal. You don't have to look like a movie star, so you don't want to overdo it, but take some time to look your best.

, Try to find a minute that you two can be together to ask. Sometimes, passing period can be a good chance for this, or right after school. If you can't seem to find a time when the person is alone, just ask, ""Hey, can I talk to you for a second?""


Try to do it in person, if you can, instead of over the phone. For a lot of people, asking someone out via text or chatting will be a bad idea, while it can work for others. If you chat regularly with someone, it might be fine.
There's always a chance that you get shot down. If this happens in front of a bunch of people, it'll be worse than if it happens in private.

, If you've been attracted to someone who doesn't know who you are, they'll likely say ""no"" if you just walk up and ask them to go out. The best first idea is probably to introduce yourself briefly, and let them know what your connection is.


Hey, I'm ____. We're in the same history class. I was wondering...""

, When you've got an opportunity, just cut to the chase and ask. You don't need to give it a lot of thought or Try to be clever. Just be kind, complimentary, and clear. No lines.


Say something like: ""I've noticed you for a long time, and you just seem like a really sweet, cool person. I like you a lot. Would you like to go to the dance with me?""
Don't wait to be asked, or assume that someone will ask you out, whether you're a boy or a girl. It's perfectly fine for girls to ask boys in middle school, or at any age.

, Since you're underage, it's still important to get your parents' permission about things like dating, as well as the parents of the person you're asking out. Just ask, and then follow their wishes.This is especially important if you're going to ask someone to go out in public with you. It needs to be ok with all of your parents, especially if you're going to be getting a ride.
You can always spend time at school together with someone, regardless of how your parents feel about it. It's better to have permission, of course, but Romeo and Juliet were middle-school aged, after all.

, Talking with your date can be just as much fun and just as important to a young romance as actually going anywhere. Set up dates on Skype or some other chatting service, or talk on the phone.


Arrange something you can do together, even if you're not together. If you both have a show you like, watch it at the same time and talk about it on the phone. Or just leave the Skype window open while you do homework together.

, Make sure you're allowed to text with your date, then trade numbers and start texting. You can be conversing and laughing together, even if you're not actually together.


Try to be a good conversationalist and give you date something to respond to. Don't just write, ""hey."" Ask a question, make an observation, have something real to talk about. Don't write one-word responses with a date. If you can't talk right now, say so.
For some good articles about texting a crush or a date, click here or here.

, Lots of middle school romance will happen primarily on Facebook. If you're going out with someone, you need to discuss how much of it you want to be public, and how much of it you want to be private together with the person you're dating, and be respectful. Remember: lots of people can see it.


If you decide you want to, change your Facebook status to ""in a relationship"" with your date.
It's important to ease up on the digital PDA. The occasional kissy-face emoticon exchange is ok, but not more than once every couple days.

, The only way you need to act when you're with your date, when you're talking to your date, and when you're thinking of something to say is to just act naturally. Be yourself. Joke around, goof off, don't Try to be someone you're not.


Give sincere compliments, when they're deserved. ""I thought you looked really nice today"" will always be appreciated when you mean it.
Act the same around your date as you act around your friends, which is what your date should be, unless of course you act like a total dweeb with your friends. The point is, if you're not friends, you shouldn't be dating.

, In middle school, you're still developing and maturing, and different people will develop and mature more quickly than others. You might be feeling a rush of conflicting emotions and like your hormones are raging out of control. That's because they are. It's important to take a step back, calm down, and let things go slowly. You've got your whole life ahead of you to date.


Sometimes, it's ok to try for a kiss, when the time is right, but only if both people are comfortable. Be open and honest with the person that you're with.
Sometimes, middle school romances seem devastating when they're over. Try to relax. You'll look back on this in less than two or three years and laugh.

, If you're ""seeing"" somebody in middle school, that's great, but that doesn't mean you're married. Who your date talks to on Facebook, or sits with at lunch shouldn't be a source of your obsession. You're two individuals who like to spend time together. That's it.


Don't get desperate and needy while you're dating someone. No texts or Facebook messages that say things like, ""Where r u????""
Spend time with your own friends, making separate time to do things that you enjoy doing alone. There'll always be time for dating.

, Lots of middle school romances don't last very long, and are mostly on the Internet and at school. That's ok. It's hard to do much when you don't have any money and you don't have any car. But if you really like spending time with someone, try to make a point of spending some real time with each other, not just posting on the other's wall.

, One of the best and easiest ways to go on a date in meeting school is to go to a dance together. It gives you a great reason to ask and a fun thing to do together. Most dances in middle school are right after school, too, which means you don't have to bother any parents for a ride.


If you're scared of dancing, practice. Pump up some tunes in your bedroom, or on your headphones, and work on your moves ahead of time. You don't have to be super-smooth, but you do want to avoid looking dorky.
If your school doesn't have many dances, you can go to other school events together, especially football or basketball games. Go to any after-school club, or a school play together as a date.

, Ask your date if they'd like to see a new movie, maybe the night it comes out to make it seem like an event. You could even get the tickets ahead of time, and maybe plan to get a bite to eat, or an ice cream, after the movie, if you're allowed.


Going to the movies can be a good way to make a date a little less awkward. You don't have to talk too much, so it's a good choice if you're feeling nervous.
If you have an older sibling, see if they'll drive you to the date instead of your parents. Way cooler.

, While it might not seem like a date, one of the absolute easiest ways that you can hang out with someone you're dating in middle school is to spend time together at lunch. Find a quiet table where you can sit together, or sit together with your friends and let everyone see how disgustingly cute you two are. Good fun either way.


Offer to do little things for your date, like throw away their tray for them, or hold out the chair. It might seem old school, or like something your parents would do, but it's good to make someone feel special.

, If you don't get to see each other much at school, spend some time together afterward by walking home, if you can. It's a good way to be able to get some private time and talk without a bunch of people around.


Make sure both of your parents know you'll be doing this, and only do it if you'd normally walk home from school. If they know you're together, you can linger a while. Walk slow.
You can also walk somewhere else, if it's convenient and you're allowed. Head to the mall, or to some other store to walk around after school. You can also arrange another non-school time you could go on a walk together, maybe in a park close-by.

, Have your date over for dinner some night, or come over and watch a movie at your house. This can be a good way to let your family meet someone you're dating, and let your date meet your family. Big step in a relationship!


You'll need to talk to your parents about this, because they'll probably not want you two to be locked up in a room together, but maybe they'll let you have the living room to yourselves.

Hold study dates.,
Quiz each other.,
Put your phone away.,
Set boundaries.",How to Date Your Boyfriend and Still Do Well in School2," A great way to get your work done and hang out with your boyfriend is to plan study dates. Once or twice a week, do your homework together. Even just reading in the same room can help you bond. If you are struggling with a question, you can ask him for help.


It can be easy to become distracted during study dates. At the beginning, set a time limit or a boundary with your boyfriend. Say, “I need to study for at least two hours before I can do anything else” or “If I write three pages, maybe we can watch an episode of a TV show together.”

, If you have a test coming up, you can ask your boyfriend to help you prepare. Make notecards, and ask him to quiz you on the terms. You can also give him your notes, and he can read off questions from them. This makes studying more interactive.

, Studying is difficult enough without any distractions. If your boyfriend cannot study with you, you may feel tempted to text or message him while you are studying. Let him know that you are working and that you won’t be able to talk for a few hours. Put your phone in a drawer or under a pillow. Turn the phone on silent. Once you are done studying, be sure to text your boyfriend to let him know that you can talk again.


If your boyfriend knows you are studying and still texts you constantly, it could signal a lack of trust on his part. This is especially true if he keeps asking where you are or demands that you pay attention to him.Have a talk with your boyfriend. You can say, “It’s not cool that you keep texting me when I ask you not to. Trust is important in a relationship, and if you can’t trust me, this might not work out.”

, Let your boyfriend know that when you are studying, everything else is off limits. If he tries to pressure you to make out or give him attention, remind him of your responsibilities. Gently tell him that this is important to you and that you would appreciate it if he would let you study.


Remember your boyfriend does not have to take up your whole life. You can still study and be a good girlfriend. In fact, a good boyfriend is one who understands that you need to work and gives you the time you need to succeed.If your boyfriend becomes angry that you are setting boundaries, it is not your fault. It is his problem.This is typical of abusive behavior. Even if he is not currently abusive to you, it is a sign that he may be trying to control you.

Eat lunch together.,
Plan your dates for the weekend.,
Text when you cannot talk.,
Avoid fighting at school.",How to Date Your Boyfriend and Still Do Well in School3," If you have a lunch period together, you should sit with your boyfriend. Try to bring both of your friend groups together so that it is a social meal. This will let your boyfriend see you every day, even if you are in the middle of your studies.

, It is best not to have a date on a school night. You can plan your dates for Friday night, any time Saturday, or during the day on Sunday. Make sure that these are fun outings where you can do something active and engaging together, such as ice skating or going to the beach. This will liven up your relationship.Try to avoid talking about school or your studies during your date.

, If you cannot see your boyfriend much during the week, you can still talk to him. While you should not distract yourself while studying, do send him texts throughout the day. A good morning and a good night text are good for letting your boyfriend know that you are thinking about him. After school, ask him how his day went.

, School is a place for studying. You should try to avoid any romantic conflict while you’re at school. If you’re annoyed at your boyfriend, ask him if you can talk privately after school, but try not to have a fight in the hallway or cafeteria. This will publicize your argument, and you may not be able to settle the matter maturely while in a public setting.You can also follow the 48 hour rule. If your boyfriend angers you, wait two days. If you’re still angry, you can bring it up with him. Otherwise, it might be a minor issue, and you can drop it."

Keep your relationship fresh and exciting.",How to Make a Girl Fall in Love With You Fast," Turns out, that tingly feeling on your skin and pounding heartbeat when you see someone you’re attracted to are caused by chemical reactions. Attraction is, literally, about the chemistry between you.Your brain can make up your mind about whether you find someone attractive in as little as one second.Dopamine (where we get the word “dope”) is a “feel-good” brain chemical involved in your brain’s reward and motivation systems. Dopamine starts sending positive reinforcements to your system when you’re attracted to someone, resulting in that feeling of exhilaration when you’re around the girl you’re into.Norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline (but not the same thing as adrenalin), is a messenger for your central nervous system.It decides what’s the most important stuff for you to focus on, and it’s why you’re able to block out everything else around you when you’re with the girl you love.
Serotonin regulates quite a few functions, including sleep, sexual behavior, and body temperature. The reason your skin may tingle when you’re around the girl you like is because serotonin drops your body temperature, making your skin temporarily more conductive of electricity. Pretty cool, right?If a girl isn’t attracted to you, it doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you. It’s all down to chemistry.;
, People send off a lot of messages with their bodies, some conscious and some unconscious. You can tell a lot about whether a girl is interested in you by looking at how she holds her body when she’s around you.“Open” body language, such as uncrossed arms and legs, relaxed posture, and smiling are all signs that she’s into the interaction.
If a girl plays with her hair, tilts her head when she talks to you, or keeps her hands and wrists relaxed and visible, these are good signs that she’s interested in what’s going on between you.
If her legs and feet are pointed toward you rather than away from you, it’s a sign that she is engaged in your interaction.
Watch how she smiles. True smiles, also called “duchenne” smiles, use the muscles around your eyes as well as your lips. If the creases around her eyes wrinkle a little bit when she smiles, it’s a good sign. If only the muscles around her mouth move, she’s probably trying to hide discomfort., Your body’s autonomic system is in control of a whole host of functions, including sexual attraction.When you’re attracted to someone, certain responses usually occur without you even knowing. Look for the following:


Flushed cheeks. When you’re aroused, blood rushes into your face and cheeks. (This is the reason why some cultures use blush.) People may also flush when they’re nervous or embarrassed, though, so don’t take this as the only sign that she’s into you.Reddening or plumping lips. Arousal causes blood to rush into the lips, making them appear redder and fuller. (Hence the reason some women wear lipstick.) And if she licks her lips, she may be signaling she’d be open to a kiss.Dilated pupils. Physical arousal (stress, attraction, etc.) tends to dilate our pupils. If hers are bigger than usual, she might be unconsciously signaling that she’s excited to be around you.

, Guys have plenty of body language cues too.And, fortunately for you, girls tend to be better at interpreting body language than guys are.This means she’ll probably pick up if you throw a few signals her way.


Keep your body language open. Don’t cross your arms or legs, keep your arms and hands relaxed, and don’t check your phone every 10 seconds.Keep your hands in plain sight. Studies show that we find people more trustworthy when we can see their hands.
Lean in a little bit. Don’t get creepily close, but show you’re interested by leaning it just a bit or tilting your head in her direction.
Smile. You don’t have to force anything, just throw her a quick glance and a friendly smile. If she returns it, she may be interested.
If she seems open and inviting, gently touch her. Maybe reach for her hand or gently brush her forearm. Don’t touch anywhere that’s too personal, and if she doesn’t react well, don’t try it again., You don’t have to be a bodybuilder or star athlete, and you don’t have to wear neon or flashy labels to impress a girl. However, humans have evolved to interpret signs of physical health, such as cleanliness, tidiness, and fitness, as signs that your genes are healthy too.Keep yourself clean, neat, and well-groomed. Not only will you not stink. you’ll project that you care about yourself -- which means you’re likely to care about her, too.
Eat a healthy diet and get regular exercise. You can still have the occasional doughnut or pizza, but try to eat lots of fresh vegetables and fruits, lean proteins, and whole grains. Exercise about 30 minutes a day.

, If you want the girl to fall in love with you, you have to catch her eye. Be friendly and approachable and to stand out to her in some way. Studies show that girls usually value social traits like friendliness and kindness even more than physical attractiveness.Here are some ways to make her notice you:


Be a bit of a joker. If you make people crack up, tell funny stories, or just generally look like you’re having a great time, science suggests she’ll be more interested in you. Research shows that both girls and guys tend to value a sense of humor very highly.Just don’t demean others or be bitter -- that is a quick way to kill any attraction.Make some quick eye contact. Hold it for 4-5 seconds and smile at her.This will show her you’re fun and approachable without coming on too strong.
Be playful. Most guys and girls find playfulness very important.Make even everyday things like study group a little wacky and fun. Be able to laugh at yourself.
You don’t need to try too hard to look different. Unless you’d like to dress in a unique way, the best thing you can do is to wear clean, well-fitting clothes and to pay attention to your hygiene. Be yourself, express something about yourself with your appearance, and let the rest of it come as it will.

, If you want the girl to be hooked fast, then you have to let her see that you really want to get to know her and care about the person who she is. You don’t want her to think that you’re just looking for arm candy or that you just want any pretty girl to fall in love with you. If you actually want to get to know her, then you have to put in the time, pay attention, and ask her questions that help you understand who she really is. Here are some things you can ask her about:Her favorite bands, musicians, TV shows, and movies
Her pets
Her friends
Her family
Her hopes for the future
Her weekend plans
Her childhood
Her favorite hobbies
Her favorite books

, Though you may be extra eager to get the girl to fall in love with you fast, you don’t want to rush her or to force it too much. If you have the sense that the girl likes you but that she wants to move a bit more slowly than you do, then have the respect to let her do that. If you try to get her to move at your pace and she’s not ready for it, then she may feel overwhelmed and may actually back off. If you do feel a connection forming, then it’s worth the wait.


If you sense that it takes this girl a bit longer to open up, then you shouldn’t ask her too many personal questions or reveal too much about yourself right away, or she may feel taken aback.
Don’t introduce the girl to all of your friends and relatives right away if she’s still feeling out the situation. You don’t want her to feel pressured to commit to you too soon.

, To get the girl to like you right away, you have to show her that you respect other people (including her). This doesn’t mean you have to pull out her chair at the table or always pay for dinner; in fact, some girls may find these unappealing. It does mean that you should show respect and kindness to everyone you encounter, especially the girl you want to woo. Studies show that traits like kindness actually make people see you as more physically attractive.Feel out (or just ask) what your girl prefers. Some girls like the door held for them; others would prefer to do it themselves. Whatever she wants, that’s what you should do.
Remember that she will also judge you based on how you treat other people, especially people you have a certain level of power over (like servers at a restaurant). If you’re rude to your waiter, your girl will notice, and she’ll probably expect that at some point you’ll be rude to her too.
Whether you’re going on an official date or just meeting up to see a movie, be respectful. Get there on time, be courteous, and give her a compliment or two.
Though you don’t need to dress up like a prince when you’re together, if you don’t put in any effort into your appearance, then she’ll think you don’t care for her.
Everyone slips up. If you do, acknowledge your mistake and apologize for it right away.

, You’re more likely to get a girl to fall for you if you show that you believe you’re worth falling for. Be confident, but never cocky. Studies suggest that your self-confidence will draw her to you.True self-confidence comes from knowing and accepting yourself for who you are. When you’re cool with yourself, you inspire others to feel the same way.
Cockiness, on the other hand, may come from a deeper insecurity about yourself. You may feel the need to get your self-esteem from external sources, or like you have to put people down to feel good about yourself.Don’t brag about yourself, tear others down, or puff yourself up with arrogance. Your general rule of thumb? Don’t be a jerk.
A little self-deprecation can actually increase others’ perceptions of your confidence because you aren’t insecure about the little foibles we all have. Don’t present yourself as though you’re the world’s sorriest human, but if you have some flaws, laugh them off. For example: “Oh, no, you do not want me to help you with your math homework. You would fail the class. Now, if it’s history, you just call me up.”

, In order to get the girl’s attention and to keep her interested, you have to show her that she’s special and that she really stands out to you. Tell her why you think she’s different from her friends or the other girls out there, give her sincere compliments, and tell her how cool it is to get to know a girl like her. Don’t stare at every pretty girl in the room, either, or she’ll think she’s just one of your conquests. Here are some ways to really make her feel special:


Show her that you’re paying attention. Bring up something she talked about the last time she saw you, whether it was a book she was reading or an exam she was studying for, and ask her about it.
Give her a meaningful compliment. Sure, telling her she has nice eyes can make her feel good, but she’ll be even more flattered if you compliment her intelligence.
Let her see that you only have eyes for her. If her friends are around, don’t flirt with them; show the girl you like that you’re only focused on her.

, Though you may feel like you want to put all of your feelings out there right away and to tell the girl exactly how you feel, if you really want to keep her close, you want to keep a little bit of mystery.Don’t tell her every last thing you’re feeling about her, or she may feel like you’re over-sharing (or worse, only talking about yourself).


It’s also tempting to tell her everything about yourself in an attempt to convince her that you’re a great catch. However, it’s a better idea to let your conversations grow naturally. Ask her some questions about herself. If she’s interested in you, she’ll ask some back. You can let your sharing grow from there.
There are a few things you should probably not share. For example, don’t go on about your ex-girlfriends, even if you’re saying how crazy or awful they were. This might initially make her feel flattered, but it’s also a sign that if you break up, you’ll talk about her that way to someone else, and that is a major red flag.Trashing your boss is also a sign that you may not understand appropriate behavior, which could turn her off.

, If you really want the girl to fall for you right away, then you have to show her that you’re a dynamic, interesting guy who is worth knowing. Let her see that there are things you are passionate about, that you are keen on self-improvement, and that you do more than play video games for hours when you’re apart. Being a healthy, well-rounded person is attractive.Girls want guys who are interesting conversationalists. If she feels like you have nothing to contribute to the conversation other than the score of the baseball game or like the only thing you read are your friends’ text messages, then she won’t be as eager to hang out with you.
Guys who are independent are attractive to girls because independence is also a sign of confidence. If you’re comfortable pursuing your own interests, then this shows that you don’t need the company of others to find validation.
Be comfortable with doing your own thing. If you’d rather read a novel or play guitar in the park than hang out with a big group of people, she’ll respect your drive and independence.
This also means you let her do her own thing too. If she has interests that you’re not into, don’t feel bad about her not involving you. It’s actually healthy for people in relationships to have some separate interests.

, Sometimes girls can feel like it’s nearly impossible to get a guy to listen to them these days. If you want to stand out and to really make a girl fall in love with you fast, then you have to show her she’s worth it by making a real effort to listen to every word she says. Make eye contact, put away your phone, and avoid interrupting her while she’s trying to tell you something. Let her see that you care about what she thinks and that you want to understand what she’s going through.If she asks for advice, you can give it to her, but don’t be too quick to give her advice if all she wants is for someone to listen to her. If you aren’t sure, ask: “I just want to make sure I give you what you need. Do you want me to give you advice or do you just need to vent? I’m cool either way.”
If she’s going through a hard time, don’t just compare her experiences to your own; this can make it feel as if you’re minimizing her problems. However, if you really do have a relevant experience that you think can help her, then you can bring it up cautiously. For example, “Wow, that sounds terrible. I’ve also had horrible bosses, so I can totally empathize. When my boss was a jerk, I did _____. What do you think about trying that here?”
Practice active listening. While you don’t have to nod emphatically after every word she says, you should repeat some of what she says back to her in your own words to show that you really care.
Clarify anything you don’t understand, especially if it is fairly emotional. Your feelings may get hurt from time to time, or you may have no clue what she’s talking about. Stay cool and ask for clarification. For example: “I’m not sure I understood you right. I heard ________. Was that what you meant?” Take her at her word when she explains.

, If you want the girl to fall in love with you fast, then you have to make her see that she’s on your mind even when you’re a hundred miles apart. Though you don’t want to suffocate her with phone calls, you should give her a quick call or send a sweet text message often enough that she feels like you’re still thinking of her and that she really matters to you. Make sure she sees how important she is to you and that you want her to be a regular part of your life.


Just make sure you’re not always the one texting or calling her. You want there to be a balance so she doesn’t feel smothered. Otherwise, something called the “distancer-pursuer dynamic” can show up, where you continue to chase after her and she feels so overwhelmed that she keeps pulling back.Send her a quick note with a sweet reminder of something fun you did together or something you love about her to make her smile. Just say something like, “I keep thinking about how much fun I had hiking with you. I can’t wait to do it again soon” or “I can’t stop thinking about how cute you look with your new haircut.”

, If you want a girl to fall in love with you fast, then you have to be willing and ready to open up to her pretty quickly. You don’t want her to feel like you’re not vulnerable or like you’re not ready to share yourself with her, though you also don’t want to overwhelm her with too much private information at once.As you get to know each other better and better, you should make an effort to let her see who you really are. Here are some things you can open up to her about:


Your hopes and dreams
Your childhood
Your biggest disappointments
Your friendships
Your family
Your favorite hobbies
Your favorite memories

, One of the best ways to make a girl fall in love with you is to show her support and acceptance. Even if she already has high self-confidence, you should make her feel special, compliment her, and point out all of the things she’s good at; you want her to feel like you help inspire her to be the best version of herself.Be there to support and encourage her and make her feel like she can do anything. Whether she’s preparing for a hard test or an interview for her dream job, you should point out all of the reasons why she’ll do an amazing job.
If she has a big day coming up, write her a letter telling her she’ll do great. Make sure to check in with her after the event to see how it went, too.

, Another way to make a girl fall in love with you fast is to show her how dependable you are. You can’t say you’ll be somewhere and not show up, promise you’ll help her out with something and then cancel at the last minute, or be nowhere in sight the second she needs a shoulder to cry on. Dependability builds trust. You want this girl to think that you’ll be there for her through thick and thin and that she can trust you no matter what is going on.If she feels like she can’t really depend on you, then she’ll definitely doubt your feelings for her. Show her that your word is worth its weight in gold.
If you do have to cancel on her for some reason, let her know why. We all have unexpected stuff come up that keeps us from following through sometimes. She’s less likely to think you’re a flake if you explain what happened and express that you’re sorry you had to miss out on spending time with her. For example: “I’m so sorry I have to miss our date tonight! My mom is working late and my little brother has nobody to take him to soccer practice but me. How about tomorrow?”

, To really build a deep connection with the girl and to make her see how much you love and care about her, you have to make a real effort to bond with her friends and her family. These are the most important people in anyone’s life, and they can have a huge influence.Try to really get to know the important people in her life, to show them your best self, and to treat your girlfriend with the respect she deserves when you’re around other people. If you want your relationship to last, then you have to have the approval of her friends and family.


You may never be best friends with her friends and family, but you should still make sure they like you and think that you’re kind to your girlfriend; they have to think that she can be herself around you.
Ask them how they’re doing, show an interest in their lives, and be friendly, even if you run into them without your girlfriend.

, If you want the girl to fall in love with you fast, then she has to see that you’re someone who can really be there for her in the long run. Though you don’t have to ask her to think too far ahead, you can exhibit the qualities that any good long-term boyfriend should have if you want her to love you and to see real potential with you. Here are some things you can do to show that you’d make a great long-term boyfriend:


Have great manners
Treat her family with the utmost respect
Exude confidence
Be driven and motivated to achieve your goals
Be punctual
Be comfortable opening up to her and showing vulnerability
Make her feel good about herself and respect her decisions
Don’t drink too much and embarrass yourself or do anything else that would make her not want to be seen with you in public

, If you really want the girl to fall in love with you, then you have to be okay with letting her do her own thing. Contrary to what you may think, putting on pressure for her to spend as much of her waking hours with you as possible won’t actually make her fall in love with you any faster. In fact, being comfortable with letting her spend time with her friends and to pursue her own interests will actually make her love you more, because she’ll appreciate you more if you’re not always together. She’ll also appreciate the freedom to pursue her own interests and passions.If you’re okay with her being on her own, this also shows that you’re confident in yourself and your relationship. This will also help make her feel more excited about your relationship.
If you text or call her every five minutes when she’s out with her friends, then she’ll feel like you don’t really trust her. This type of behavior is actually a warning sign of abuse. Don’t be a control freak.

, If you want to make your relationship last forever, then you can’t take your girlfriend for granted. You have to make her see how much everything she does means to you and how much better your life is because she’s in it. You can’t get complacent and assume that she knows just how you feel about her because you’re together.You can write her a love letter just because you feel like telling her all of the ways that she makes your life better.
You have to remember to thank her for everything she does for you, even if she just runs a small errand, so she always feels like you appreciate her.
If you know you won’t be able to see each other a lot for an extended period of time, make sure that you call her and stay in touch so she doesn’t think she’s out of your mind just because she’s out of sight.
On the other hand, you don’t need to smother her, either. Secure attachments mean that each person feels comfortable and confident in the other person’s love. If you’ve said “I love you” once or twice that day, there’s no need to say it 50 more times. Too much can actually make you seem insecure.

, You don’t have to tell her that you love her every second of the day, but you should tell her at least once a day, and say it like you mean it, by looking in her eyes, putting away your phone or other distractions, and showing her that there’s nothing more important to you than telling her how you feel about her.Texting her “love you” or saying “love you!” as you walk off is not the same thing as really making the effort to say “I love you.” Avoid shortcuts when it comes to telling your girlfriend how you feel.
Don’t say that you love her when you’re in a fight or have just made up from an argument; “I love you” can mean the most when you say it just because.

, No matter how long you’ve been together, you have to make an effort to keep that spark of romance alive. Make sure you always have time for date nights, that you take care with your appearance when you’re together, and that you keep your relationship feeling exciting and adventurous. Keep on complimenting your girlfriend, being sweet to her, and giving her love and affection, and keep your romance going strong no matter what.Don’t forget to give your girlfriend a kiss when you spend time together. Kiss her passionately, not just because you’re saying hello or goodbye.
Give your girlfriend little meaningful gifts just because. Don’t give her a gift just because it’s her birthday or because an anniversary is coming up, but because you just feel like telling her how much you care.
Even if you’re having a date night in, make sure to wear flattering, well-fitting clothes. Don’t make your girlfriend feel like you don’t want to put in the effort anymore.

, If you’ve fallen in love and are determined to make that love last a long time, then you have to be prepared for the fact that your girlfriend won’t always be the same person she was when you met her. She will evolve, develop new interests, gain new experiences, and will see the world a different way, just like you will. You have to be prepared for the fact that you’ll both change as you move forward with your lives, and be accepting and even excited about that idea.


The key is that, while you both develop new interests and have life take you in new directions, that you develop together, instead of growing further apart.
While you may not always have the exact same interests, you can’t let the fact that you’re changing drive you apart. When things change, you have to talk about it and be accepting of it instead of always wishing you could go back to the way things were.

, To keep your loving relationship going, you have to make sure you do little things to show your girlfriend how much you love and care about her. It’s not all about the grand gestures, and life really is lived in the details.No matter how busy you are, you should never stop making an effort to show your girlfriend how much she really means to you. Here are some little things you can do to make your relationship shine in a big way:


Leave her little love notes around the house for her to find when you’re not around
Send her a sweet text or email during your day to let her know you’re thinking of her
Bring her flowers just because, not because it’s her birthday
Prepare a romantic meal for her at home when you know she’s having a busy week
Do little favors for her, like picking up lunch or coffee for her, when you know she needs a bit of extra help

, If you want to keep your love going strong, then you and your girlfriend have to build meaningful traditions that make your life together really special. This can be anything from playing bocce together to watching your favorite TV shows every Sunday night; it’s not important what you do, but that you take pleasure in each other’s company and find things to do together that make your lives and your relationship better.Here are some things you can do to build traditions together:


Go on a short vacation during each yearly anniversary
Write each other love notes on your birthdays
Have a movie-and-dinner-at-home night at least once a month
Pick up a new hobby together, such as biking or writing songs
Go to your favorite “date night” restaurant at least once a month
Find your favorite hiking trail and hike it at least once a year
Give each other gag gifts during a specific holiday

, While building strong traditions is one way to keep your relationship going strong, another way to make your love last is to never stop finding new ways to keep your relationship feeling new.Step out of your comfort zones, seek out new adventures, and don’t be afraid to be spontaneous. Making a real effort to make your relationship feel exciting can help your love stand the test of time. Here are some things you can do:


Take dance lessons together
Explore a completely new place together
Make an effort to meet new friends together
Learn a new skill together, such as cooking or speaking a foreign language
Point out new things you love about each other

Avoid talking endlessly about yourself.",How to Make a Girl at School Like You1," Interact with the girl you have a crush on. Say ""hello"" when you see her at school and at extracurricular activities.
If you never talked to the girl before, just find the courage to simply even smile at her, and maybe later say hello, that will make it pretty clear to her.
If you never acknowledge the girl you like, she will never know you have a crush on her.
Don't be too shy when you try to talk to her. Confidence is a very attractive quality.
Don't stare at her for too long. This will make a lot of girls uneasy and wonder what's wrong with them.
When you introduce yourself, keep your body language open and vibrant. Don't slouch, look away or mumble.
Keep your initial conversations very casual. Ask her how she is, what she is doing etc.;
, Chances are she spends some time on Facebook or Twitter. Initiate an online or text conversation by saying:


""Hey, how are you?""
""What are you up to?""
Comment on the photos on her page. If she has a pet, ask her about it. If you see her playing a sport, this is something you can try to drum up a conversation about.

, Girls like to hear nice things about themselves.


Give her friendly compliments. Don't always comment on her looks.
Girls don't want to get attention for their appearance alone. If she is good at something, tell her!
To compliment a girl you could always say ""I noticed you are a great dancer."" or ""I like what you said in history class today. I never thought of things in that way.""
If she is an athlete, compliment her on her last game: ""Hey, you were awesome at last weekends soccer game"".

Learn how to act around girls.,
Be likable.,
Appreciate the whole person.,
Pay attention to girls who aren’t used to it.",How to Make Any Girl Go Crazy over You1," Before you single out a particular girl to work your charms on it’s a good idea to understand how to behave around them in general. In fact, the more girls like you in general the better your odds are that the one you’re interested in will take notice.


There are a lot of myths out there about things that girls don’t like: being a ""nice guy,"" being sensitive, etc. Believing those myths might actually lose you points.
Treat girl friends (as opposed to girlfriends) like one of the guys: be friendly, talk about your shared interests, tell jokes, and listen. Toss in some extra politeness and consideration and voila! You’re on your way to becoming that down-to-earth, chivalrous guy she’s been hoping for.;
, But don't be a doormat. It's fine—awesome—to be nice and sensitive. But don't push it so far that you become like her brother. That's the kiss of death to any hopes you might have, so let your conversation go into areas brothers never go.


For example, saying something like, ""You look nice, Julia,"" may be true, and she'll probably like to hear it, but c'mon—it's something her brother could say! Instead, try something like, ""Damn, Julia, you look sexy today. Those jeans are smokin' on you!"" Think her brother might say that? Let's hope not. Don't be her brother and don't give her reason to think of you as one.

, People tend to give what they get, and get what they give. If she thinks you appreciate her just for her mind, then it's likely that she'll also appreciate you for your mind, too. But not your body, bro.


Appreciate all of her—her mind, her spirit, and her body. Let her know you think she's pretty, or sexy, or both.

, Plenty of perfectly nice, pretty girls get left on the sidelines because they’re quiet, shy, or not part of a fashionable social group.


The next time you sit next to one of these girls in class, strike up a conversation with her; the next time you see a girl standing around at a party or club, invite her to dance. Even if it’s clear that there's no romantic interest, she won’t forget it—and she will never look at you the same way again.
Learning how to interact with girls on a social level, without wanting anything other than their company, is a good lesson to learn. The more comfortable you are around girls in general, the more comfortable you will be when you meet somebody you really like.

Notice when she touches you.",How to Make a Girl Attracted to You," Spending time on your looks is important. Don't go overboard, but make sure that you dress well. Take the time to comb your hair and have a neat, clean cut appearance. It will convince the girl that you've made an effort for her, which tells her she is special to you. If you go out wearing the same dirty clothing that you wore yesterday, it will appear that you don't care and might make her think that you're not actually interested or that you don't value her opinion enough.


Wear a little cologne. Just don't overdo it or it will be overpowering. You want her to focus on you, not the overwhelming scent around you.;
, A smile can help relax the tension when you are just getting to know someone. It says you're confident and having fun. A good smile can even make you seem more successful. The key to smiling is to be genuine. When people are really happy and having fun, it usually is the eyes that express the emotion to others.
Smiling too quickly can seem contrived. When you smile, slowly pull back the corners of your mouth.

, You don't need to be ripped, just eat right and exercise to keep your body in good shape. Women are more likely to find a man attractive if he takes care of himself. It will help you to feel more confident too.


Get your rest, too. You may not realize how much the dark circles under your eyes make you less attractive, but women do.

, Don't worry about what you can say or how you can dress to make women like you. Focus on what you can do to improve yourself.Once you start going after the other things you want to achieve in life, aside from picking up women, you will start to notice women can sense your drive and ambition and will be drawn to it.


Success goes further than being wealthy. Perhaps you want to learn more, or sing in a band or climb a mountain. The kind of guy who goes after these dreams is the kind of guy that will have more success attracting women.

, Even if you aren't feeling very confident yet, fake it until you make it. Look her in the eyes, stand up straight and keep your hands out of your pockets.Speak clearly and project your voice so she can easily hear you.


Even though girls admire confidence, don't gloat so much come across as self-absorbed.

Relax. Men that are relaxed are more attractive than those that are stressed out., Be sure that she can see you coming. When you approach from behind a woman, it can set off her protective instinct. Approach from the front so she won't feel alarmed.Since most people decide if they like someone in the first 30 seconds, it's important to make them count.If you get approach her in a way that is immediately uncomfortable for her, you may have a hard time making a good impression.

, Talking to girls can take guts, but it's something you're going to have to do to make a girl interested in you. Just power through the initial awkwardness. It may take you some time to get used to starting up a natural conversation, but the more you attempt to approach women the better you will be at it.


Don't use a pick-up line. She probably heard it before. Just say, ""Hi."" If you're looking to be more original, ""Hello"" works too.
Introduce yourself. Shake her hand gently, too.
If you're at school or somewhere and she is talking with a group of friends, move nearby so as to overhear the conversation. Then interrupt to ask a question about their conversation. It doesn't even matter what they are saying. For example, if she says something like, ""It was such a good movie,"" just interrupt and ask ""what movie?"" Instead of hitting on her you are suddenly just part of her conversation and she is likely to give you a few moments.

, Don't dive in with compliments, or start an awkward conversation about the weather. Start a conversation as naturally as possible, like you're chatting up someone you already know.


Tell her a funny personal story. You can even make one up ahead of time. If you can make her laugh right away she will likely enjoy your company.
Use an indirect opener. An indirect opener can let you start a conversation while staying under the radar. For example try saying, ""What is a good place to get a drink around here?"" She might offer a suggestion, then you can work up a conversation. After you talk with her for awhile, you can ask her to go to the place she suggested.
If you're younger and approaching a girl in school, there are lots of opportunities to open a conversation. For example, whether you have a class together or not ask, ""Don't we have a class together?"" Even if you don't you can insist you do, or say you are pretty sure you've met before. Then, ask her name and keep the conversation going.
Try a situational opener. Depending on where you are, you might start a conversation by pointing out something around you. For example, if there is music playing you can ask ""Do you know who sings this song?"" Whether she knows or not, you can comment on how good or bad the song is and, before you know it, you're talking about all sorts of topics.

, Don't try too hard to memorize pickup lines or work from some script. It will only clog up your brain and make it hard to have a comfortable conversation.Don't be afraid to fail or get shot down. The only way to get better at talking to women is to practice until you get comfortable doing it. Once you have a little success, you will start to build more confidence and find that approaching girls is not as hard as you once believed.

, Converse with her by asking questions and making comments about what she is saying. You should always go the extra mile to keep the conversation going if you are interested. Ask open-ended questions that require more than a yes or no answer to keep her talking more and telling you more about herself. For example, instead of asking if she likes music, ask ""Who are your favorite musicians?""


If you're struggling to find something to say to keep the conversation going, try saying something like, ""That's really fascinating, tell me more about that.""
Give her your full attention. Don't go looking around at other girls, or the room, or even your cell phone. If you make positive noises, like ""uh huh"" or ""right"" during her pauses it will prevent you from seeming cold and encourage her to keep talking., It doesn't matter what you say as long as she feels like she keeps hearing more reasons to talk to you. Be funny, or let her see your life is exciting, or that you are incredibly smart, or successful or romantic. If you can keep showing her you possess positive qualities and bring them to the conversation, she will be anxious to keep you around and learn more about you.

, You might be a total tough guy and maybe it has worked for you in the past. A girl may need to see that there is more to a guy before she is attracted to him. Even if you don't really think you have a soft side, you may need to show her one. Talk about something that made you sad, or when you tried to do the right thing but failed. Find a story about yourself that will let her feel she is getting to know the real you and show her you have an emotional side.


Don't be an open book. While it is good to open up, know when to shut it down. You don't want to talk too much about your shortcomings, or bring a negative tone to the conversation.

, Talk about what you really care most about and let her see how much it matters to you. Women are more likely to be attracted to a man that is driven, has a purpose, and knows what he wants from life.


You can talk about places you really want to travel to and where you have been. Talk about how much you love doing what you do. You can even be very passionate about music, books, painting or skydiving. Bring up whatever it is that really matters to you.

, Being the center of attention makes a person feel good. Try complimenting her, perhaps notice her hair, or the way she laughs, or something she has done that has impressed you.


You can also try giving her a nickname. Something fun and playful can help ease the tension and build a connection.If you notice she is always eating a blueberry muffin for breakfast at work or school, you can call her ""muffin"" or ""blue.""
Maintain eye contact when talking to her. This helps to reassure her that she is the center of your attention and lets her know you're actually listening.

, One of the biggest mistakes guys make is to soften up too much around women.Modern men have been trained to be less manly in order to come off as less threatening. You don't need to act hard or macho to be seen as an alpha male.


Keep your eyes up. Don't look at the floor. This can project insecurities and a lack of confidence. Keeping your chin up projects pride and confidence which is more likely to appeal to a woman.
Make your intentions clear. You don't have to say something blunt like, ""I want you."" Casually interject that she is ""good-looking,"" or ""stunning,"" or something along those lines to show you find her attractive. Do this early on in your conversation so she knows what you are looking for.
Touch her. Don't be afraid to put your hand on her back, or touch her gently on the hands. You don't want to make any moves that are too aggressive, but be an alpha male by letting her know your intentions. Be sure to judge her reactions. If she seems uncomfortable, don't push it.

, Have the same energy that she has during the conversation. Slightly more energy is okay, too.


Even if she rejects you, remain upbeat. She may come around to seeing things your way (but if she doesn't, just let it go––don't be a stalker). Showing that you are man enough to handle her decision and still be confident and happy will likely impress her.

, Leave a bit of uncertainty about your interest in her. Women will tend to think about men more when they are not sure how much a man likes her.If you tell her that you think she is the most amazing woman in the world right away, she will not wonder about your feelings. If you can let her know you're interested, but make her wonder exactly how interested you are, she will likely have trouble getting your encounter out of her head.


Be busy. Tell her you really want to take her out, but you're so busy lately that you can't make any promises. This makes you seem important and in demand. That you have a full and interesting life. That you like her, but that she will have to work to win you. Suddenly she finds herself the pursuer in the relationship and you are something to obtain.

, Take a line from Ryan Gosling in Crazy Stupid Love and say, ""Let's get out of here."" Instead of posing a question, this statement infers you are already together.It doesn't matter if you go somewhere else together, or go to your house, if she agrees to leave with you, then you know you have her very attracted to you.

, If a woman is facing you most of the time, you have her interest. If she is turning her head often to check out the rest of the room, then she is probably looking at other options. A woman's body facing a room full of people is an unconscious way of appearing available, whereas a woman that is facing you, is focused on you.

, If she is holding her purse or jacket in between you, then she is creating a barrier.She might not even realize that she is doing it, but that doesn't mean you should ignore the implications. It could mean that she is a guarded person, or that she is not quite sure about you yet. Either way, you should know it might be a sign that might not be turned on.


If she is creeping in on your personal space, there is a good chance she is doing it intentionally. Just be sure you aren't the one who is actually moving closer.

, If she has no interest in you, she won't be sharing an embarrassing story from her past. Even if she isn't sharing anything too deep or personal, if she is opening up at all, you're doing something right.

, If a girl is not into you, she won't have any desire to put her hands on you.If she does, even in a way that is seemingly innocent, it could be a good sign she has some interest. Be sure to touch her back in a similar fashion.

Make sure you aren’t just afraid of being alone.,
Don’t expect her to “fix” you.,
Know who you are.",How to Know if You Are Ready to Date a Girl1," You shouldn’t start dating a girl just because you want to be part of a couple. That can make you desperate, which means you may wind up scaring her off by being too clingy and possessive. You should be happy on your own before you start dating someone new.You should have your own hobbies, interests, and friends that you really enjoy even without a romantic relationship in your life. If you aren’t happy with those things, work on them before looking to date a girl.;
, If there are issues in your life that you wish would go away, such as insecurities or anxiety, you can’t expect that the girl who you date will magically make them go away. A girlfriend shouldn’t be responsible for sorting out your problems -- you’ll either attract someone who has a savior complex or she’ll wind up resenting you, and in both cases, your relationship probably won’t work out.If you aren’t able to deal with the problems that you’re facing on your own, you may want to talk to a therapist or counselor, who can assist you in finding healthy ways to work through your issues before you start dating.

, Sometimes when you’re looking to attract a girl, you may be tempted to portray yourself as someone other than who you really are to appeal to her interests. For example, if she tells you that she loves tennis, you might lie and say that you were a tennis star in school even though you’ve never picked up a racket. That’s a big mistake because she should like you for who you really are and you won’t be comfortable faking it. Have enough confidence to be yourself.Being yourself doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be open to new experiences. If she has a hobby or interest that she’d like to share with you, be willing to learn more about it -- and share your interests with her as well.

Maintain your daily hygiene.,
Dress well.,
Feel good in your skin.,
Have good posture.",How to Impress a Girl in Middle School1," Make it a priority to shower often in order to smell clean and avoid foul odors. Try to brush your teeth, comb your hair, and upkeep any other part of the body before leaving for school. Feeling fresh not only looks good, but you’ll feel rejuvenated and confident.Most boys begin to have a more distinct body odor in middle school. Combat this by wearing deodorant. Avoid using strong colognes such as Axe unless it is in small proportions. If the smell is overbearing, ladies won’t want to hang out too close.
If you feel the need to use cologne, use it sparingly.
Try choosing a deodorant that smells refreshing with a hint of musk.;
, Image is important for first impressions. Don’t give her the impression that you have a shabby personality because of your clothing. Upgrade some of your t-shirts, jeans, and button down shirts for nicer versions.


Swap out your jeans for corduroy, slacks, or khakis. Grab some polos instead of a band t-shirt. Try out a flannel instead of hoodie.Even if your middle school requires uniforms, you can still pull off a sharp look by caring for your clothes.
Do not let your clothes get shabby or smelly. As a general rule, don’t wear a top more than one day. Pants should only be worn two to three times before a wash.

, While looks are not the only thing that matters, it’s often the first thing that a girl will notice about you. Confidence is something that girls can easily pick up on. Try setting small goals for yourself like learning the piano (middle school is the perfect age to begin an instrument). Exercise is another way to feel comfortable in your body and boost your self-esteem.


You can reach a confident state of mind by dressing in a way that comforts you.
Once you’re out the door, don’t look back on what you’re wearing. Live in the moment and don’t worry about your clothes out of the house., Having a confident posture can impact your chance of success by positively affecting your brain. Your posture impacts the way others see you.While standing be sure to hold your head and chin up straight while looking ahead, put your shoulders back, and take a deep breath to relax your shoulders.


When you're sitting down put your back against the backrest of the chair, put your knees at a right angle, and keep your feet flat on the floor.
Avoid slumping forward while standing or sitting. Try to look ahead of you while walking instead of looking down at the ground."

If you know she has expressed an interest in going to a specific event, offer to take her. Say ""I heard you wanted to go to the dance on Friday. I would like to take you, if you still want to go.""
Make your offer for a date about her and her interests.
Don't ask forcefully or be rude if she turns you down.
It doesn't have to be an expensive activity or date. The importance of a date is to be able to spend time together one on one.

, This is a huge turn-off.


Give her some space. Don't always hang around her.

Girls like guys who are comfortable with themselves and have a lot of self confidence.
If you are creative, get involved with a music group, art group, or theater. You will meet, and hopefully attract, girls who have similar interests and talents.

, Stay involved in your sports, arts, or school activities even when you are interested in chasing a girl.Don't spend 100% of your time thinking about the girl you like or trying to impress her.
You will need balance in your life. Keep yourself occupied with your own hobbies in the meantime.

Friendships are important. Make sure that once you start dating a girl, you don't neglect your friends.

, You don't want your grades to slide because you are distracted by trying to make a girl like you.A guy with good grades will be more attractive to girls than a guy who is failing all of his classes.
Participate in your classes. Girls will notice this if you are confident in class.
If you aren't doing well in a class, you could ask a girl for help if it's a subject she is good at.

"
"
Approach her and lead into something appropriate.,
Pick a conversation starter.,
Work in compliments as conversation starters.,
Don't come on too strong.,
Keep talking to her around school.,
Don't put her on a pedestal.,
Close the deal.,
Have some style.,
Be friendly.,
Stand up for your beliefs.,
Don't be afraid of rejection.",How to Pick Up Girls in High School," This is the hardest part. Try to get over your nerves; don't let them show in stammers or sweating. Feel confident in order to look confident.


Talk about something appropriate when you initiate. In the back of her mind, the girl probably knows that you're talking to her because she looks pretty, but you have to at least pretend to have a reason to talk to her.
As long as it makes sense that you'd talk to her about it out of the blue, go for it:

Don't start with a cheesy pick up line like ""If I were a stop light, I'd turn red every time you passed by, just so I could stare at you a bit longer."" Let's face it: these rarely work. Increase your chances by starting casual.
You might say something like ""I heard you were in class. My class sucks, so I'm thinking about transferring in there if I can. How is it?""
Or you could try: ""Hey, I saw you cheer last Friday at the football game. When is the next home game going to be?""

;
, Now that you've put yourself in a social situation, you'll probably need to have a conversation starter. Getting up and talking to her is great, but if you have nothing to say after your lead-in, it could get awkward fast.


Try an indirect conversation starter. An indirect conversation starter is where you just start talking to her without pointing out how beautiful she is. Remember to be confident.

""I'm looking for a woman’s perspective on this. I was just talking to a friend whose girlfriend broke up with him. The problem is that she keeps calling him. Why does she do it?”
Or: ""Maybe you can help me out. I'm new here and I don't really know what people do for fun. What do you and your friends do for the weekend?""


If you're a little more confident, you can try a more direct approach. Remember that this approach has a bigger chance of backfiring, but it could also really impress the girl.

""I don't usually say this, but you're absolutely the most stunning girl that I've seen in the past...3 minutes. Hi, my name is .""
""Sorry to bother you, but you look too good to be alone right now. Do you mind if I walk with you for a little bit?""



, Everyone enjoys being flattered. If it's in good taste, and you do it just enough, you could make a big impression right away.


""Hi, those are wonderful earrings. Did you make them?""
""Hi, that's a beautiful dress, did you make it yourself?""
""Hi there, I couldn't help but noticing how your dress matches your eyes. It's a great color.""
Whatever you do, don't talk about feminine body parts, as a rule. Almost all girls are turned-off when you talk about their breasts or butt. So don't shoot yourself in the foot; stick to complimenting her hair, eyes, lips, or clothes.

, Getting into a conversation is a great start. But don't ask too much of her on the first pass. Keep it light, and keep it quick. Be out of her face in five minutes or less.


If the conversation has hit a natural cliff, don't be afraid to simply say: ""It was nice meeting you. I'll see you around some time?""
If the conversation goes really well — she's laughing and flirting with her eyes — ask for her phone number. Just a simple, ""Hey, can I get your phone number? Maybe we can meet outside of class?""

, One conversation won't always make or break you, luckily. If you didn't make the best impression on her the first time, keep coming back and engage her in conversation. Her guard might come down. Do not talk about cars, etc., until she talks about it, as this may get annoying.


Ask her questions to keep her talking: ""How do you like school?"" ""Have any plans for college yet?"" ""What clubs have you heard good things about?""
Tell her funny stories or jokes. Girls love guys with a playful sense of humor. Keep things light, maybe even a bit sarcastic. If she makes fun of you, don't take it personally and don't be afraid to laugh at yourself.
Be there for her. When she's off at a swim competition or she's competing in a debate, show her that you care by being there. If she's made it clear she doesn't like it, don't do this. But if she's on the fence, this might tip the scales.

, One of the biggest mistakes guys make when talking to girls is to put all the attention on her and not on themselves. Instead, girls want to know how great of a guy you are. Don't brag about yourself, but understand it's okay to tell her about the cool things you do in your life (e.g. Guitar, Snowboarding, Sports, Photography, Jobs, etc.). There needs to be an even balance between both people here.


Just because you validate a girl doesn't mean she'll validate you back. Just like how you only validate girls who are attractive, they'll only validate guys who are attractive. So show her how you are attractive with your interests, beliefs, values, and hobbies.

, A big mistake guys make is they never ask the girl out to a date or never get her number. They don't escalate. You must keep on escalating the relationships you have with girls.


Escalate physically starting with secret handshakes to tickle fights to hugs and kisses.
Escalate conversationally by getting her number and talking to her over the phone; if you're too shy to do that then ask for her Facebook.
Lots of guys never ask for a girl's phone number. The girl takes this as a sign that the guy doesn't like them. Don't fall into this scenario.

, Having a great sense of fashion and taking care of your hygiene are two of the most important factors in determining how attractive you are to the girls in your school. If you are currently wearing striped sweaters, awkward looking jeans, and tennis shoes, it's time for a change. Fix up your hair, buy some shirts that fit you, and start wearing more dapper shoes.


Stay clean. Girls are suckers for clean guys. Shower regularly, floss and brush your teeth twice daily. You need to smell nice to make an impression.
Purchase or find some low-rise, slim fit pants or jeans. If you're on the heavier side, baggier pants are probably better (but don't get lost in a sea of cloth). Skinny jeans that hug every inch of your legs are probably not the best fit, unless you're sure you can pull it off.
Purchase or find some trim collared shirts. You don't need dragons or tribal patterns on your shirts to impress girls. A simple plaid, one-tone, or striped pattern will do.
Purchase or find some soft, simple sweaters or jackets. Give girls an excuse to get close to you. V-necks are in style currently. Crew necks and hoodies also work. Go with what you think will look good on you.
Get a nice haircut. Yes, you might have to shell out more than $20 for a haircut. But it will be worth it. Look through magazines like GQ or Vanity Fair and bring a picture along of someone who has the cut you'd like.

, Girls are naturally attracted to guys who have a lot of ""social proof."" To gain social proof, you must be ""popular,"" which simply means you just need to make a lot of friends. So be more talkative and get to know the people in your school, your class, etc. Always smile and laugh. Try to have a good time with everyone. If you're not looking like you're enjoying yourself, you are a turn-off.


Get involved in what you like. High school can be tough for a lot of us because we're still figuring out what we like and what we don't. If you do have hobbies, interests, or curiosities, find other people who share that share passion. Chances are you'll get along with them.
Do favors for other people. Don't let other people walk all over you and exploit you, but help out people who seem trustworthy and appreciative. Your social stock will climb.
Do things outside of school. The guy who's connected to a social scene outside of school attracts a lot of people (guys and girls) because the school scene often lacks that edge and vibrancy.

, Girls love guys who have goals in their lives and stand up for themselves. If a girl decides to be mean to you, don't accept it. Tell her it was not a nice thing to do, and be done with her. Don't be a total jerk about it though, but rather say it in a sense of talking to your little brother or sister. It's harmless, but you want to make sure they do the right thing.

, Of course, rejection is hard: No one wants to feel like they're inadequate in any way, and being rejected makes us feel that way. But being rejected is part of life.


Don't pin all your hopes on a single girl. Pin your hopes on her after you've started a relationship, if you get that far. But it's probably a bit unhealthy to do so before then.
If you're not being rejected some of the time, you're not trying. Normal guys — guys not named Brad Pitt or George Clooney — get rejected all the time. If you're not being rejected, you're not putting yourself out there.
Keep on trying. Pull yourself up when a girl throws you down. If you sit around and mope about your problems, letting your self-esteem take a serious hit, you actually become less attractive to other girls. Try to stay happy and thick-skinned.

Change your profile picture.,
Don’t try too hard.,
Be casual.,
Learn how to flirt.",How to Make Any Girl Go Crazy over You2," If your current photo shows you flashing your best smile into the camera, delete it immediately; studies show that, though guys are most attracted to photos of smiling girls, girls are the least attracted to photos of smiling men. Instead, they prefer photos of guys who either look proud or downcast.


Studies also show that the left side of the face tends to be considered the most attractive. Take a new photo of yourself looking off and to the right with either a brooding, downward-glancing, Edward-Cullen-ey look or a cocky, up-ward looking, Jacob-Black-ey look—and watch the “likes” and “favorites” pour in.

, If your photo comes off as mopey or attention-seeking, you will be laughed at. Take many photos if necessary and choose one where you still look natural and yourself. Have a girl friend take the pictures, if you can. She'll know what girls like to see, and may be able to get the right shot.

, Send the message that you are at ease in any situation, even if you secretly want to run screaming. It's called confidence.


If you approach girls like a desperate beggar who is terrified of rejection, they will know it instinctively, and will proceed to prove you right.
Don't act like you’re too cool to care. Just be enthusiastic and calm, and if something goes wrong, laugh it off and move forward without a scratch.

, Flirting takes practice, confidence, and the ability to forget about your own nervousness; after all, how can you pick up on anyone else’s cues if you are too busy wiping the sweat off your palms or staring at your own feet? Prepare yourself by reading How to Flirt. To step up your game, learn the following:

Ask her out.,
Live up to the expectations you’ve set.",How to Make Any Girl Go Crazy over You3," If you’ve found someone you’re seriously interested in, don’t be afraid to make the first move. Most girls really appreciate it when you take the initiative to ask them out (even if they don’t say yes). On top of that, you will feel proud of yourself for having been so bold (again, even if they don’t say yes). Read How to Ask a Girl Out to give yourself every advantage.


Many are the tales of the gorgeous girl who never got asked out because everybody was so sure that she was either already busy or too beautiful for them, that they never asked.
Be persistent. If a girl you’re really interested in doesn’t say yes the first time, try again later. This doesn’t mean being clingy or acting like a stalker; it means smiling, saying, “Alright—I’ll try again next week,” and going about your own business for a while. If you normally talk to her during the week, don't stop. Just don't pressure the date request.
Give her some time to think about how cool and confident you were and the next time you ask, you might be surprised by how differently she responds.

, Okay, so you finally snagged the girl you were dreaming of. Now what do you do with her?


If you’re at the kissing stage, make sure you are ready—clean, fresh breath, all of that.
If you’re at the relationship stage, make sure you know how to be a good boyfriend.
If things get serious, make sure you know how to have a healthy relationship.
Going through the trouble of making a girl crazy about you only to let her down when things get interesting is enough to make a girl plain crazy!

Talk to your parents.,
Determine if you’re mature enough.,
Figure out how much you really like the girl.,
Make sure she’s close in age to you.",How to Know if You Are Ready to Date a Girl2," If you’re a teenager who’s never dated a girl before, it’s important to make sure that you have permission. Some parents may want their children to reach a certain age before they’re allowed to date, so it’s important to discuss the situation with them. If you really like the girl but your parents don’t think you’re old enough to date, don’t argue with them about it. Have a calm conversation with them to explain why you think you’re ready to date.It often helps to remind your parents how responsible you are. Point out all the chores you do around the house or that you’ve been doing well in all your classes and extracurricular activities, so they can trust you.
If your parents still aren’t convinced that you’re ready to date, ask them if you can go on group outings with the girl you like and some friends. You might even invite the group over for a movie night or other activity, so your parents can supervise -- and get to know the girl.

, When you’re dating someone, you often find yourself in difficult situations that require maturity to handle properly. Before you go out with a girl, you should know whether you feel comfortable talking to her about how serious you’re willing to be about the relationship and what your boundaries are when it comes to sex. You also have to be mature enough to respect her feelings and boundaries in return.Don’t start dating just because your friends are doing it. Make sure that you’re ready for all of the baggage that comes with dating and not just giving into peer pressure because everyone else has paired off.

, It may seem obvious, but you want to make sure that you’re genuinely interested in the person who you’re thinking about dating. Thinking that she’s pretty isn’t enough either. Make sure that she’s someone who you share some interests with, so you know you’ll have fun together. Pay attention to how she treats her friends, family, and teachers too -- you want to date someone who will treat you with kindness and respect, so her interactions with others can help give you an idea of what to expect.It doesn’t hurt to ask some trusted friends what they think of the girl. They’ll have your best interests at heart, so they should be honest with you.

, You want to be sure that the girl who you’re dating is someone that it’s safe for you to be with. Dating an older girl may seem exciting, but it may not be the best idea. That’s because you may feel pressured to do things that you’re not emotionally ready for. Try to date girls who are no more than one grade ahead of you in school."
"
Ensure that you’ve gotten over the anger.,
Stop keeping tabs on your ex.,
Keep an open mind.",How to Know if You Are Ready to Date a Girl3," After a breakup, it’s only natural to feel hurt and angry about how the relationship ended, particularly if your ex treated you badly. However, if you’re still feeling anger about a past relationship, you’re probably not ready to date a new girl. Your emotions are still tied up in the old relationship, and you need to work through the feelings before you can move on.If you’re still feeling anger and sadness over a breakup, it may help to talk about it. Discuss your feelings with family and friends who you trust, or see a therapist or counselor who can help you process your emotions.

, When a relationship ends, you don’t necessarily stop caring about the other person. You may still be interested in what’s going on in her life, so you might ask mutual friends or look at her Facebook, Twitter, and other social media accounts to see what she’s up to. If you’re still that invested in her, though, you probably aren’t ready to date a new girl.


In general, it’s a good idea to stop following an ex on social media. It’s often hard to get over someone when you’re constantly seeing her status updates and photos every time you log on.

, If your breakup occurred because your ex cheated on you or otherwise betrayed you, it can be very difficult to trust new people afterward because you assume everyone will be like your ex. However, it’s not healthy to enter a new relationship if you’re suspicious and cynical about the girl even if she’s given you no reason to doubt her. You shouldn’t start dating again until you feel you’re ready to trust your new partner.Being open-minded doesn’t mean that you should blindly offer your trust and ignore possible warning signs in a new girl. However, you shouldn’t judge anyone based on past hurt that you’ve experienced.

Be kind to her.,
Act considerate.,
Use your manners.,
Show compassion.",How to Impress a Girl in Middle School2," It is easy to fall into the trap of being mean to a girl you like, but in the end girls appreciate a nice, compassionate guy. Rather than tease or bother a girl you are trying to impress, flatter her with kindness. When you pass her in the hall, smile and say “Hey, Jess.” Take any opportunity to help out, like holding open a door, picking up her books, or offering her notes when she was sick.Do not be overly nice or it will come across as phony.
Also, be nice to her friends because friends often influence how someone feels about another person.

, Not only should you be considerate towards the girl you are trying to impress, but also to others around you. Once she sees how you treat others, it will shed light on your overall character. Practicing consideration for others will benefit you in all your future impressions on women.


Don't be a bully.

, Girls notice and appreciate a boy who is well mannered. For example, if she is walking behind you through a doorway make sure to hold the door open for her. Also saying please and thank you is appreciated by everyone.Make her feel special in anyway that's available to you. For example, if there is only one candy bar left and you both reach for it, offer it to her.

, Be careful and conscientious about what you say around her. Don’t say something around her that may make her feel uncomfortable. Avoid putting others down even as a joke; she may see you as judgmental and feel self-conscious around you.


You can be compassionate by showing encouragement to her and others. Positive reinforcement goes a long way in middle school and is often overlooked.Try out some positive messages in your day at school like ""Don't even worry about that math test, Shonda. I know you'll ace it!"" or ""Good luck with your soccer tryout, Bill!""

Ask her friends about her.,
Avoid talking about other girls.,
Compliment her.,
Offer her your help.,
Listen to her.,
Start an inside joke.",How to Impress a Girl in Middle School3," This is a romance tool that extends into the mature dating world. Ask about her to her friends and tell them you like her. Do not play hard to get. Let her know that you are interested in her. If she shows you any attention make sure to return the affection. Even if it sounds frivolous, try saying something like this to her friend:


""Hey do you know if Lauren has a boyfriend?""
""I want to ask Kris to the movies. You think she’d go with me?""
Use your friends to relay information as well., While making a girl jealous may seem like a way to make her notice you, in the end, you aren't getting attention in the right area. Focus on making the girl you like feel appreciated rather than jealous.

, Think about what you truly like about this girl and tell her directly. It should not be over the top. You can casually slip in a compliment within a conversation. Try compliment her on what she is wearing if it looks good.


If you notice she got a haircut, compliment her on it.
Try complimenting her if she is wearing something that looks like it took effort.Compliment her in aspects other than her appearance like: ""Woah, Sujata, you really killed it on the electric guitar"" or ""I wish I was as good as you at Math.""

, Be there for her if she needs assistance in any way, whether it is helping her carry something heavy, cleaning up a spill, or helping her with a math problem. She will notice the time you took out of your day to help her.

, Portray genuine interest when listening to what she has to say. Ask her questions about what she is telling you so that she knows that you care. Try not to talk about yourself too much and instead ask her questions. Your chemistry together will increase if you engage properly in conversation.


You can also try asking open-ended questions, or ones that require more than a yes or no response. Try something like ""So Jamie, what movie would you recommend?"" or ""How did you figure out that problem so fast?""
This will establish a closeness with her that could develop into something more., Starting an inside joke with the girl you are trying to impress is a great way to connect and get a little closer. It will become a thing you share while making her laugh at the same time. Romance shouldn’t be pure chivalry and modesty. Have a laugh every now and then.

"
"
Act natural.,
Showcase your interests.,
Be true to your friends.",How to Impress a Girl in Middle School4," Do not try to be someone that you are not in order to impress her. You want her to genuinely like you as a person and do not want to come off as phony. Don’t try to be overly funny if you don’t usually tell jokes. Also try not to be the mysterious type if you're usually a little goofy.


Everyone has the ability to flirt and everyone does it a little differently. Find your style through practice. If you find some guys are playful while they're flirting and you're more polite, don't try to imitate some else's style., Show her some of your hobbies and extracurricular activities that you participate in so she will find you interesting. Never lie about what you enjoy to do. If you’re in the math club, be real and fess up.


Don’t go to elaborate lengths to impress her either. Bring it up if it is appropriate. Nobody likes a showoff.
Attraction is all about learning to reveal and receive., It is important to have a healthy social life. If a girl sees that you have close friends, it will reinforce to her that you have likable qualities. Friends can also be a judge of the girl you like. Never go for a girl if you’re friends don’t approve.Use your friends to tell her group of friends that you like her. Never ask a friend to ask the girl out. You always need to ask her out yourself.

"
"
Introduce yourself to her.,
Make casual conversations whenever you see her.,
Make sure she has the right friends to talk to otherwise they will tell you all the weird or embarrassing things you did earlier.

,
Give her your phone number or ask for hers.,
Ask her out somewhere.,
Continue to hang out with her.",How to Get the New Girl to Like You," Since she's new, she probably doesn't know very many people. Just the simple act of introducing yourself can really make an impact on her.


Approach her confidently, greet her, and tell her your name.
Ask her how she is coming along in your school and if she needs any help adjusting.;
, She may already have friends she talks to, but that doesn't mean she couldn't use one more. If you sit by her in a class, pass her in the halls, or wherever else you may see her and and have the opportunity to talk with her, do so. Make jokes (in good taste), ask questions, and tell interesting stories. Just get a conversation going and see where it leads.

,, Be casual about it. Tell her to text you sometime. If she gives you hers, text her later in the evening (not as soon as you get home) to give her your number. Every once in a while, text her to ask what's up and get a conversation going.

, You can either do this in person or on the phone, whichever you think would be easier for you. Invite along a couple mutual friends, or several of yours and ask her to invite several of hers, to make it less awkward. Make sure she knows if it is a date or not.

, Slowly, your friendship will continue to build. It could end up as a romantic relationship, or just really good friends.

Pack a picnic.,
Visit a farmers market, flea market, or a U-Pick.,
Go on an adventure.,
Take advantage of city living.",How to Have Fun with Your Girlfriend1," Picnics are romantic, scenic, and a great change of pace. They can be simple—try sharing sandwiches on a park bench during her lunch break. They can also be elaborate. Pack a proper basket with a large, sturdy blanket you can both lie down on. Bring a full meal as well as water and white wine. Drive somewhere with running water, and chill the wine in the water while you set up your picnic.


Pack food you can eat with your hands and share.
Great picnic foods include: pan-bagnat, a fresh baguette with ham and butter or fancy cheese, hummus and carrots, grapes, peaches, and chocolate.;
, Shopping is boring, but hunting and gathering is fun. Stock up on flowers, produce, and artisanal delicacies at your local farmer's market. If your town doesn't have one, find one nearby and drive or take a bus. Farmer's markets are a great way to start a day together: go for breakfast, buy coffee, fruit, and pastry, and sit outside to enjoy the hustle bustle.


Find silly junk for one another at a flea market or a yard sale. You might find useful things, but the goal should be to enjoy the scenery.
During harvest seasons, visit a U-Pick. Spend the day wandering the orchard or fields together, and pick only what you actually want.

, If you have the time, the money, and the guts, do something unusual from your shared bucket lists. Go bungee jumping, sky-diving, or snorkeling. Climb the nearest highest peak, or rent equipment and learn how to surf, ride dirt bikes, or skateboard.

, If you live in or near a city, take advantage of the cultural offerings. Check out famous monuments you've never visited, or haven't visited since you were a child. Visit the zoo and the local museums. See if your city has a “First Friday” and end the week by walking around looking at art. Cap it off with glass of wine or a nice dinner."
"
Play games.,
Cook together.,
Indulge in nostalgia.,
Share a project.",How to Have Fun with Your Girlfriend2," Playing games together can be a relaxing way to hang out while keeping things moving. Play cards, board games, or games that don't require any supplies. Go for board games you both enjoy, or try out a new one neither of you knows. Figuring out the rules of a new game together is part of the fun.


If you're playing a competitive game, come up with flirty penalties and prizes. The winner should win something thrilling.
Freak each other out with occult practices. Play with a Ouija board, or look up an ancient spell and try to cast it.Play getting-to-know-you games. Even if you've been dating forever, there is always more to learn about a partner. Try two truths and a lie—you each take a turn saying two true things and one made-up thing, then try to guess one another's lie.
Answer questions and fall in love again. Take turns answering questions designed by psychologist Arthur Aron to get you both to open up.Put a spell on her. Take turns tracing short messages on each other's skin. Try to guess what is being spelled.Play interactive video games, like Guitar Hero, Just Dance, and Wii Resort., If you don't already cook together, figuring out how to do so can be fun and rewarding. If you cook together all the time, take a novel approach to it. Make up a new recipe collaboratively based on random ingredients you have at home, or challenge one another to make something delicious based on ingredients the other partner picks out. Have a competition for who can make the best meal with the ingredients on hand, and blindfold each other for the taste test (even though you'll recognize your own dish, it'll be cute).Try to recreate dishes you enjoyed together at a restaurant.
If you bicker when you try to cook together, plan an elaborate meal collaboratively but split up the cooking. One of you can make the main and a salad, while the other can provide dessert, drinks, and a side.

, Hunt down your favorite childhood cartoons online. Try to remember the weirdest favorites you had. Take turns picking a favorite cartoon to watch. You can be nostalgic while you have fun.


Expand this. Listen to music you thought was awesome when you were 7. Watch a music video that scandalized you when you were 9.
Eat a childhood favorite food that you don't eat anymore while you watch.
Try to figure out what overlap you had as kids. If you have an age difference, grew up in different places or in very different households, it may take some hunting before you find a commonality. The challenge will make it fun.

, If you live together, think of something you'd both like to change about your home. Maybe it needs a fresh coat of paint, or some new shelves. Maybe your photos need framing, or maybe you've been meaning to start a garden or plant a window box. Chores that might be boring when done separately can be fun together. Put on music you both like and beautify your life.


If you live separately, you can still enjoy helping one another improve areas you both share.
Sharing a cooking project that you can split up can be fun. Try canning fruits from your u-pick and splitting up the results. Pickle a bunch of pickles and can those.
Learn how to brew beer together, and name your beer something silly. Go through the whole process together, even if it can only be stashed at one of your house's. Design labels and print them. When it's ready, do your first tasting together as a date, and your second as a small party with your best mutual friends.

Plan a scavenger hunt for your girlfriend.,
Throw her a surprise party.,
Design the perfect day.",How to Have Fun with Your Girlfriend3," Place clues around town that lead the way to a final surprise or date. She will be appreciative of the effort and thoughtfulness of the game.


Scavenger hunt together by entering the world of geocaching. You follow coordinates to find hidden treasure in cities, parks or forests.
Personalize the clues and make them fun for her.
To make it into a surprise, tell her to meet you in a public café to ""help you shop."" Instead of being there, give an employee a photo of her and a tip, and have them hand her a note with instructions for finding the next clue.
Make sure you have your phone in case she doesn’t get the first clue or doesn't want to do the hunt alone.
The final surprise can be something like tickets to see her favorite musician, or a gorgeous meal you've already prepared and laid out for her.

, It may not be her birthday, but planning an impromptu party for her might make her day. Surprises are more fun than planned activities, if they're timed right. Invite over a bunch of people she loves, buy food and drinks, and give everyone balloons to release and streamers to throw when she comes in so that the house is instantly ""decorated.""


To ensure the surprise is welcome, ask her to do you a favor and attend an evening with your coworkers at your house. Tell her how much they want to meet her, and that you'll make it up to her later. That way, she'll come on time and be overjoyed that her boring obligation has turned into an elaborate present.
Make sure the party is personalized to her tastes. Ask her friends to bring music or games that she enjoys.
Have the guests dress in a style she enjoys or in honor of her favorite book or tv show. When she's been surprised, hand her a costume or accessory she can wear. She'll feel like a queen.
Ask her best friend for costume/style advice if you feel like you can't be quite that smooth.

, Treats don't have to be a surprise. If your girlfriend has been overworked, stressed, or down on life, promise her a day where she doesn't have to lift a finger. Plan every detail, morning to night. Make sure some of the activities are freeform, some are organized, and that there is plenty of time to relax as well as enjoy.


If she's someone who likes being involved in plans, plan a perfect day together. Even planning is fun when you do it with someone you love.

Keep showing interest in what she has to say.,
Treat her family with respect.",How to Get a Girlfriend While You're a Kid," As a kid, it's important that you're trying to get a girlfriend for the right reasons. Trying to get a girlfriend just to look cool in front of you friends isn't fair to yourself, and it's certainly not fair to her. If there's a girl you have your eye on, make sure you want to be with her because you like her for who she really is. In the end, nothing else should matter as much.;
, As a general rule, girls mature faster than boys, and things tend to stay that way until the end of being a teenager. With that in mind, throwing spitballs and acting like a clown isn't going to impress girls very much. You're going to have to act like a grown-up to prove to any girl that you're worth taking seriously as a boyfriend.


You can still goof off with your friends, but try to make a point of acting grown-up in most other areas in life. This includes getting good grades and being punctual for school.
If you're having trouble figuring out how to act like an adult, pick a couple of male role models in your life and try to take after them. They could be a father, uncle, teacher, anyone, so long as they're responsible and show a lot of maturity.

, Once you think you've got the maturity down pat, make your existence known to her. While you might be wondering how you should go about it, usually the simplest approach is the best one. Here's a few examples:


Go up and say ""Hi!"" casually. this is the simplest thing you can do, and it's usually the best. Most girls are bound to feel pretty flattered by the fact you're giving them the attention.
Ask an ice-breaking question. Asking a casual question is a good way to start conversation with someone. Even something like asking for a pencil in the middle of class, and asking the time can be a good way to break the ice.
Following up your introduction with a quick compliment is good, because it immediately shows you're interested in her. It might sound like a brave thing to do, but no one's ever going to reject a compliment in their right mind!

, Once you're on speaking terms with the girl, you should find opportunities to get to know her better. This can be very easy if you go to the same school as her. If you're in the same classes, make a point of sitting next to her-- that way, you two can collaborate on class projects. Sitting down together at lunch is good too, as it's a casual way to get to know each other.

, While you're getting to know her, make sure to ask lots of questions about things, whether it's her opinions, her goals or a bit about her life. All of these things will help you understand who she is. In turn, telling her about yourself will give her a better idea of what a unique and amazing person you are.


Be patient with this process. You shouldn't be going into this purely to get a girlfriend. Instead, you should be focusing in on getting to know her. Enjoy spending time with her! She'll be able to sense if you're just talking to her because you want a girlfriend.
In this time, you may well find that you're not as interested in her anymore as you thought you were. If this happens, don't try to force it to go any further; some girls you meet are going to be best kept as just friends.

, Girls place a lot of importance on what their friends think. If you want her to be your girlfriend, it goes a long way to have her friends like you. If you're not part of the same social circles, find an opportunity to spend time with them. That could mean asking to go with them to the mall, or even just sitting with their group at lunch if you go to the same school.


While you want to get to know her friends, make sure not to pay more attention to them than her. This is especially important if her friends are girls. If you give them too much attention, she might get the wrong impression you've got a crush on one of them!

, This is a pretty crucial moment. Most of the time, if asking out a girl goes wrong, it's because it was rushed, or happened too soon. By the time you tell the girl how you feel, it should already be obvious to the two of you that you like each other. With that in mind, you shouldn't try asking unless you already have a pretty good idea she'll say yes.


Keep in mind that someone saying they like you would put you on the spot, too. Even if she does like you, she might get scared or feel awkward with that. Don't be too alarmed if she says something like that; keep hanging out with her and being her friend. If she sees that sincerity in you, she'll probably become a lot more comfortable and say yes in time.
Of course, there are other situations where it will be plainly obvious she isn't interested. This isn't always to do with you; there are lots of reasons a girl might not want to date someone. If that happens, you should shrug it off, think about your best qualities, and keep your eyes peeled for a new girl to connect with.

, The most important thing in a new relationship is to prove that the way you were acting before wasn't just an act. You have to be just as mature and respectful. While some of the stress should be gone now that you both know you have feelings for each other, it's not time to start slacking off. Be courteous and patient with her. Never try to get her to do something she isn't comfortable with; it's much better to take it slow and easy. If you show the same maturity throughout, her feelings for you will grow.

, Now that she's your girlfriend, it will probably come time to have deeper, more intimate conversations. You should be even more interested in what she has to say, now that she's become a significant part of your life. If she's earned your trust, you shouldn't be afraid to tell her secrets. A crucial part of a good relationship is the mutual emotional support, and that can't happen if you're just trying to look cool in front of her.

, When it comes time to meet her family, make sure you are giving them the same respect you would give her. A girlfriend's family is bound to be very judgemental of a new boyfriend at first, so it's important you prove them wrong. Look them in the eye, smile lots, and let them know they don't have to worry that she'll be spending a lot of time with you.


Don't be afraid to introduce her to your family as well! Even if it's coming over for dinner, showing her a different side of your life is important.

Don't be a jerk!,
Don’t avoid her.,
Ask her out!",How to Get an Emo Girlfriend," If you yourself aren’t already emo, you probably don’t want to change overnight, nor is that recommended, since it’s not genuine, even “poser”-like behavior. That said, look for particular emo articles of clothing, accessories, or styles that you do like. Incorporating those into your style might make you more appealing to an emo girl and give her something to ask you about.


If you're really not emo and you don't like the style or take to it easily, you don't have to be emo. Sure, emo girls like dark emo guys but if they like you, they'll date you no matter what style you happen to fall into. It's just easier if you are emo in that it gives you some common style interests.;
, Emo girls tend to be more interested in an emo guy, as long as the style is genuine and works for him specifically. Look for darker clothing in black, gray, or silver. Small amounts of silver jewelry might also complement the look.Some guys even paint all or some of their nails black.

, Emo hairstyles are varied, but the color tends to be jet black. Brighter emo colors might be blue, maroon, or even pink.Emo hairstyles could be spikey, or you might have bangs coming down over your forehead, for example. You might also buzz shave the sides or back of your scalp. In general, emo hairstyles tend to be asymmetrical, including varied lengths and sometimes inconsistent scissor cuts., Emo does not mean dirty, and emo girls like most other people, prefer their friends and partners to be clean. So remember the basics: take regular showers, wear deodorant, and wash your hands frequently. Don’t overdo it with cologne or deodorant; just aim to smell pleasant.

, This could be fun, especially if you already like emo music or bands that are considered emo. Emo girls are typically into rock bands but possibly other genres and subgenres as well.


Do research, including research into local bands. She will most likely bring up bands, asking you if you have heard of them. You will seem much more interesting if you know about certain bands that she knows, and you can have comfortable conversations.
If you don't know a band that she brings up, don't lie. Admit that you’re not familiar with the group, and ask her to explain. It’s not the end of the world, and she’ll probably appreciate that you’ve taken an interest in her music.

, Poetry appreciation can be an acquired taste, but knowing some of the basics can help you better understand emo girls. You can, of course, write emo poetry yourself, but if you’re not the literary type, you might want to read and learn about emo poetry and poets, since emo girls are often interested in poetry.


Emo poetry often includes subjects like darkness or blackness, loneliness, isolation, broken heartedness, un-holiness, murder, and death generally. Emo writers might include Edgar Alan Poe, Bram Stoker, or H.P. Lovecraft, although these might also be considered gothic or horror writers.

, Artistic subjects that interest emos are similar to the literary subjects that they like. Graphic art might also include comic or graphic novel images. Some art is more colorful than just the grays and blacks in emo clothing.Even if you’re not interested in art that is emo per se, being able to discuss art that you are interested in might be a good conversation topic with an emo girl.

, Goth and punk girls are different and wear different types of clothing. For example, punks might have mohawks, and goths might wear skirts, but emos do not do either.These differences are fine, but show that socially you’re dealing with a different type of girl whose interests might not be the same. Therefore, your approach would need to be different too.

, You don’t have to wear your heart on your sleeve to be emo, but emos, as the name itself says, tend to be closely connected to their emotional side, if not more emotionally expressive. Take note of the emotions that your emo crush might be having. If you feel comfortable, you might even ask her how she’s feeling in an open-ended way that doesn’t assume you already know.

, These shouldn’t be sappy, obvious comments, but something pertaining to her emo style. Emo girls tend to be obsessed with their look, especially their hair. If they change their hair for a day, bring it up and say that you like it. It will make them feel good about themselves, and they will feel much more comfortable with you, knowing that you respect—and like—their style.

, Emo girls love romantic guys. What kinds of guys do you think are in the novels and poems they read and write? This might also inspire some gift ideas. Good gift ideas once you're dating could be black or red roses and handwritten love poems with quotes from their favorite songs.

, Don't start crying for no reason, but if you hide your emotions and don't talk about how you feel, you might alienate an emo girl. You don’t have to be sappy when doing this. For example, you can talk about daily frustrations, family or friend conflicts, issues at work or school, hopes and dreams, or any of your musical or artistic interests.

, It also doesn’t have to be a major secret, but sharing something secretive or private will show that you are interested in her. It will also show that you’re in touch with your emotional side since you’re opening up to her.

, Just because you’re looking for an emo girlfriend doesn’t mean you’re looking for any emo girlfriend. You probably already have a girl in mind, but make sure she’s the type of person you’d want to date and be friends with regardless of her emo style.

, Emos don’t like jerks, particularly if jerks remind them of jocks or guys that use women. Emo girls would rather date a shy and modest quiet guy than a loud and obnoxious guy who everyone thinks is so cool.

, Sometimes if you like a girl, you feel shy towards her. It's okay to feel shy, but don't avoid an interest, as you might miss out on an opportunity. Emo girls might seem more aloof, but they won’t appreciate feeling avoided or rejected.

, Don’t make a big deal about it. After you’ve made some sort of positive connection with your emo interest, ask her out. Try to do something that she’s interested in or something that you’ve already discussed. Take things slow and let your relationship grow. Respect her interests and emotions in the process and you’ll be on your way to a relationship.

Wear tidy clothes.,
Take care of your hygiene.,
Choose a deodorant.,
Get a haircut.",How to Get an 11 Year Old Girl to Like You1," Not many girls, at any age, want to date a dirty boy. It’s good to get into the practice of taking care of yourself at an early age. Don’t wear clothes that you recently wore and make sure nothing looks dirty. Wear the “nice” clothes that are in your wardrobe when you know you will see this girl.


Have your parents or guardians buy you t-shirts with a collar and pants that aren’t denim.;
, You should clip your nails, wash your hair, and brush your teeth on a daily basis. Never leave the house without doing these things. One thing that girls dislike especially is bad breath.

, It is popular to spray too much Axe body spray when you’re eleven, but resist this temptation. Instead, go to the hygiene section of a local convenience store and find the fragrance that best suits you. Pick out something that contains musk in the smell. Musk is a popular smell for boys and it'll show off your maturity.If you use a spay on deodorant, only spray underneath each arm once. Do not hold down the nozzle until you've covered your entire body.
A stick or dry deodorant is more subtle and less obnoxious.

, It is unpopular for eleven year old boys to enjoy getting their hair cut, but having the right cut will help you out. Look through magazines and look at celebrity haircuts. Pick out a few that stand out to you. Ask your mom or sister’s opinion on what type of hairstyle you should get.


Getting a second opinion can help your chances of picking out the best haircut that will suit your attributes.

Listen to her.,
Be her friend first.,
Try to impress her.,
Try breaking the touch barrier.,
Smile a lot.,
Ask for help.,
Don't seem desperate.",How to Get a Teenage Girl to Like You," You should always be the one to take the time to pay attention to what a girl is saying. It is never good if a man constantly interrupts a girl while talking. Wait until she is done speaking, and then ask a question related to what she said.;
, You don't have to hit on her right away, first try talking to her and getting to know her, if you haven't already, and be nice to her.

, Try to get her to go to places where you do things that may impress her. For example, if you skateboard fairly well, you could try saying something like, ""Hey, have you ever gone skateboarding before? It's really fun. Maybe you could come and watch me sometime."" Don't go overboard with this step though because then you will probably come across as a bragger and a showoff. What girl wants a guy who tries to outdo everyone and talks about nothing but his own achievements?

, Sometimes girls will make the first move and do it, but manning up and doing it yourself can often be better especially if the girl you like is shy. Don't be scared to do this yourself. Try offering to help her put her coat on, hold out your hand to her when she is walking on uneven ground to help her keep her balance, or, if you are really close friends and this wouldn't seem awkward to her, then hug her in a friendly manner either to congratulate her on an achievement of hers or you can even use it as a greeting.

, Don't smile too much,(or you'll creep her out), but flashing her those pearly whites towards her once in a while will make her feel special.

, Showing a weak side might go against everything you've ever considered ""sexy,"" but it will make the girl feel important if she can help you with something. Go up to her and ask for her help on a homework assignment. Not only will she likely help you, but you'll be able to get emotionally and physically closer to her.

, Always asking her out or obsessing will be a turn off.

Go right up and talk to her, let her know that you're interested. She might be guarded at first, but she'll mostly likely be impressed by your directness.Don't be too forceful or demanding. This could give her the wrong idea about your intentions.;
, You don't have to be a ""bad boy"" to display confidence in yourself. Stay relaxed and comfortable in any situation. Be assertive; use a firm, clear voice, and speak your mind. She's probably used to being the most confident person in the room. Stand out and show her that you're just as sure of yourself.Assertiveness is the key, not aggression. Come on too strong and you risk looking like a jerk.
Let your personality speak for itself. There's no need to brag, but don't downplay yourself or be unnecessarily modest. Take pride in yourself and own it.
Loosen up. It's more impressive to people if you can handle mistakes and awkward moments gracefully.

, If she values her individuality, she'll also be able to recognize yours. Don't mindlessly follow trends or conform to what others are doing hoping it will get you noticed. Instead, be up front about your interests and beliefs and make it clear that you're someone worth knowing.

, Find things that the two of you have in common, no matter how small. You don't have to dress the same or have the same favorite band, but the more she can relate to you, the more comfortable she'll be around you.Finding things you have in common can be as broad and impassioned as political beliefs or as casual as your favorite breakfast cereal. Take this opportunity to get to know more about her, and as you do, you'll find that you have more things you connect with.

, While it's great to be direct, assertive and up front, leave a little for her to wonder about. She'll want to know more about you if you keep her guessing, and you'll come off as a more complex person. This could be the lead-in you need for your next conversation or date.Hold a little back in conversation. Don't be too eager or talk about yourself too much. Let her imagination do some work in figuring you out.
Don't complain. Quiet dignity is an undeniable trait in anyone.

, There's no need to lay it on too thick. She'll know if you're boasting or trying to seem more appealing to her, and talking yourself up too much can be annoying.


Confidence and assertiveness are qualities that anyone can develop, not stand-ins for your innate personality. If you get too wrapped up in trying to impress her, you'll lose sight of yourself.
Trust her enough to let her make up her own mind about what she wants.

, Make it your mission to discover what sets her apart from the rest and understand her motivations. You can accomplish this by talking to her, and you should, but also pay attention to unspoken cues like body language and the way she interacts with others.She may hold on to a tough or uninviting persona due to the way she's been treated by others in the past. Approach her with no judgment, and don't make her feel cornered when getting to know her.
Everyone is different. Be careful making assumptions about her character or trying to analyze her based on the way she looks or the things other people say about her.

, Even if you're not that keen on the books she reads or her favorite place to eat, make an effort to know what they are. Get involved in the things that are important to her. If you like her, you should be accepting of her interests, as they're part of what makes her who she is.


Listen actively when she talks about her interests, and be enthusiastic when talking about yours.
Ask her for recommendations for new things to try, watch, read and listen to.
Go where you know she might be. Don't be creepy about it, but listen for cues about things she likes and look into them for yourself. If you know she's into roller derby, go watch a match. If you happen to run into her, tell her you were intrigued by what the two of you talked about and wanted to learn more.

, Talk to her friends to find out more about her, and let them see the kind of person you are. A person's friends can say a lot about them, and they're also the people that she's closest to. Winning the favor of her friends can go a long way toward getting her to like you.You may also make new friends of your own this way. If you like her and she likes them, there is probably be something about them you would like as well.
Friends are not instruments for getting her in your corner. They can provide insight into what she's like and provide a buffer for hangouts, but you should never manipulate her friends just to make yourself look better.

, Take every opportunity you can to spend time with her. If you're going out or know of an upcoming event, invite her along. Doing things together allows you have shared experiences, which will bring you closer. It's usually flattering to girls just to know that you want them around. She'll appreciate the effort.Now you can both start to enjoy your common interests together. Rather than just following her recommendations, ask if she'd mind having you along to a show or event, or invite her to take part in something you can do together.
If you have mutual friends, organize a group outing. A casual setting and the comfort of having your friends around is the best environment for cultivating a new friendship.

, There's a chance that a girl with her image and social history may be less open to making new friends. She could be hesitant to open up to you, or try to keep you from getting too close too soon. Don't be put off. Letting her know you like her and want the two of you to get to know each other is about being up front and, most importantly, being persistent.Don't be easily discouraged. No friendship falls into place right away. It may just be a matter of seeing her a few times and becoming more comfortable in one another's presence.
Know when to back off. Though persistence is important, it shouldn't keep you blindly pursuing her if she's just not interested. Try to develop a sense of when enough is enough. If she feels like she's being harassed, it may make her even more closed off.

, No matter what your intentions are in getting to know her, the strongest foundation is friendship. The two of you will most likely start off as friends, and you may even find that this is more meaningful to you than dating her would be. Don't try to force her into anything or expect things to move too fast. It's up to her whether she wants the relationship to progress; in the meantime, let your friendship be its own reward.


Others may be reluctant to become friends with her based on the way she looks or acts outwardly. Try to see past the ""tough girl"" label and get at the essence of the person inside. We're not all that different at the end of the day.

, Become a reliable figure in her life. Always be ready with a helping hand and prove to her that you can be trusted. She can be the most capable person in the world, but it will still mean something to her to know that you care.Make yourself available when she needs you.
Be someone that she can talk to. That means being honest and straightforward with her, withholding judgment and making her feel at ease.

, No matter how tough or independent she is, no one minds receiving a compliment. Pay attention to more than just her physical features. Single out the best parts of her character and give them the praise they deserve.Sometimes she might just need to hear that someone else likes the same things about her that she likes about herself. Encourage her individuality, don't make her feel self-conscious about it. Attempts to change her subtly by saying things like ""you shouldn't be such a loner"" or ""see, you look good when you get dressed up"" will only be met with resentment.
Lavishing her with too much praise can become tiresome. Say something nice about her when it's warranted; otherwise, it's best not to be too heavy-handed with affection.
Make her feel appreciated. This is a much more significant thing than just telling her she's pretty or complimenting her hairstyle. True appreciation stems from recognition of someone's positive qualities and successes, and these are the things you want to celebrate with her.

Notice her at school.,
Ask about her.Ask one of her friends what she enjoys doing.,
Be confident.,
Be considerate.",How to Get an 11 Year Old Girl to Like You2," Once you decide that you “like” someone, go for it. Observer her without staring or being too creepy. Take mental notes of things she says in the classroom. See who her group of friends are. Notice if she hangs out with a boy already.Do not begin to stalk this girl, or else you may get a bad reputation.

, A good way to get her to take notice of you, is to begin asking questions about her. Her friend will definitely tell the girl that you are asking about her. Regardless of how she feels about you, this will flatter her. You could potentially ask something like:


”What does Samantha like to do on the weekends?”
”Do you know if Jasmine has a favorite book?”
”Does Jamie have a boyfriend?”

, You need to put yourself out there and that involves being vulnerable to being made fun of. You can combat feeling embarrassed by having a positive outlook on your actions. If you are asking about a girl you like, then you’re acting normal.


People who tease you for this are insecure that they don’t have the courage to talk to the ones they like., Never talk down about the girl you like when confronted about your feelings. Stand up for her and yourself. It is easy for some to try to back out of liking someone when they are in the spotlight. Say nice things about her and she’ll appreciate your respect.Remember the point is for the girl to like you and not for a group of kids to like you.

Avoid trying to act older.,
Have a hobby that you enjoy.,
Keep your friends close.",How to Get an 11 Year Old Girl to Like You3," You need to embrace the age that you are at. If you are eleven, you have a couple more years until you are really in the depths of puberty.There is no need to feel self-conscious that you don’t have leg hair, or that your voice hasn’t dropped. All this will come in time. Honesty is the best way to earn somebody’s respect.

, If you learn that she is only interested in horseback riding, you should not drop all your passions to afford a saddle. Let her determine if your interests are compatible. If you are trying out different activities and unsure what you wish to pursue, keep trying things out. It helps later in life if you begin practicing a hobby young in life like piano, dance, soccer, drawing, or even film making.


Just take a chance if you want to do something.

, As you begin to enter into your adolescent years, friend groups become more important as family life decreases.Try to avoid fighting with your family during this transitional period. Don’t ditch your friends because you don’t think they’re cool anymore. Stay true to who you are and keep your friends in on who you have a crush on.


If they are good friends, they’ll help you figure out ways to get this girl to start to notice you.
If you are in the wrong friend circle, they could ridicule you for your crush and start nasty rumors. Leave hazardous friend circles for the friends that respect and enjoy your company.

Tell her your feelings.,
Be yourself.",How to Get an 11 Year Old Girl to Like You4," Next time you see her, start talking to her. Don't go right out and say ""I like you."" That isn’t always the best technique, but being direct is a positive trait. Talk to her about a casual topic like school, sports, or teachers. Try to get to know her better. Find out general information about her, but don't get too personal. Become her friend.


If you’re unsure about what to say, just say “Hey Kristen,” when you pass her in the hall. It might not seem like a lot, but it is sure to catch her attention.
Don't be scared to talk to her.

, Find a mutual interest and talk to her about it. Say you both enjoy drawing, ask to see one of her drawings, and tell her if you like it. If you both enjoy fantasy movies, strike up a conversation about a specific movie. One of the keys of bonding over a mutual interest is to bring up something specific.This will require you both to engage in conversation stronger than normal chit-chat.

, A good way of getting romantic thoughts into her head is to compliment her every once in awhile. You can compliment her outfit when you think it looks nice, but don't feel restricted in complimenting her appearance.You could say things like this:


”Angie, your dress is really pretty.”
”Good job on that math problem! I was totally stumped.”
”Your outfit compliments your eyes.”

, A great way to develop a closer bond with the girl you like is to make her laugh. Use your natural humor on her and don’t memorize other peoples' jokes. Even if you’re unsure or nervous, just be a little silly in front of her. Start an inside joke between the two of you. Inside jokes are a great way to bring people together., After you’ve talked a few times and you're friends, ask her if she likes you. She probably will blush. If she does, then it may mean she likes you back. If she doesn't, the odds aren't so great. Don't ask her too early in a friendship or it will seem like you are pushing it.


If she does blush or express interest, ask her out. Make sure you two are alone. Also, try to keep it low key or else it might spread throughout the whole school.
If she doesn't blush, you have to be okay with being friends for the moment. She might ask why you asked that, and don't try to play it off with, ""nothing."" Be upfront and honest with her.

, Regardless of how confronting her went, you need to keep yourself in check. Whatever you do, don't try to make yourself popular. Be yourself, not the person you think she wants you to be.


If she tries to change you, back down. Girls that try to change you are not right for you because they don't like who you are.
Be talented but don't show off. For instance, write a song or short story (not directly about her) and show it to your friends. When people praise your skills, it might get her interested.
The key is be yourself."

Ask your friends for any information, such as whether they’re available, what their interests are, their age, and so on. It’s always best to have at least a little bit of information about your crush before approaching them.


Having some background information will be helpful as you’ll then have some conversation starters as well as an idea of whether or not you two would be compatible in a relationship.;
, Don’t be nervous and instead just aim to be direct and friendly.Let them know who you are and start a simple conversation with them. After all, the relationship will never happen unless you actually talk to them!


If you two have anything in common (such as being in the same class or seeing each other at the same coffee shop frequently) start by talking about that. That way, you’ll have more of a reason to approach them and you’ll already have a topic that you can fall back on for conversation. Try saying something like, “Hey have I seen you at _____ before? You look familiar.”
You can avoid awkwardness by coming up to them and giving a friendly smile and handshake. Don’t immediately ask them a lot of questions. Instead just give them a little compliment or make small talk. Saying something as simple as, “Hey, I really like your shoes, where did you get them?” could potentially spark a longer conversation.
If you two have any friends in common, ask the friend to introduce you. That will make the introduction more natural and the friend could work as a mediator for you two to get to know each other.

, Though your crush may physically fit the description of a nerd or have a reputation as one, don’t make any assumptions about who they are or what they are like. After all, you want to get to know your crush as a real person, not as a stereotype.


For example, instead of assuming they like video games or programming, simply ask them what their hobbies are. Be sure to ask follow up questions and show an interest in what they are telling you.

, Nerds are known for being more socially anxious so a great way to get to know your crush without a lot of pressure is by starting off as friends.Rather than openly flirting or asking them out on the spot, get to know them through casual conversation.


For example, skip the candlelit dinner date and ask them if they want to go to a cultural event, walk in the park, or any other activity that isn’t strictly all about romance. After all, at this stage you want to get to know them and for them to get comfortable being around you.

, Nerds are generally people who are considered outside of the mainstream so don’t be afraid to share any unusual traits about you that others may not know about. Even if they don’t share your interest, they’ll likely be intrigued that there’s something “different” about you.If you have any personal projects, such as drawing manga or gourmet cooking, share these interests with them!
Perhaps you collect Pokemon cards, have a secret spot where you go to reflect, or have an unusual superstition (such as believing in aliens). Don’t be afraid to let your crush know about your quirks as they’ll get to know you better and being vulnerable can help develop a closer relationship., Many nerds struggle with face to face interaction, which is why so many of them are drawn to the Internet and virtual forms of communication.For example, every so often you can send your crush a funny video or a greeting on Facebook or Gchat. Just be sure to not do this too frequently, especially if they don’t readily respond.

, Being a good conversationalist is an art and one that nerds are known for struggling with. Therefore, if you want to get closer to your crush, it’s likely that it’ll be up to you to carry on the conversation.


Instead of just waiting for your turn to talk, truly listen to what your crush is telling you. Ask follow up questions and add in little comments or even nonverbal cues (such as nodding your head) to let them know you are really interested.Avoid making them feel like they’re being interrogated by offering information about yourself throughout. Do your best to carry on a conversation naturally, rather than posing one unrelated questions after another.
If you find anything in common, try to go deeper into that topic. For example, if you discover you share similar views on politics, continue talking about it and sharing your opinions. After a while, the conversation should start to naturally flow as you two get to know each other better.

, Your crush is never going to know how you feel if you don't put out some signals. You should be calm and confident and not too aggressive.Flirting can be as simple as giving them a slightly longer hug when greeting them, touching their shoulder, laughing a lot at their jokes, and paying them compliments.Try to strike the right balance between being forthright without making them nervous. If they start to seem uncomfortable with all of the attention, back off a little bit and just focus on having a pleasant conversation.

, What many nerds lack in social grace, they make up for in intelligence. Whether it’s a knack for mathematics or an encyclopedic knowledge of Japanese anime, let them know that you’re impressed by it!


Making other people feel validated is crucial in any relationship and some nerds may have grown up being mocked for their skills or interests so be sure to distinguish yourself by doing the exact opposite., Note this is different from faking interest. If you are truly bored when they go off about their area of expertise, it may be time to rethink whether you really want to get this person to like you. However, if you really do get interested in what they are really into, not only will they be delighted to have an audience, but it’s is also a good sign that you two would actually be good together.For example, if your crush tells you what their favorite books or movies are, read or watch some of them. That way, the next time you see them, you’ll have something to talk about and it’s also a great way to let your crush know you are interested in them.

, Nerds appreciate intelligence so take some opportunities to demonstrate that you also have in-depth knowledge on a particular subject or have a special skill of your own.For example, if you two are making small talk about the weather, you can throw in an interesting fact such as, “did you know that those stringy, fluffy clouds are called Cirrus clouds, and mean that it’s going to rain in the next 36 hours?”
Another option is to occasionally rant about some of your passions. For example, if you love to read, tell your crush about the book you’ve been reading lately and your impressions of it. Your crush will likely appreciate that you have an intellectual side so that you two will have a lot to talk about and teach each other.
Don’t be afraid to occasionally challenge your crush to a debate. Nerds love intellectually stimulating conversation so letting them know that you’re up for long discussions may make them more interested in talking to you.

, Don’t get dressed up in formal wear every time there’s a chance you might run into your crush, but do put in a bit of effort. Not only is it always nice to be presentable but wearing clothing that is clean and flattering will draw your crush’s attention to your physical attributes and perhaps encourage them to see you as more than just a friend.With that being said, a nerd is less likely to be concerned with fashion. So, whether you’re a boy or girl, just focus on wearing clothes that are clean and look nice but aren’t necessarily the cutting edge of fashion.
If you are a girl, don’t suddenly begin wearing more makeup whenever you see your crush. Putting on a bit of gloss or eyeliner that draws attention to your best features is fine but your crush may be a bit confused by any drastic style changes.

, If you are getting any signs that your crush likes you back, it may be time to make a move and let them know that you are interested in them romantically.


Watch their body language. Men and women show they are interested in different ways. Nerds of both genders may be more likely to be flustered or nervous rather than being the type to respond smoothly to little shows of affection or compliments.
If your crush is a guy, here are some signs that they are interested in you: going out of their way to do nice things for you, getting flustered or reddening when you compliment them, paying attention to you on social media (such as liking all of your Facebook profile pictures), and finding ways to get physically closer to you.If your crush is a girl, the signs may be different and can include the following: leaning towards you when you speak, playing with their hair or clothes, and periodically flicking their eyes away before looking back into yours., If you two have already established a friendship, it may be time to just let them know that you have romantic feelings for them and would like to know if they feel the same way. If you two are still at the acquaintance stage but you are getting possible signals that they are interested in you, ask them out on a date and make your feelings clear.


If you two are already friends, let them know how you feel in a private, comfortable setting. You can begin the conversation by saying, “Hey, I just want to let you know it’s been great hanging out and I like you in a way that’s more than just friends.” If they respond positively, you can follow up by asking them to dinner or even come up with a more creative date idea that you think they would like (such as a comic book expo if they read comic books). If they don’t respond or tell you they don’t feel the same way, don’t take it personally and tell them you’d be glad to remain just friends.
If you are at the acquaintance stage, ask them if they have a moment to talk and casually ask them on a date. You can say, “I just want to let you know you seem like an interesting person and I’d like to get to know you better. Would you like to get coffee or have dinner sometime?” If they say no or don’t respond, you can be kind about it by saying, “It’s no problem, I just thought I would ask. Have a great day!”
If you are the romantic type and aren’t afraid to show your feelings, try asking them out in a creative way. For example, you could give them a little present, such as a book that you think they would like, with a handwritten note saying you would love to talk about the book over a meal and some wine. Asking them out this way may relieve some of the pressure as they don’t have to immediately respond and they’ll also realize that you care enough to know what their interests are.

, Your crush may say yes to a date but it’s always possible that you’ll be rejected in spite of your efforts. Perhaps your crush isn’t interested in you or just doesn’t want a relationship at the moment. If that’s the case, don’t get angry or break off the friendship. Instead, appreciate the friendship and be kind even if you’ve been rejected.


If you don’t know your crush that well and they say no, you can make things less awkward by smiling and saying something casual like, “Cool, no problem, sorry if I bothered you!”
If you two are already friends, emphasize that the friendship is important to you by saying something along the lines of, “I hope I didn’t make you uncomfortable, I’m more than happy to just be friends too.”
Don’t ask them out repeatedly. Respect their decision and treat them with the same kindness and respect that you did before. After all, no one is ever obligated to like another person so if you are rejected, take it in stride and move on with your life.

You won't be able to make her your girlfriend if she has no idea who you are. To make her notice you, you should not only maintain clean clothes, good hygiene, and a killer smile, but you should find a way to make her see you — preferably when you're at your best.


If you know that you'll be running into her on a certain day, make sure to look your best.

Even if you're in a bad mood, make an effort to smile and give her a positive vibe, so she wants to get to know you.
;
, Invite her to hangout. Get to know her. Be upfront and friendly. It's always about the other person in a relationship. When you hang out try to get to know her more. No one likes to get into a relationship with someone they don't know.


She won't be impressed if she sees you sleeping in class, or kicking your locker because it won't open. You should make her see that it's really fun to hang out with you.


, You don't have to be the teacher's pet to get the girl's attention in class. But you should do a few things to make her want to get to know you. Let her see you talking with friends before class starts so she knows you're social. Pay attention and answer some questions correctly so she knows you're smart. And don't be rude to the teacher just to make her laugh.


You can make some jokes in class to show that you like to have fun, but not at the expense of others or the teacher. That'll make her think that you're too much of a wise guy.
If you make eye contact or walk into the room together, don't be afraid to say hi.
If you're sitting next to her, you can make small talk about whether she's ready for the test, if she understood the homework, or just ask her how her day is going.
You can ask her to help you in class or have her tutor you. Just go up to her and say, "" Listen I'm having trouble in math and I was wondering if you could help me after school sometime?"".

, You can also make a big impression on the girl if you run into her in the hall, the mall, or at a party. You don't have to do a back flip to make her see that there's something special about you. If you see her out in an unexpected place, don't be shy and avoid her because you weren't prepared to see her. Instead, go up to her and ask her how she's doing.


If you see her in the hall, say hi and even walk next to her if you're feeling bold.

If you see her at the mall or at a party, let her see you talking to your friends, acquaintances, and other girls to make her see that you're a cool guy who can get along with anyone.


, You may think that it's not cool to be friendly, to smile, or to actually act like you care about the girl, but the opposite is true. She should be able to see your face light up when she comes your way, and to start to see that you may like her without feeling smothered or put off. So, if you see her, give her a big smile or a wave and ask her how she's doing. Don't be afraid that you don't look cool just because you're not ignoring her.


Remember that most guys in middle school are nervous about how to talk to girls. If you keep your cool and say hi to her like it's no big deal, you'll stand out from the pack.


, Saying hi and making her see you having a great time is a great way to make her notice you, but when the time comes, you have to be able to put your money where your mouth is and to actually talk to the girl. She'll be more likely to want to date you if she knows that you can actually hold up your end of a conversation and make her have fun and feel at ease. Here's how to do it:


Start off by making her feel at ease. Pay attention to her and make eye contact without cornering her or making her nervous.

Ask her about whatever's coming up next. If you see her in the halls, ask about her next class. If you see her in the halls, ask her if she's going to a club meeting or what she's up to after school without being too nosy.

Make her laugh. If you start off by poking fun at yourself or making a harmless joke about a teacher or someone you both know, you'll start off on the right foot.


, If you want the girl to feel like she means something to you, then you have to show an interest in her life. This doesn't mean you should grill her and make her feel like you're interrogating her, but it does mean that you should make her see that you care about her interests, her friends and family, and the things that are important to her. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Ask her about her dance classes or any sports she plays. Girls love talking about their interests.
Ask her about her pets. If she has a cat or a dog, she'll love that you care.
Ask her about her friends. Girls love talking about their friends — and any drama that they may be dealing with.
Make sure that you have a balance. She should find out things about you, too, instead of revealing a lot without getting anything back.

, If you want the girl to see that she matters to you, then you should ask for her opinion on a variety of subjects to let her see that you care about what she thinks. You can flirt with her just by asking if she likes your new shoes or asking what she thinks you should do for your next haircut, but you can also ask her opinion on more serious matters.


If you had an interesting debate in a class you had together, you can talk to her after class to see what she thinks on the matter.
If you know that you both just saw a new movie, you can ask her if she liked it and why or why not.
Ask about her favorite music. See what she likes and doesn't like to listen to -- who knows, you may even end up going to a concert together.

, If you want to make her feel special, then you should compliment both her appearance and her personality. You shouldn't go over the top and say anything that makes her uncomfortably; for example, don't say, ""You are the most beautiful girl in the world,"" instead, say, ""Hey, I like your shirt. It matches your eyes perfectly."" Here are some other nice complements that can make her feel special without overwhelming her:


""I have so much fun talking to you.""
""You have a great laugh.""
""Has anyone ever told you you look like...(name of cute actress here)?""
""It's cool that you have time to do well in school and play soccer.""

, Once you've gotten to know each other a bit better, you can start flirting with the girl by teasing her, being playful, and let her see that you like her in cute and subtle ways. If you want to flirt with her, then you have to use your body language to let you know you care by facing her, making eye contact, and smiling at her, and to drop subtle hints that you like her.


Tease her a bit and let her tease you back. Don't tease her about anything too serious that can be taken the wrong way. Instead, tease her about her love for the color purple or her obsession with any boy band.
You can break the touch barrier by playfully hitting her arm or letting her push you a bit if you've said something that makes her laugh.

, If you want the girl to start thinking that you want her to be your girlfriend, then you have to make her see that you actually pay attention to the things she says or does. If she gets a new haircut or wears a new outfit, let her know it looks great. If she told you on Friday that she was nervous about her weekend ballet recital, ask her how it went on Monday. It's the little things that will make her see that you're important to her.


If she once mentioned that Ryan Gosling is her favorite actor, you can mention that a new movie that he's in is playing that weekend. She'll be touched that you remember what she's interested in -- and may even want to go to the movie with you.
If you've been talking to her for a while and can tell that she's not being her usual chipper self, you can casually say, ""I can see that something's wrong. Do you want to talk about it?"" Even if she's not ready to talk, she'll appreciate that you care.
If you know she has a big test that she's nervous about, wish her luck and ask her how it went afterwards. You don't have to memorize her entire schedule to be aware of the key moments that matter to her.

, If you're already flirting and getting to know each other, then you can start going out of your way for the girl to let her know she matters to you. You don't have to make any grand gestures to make her see that you're willing to do things for her and care about how she's feeling. Here are some things that you can do:


If you know she's really busy during lunch because she has to study for a test, offer to stand in line for lunch for her.
If you've started talking in the halls a lot, walk out of your way so you can escort her to her next class.
If your friends are waiting for you to catch up with them, don't just leave her right away; talk until you find a natural stopping point in the conversation to show her that talking to her is important, even if it means making your friends wait for a minute or two.

, Though there's no guaranteed way to know if a girl likes you without asking, there are a number of signs that can let you know that she likes you as more than a friend. If you're pretty sure she likes you or even just suspect that she likes you, then you'll have much more confidence when you ask her to be your girlfriend. Here are some signs that she likes you:


If her face lights up every time you approach her and you can tell that she really likes talking to you.
If she's always laughing or giggling when she talks to you, even if you're not being that funny.
If her friends start giggling or abruptly stop talking when they pass you when she's around.
When she's dropped hints that it would be cool to have a boyfriend or has asked about your plans for the weekend, hoping you'll invite her to something.

, If you want to raise your chances of success when you ask her out, then you should try to ask her in the right time and place, when it's most convenient for both of you. Pick a place where you two can be alone, or reasonably alone, so she has time to think and doesn't feel pressure to report right back to her friends. Pick a time when she's in a good mood and not stressed out about rushing off to her soccer game or to her next class.


You don't have to worry too much about finding the perfect or even the most romantic place to ask her out. If you wait too long for everything to be just right, you may miss your chance.
Asking her in the hallways after school is a good idea as long as it doesn't make her late for practice.

, You don't have to tell her that she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen or that you can't stop thinking about her, even if that's what you're feeling. Start small by telling her that you think she's really cool and that you've enjoyed getting to know her. And if you have a lot in common, you can mention that, too. This shouldn't take more than a minute. You don't have to list every reason that you like her.


Say, ""I just really wanted to tell you that"" so she feels flattered and like you've put a lot of time into telling her how you feel.
This would also be a good time to gauge her reaction. If she leans closer to you, smiles or blushes, or even starts telling you that she feels the same way, then you can ask her out. If she backs away, says she has to go, or doesn't respond well, then you may not want to upset her even more by asking her out.

, Once you've told her how you feel about her, you should ask her to go out with you. In middle school, this usually is the same thing as asking her to be your girlfriend, so don't be afraid to ask that. Look her in the eyes and ask her with confidence. Don't look at the floor or mumble. You can even practice asking her out in the mirror if that makes you more comfortable.


Just a simple, ""Do you want to go out with me?"" will do the trick. She'll appreciate that you're being forward and direct.

, The last thing you have to do is to react maturely once you've asked the girl out. If she says yes and tells you that she likes you too, you should let her see how happy you are. You don't have to jump up and down and celebrate, but don't worry about looking too cool to really care -- making her see how much she means to you will get your relationship off on the right foot.


Be prepared with a date idea if she does say that she wants to go out with you. You can ask her to go to the movies or to an upcoming dance. This will make her see that you've put a lot of thought into asking her out.
If she turns you down, don't be mean or walk off without saying goodbye. Thank her for talking to her and tell her you hope she has a nice day. Even if she doesn't want to go out with you, she'll appreciate your maturity.
And whatever happens, remember not to take yourself or the relationship too seriously. Middle school is the perfect time for you to get some relationship experience without getting in over your head.
At some point before or during the date kiss her. But make sure both you and her are comfortable and in a good mood

Use Oxy or Proactive if you would like to clear up your skin, and don't eat a lot of sugar. Sugar causes the build up in pores, (Creating pimples) as well as not washing your face. Use deodorant and a little bit of Axe or another type of body spray. With body spray though, the rule is, ""a little is too much"". Don't use too much body spray (that is a huge turn off). Comb your hair; wear clean clothing and anything else that makes you feel better about yourself. If you feel good, girls will know it.;
, You're special, and you know it, so, show everyone else that you are not afraid to strut your stuff. But now, instead of wondering if you are expressing yourself enough, you now need to ask your self, ""Am I being cocky?"" No girl likes a know-it-all, full-of-it, jerk. The easiest thing to do, is to be confident, but know your place in life. You'll get higher in life, if you have humility.

, Does she like animals? Leave a cute stuffed animal on her desk, or if she is not from school, leave a cute present somewhere she will notice it. Girls love it when someone knows their interests, and takes them into account. If you're uncomfortable with giving her a gift, try asking her about the topic she's interested in. For example, if she's into animals, like the example above, maybe say to her, ""Did you hear about the new zoo opening this weekend?"" If you're still uncomfortable doing that, talk to your friends when you're near her about the topic that she's interested in.

, Ask her if you two can study together, or if she'd like to grab an ice cream later that night. Use any excuse you can to get close to her. Most girls like it if you make the first move, so do just that.

, Laugh with her. Girls are sensitive to their own flaws, if you make fun of them, she won't get that you are trying to make her laugh. She will only know that you are being mean. If you've hurt her by accident, apologize by saying something like, ""Sorry, I didn't mean for it to come across that way."" or ""Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."" and look at her apologetically. If she doesn't get over it immediately, don't get mad at her or clobber her with apologies, instead give her space to forgive you and flash her apologetic glances so she knows that you still care about her. When you think it's the right time, say sorry again and ask if she'll forgive you. If she doesn't, then it's either not the right time or she's not the girl you thought she was.

, She is a nice girl, and you like her. Express your feelings, tell her she has beautiful eyes. Write an anonymous letter, and post it on her locker. She's great, let her know that.

, When you and her are alone, look her in the eyes, and tell her that she is beautiful. Ask her if she feels the same way you do. If she does, ask her if she'd like to be you're girlfriend. If she does not share the same feeling, oh well! Rejection is a small bump in the road of relationships. Think of it this way, if you didn't know that she doesn't share your affection, you would've wasted all of your precious time on her. Maybe she'll change her mind or you'll find someone else. So just relax.

, If you got the girl, be happy, you're a new person, but, if you didn't, show everyone you can get back on your feet. Have fun with your friends, and maybe, find a new interest. Have fun, and don't hold grudges.

This doesn't mean that you should go out of your way to do weird things or to wear neon, but it does mean that you should take a chance and be original when you can. Here's how to do it:


Impress her with your wit. If you're in a class or a social situation, make a witty comment while everyone else is still thinking to show her how sharp and funny you are.
Wow her with your charm. Learn how to be smooth when you talk to anyone, whether it's your English teacher or your shy lab partner. Being charming means being able to talk to anyone and make people feel at ease no matter what, and if you do that, she will be impressed.
Be a jack of all trades. If you're a history buff, lacrosse star, and the lead of the school play, she will notice you. Obviously you can't do everything, but the more active you are in school, the likely she'll be to run into you and be impressed by your skills.
Don't stand out in a bad way. If you're the kid who always gets detention or talks back to his teachers, she may find you amusing, but she will not see you as boyfriend material.;
, Let's face it. High school is not a time when people are at their most confident. Not only is your body and voice changing, but you're walking around filled with confusing hormones and new emotions, while trying to balance your school work and navigating a tricky social arena. Though the people around you may appear confident, it's likely that they're just masking their deep insecurities with arrogance, and that's exactly what you should avoid. Here's how to make her notice you by being truly confident:


Take the time to look good. This doesn't mean spending hours gelling your hair or grinning in front of the mirror. Just make sure to take regular showers, style your hair, and wear clothes that flatter your body and show off your style. Oh, and make sure to wear pants that actually fit you.
Pursue your interests. Seriously. No matter how ""nerdy"" you may feel your real interests may be, if you're really passionate about something, you will make it cool. Don't try out for the football team just because that's what all of your friends are doing if you'd rather play golf, or join the French club. She won't be impressed by you if you look like a follower. Followers do not have confidence.
Don't be afraid to be enthusiastic. Though you may think real confidence is looking too cool for school and slouching in your seat in the back of the class, real confidence means wanting to learn and being excited by the world. If you're interested in something in class, ask questions. She'll be impressed that you're so comfortable with who you are that you do whatever you want.
Address your flaws. Part of being confident means knowing you're not perfect. Everyone in high school has plenty of growing to do, and that's natural. If you know you need to work on being more sensitive or a better friend, then do it.

, Girls want to have fun, and they don't want to be with a guy who is dark or mopey. Though you can't have a smile on your face all the time and high school can be rough, make it look like you're having a good time, and pretty soon you'll actually start having a good time and she'll want to join you. Here's how to do it:


Be friends with everyone. Though navigating high school cliques can be tricky and you can't be a part of every friend group, you should take the time to get to know a variety of people. This will show the girl that you're friendly and don't care about the status of the people that you talk to, and that you're a versatile person.
Drop the haters. Don't hang out with dudes who are mean to women, or who pick on the uncool kids. Girls are completely turned off by that, and you should avoid hanging out with haters or you'll look like one too.
Always be laughing. Laugh and smile as much as you can. If you're surrounded by a force field of positive energy, the girl of your dreams will gravitate toward you.

, Once the girl has noticed you, it's time to kick your game up a notch by paying her more attention. You should still play it cool and act like you're not too eager to hang out with her, but slowly start showing her that you think she's a cool chick during school. Here's how you can do it:


Stop to chat at her locker. Say ""hey"" and ask where her next class is. Make it look like you're just passing by. You can make her laugh by saying, ""Mind if I check my hair?"" and squinting into her locker mirror.
Start walking with her in the halls. Everyone knows that one major role of the high school boyfriend is walking his girl from class to class, even if it's the classes are miles apart. If you're in the same class, walk with her to the next one, and make her laugh as you're getting there. You can play it cool and say goodbye to get to your own class halfway through. Just give her a taste of how awesome it would be to have you as a boyfriend.
Charm her in class. Be smooth by knowing all the answers to your teacher's questions without being a know-it all. Make your classmates snicker from time to time without being a class clown. Look over at her to see her reaction.

, Whether you're at the school play or the school dance, there are a few ways to show her she's special and make her want to hang out with you. You should find a balance between playing hard to get and putting all your cards on the table. Here's how to do it:


If you see her at the school play or talent show, ask her how she likes it. Show her that her opinion matters to you. Don't linger too long — just long enough to make her wish you'd stay.
If you're at the school dance, come up to her and dance like a goofball and then look very serious when you ask her if she likes your moves. If she's really into it, you can ask her to dance.
If you're in the same club or do the same sport, ask her how she is without fawning all over her.

, If you see the girl at a party or at the mall, that may be your best chance to isolate her a bit and make her see that you'd be the best boyfriend ever. Once you're away from school property, you can relax a bit and let loose, and show her who you really are without being so worried about what everyone else is thinking.


If you run into her at the mall, ask what stores she went to. If she has a bag, ask her what she got and tell her you bet it'll look great on her. Bonus points if you say something when you see her rocking the sweater she showed you in school.
If you run into her at the movies, ask her what she saw or what she's seeing. Give your opinion on a recent movie you saw. Just avoid saying that everything sucks.
If you see her at a party, chat her up. But don't talk to her all night. Talk to a few other girls to show you can hang with anyone. Just don't flirt with anyone else so much that she doesn't feel special.

, In high school, once you start going on dates with a girl, it basically means she's your girlfriend, but you still have to play it cool when you ask her out. If she says yes, it doesn't mean she's your girlfriend — she's just trying you out as boyfriend material. So when you do go on a date with her, you better be your best self. Here's what you do:


Be a gentleman. Get her flowers, open doors, and give her your coat if it's even a little cold. High school guys can be a bit dense, so you may be the first guy to treat her like a lady.
Don't be afraid to compliment her. You don't have to shower her with affection when you first see her, but you should definitely say, ""You look nice tonight."" You can even compliment her clothes or jewelry. She obviously spent a lot of time trying to look her best and will appreciate your comments.
Catch her interest. Unless you're sitting in a movie, you'll have to strike up an interesting conversation. Come prepared with a few interesting things to say, whether it's related to one of her interests, your family, or just something funny that happened in school. Avoid putting people down or saying everything is lame.
Take her somewhere that makes her feel special. Take her on a cute mini-golfing date and then go out for ice cream. If there's a new fancy restaurant in town, take her there if it's her thing. If she really wanted to go to the movies and local restaurant, fine. But treat it like a real date and try paying for everything if she lets you.
Always make her feel special. Without sounding like an interviewer, you should ask her about her interests, her friends, her family, and her opinion on a variety of subjects.
Turn. Off. Your. Phone. Seriously.

, You can ask her at the end of the date, after your first kiss, or a little while after your first date. Once she's ready, you should ask her, because you don't want her think you're just a player who wants to hook up. As soon as the moment feels right and you're alone, you can pop the question.


Make sure you're somewhere quiet, where your friends or her friends can't hear you.
Lock eyes. Turn your body toward her to show she has your complete attention.
Be simple. Just say, ""I really like spending time with you,"" or ""I've never met someone like you before."" Then say, ""Will you be my girlfriend?""
Do not have your friends ask her to be your girlfriend. This isn't middle school. You're in the big leagues now.

, Whether she wants to be your girlfriend or out-right rejects you, you should act like the confident, mature person you have been throughout your friendship. If she says yes, you can hug her or even kiss her and say it makes you so happy. But if she turns you down, you have to take it well or you'll look like a big jerk.


If she says yes, have a mini-celebration. You don't have to do a little fist-pumping dance, but you can show her how much you care about her.
If she says no, don't sweat it. Just say, ""All right. You can't blame me for trying."" End with a compliment and wish her luck. High school is all about finding the kind of girl you really like, and though she may seem like the only decent girl around, your high school or town is filled with amazing girls. Now that you've had some experience trying to get a girl, it'll only be easier to find someone who really wants to be your girlfriend.

The more you put yourself into social situations, the better you'll get at interacting with people.

, Yes, you should try to socialize more. However, it's fine to stick to the types of gatherings you feel most comfortable in. For instance, you may find that you don't like loud, raging parties. On the other hand, you may find small parties, especially ones that include a couple of your friends, are more to your liking. Pick situations your comfortable in.

, If you feel like you're not meeting enough people, try asking someone you know to introduce you to someone new. This technique works very well in social gatherings where you may not want to run up to someone by yourself to start an introduction. Most people are happy to introduce you to someone else, especially if they know you're shy or introverted.

, That is, if you go to a party, you're there to socialize. If you go to a club meeting or hobby enthusiast group, your focus is on the issue or the hobby. You may find it's easier to socialize with a group of people when you have a topic to focus on and when the setting is a bit more rigid.Another activity you could use to meet people is volunteering.Try volunteering at your local library, food bank, or homeless shelter.

, If you have a friend who's an extrovert, you can use his or her advice to help you understand how to interact in extrovert's world. One way you can use this person expertise is to propose different interactions you've found yourself in that puzzle you. Maybe an extrovert can help you talk your way through them.

, If you find you're often at a loss about what to talk about when you meet new people, try coming up with topics before a social gathering. You could pick something in the news (though you may want to skip anything too controversial), a book you've read recently, or a movie you've seen. You could also decide to talk about some of your favorite restaurants or your hobbies. Just try to pick something you think other people might have an interest in.

Come up with several talking points for each topic ahead of time. That way, you know exactly how to respond if someone else brings the topic up.

, When someone asks you a question, try to make your answer longer than a word or two. If you just answer ""I'm okay,"" that doesn't give the other person any chance to respond. Instead, try something such as ""I've been doing pretty well. I just got a new laser cutter machine at home, so I've been enjoying my time trying to figure out how it works.""

, Sometimes as a loner, you may find that people don't always hear or understand what you're saying. Introverts and shy people naturally tend to speak more softly or sometimes even mumble their words. If you find yourself in a conversation where a person is constantly asking you to repeat yourself, trying slowing down and enunciating your words more. You may not even need to speak louder, just more distinctly.

, Many shy or introverted people feel a bit awkward in groups. It's fairly normal, in fact. Nonetheless, you should forge ahead. Over time, social interactions may come to feel less awkward for you, and anyway, you shouldn't let those feelings stop you from interacting with people, if that's your desire.

If you're having trouble working up the nerve, try reducing your stress first. For instance, you can try a short meditation before you approach someone.Find a quiet place, and take a moment to focus on your breathing. Try counting to four as you breath in through your nose and to four again as you breath out through your mouth. Focus on your breathing until you feel some of your anxiety calming down.
Another way you can help yourself is to decide what you're going to say before you approach the person. That way, you are prepared ahead of time. However, try not to think about what you shouldn't say, as it may pop out of your mouth., Smiling invites the other person into the conversation. It says, ""I think you're interesting, and I want to talk with you some more."" If you can make eye contact with the person, even better. Eye contact shows you're listening and that you are engaged in the conversation.

, People enjoy talking about themselves. Therefore, to strike up a conversation with a girl, start asking about herself. You can ask about her hobbies, her job, her interests, what she likes to read, and what shows she likes to watch. You can also ask about her family and pets.

, When the girl your interested in is talking, be sure to listen attentively. It may be tempting to think about what you want to say next, but it's more important to actually hear what she has to say.

One way you can show you're listening is to offer short summaries of what you hear her saying, such as, ""That's awesome that you have two cats. I wish I wasn't allergic.""
Another way to show you're listening is to ask relevant follow-up questions.

, If you're only trying to get her to like you, you'll most likely fail. Instead, your goal should be to learn about her and let her learn some things about you.

, That is, you don't want to act like someone you're not (say an extrovert) just to catch a girl. Your true colors will come out in the relationship. In addition, you want the girl to be attracted to who you are. Loners have attractive qualities, too.

, Offer genuine compliments to the girl you want to date. These compliments don't always need to focus on looks. In fact, it may be better if they don't since it shows you can look deeper. Try something along the lines of, ""You seem like a really happy person, and it shows in the way you carry yourself.""

, If you're not confident enough to ask her outright, try making a suggestion. Allude to plans you have over the weekend, suggesting that she be a part of them. How strong you make the suggestion is up to you.

As an example, you could say, ""What do you have going on Friday night?"" She may say ""Nothing much"" or ""I was thinking about going to a concert, but I can't make up my mind."" You can say, ""Well, I'm going to see this awesome throw-back movie playing downtown. Have you ever seen Singing in the Rain?""

, Another way to ask her on a date is to ask her advice about a good place to eat. Alternatively, you could ask about any interesting events going on in town. Either way, the point is to get her to answer and then suggest you go together.

For instance, you could say, ""Have you heard about any fun events going on this weekend?"" In turn, she might say, ""Oh, I heard there was a folk festival on the south side of town."" You could say, ""That sounds fun! Maybe we should go together.""
If she says no, accept it, and move on. You can always meet someone else.

, When dating, it's important to focus on becoming friends with the girl, not just on moving towards intimacy. That is, try to learn about her as a person. Find out what excites her and what she both loves and hates. Ask what she'd like to do in the future. Learn what her hopes and dreams are.

, As you date, try to find things you enjoy doing together. Over time, you'll find that your shared interests are making your relationship stronger.

For instance, try taking a cooking class together, or learn how to fly fish if you both like the outdoors.

Don't change who you are.,
Clean yourself up.,
Be confident.",How to Get a Girl You Like to Like You Back1," This is the most important step, because it defines all the other ones. If she doesn't like you for who you are, then you will never able to be yourself around her. This will not make for a good relationship. Someone you have to change yourself for is not someone you will end up with.;
, You don't have to dress fancy, but make sure that your hygiene is well taken care of. Basic cleanliness will go a long way in helping you stand out. Make sure you smell good, thats a key factor to getting her closer.


Shower before school. Use a fresh-scented soap or body wash. Wear a lightly fragranced deodorant. Strong fragrances can be too overwhelming and may drive her away.






Keep your teeth brushed. Carry some gum in case your breath gets bad during the day. keep a travel-sized mouthwash in your backpack or locker for a quick freshening.There is nothing worse then someone with dragon breath.






Trim your fingernails. Make sure your hands and nails are clean, they are a very visible part of your body. Think: does she want you to hold her hand or hide it?






Make sure your clothes are clean. Ratty, threadbare clothes are a turn-off, unless you're going for a specific look. Make sure what you're wearing is presentable and well put together. Pick clothes that compliment your looks; baggy shirts and pants hide your form and make you look less confident. GO for what that girl wants, maybe if she's popular wither wear brand shirts and gel in your hair.







, Girls, and people in general, pick up on confidence. Nobody likes someone who doesn't believe in themselves. You will find that this will help not only get the girl, but in all aspects of your life. Here a some ways to look confident, even if you aren't.


Stand up straight. Slouching makes you look lazy. Pull your shoulders back slightly, this will fill your frame out.






If you're out of shape, suck in your stomach. Start exercising for long term benefits to your confidence and sense of self-worth. Even a few basic exercises a day, such as crunches and sit-ups, will make a big difference.






Make eye contact. Looking down or away makes you look passive, scared, and weak. Maintaining eye contact will show her that you are interested and engaged, and that you are not afraid.






Don't mumble. Speak clearly and form your thoughts before you open your mouth. When you talk, speak with a measured speed. Speak loudly enough to be the commanding voice in the conversation, but don't yell or overpower.

Start talking to her.,
Find out what she likes and doesn't like.,

Be careful not to get too personal.",How to Get a Girl You Like to Like You Back2," You can't know someone until you talk to them. Conversations won't fall into your lap; you need to make them happen. Try to sit next to her in a class. Comment on something she's wearing as you pass her in the hall. It doesn't have to be deep, just natural. Get her interested in talking to you. Here are some conversation starters:


""That last class was so boring!""
""What are your planning to write about for the paper next week?""
""Do anything exciting over the weekend?""

, Look at what colors she likes to wear. If she likes to read, ask her about the book she's reading. Ask her what TV shows she likes. Ask her friends, if they seem receptive to helping you. Finding common ground will increase your appeal.


""I see you're reading , how are you liking it?"" ""I'm reading the same book do you want to read it together on face-time?""
""Been to any good concerts lately?""
ask her questions about herself and her friends/family, the more she tells you the more you can talk.

, You want to keep the conversations carefree in the beginning.

"
"
If she blushes when you're around, that's a very good sign.,
Pay attention to how she responds to you.,
Play to her unique qualities.",How to Get a Girl You Like to Like You Back3," You're not the only one who's nervous. If she likes you, the same worries are probably going through her head. She can also be really brave and experienced, so this doesn't mean she doesn't like you.


Don't start gushing about how much you like her. It will most likely scare her away. Instead, let her discover your attraction through your interactions. Drop little hints, and keep her wanting, don't always text first and be the last one to text bye.

, When you talk to her, watch how attentive she is. If she is actively participating in your conversation, she is interested in what you have to say.

, Her personality has a lot to do with how the two of you will interact. If she is an outgoing person, you will need to be more outgoing yourself to get noticed. If she is quiet and reserved, a boisterous personality may drive her away. You don't have to change who you are, but you can adjust how you present yourself.

"
"
Find a girl that seems nice that you're attracted to.,
Get confidence.,
Try to venture out a little bit more and get more social.,
Wear something nice, and wash everyday.,
Go near her with your friends and talk about a topic that interests you both.,
When she looks at you, hold her gaze, smile, and say hi if she's within earshot.,
Bump into her slightly or touch her hand lightly as you walk by.,
Make small talk.,
If you aren't getting anywhere with the conversation, give up and try again later.

,
Become friends with her.,
Flirt with her a bit.,
Ask her if she would like to go somewhere with you and your friends.,
When you think the time is right, ask her out.",How to Get a Girlfriend in Fifth Grade If You Are a Shy Person," If she is the new girl, wait a while before you decide to flirt with her or ask her out.;
, This will give you the courage to flirt with her and ask her out. Also, most girls are much more attracted to a confident guy than an un-confident one.

, If you become more outgoing, and overcome some of your shyness, it will build your confidence and make it easier to flirt with or ask out the girl you like.

, Use cologne or deodorant if you have to. Nothing is a bigger turn-off to a girl than a smelly guy who doesn't wear half decent clothing.

, This is a great way to get the ball rolling as a shy person. Just make sure that you are talking loud enough for her to hear, but not so loud that it's obvious that you want her to hear you.

, Make an effort to do this once or twice each day. Don't do it anymore than this, and usually only do it once a day. Also try half smiling a bit, but be careful to not make it look like a smirk because smirking is offensive and rude, but half smiling can be cute and endearing.

, Just brush by her hand, and when you bump into her, don't bump her so hard that she falls over.

, If you're too scared to just go up to her awkwardly and say something, see if you can get in her group for group work or be her partner for partner work, and then use it as an excuse to talk to her. Ask questions, but make it subtle and don't make her feel like she's being interviewed. try these questions for starters:


""How are you doing?""
""Do you have any hobbies?""
(if she is a new girl) ""How do you like this school so far?""
(if she is not a new girl)""How long have you been at this school?
""Do you have any siblings?""
(if she happens to have a broken bone)""How's your(insert name of broken bone here) doing?""
""Do you like any sports?""

,, Smile at her lots and talk to her whenever you can, just don't make it seem too obsessive and make sure that it isn't obvious that you like her. (see step 6 for more help.) Do little things for her to let her know that you care. Do some activities that she does and be open-minded.

, This is assuming that you've done the last step. Anyway, do subtle little things to flirt with her. Try doing things like teasing her just the slightest bit, compliment her personality and eventually her appearance, and toss a tennis ball to your right hand, and then your left hand and so on (this can be kind of cute and show that you are sporty. If you aren't sporty, since you want to be yourself, you might not want to do this, but it's your choice). When you see her flirting back, increase the amount you flirt, and also make the flirts a tiny bit less subtle. For example, you could try winking at her when she flirts back.

, Try to avoid going to the movies with her and your friends, especially a romantic movie, because this might seem a bit suspicious and it will probably make everyone a bit uncomfortable. A few suggestions of places where you could go are a bowling alley, a fair, and possibly a theatre(not a movie theatre, but a play theatre, and if you choose this one, make sure that the play is appropriate and not at all romantic. Make sure you are actually into theatre if you do this one, and be aware that this choice is a little bit iffy.) You could also go get ice cream, go to a fast food restaurant (not a fancy restaurant), or go to a sports event.

, Ask her in a somewhat subtle way, just don't make it too subtle. Dress extra nice that day (not in a tuxedo, but maybe something plaid), and ask her out to the zoo or to a sports event, maybe out for ice cream. If she rejects you don't cry and get upset, just say, ""Alright, let's just continue to be friends then."" Don't keep asking; if she changes her mind she will probably let you know.

Use lunch and recess to talk to as many girls as you can.
If you don't know how to talk to a girl, figure out who her friends are, and make friends with them. That will give a chance to talk to the girl.
Try to talk to girls who are close to your grade an age. If you're in second grade, it's probably a waste of time to try to get a fourth or fifth grader to be your girlfriend.;
, Now that you've met a lot of girls, decide which ones you like best. Try to make them your friends by spending time around them and being nice.


Compliment them. Tell them you think they're smart or funny, or tell them that you like their clothes or their hair.
Stand up for them. If you see somebody being mean to them, stand up for the girl you like, because then she'll know you're a good friend.

, One of the most important things about having a girlfriend is that you can make each other laugh. When you spend time with your new friends, see if any of them make you laugh, or if you make them laugh. If you think a particular girl is funny, and she thinks you are funny, that's a great sign!

, It's also very important that you and your girlfriend are interested in some of the same things. You're different people, so you don't have to like exactly the same things, but it's a good if you have a few interests in common, like if you both like the same sports or subjects in school.

, You're probably pretty close to picking which girl you want to be your girlfriend. The last step is to make sure she's nice. If you notice that a girl is bossy, or that she makes fun of you, she probably shouldn't be your girlfriend.

, You started out by talking to a bunch of girls. Then you became friends with some of them. Then you checked to see which of your new friends like the same things as you, and think the same things are funny. Now it's time to pick the girl you like best.

, Before you do anything else, you need to make sure you're clean and well groomed whenever you see her. Girls don't like boys who smell bad. Before school or play dates, do the following:


Take a bath or a shower and use lots of soap.
Brush your teeth.
Wear clean clothes

, Most people don't have their first boyfriend or girlfriend until after elementary school,so the first thing you need to do is check and see if the girl you like even wants a boyfriend.


Talk about other people you know who have boyfriends or girlfriends, because it will give you a reason to ask if she wants one.
Ask her if she's ever thought about having a boyfriend, but don't tell her it's because you want to be her boyfriend. That might scare her off.
If she says she doesn't want a boyfriend, ask her why not.
If she asks if you want a girlfriend, tell her that you wouldn't mind having one, but that you're not desperate to.

, DO NOT try to convince her to be your girlfriend. This will only make her hate you for not respecting her, and then other girls will not date you either. NEVER EVER try to talk a girl into anything she doesn't want.

, If she's going to be your girlfriend, you should try to spend time with her outside of school. But you don't want to seem too aggressive at first. So, instead of inviting only her to your house, try to get a group of people to come—your friends and hers. That will give you a chance to spend more time with her, but won't feel too awkward.

, Girls talk about boys when they're alone, so you want to be sure that her friends are saying nice things about you. No girl wants to have a boyfriend who isn't friends with her friends, so this is very important.

, If the group play date goes well, the next step is to spend time with just the two of you. Remember, this still isn't a real date, so you don't want to assume she'll be your girlfriend just because you two are hanging out.


Find things to laugh about. Talk about funny things that happened at school, or watch a funny TV show you both like.
Talk about things you have in common. If you two are in the same class, or if you like to do the same things outside of school, these are good things to talk about so your play date won't be awkward.

, Boyfriends and girlfriends are close, and they talk about their feelings. So, if you get in the habit of talking to the girl you like about times when you were sad or happy, she'll start to think of you more like a boyfriend.

, Giving her a gift will show that you've been thinking about her. And if it's a gift she can use, she'll think about you whenever she uses it. Think about the things she likes to do:


If she likes to draw, give her some nice markers.
If she likes fancy socks, give her a pair you like. It will make her feel special.

, Eventually, if you want her to be your girlfriend, you're going to have to ask. This is probably the scariest part, but here are a few things you can say to her before asking if she wants to be your girlfriend:


You're one of my best friends, and I think you're really smart and funny.
I've noticed that we always have a really good time when we spend time together, so I'd like to spend more time with you.
I feel like I can talk to you about things that I can't talk to other people about.
We have a lot in common, and I really like all of your friends.

, Remember, she's younger than most people are when they get their first boyfriend, so she might not be ready yet. Just remember not to pressure her into anything she doesn't want.

Be confident.,
Be hygienic.,
Stay in shape.,
Talk to them.,
Listen.,
Have a sense of humor.,
Don't get friend zoned.,
Ask her out.,
Keep her.",How to Get a Girlfriend as a Teen," Girls like confident guys. Make it noticeable. When you walk, don't slump your shoulders; walk with your chest out and chin up. This displays that you are a strong person. When you talk, don't be timid, but be articulate. This shows that you are not afraid to speak your mind. Also, be careful not to be over-confident, as this can come across as cocky, and girls are generally not fond of overly cocky guys.;
, Girls don't like bad body odor. Keep yourself smelling and looking good. Shower everyday, brush your teeth often, wear cologne. Keep yourself clean.

, No girl wants to date the kid that's always last in gym. Keep yourself healthy. You don't have to be the star athlete but be able to pull your own weight.

, Don't be that guy who's always hanging out with other guys. Make friends with girls. That way you know who's out there for you. And if you're not sure ask them. They might have a friend who's right for you. If you find a girl you like, talk to her. Even if she doesn't know you exist, get to know her. Start off with a simple 'hi' and keep the conversation interesting and playful. No girl likes a boring guy.

, This cannot be stressed enough. Listening is something that is extremely important. When a girl is talking to you don't talk unless you know she is asking you a question or asking for an opinion. Also, try not to fidget. Keep your hands in your pockets or belt loops. When you fidget she may think that you are nervous and uncomfortable.

, A good sense of humor is something girls love in a guy. Find out what makes her laugh. Don't just make her giggle and be like ""that was funny"" but make her really laugh. That will tell her that you like to have a good time.

, Keep your relationship flirty and friendly to remind her that you are a guy not just a ""good friend"".

, Once you feel that you and the girl you like have something ask her to be your girlfriend. Don't be all ""Ummm you know I've really liked you for awhile and was wondering if you would be my girlfriend?"". Simply say I think your beautiful and I want you to be my girlfriend. Look into her eyes while you say it and hold your gaze when you finish. She may not respond immediately because she is shocked but don't let that phase you. If she walks away don't run after her as that will make you seem needy. Just let her go because she is probably thinking it over. If she says no than just say okay and walk away.

, This is the most important step. Make her feel wanted. I'm not talking about showering her with gifts 24/7 but surprise her, make her laugh, do things together. Don't be that couple who just talks in school. Keep things exciting. You want to make her fall head over heels for you.

, Remember, you have to take the first step forward.

,, If she was not sure she liked you, she will just get scared of you and will try to avoid you.

, Don't push her or say bad words in front of her, girls really don't like that.

, Instead of just making her jealous, you will make her dislike you.

, Groom yourself. Girls hate guys that smell, especially when it comes to bad breath or bad body odour.

, However, be sure that the girl you are talking to doesn't know the girl you are trying to impress, otherwise things could go wrong.

No matter how geeky or unfashionable your current interests may be, it is considered attractive for a man to own up to what he's interested in, and own confidence enough to show them off with pride. When you're meeting a woman for the first time, this will also give you plenty of possible material to converse with., Maintaining an active and healthy social life is an important part of feeling confidence. Anyone is bound to feel down on themselves if they feel isolated from the rest of society. If you're feeling in need of cheering up, spending time with your existing circle of friends can give you the morale you need to broaden your horizons.


Not to mention-- the most common way of meeting new people is through the people you already know. If you're looking to meet a woman, you can't go wrong with going out with the friends you already have.

, Taking care of your health shows to a woman that you have self-respect and discipline. This will make her that much more likely to take you seriously as a possible partner. Take a look at your own body and try to access the things you'd like to see improved.


If you're overweight, going for a run or using an elliptical machine can help shed pounds, so long as it's done in tandem with a whole foods-based diet.
If you lack sufficient muscle definition, you should determine which muscles you would like to see improve the most and focus on them. Keep in mind, however, that good health comes from valuing every part of your body. A well-balanced workout will always have better results than simply training up your biceps.
Get at least six hours of sleep every night, and try to get to sleep around the same time every evening.
Watching what you eat will have a big effect on the way you feel. Steering clear of fat and sugar-heavy processed foods should see a significant change in your mood within a couple of weeks.

, If a woman is going to step outside her comfort zone and show open interest towards you, you had better make sire you are a catch worth pursuing. A big part of that means presenting your body in a fashionable, attractive and sophisticated manner. Purchase a current men's fashion magazine for insights into what to wear and how to wear it.It's also important to be dressing as appropriately suits the place you'll be meeting at. As much as a three-piece suit looks great on just about any guy, you might seem silly if you're approaching a woman at a hardcore punk show dressed like that.
Fashion is important, but personality and comfort are arguably even more crucial to your attractiveness. You won't be feeling quite like yourself if you're wearing something that doesn't suit your personal style. Worse still, dressing as someone you're not may attract the wrong sort of women to you.

, Posture, eye contact, and proper force of step are all non-verbal ways of letting the world know you are confident in your abilities as a man. If you aren't already exhibiting these traits, it's a good idea to train yourself to do them in the mirror. Looking at yourself with give you a basic idea of the way other people are going to be perceiving you when you're stressing these physical indicators. Ideally, you will be ultimately demonstrating these on a constant basis without having to think about it. At first, you'll need to keep them in mind frequently. Give it enough time, and you'll start showing these signs by default.As an added bonus, expressing confidence physically will make you feel more confident on the inside as well. Keep running with it until it starts to come naturally, and you should feel the morale booster set in shortly thereafter.
If you're having a hard time developing a dash of confidence in yourself toward women, try writing down a list of things you think women might potentially find attractive in you. No matter how down yourself you might be, there are things about you a woman would die for.

, While the obvious places to meet women are bars and clubs, the fact remains that they're a lowest common denominator. If you're looking for a more specific kind of partner, you should think beforehand what kind of places your ideal woman would frequent on her time off. A more bookish type would probably find his best match at a library, school or convention. Contrast that with an athletic type, who would be better off at a sporting event or dance club when seeking his other half.If you already have a woman in mind, you should make yourself present in places she will normally be. Make sure not to overdo it however, as you don't want to pass yourself off as a creep.

, A lot rests on making the best possible first impression. With that said, you shouldn't necessarily be putting too much thought into it. If you have a natural confidence in your abilities and personality, a first impression will succeed on its own. Make eye contact, smile nonchalantly and introduce yourself casually. Even if the two of you are already attracted to one another, it's best to stay slightly aloof at first., There are many ways you could go about introducing yourself to a woman. The most natural and effective method is to look to your mutual surroundings for inspiration. If there is something noteworthy about the event or place you're at, you should bring it up. It could be anything-- is the music too loud? Is the entertainment boring, or the food especially tasty? Ultimately, it doesn't really matter what the particulars are, so long as you approach the situation feeling sure of yourself and your motivations.If you're at a concert for example, you could say: ""That last song was pretty incredible! What have you thought of the show so far?""
Or, if you're feeling particularly sure of yourself, you can just as easily go up and say ""Hi!"". There's no harm in trying, and if you're confident enough, the aura you'll emit should be enough to get her interested piqued.

, Once you've struck the initial introductions, it is time to get to know this woman and hopefully spark some interest between the two of you.No matter how badly you may want to get to know her, it's important to keep your initial interactions light and playful. This includes smiling, joking around, and stressing casual fun over any matters of importance.


This can't happen if you're worrying too much or not having fun yourself, so try to make your own enjoyment the first step before focusing on her. The better you're feeling, the smoother the charm will flow.

, Asking a woman about her life will demonstrate your interest in her, as well as give you a better idea if there's any mutual compatibility. Every question is a potential conversation starter, so try to make your questions as open-ended as they can be.


Avoid questions like ""How old are you?"" or ""Where do you work?"" Instead, aim for questions that would demand longer answers, such as ""What sort of stuff do you do at work?"" or ""How did you end up here tonight?"" With any luck, the next conversation topic will be buried in her response.

, When it comes time to turn the tables on you, you should be honest with your answers. Give a just answer to the questions she asks, and don't be afraid to go into detail with talking about yourself, remembering all the while to keep your conversation light and fun. The more detail and depth in an answer, the easier a conversation will flow.


For example, if you are asked ""What do you do for work?"", you could answer in very basic terms (""I work at the post office."") but that doesn't offer much opportunity to let the conversation breathe. Instead, you should dive into more details, offering opportunities for the woman to ask more: ""I work at the post office sorting out mail and deliveries. It's usually pretty hectic, especially around holiday season. I'm not sure I enjoy it so much, but I'm expecting a promotion really soon."")
Of course, you don't want to talk about yourself too much. A man who talks about himself excessively is often interpreted as narcissistic and undesirable by most women. It's better to strike a fine balance between asking questions and giving responses.
Demonstrating the traditional physical signs of confidence (such as posture and proper speaking volume) will translate into yourself feeling more certain of yourself.

, If you're wanting to get a woman to pursue you, you're still going to have to exhibit some signs of interest. However, part of the fun here is making those hints subtle enough that they aren't construed as actively hitting on the woman. You want to make her think it's her idea to pursue you, after all!Offhand compliments about her are a good thing, so long as you don't hinge them on her appearance. Chances are she's heard the same lines dozens of times before.
Steady eye contact is a powerful tool that enables quick familiarity and chemistry between two people.

, A lot of men put far too much emphasis on being assertive and seeming confident when first meeting a woman that they lose sight of the fact that the conversation is meant to go both ways. A woman will be more interested in you if you know something about her and accept her as such for it. When she's telling you something, don't let your attention be broken for anything.


In order to demonstrate active listener, you should occasionally summarize what the woman has told you thus far. While it may sound strange, it shows the other person you've been taking the time to listen in on what they're saying. Chances are you already know people who use this technique without knowing it themselves! With confidence and experience, it can be done fluidly as part of a conversation.
It goes without saying that it is much easier to listen to someone if you are genuinely interested in what she has to say. At the end of the day, chemistry cannot be forced. If you are really having a hard time staying engaged by the conversation, it may be best to turn away and find someone else to talk to.

, Men are often conditioned in society to pursue women they are interested in. While this bodes well in many cases, this also doesn't give the woman much of an incentive to chase you herself. She may even come to expect to be chased! Instead, you've got to be aloof and make yourself effectively emotionally distant while you're trying to get her attention. If you drop subtle hints of your interest, you might even give her the impression it was her idea all along.


Use the push-pull technique. This is a tried-and-tested technique that, if done correctly, will get girls to chase you and seek your approval. First, give the girl a compliment, or offer her some other sort of positive reinforcement. Once she is warming up to it, pull away and act more cold and aloof.Done in the right way, this will get the woman hooked on your affection without getting too used to it.

, When it comes time to part ways, you should make a point of giving at least a few seconds for her to ask you out. Whether it's an extended embrace or some lingering eye contact before saying goodbye, offering her the chance to go out on a limb and ask you out is important.


Don't hesitate too long-- due to societal norms, it's possible and even likely that, in an extended silence, she is waiting for you to ask her out!

Showing interest in what she's passionate about will quickly bond the two of you. Believe in the power of random questions in getting to know her.Ask how she would describe herself. It's a quick way to learn about her personality. It may be a bit of a shortcut, but she'll get to describe herself honestly.
Figure out what she's proud of. Positive questions will get her to talk about her accomplishments, traits, and skills.
Ask questions revolving around ""favorites,"" such as movies, TV shows, or musicians. You may have common interests, and this will create an immediate bond.
Ask her opinions about things your passionate about. If she knows you’re into something and you want to know what she thinks about it, she’ll know you value her opinion.;
, While you may find this girl attractive, you're trying to become friends, not hit on her. Avoid complimenting her looks, as this can make the situation uncomfortable, especially if she has a boyfriend.Instead, tell her something specific about her personality that you appreciate.


Women want to be appreciated for what they do or who they are, not what they look like. If you've heard her speak publicly and enjoyed it, tell her so. Speak in specifics about something positive that you've observed about her character.
Above all, a compliment should be sincere. Don't pull something from a movie or a website. Observe something that you admire about her and share this admiration.
Women like compliments, but you need to respect their personal space. Don't overdo it with the praise, as it may seem desperate or put on.

, There are many different ways to express love to another person. When starting a friendship, you'll want to express love in a friendly way. Doing an act of service works well in bonding an individual to you.These acts of service can range from cooking her a meal to picking her up from an appointment. People often need help, so extending favors to her shouldn't be too difficult.
Remember that actions speak louder than words. You can tell her that she's great, but you need to prove that you're there for her. These acts of service help solidify your reliability as a friend.

, Laughter can really be the best medicine as it elevates mood and helps to build strong relationships with friends.Humor will attract her to you. It will also smooth over any initial embarrassment or awkwardness in the first steps of your relationship.


Laughing creates a positive bond between two people. All good friendships should be founded in positivity.

, Only you will understand these jokes, making them more intimate. Sharing things between only the two of you solidifies your friendship.

, This is hugely important. If you like her, try to put the romantic part out of your mind as much as you can. This is really hard, but you have to tell yourself its either being her friend or nothing at all. Don’t ruin your friendship by letting your feelings show and making things uncomfortable.

, If she sees you act the same around her as around your male friends, she’ll trust you and know you’re not putting on an act for her. This doesn’t mean you have to act gross – just don’t try to constantly impress her.

, To enhance your friendship, you'll want to give her your undivided attention for long periods of time. Spending many hours alone together will change your relationship for the better. Remember to keep it friendly at all costs.


One key aspect of quality time is a quality conversation. It’s always important to maintain eye contact and listen intently. Don't distract from the conversation by doing something else.
Compliments and services may not be enough to gain her trust. Spend long periods of time talking with her and listening to her feelings. This will bring your friendship to a deeper level of trust and comfort.

, As your friendship grows, don’t be afraid to give her some attention if she needs it. If she's ever experiencing some intense challenge, be present in comforting her. Reach out to her if you know she's in trouble. You don't want her to feel alienated.


Things might get complicated if she's having relationship issues. Be an open vessel of kindness and support. Don't let your personal feelings get in the way of helping her. You must be a friend first.
Help her make small decisions about her issue without dictating too much. You don't want to boss her around, but you don't want to be too passive.
Let her cry if she needs it. If you give her this level of emotional support, she'll be immensely thankful.

, To truly gain her trust, you need to listen intently to her problems. Practice active listening. You'll want to be able to repeat what she says back to you, as well express your opinions about her issues. Even if you don't agree with her, you still must listen intently. She will give you the opportunity to state your opinions. Let her express herself fully before you interrupt her train of thought.


Avoid distractions when you're talking to her. Sit close enough to her to pay attention to what she says. Focus all your energy on her when she's speaking and remember the details as specifically as possible.

, After listening intently to her, reveal a piece of you. To experience real emotional closeness, speak about yourself. She will appreciate active listening, but forming trust requires two vulnerable parties.


Establishing trust requires an unspoken contract between you and her. Pay attention to what she needs, but let her take care of you too.
Most people want to listen to others. Don't feel self-conscious about speaking about your issues. You deserve to be heard.

, If it’s too hard for you to continue to be her friend, you’re allowed to tell her the truth. In some ways, it might be selfish – keep this in mind. You’re going to cause her some serious heartache because you were unable to wrap your mind around the fact that she is unavailable. You may not end up being friends at all if you tell her you have romantic feelings for her.

, Always express your feelings in a healthy way. You want to talk through the situation without being rude or harsh with her. She may be surprised when you reveal that you are into her, so you don't want to make her feel self-conscious.


Any accusation, even accidental, will hurt you. Never make it seem like she was leading you on. Say something along the lines of “I hope you don’t feel like I’m betraying our friendship, but the more time I spend with you the more I like you. I know you like someone else, and I don’t want to get in the way of that. But just know that if there ever comes a time when you feel the same way about me, I’ll still be just as into you.
Share feelings effectively by starting with the phrase, ""I feel."" If you start by saying, ""you make me feel..."" and then express your emotional state, she will feel like she's being accused.
State your feelings from your own perspective. This will ensure that you're speaking about your subjective experience. Don't allow her to feel victimized.

, Remember that she's already seeing someone else, or that she likes someone else. Even if you feel that you are a better fit for her, you've put her in a difficult position. Remember that, like you, she has complex thoughts, plans, dreams, and hopes. Her relationship gives her comfort and safety, and you've just challenged this with your feelings.


Search for verbal cues when you tell her how you feel. If she attempts to change the subject, she may be uncomfortable about the circumstances. If she doesn’t want to talk about it, just keep it short and simple and then leave her alone.

, If you've solidified your friendship, then you should have an understanding of her boundaries. Don't cross them while you're telling her this information. Even though you've probably shared physical intimacy before, this situation is a bit different.

, Being completely emotionally honest with anyone isn't easy. Before being emotionally honest, you must be fully emotionally aware. Share your true self by shedding all emotional walls. If you speak openly, you'll feel better about yourself regardless of her decision.


You have the freedom to decide when it's best to share your real feelings. Complicated situations like this one require radical honesty. If you aren't willing to say everything, then she may not fully understand your situation.
Society tells us to repress our true feelings, especially if they could be considered ""inappropriate."" Telling a taken girl that you like her isn't the most acceptable action. Having said that, your feelings are real. You are entitled to tell her the truth.

, In the end, she may not choose to pursue you. Even if you've supported her, she may value stability more. It's tough because you've probably built up a dream about your relationship. While she does have some perfect qualities, remember that she's also imperfect.

, You knew that you were entering dangerous territory by falling for a taken girl. Respect your friendship by respecting her decision.


Because you two have cared for each other in the past, this decision will be harder. You may have to get some healthy space.

Most good relationships start in the 'Friend Zone', especially when you're only in 7th grade. Talk to her casually and learn a little bit about her. Let her learn a bit about you too.;
, This may come as a surprise for some people, but girls really aren't impressed with your armpit farting skills, and they don't care about how loud your burps are. Most guys have figured this out by 7th grade, but if you haven't, get a clue!

, It always helps to look good. Shower every day as well as after a sport. Wear clean clothes. Brush your teeth and hair. Wear deodorant. There's nothing worse than trying to impress a girl when you smell like a gym sock. Since you're in 7th grade, wearing cologne is over-doing it a bit. Try to look presentable and smell good. This will make a great impression on the girl.

, Talk to her as much as possible without seeming obsessive and do not be a creeper. Casually try to start a conversation with her. If she's not really into it, don't keep following her and trying to talk to her. Do not stalk her. You will come off as desperate.

, Smile at her and compliment her. If she comes to school with a new haircut, tell her that you really like it. Give her casual compliments such as ""your shoes are awesome"". This is a very subtle way of flirting, and it will make you seem like a really sweet guy as long as you sound like you mean it.

, Does she have a cell phone? Ask her for her number. Does she have email? Ask her for her address. Skype is also a good way (so you can actually see her face). If she asks you why you want it, get a little flirty and say that you want to talk to her more often. Don't make this sound creepy, though!

, Don't go all-out and flirt with her constantly. Act your age. Tell her jokes, even if they're cheesy. She'll probably laugh and think that you're funny. Smile at her. If you're really daring, and you think that she'll like it, wink at her. 

, It sounds hard, but girls know to put their friends before guys, so if you're mean to her friends, she probably won't like you back. Be nice to her friends, no matter how much you hate them. Chances are, if you're nice to them, they'll be nicer to you back. If you really can't be nice to them, tolerate them. Don't be mean to them. If you're nice to the girl's friends, she'll like you more. However, don't be too nice or she'll think you like them and not her. This will really upset her.

, Help her with her math homework, pick up some books that she dropped, open the door, or something else. Don't go way out of your comfort zone (or hers). This step should only be used if you know her well and she feels comfortable around you.

, If school dances are coming up, don't skip 'em! Ask if she's going. She will most likely go (girls love social things like dances). If she's going, you should go too. While you're there, ask her to dance. It will show her that you're into her. Slow dances are the best.

, This step is optional because for some guys, this is way out of your comfort zone, which is fine. If it's in your comfort zone, on her birthday or on Valentine's Day, give her something. It doesn't have to be huge, or cost you a fortune. Something like a pair of earrings, or even just a chocolate bar would work. It's so simple, yet it tells her that you really care about her.

, Again, if this is totally out of your comfort zone, don't do it. If it is in your comfort zone, occasionally lightly touch her shoulder or hand, or brush your foot or leg against hers. If she reacts well, that's a good sign. If not, stop doing it.

, This is probably out of yours or her comfort zone.

, If you're not allowed to date yet, do not go out with her behind your parent's backs. If they find out you're in major trouble. If you are allowed to date, go up to her when she's alone, and say something like this, ""Hey , I really like you and I was just wondering if you wanted to go out with me?"" Don't worry if she says no she will do it nicely.

, Just be observant. Don't make eyes at a girl if you know she is taken, or if you are, but if you ask a friend if she's single, that friend will immediately go up to your crush and start rumors. You don't want to cause any unnecessary drama. Keep it to yourself. Don't tell anyone!

If you are going to get her interested, it's going to be because she sees something deep inside you that intrigues her. Don't copy other kids or mime other fads; be comfortable about who you are and your confidence will reward you. Girls like guys who are unique but confident, who march to the beat of their own drum.


Don't act like you're desperate. Girls like attention, but they dislike guys who are needy and desperate. A large portion of girls are afraid to ask out guys, so show you like her, but don't go overboard. Don't make her your one and only focus, or it will seem too obvious.
Don't show off. A lot of guys think this is a good thing to do, but it's not the right approach. The problem with showing off is that the girl could think you're too cocky or obsessed with yourself. It's okay to do things you're good at, but don't go out there trying to get her attention.
Be casual. Don't stress out about trivial things like ""I hope she will like my shirt!"" Just play it cool, and be nice to her. Girls like guys who act natural and go with the flow. If you're having trouble keeping your composure around her, think of her as a friend instead of a romantic interest. Don't be awkward. Don't be like "" Hey baby "" or anything like that.;
, Maybe you think that she likes a certain kind of guy, like rocker or preppy guys. While she may have a preference, it's not worth it to ""become"" that kind of guy. Better to simply groom yourself, look presentable, and treat your body with care. If you do these things, it won't matter what you look like to her. Your appearance lures her in; your personality makes her stay.


Shower, wash your face and wash your hair regularly. Shower every day, wash your face twice a day and wash your hair every other day. If you are starting to have pimples, see a dermatologist. Pay attention to how your hair looks, even if you go for a messier look.
Don't overwhelm her with cologne or body spray. Commercials are misleading: Girls want you to be odorless, not smell like a ripe peach or mountain spray. Don't worry about cologne or body spray. If you wash regularly, a simple deodorant will do the trick.
Get in shape if you need to. If you need to lose a few pounds, then put in the work: Find some form of exercise that works for you. Swimming, running, or cycling is all good options. Even walking 15 minutes each day is a good start. But whatever you do, don't OVERDO it. She doesn't exactly want the Incredible Hulk as her boyfriend.
Start eating healthy. Instead of fatty burgers and sweets, start incorporating a healthy amount of vegetables, fruits, and protein into your diet. Not only will you feel better, you'll start looking better, too.

, Girls in real life don't like the cocky player you see in the movies and on TV. Or if they do, they quickly realize they can't have a real relationship with him once they get close. A girl who's worth chasing wants a nice guy who respects her. Be kind, be polite, be gentle. These things help relationships grow, and make girls want to be around you more.


Be a gentleman. Don't get gushy with her, and don't crack jokes about her body. Let her see that you're a decent, respectful guy with manners and class. Open the door in front of her and others. Give advice and guidance to those who want it. Only say things about people you'd be comfortable with saying to their face.
Stick up for her. If she's put in a hairy situation — a fight or an argument — be there to break up the fight or offer support. Stand up for her if someone says something nasty about her; do this with other people you care about, too.
Be generous. Don't think that you're the center of the universe. Be there to offer a helping hand to other people, and word will soon spread that you care about making a difference. Think about volunteering, giving blood, or running for charity.

, The great thing about love is that it makes you want to be a better person. Not just for her sake, but for your own sake, too. Being in love will give you a lot of motivation to take some of your mistakes or flaws and starting working to make them less noticeable or better.


If you have a temper, cool it down. Girls don't like guys who suddenly blow up and cause a scene without warning. Be aware of what sets you off, and try to avoid it. As hard as it is, do the opposite of what you normally do when you get frustrated.
Work on your conversation skills. If you plan on impressing her, you're going to need to have multiple conversations with her. Work on good conversation topics, good questions, interesting/funny stories, and calming your nerves when you're around her.
Learn a skill that no one in your class has, then do it when you are around her. Don't be a showoff about it. Pretend that you are showing it to your friends. Some good ideas for skills are magic tricks, juggling, and being able to play an instrument. It really doesn't matter which. It will show your personality in whichever you choose.
Pursue some other hobby or interest. The world is really fascinating, and there's a lot to learn. To keep yourself a little distracted, it's a good idea to get involved in extracurriculars like engineering, poker, or ancient history. When she learns how much you know about your hobby, she'll definitely be impressed.

, You have to have some momentum when you ask her out, so work on developing that first. It's like racing: You have to rev your engine a little bit to warm it up before you take off. It's the same with girls: Look at the signals, build a comfortable relationship with her, and then ask her out.


Be observant. Don't make eyes at a girl if you know she is taken, or if you have another girlfriend. Remember, if you ask a friend if she's single, that friend will immediately go up to your crush and start rumors. You don't want to cause any unnecessary drama. Keep it to yourself for now.
Look at her body language. See if she looks at you during class or talks to you more than usual. These signs mean she might already like you. If so, good for you! If one hand is fidgeting with her hair or she looks down at her feet bashfully, that's a good sign. Here are some other signs she might like you:

She giggles or laughs at things you say, even if they aren't exactly funny.
She keeps constant eye contact with you when you're talking to each other.
She tickles or touches you when she talks to you.
She asks you to do her favors, like hold her backpack in between classes or hold her place in line.



, Think of her as a friend that you like; it will be easier to talk to her, and less awkward. Plus, you will get a chance to get to know her. Girls need to be able to trust guys, and winning her friendship will help you get that trust from her. Be there for her when she needs it and doesn't expect anything back in return.


Spend time with her. Ask her to help you with a problem. If you sit next to her, it will be easier to get her attention. Ask her for help, making eye contact all the way. Perhaps compliment her, but only after she helps you. For example, if she helps with a math problem, say, ""Wow, you're really quick!"" or ""Thanks, you're really good at this!""
Help her out when she needs help. If she asks you to do something, that's usually a pretty good sign that she's interested in you.
Keep the attention on her face. Girls hate it when boys ""go perverted"" on them (paying too much attention to her body; a quick scan of her clothing is fine). Look into her eyes when she is talking. Don't stare at her or look at her in a suspicious way. Treat her respectfully and like you would a friend.
Do things as a group. At first, try to involve her in group activities so that you really get to know one another. Do something with your boys and invite her and her girlfriends along. Go to the movies together, or the beach, or to a baseball game.

, Be careful with this one. Don't get all super nice with them, as she might get the idea you like them more than her, also don't tell her that you know someone else likes you, this could really upset her. But make an effort to get along with her friends and introduce her to your friends. This will go a long way in driving you two closer together.


Again the issue here is trust. If her friends like you, she's going to take more chances on you because she trusts her friends. If her friends know nothing about you, she's less likely to take a chance on you because she has no secondary evidence on you.
Get to know other girls. If you can't crack her group of friends and feel like they'll just end up disliking you for whatever reason, try to get friendly with other girls. Don't flirt or act suggestively around them. Just befriend them. This will show her that other girls, at least, get along with you.

, A little goes a long way here. Don't come on super strong, but be a little more deliberate about your gestures around her. Only start flirting with her once you've established some sort of friendship. If you haven't done this yet, flirting can be really difficult.


Try to get her to laugh or even smile. Most girls like boys with a sense of humor — not goofy slapstick, or fake laughing. It's always good if you can make her laugh. And don't be afraid to laugh along, or even laugh at yourself. A good sense of humor is key!
Compliment her on her hair, clothing, or smile. Again, don't make it obvious that you like her. Girls usually like being complimented. If she has already flirted with you, then you should compliment her back with something like, ""Wow, you have really pretty eyes,"" ""You really have beautiful hair,"" or ""Did you get a haircut?""

Keep the compliments PG. Don't compliment her feminine features, like her breasts or her butt. It's best to stay classy and respectful. Stick to complimenting her hair, clothing, eyes, or smile. Never ever think about sex when first meeting and talking to a girl. It will make you look weird.


Find out what makes her feel special. If a girl stresses about her looks, compliment her appearance. If she draws a lot, make her feel like a good painter. Customize what you say to her based on how she sees herself. If you reinforce the way she wants to be seen, you're making the right moves.

, If you two are talking, it's okay to reach out and touch her in a safe place to emphasize a point you're making. It's okay to lightly touch her hand, or her shoulder, or her back. If she likes you, this will send a thrill down her spine.


""Accidentally"" touch or brush against her shoulder, on the arm or hand (not body) when you're both looking at a project or something similar (or even when passing by in the hallway) and look at her with a smile. If she likes you, then when you make eye contact, she will smile and look away.

, You're trying to make an impression on her, but it's sometimes tough to get close to her while being respectful of her space. Don't overwhelm or smother her with your attention. You may think you're getting somewhere with her, but if she associates you with someone who is pesky and bothersome, that's definitely not a good thing.


Don't ask the same question twice. ""Your favorite color is green, right?” will not go down smoothly. Girls aren't dumb; they have memory. Try to stay away from short conversations with short answers. For example, don't ask ""Do you like ____?"", but ""Why"" and ""How"" questions - they are always good for a longer conversation. Start with a conversation you think she will be interested in. Don't interrupt when she's talking.
Maintain a little bit of mystery. Girls like a bit of mystery in a guy; they're obsessed with the strong/silent type if he's good looking. If he's not, he's probably going to have to use humor or intelligence to really get to her. Regardless, don't be an open book. Don't tell her everything you're doing. Don't be available all the time. Humans are drawn to things we don't fully understand.

, If she starts wearing perfume and cuter clothes, she tries talking to you more, etc., then she definitely likes you. Tell her she's looking great. Compliment on her appearance. Girls try looking attractive for a reason. It's helpful to reward her effort with compliments, increased attention, or even a date.

, The next step in your relationship has come: You're pretty sure she likes you, and you want to take the next move. Find a nice, relatively isolated place to ask her (away from friends and distractions). Make sure there's nothing distracting about your appearance. Remember to be confident. Remember, the girl expects you to take the initiative and ask her.


You don't have to call it a ""date."" When you ask her, try to stay casual about it. If she asks you whether you're asking her out on a date, you can say yes, but calling it a date might unnecessarily scare her. Here are some ways to ask her:

""Hey, so that movie we were talking about last week? I got a couple tickets to it, would you want to go together on Friday?""
""Hi, so I know the state fair is pretty lame. But my friend has a booth and I'm thinking about going. Would you want to brave it together?""
""Hey there. I was thinking about going to the football game when they play on Friday. Do you want to go with me?""



, Asking her out is an art, not a science. But there's a couple things that you can do to ensure that you give yourself the best chance to impress her and successfully get that date.


Practice your lines beforehand. Try it in a mirror if you have one. Practicing your lines will help you feel more confident when it comes time to actually ask her. Plus, you won't be as likely to stutter or flub your lines. Making sure your question comes out as smoothly as possible is important.
Ask her in person, not text. Text is certainly an easier way to ask her out, but it's not nearly as effective. The problem with text is that it's easier for her to say no to you, because she doesn't have to deal with your emotional reaction directly, in person. So be sure to be there in person when you ask her; you'll have a lot more success.
If you can't find the courage to directly ask her out, then don't ask a friend to do it in your stead. She might think it's a joke and not really consider it. Wait a little while if you can't rack up the courage. The closer you get, the easier it will be to finally ask her.

, You don't want to be bawling your heart out if she doesn't say ""yes."" If, for whatever reason, she says she has plans and can't go, leaving it at that, that means that you've done all that you can. Don't get too down on yourself; suck up your pride, tell her it's alright, and walk off as confidently as possible.


Make sure you don't ""beg"" for her to reconsider right after you were rejected. Begging won't help; you can't will someone to like you just like that. Begging her is also bad because it might wreck any chance you had with her later when she decides she likes you.
If she says ""yes,"" remember to ask for her phone number and give out your own. You want to be able to call her and occasionally text her. Don't text or call her all the time; text or call her once to hammer out the details of the date and then only text her occasionally.

, A date is where you get to know each other better and start possibly getting intimate. For the first date, take her someplace where there are people around, but where there's also distractions. The movies, the zoo, the mall, the pool are all great choices. If you're extra confident that you can hold a conversation for a long while, park or a restaurant.


Pay for her. Whether it's tickets for the movies, admission to the zoo, or food at a restaurant, you want to demonstrate that you're a gentleman and that you're generous. Paying for her is also a good way to tell her it's a date (without actually telling her), if she doesn't already know.
Don't grab onto her immediately. Give her some personal space. If you're at the movies, wait a little bit to put your arm around her; if you're walking somewhere, wait a little bit to start holding her hand. Your patience will be rewarded: Once she gets comfortable, she'll be more willing to respond to your affection.
Smile, relax, and pay attention to what she says. Show her you're happy being with her by smiling. Don't be too nervous when you're on the date; she's probably just as nervous as you are! Finally, pay attention to what she says. This will help you make conversation with her that is informed, interesting, and lasting. If the date goes well, you've accomplished all your goals — she definitely likes you!

, Don't try to be sporty, geeky, hipster, etc. if you're not. On the other hand, be as much of the person you really are so that she accepts you as yourself.

Improve your physique.",How to Get a Girl if You're Short1," There’s no substitute for confidence. When you walk into a room, hold your head high and put a little swagger in your step. Acting self-assured shows that you have a lot going for you and you’re not hung up on being a little more compact than the people around you.In order to feel bigger, it can also help to sound bigger. Use a clear, assertive tone when you speak instead of acting shy or murmuring softly.
If you don’t treat your shortness like a big deal, chances are no one else will either.;
, Practice good posture and avoid slouching. Draw your shoulders back, push your chest forward and raise your chin up. You should also find something better to do with your hands than stick them in your pockets, which can cause your shoulders to droop and make you look self-conscious.It’s all about creating a presence—by holding yourself as though you were the tallest person in the room, you’ll have an influence over the way other people see you.Poor posture can actually play up shortness, which is the opposite of the effect you’re going for.

, Remember, it's what's inside that really counts. Instead of simply wishing you were taller, make your worth visible in other ways. For instance, you could play up your accomplishments at school or work, or describe a fascinating hobby of yours that will help you stand out from the crowd.Always wear a warm smile. It will make you more approachable.Being friendly will take you a lot further than just being a certain height. Girls want to spend time with people they can feel comfortable around.

Dressing well can help you cut a more appealing image.Vertical stripes and patterns are also a smart choice, as they make the eye move up and down.Steer clear of baggy, oversized clothes that have a tendency to bunch up. You’ll look even smaller if you’re swallowed up by your outfit.
Thick-soled shoes or boots will raise you up a little, which can help you get noticed when socializing.

, You might be able to make your short stature less noticeable by building a healthier, more proportioned body. Put in some time at the gym doing cardio and lifting light weights to increase your muscle mass, and make sure you’re eating a balanced diet. A well-developed physique will draw attention away from the fact that your interest has a few inches on you.Get good at a sport or some other discipline that’s physically impressive, like dancing.
Be careful not to bulk up too much, or it could end up making you look stocky. Putting on massive amounts of muscle may also give the impression that you’re trying to compensate."

I mean, you probably don't want a really ugly girl to be your girlfriend, but you also don't want to get the hottest girl either. Be wise about who you choose.;
, If you're shy, try just walking up to her and saying ""Hi!"" at lunch or in the hall. If she's hanging out with her friends try to at least talk to her or try to catch her eye while walking past. If you know her to have a sense of humor try to say something that will make her laugh.

, You should shower a lot and DO NOT put too much cologne on. You may think it smells good but it may be a little strong and the girl might be scared to go around you.

, If she tries to flirt, that's a good sign. She likes you too. Don't try to ask her out right there though. She might say no because she just started liking you.

, Ask her if she has a phone. If she says yes ask her for her phone number.

, If she says yes then ask her if she wants to go to the movies. If she says no then ask if it was awkward for her. That will cool her off. She will probably laugh and say kinda.

Don’t rely on online dating.",How to Get a Girl if You're Short2," There’s no way to change how tall you are, and the sooner you make peace with that reality, the better off you’ll be. But that doesn’t mean you have to hide your face in shame. Your height is just one of many features. Remember that you have plenty more to offer than just the way you look.Insecurity can lead to bashfulness or defensive behavior, both of which may be unattractive to girls., One simple solution is to go after girls that are around the same height as you. That way, there will be no need to bring up the topic while you’re getting to know her, and no awkward hugs or dances later on. You’ll be able to look her in the eye without constantly feeling like she’s towering over you.Since you won’t be intimidated by someone in the same height range, you’ll be able to focus on enjoying yourself.While height may be something you consider when playing the field, you shouldn’t judge people on their physical characteristics alone. Take the time to really get to know the girls that you’re interested in.

, Most girls are drawn to fun, lighthearted personalities. Whereas tall guys are a dime a dozen, finding someone who can make her laugh isn’t nearly as common. Having a good sense of humor is a far better selling point than simply being a little taller.Don’t hesitate to make a quip about how you have trouble reaching the top shelf or need platform shoes to drive when the situation calls for it. Saying something like ""I'm so short you can see my feet in my driver's license photo"" can really help to break the ice.
If you let your height become a source of frustration or embarrassment, it may cause you to come off as bitter around other people., Many users on dating apps and websites list preferences for physical traits like height, weight and hair and eye color.

You may feel like everyone around you has had a ton of experience and that you’re the only one who is lacking in that department, but the truth of the matter is, everyone always feels like he or she could use more experience, and you shouldn’t let your lack of experience keep you from pursuing any girls you’d like to pursue.


If you’re feeling self-conscious about it, get advice from a friend who has a bit more experience dating girls. You’ll see that there’s nothing to be scared about.
Remember that even guys who have been dating girls for years often feel clueless or at a loss; relationships are growing, ever-evolving things, and there won’t be a magical moment when you suddenly “get it”.
While you don’t need to lie about having had a girlfriend, you don’t need to broadcast it, either. That may just make you feel self-conscious.;
, If you’ve never had a girlfriend, then you may be nervous about wanting to find someone as soon as you can, but the truth is, you’re far better off waiting for the right girl to come along than in rushing into a relationship with a girl you don’t really like. Look for a girl that you may be compatible with, who you think is an interesting person that you’d actually like to get to know. You may not know the girl that well, but if you get a good feeling every time you’re around her, then there may be something there.


It’s a good idea to go for someone who you can see yourself really starting a relationship with. That said, you don’t need to be so picky that you’re only willing to ask a girl out if she seems like she can be your soul mate.
Don't focus as much on looks. Of course, you may want to have a pretty girl, but it doesn't have to look like some supermodel or something like that. Try to be more realistic and be more open minded about girls that wear glasses, are a little chubby, have acne, very tall or very short, are tomboyish, have tattoos, piercings, and hair dye, etc. These traits are more your average person on the street and not somebody off of TV or a magazine. The more attractive girls want a more traditional male and you may be more non traditional than most males so you might want to broaden your horizons for girls.
Try to find a common interests. If you like sports, join an intramural sports team or go to local sporting events. If you like music, go to concerts or join the band or orchestra. If you like books, go to the library or a bookstore. The internet is excellent for finding people with more obscure interests.

, Standing out doesn’t mean screaming at the top of your lungs or playing a banjo outside your school. It just means being proud of the things that make you different, whether it’s your love for science fiction or your soccer skills. Work on doing what you love and let the girl you like see you in your element. She’ll be impressed that you have so much to offer and that you’re happy doing your own thing instead of blending in with the crowd.


Don’t be afraid to be a little bit goofy or silly if that’s who you are. You don’t have to act like a macho man or a standoffish bro to get a girl’s attention.

, Don’t be shy. Just say hi to the girl, introduce yourself, and start a nice, easy conversation. You don’t need to ask her a million questions about herself right away and should work on starting a light, easy conversation on simple topics like your classes, your weekend plans, a movie you both saw, or your favorite band. The most important thing is that you make eye contact and care about what she has to say.


You don’t have to start a deep conversation with her. Just ask how she’s doing, smile, try to make her laugh, and take the pressure off.
You can talk to her at a time when you know you’ll only have a few minutes, like in between classes. This will help make you less nervous because you won’t feel like you need to keep the conversation going for a long time.

, If you want to get her attention, then you should work on having a great conversation and then leaving just when things are getting good. That way, she’ll be more excited to talk to you the next time, because she’ll feel like you have so much more to talk about. If you linger around too long, even though you’ve both run out of things to say, then she’ll feel like you won’t have much to say the next time around, either.


This doesn’t mean you should leave abruptly. Just say you’ve had a great time talking to her and that you look forward to picking up your conversation later.
You don’t have to tell her you have to go because you’re late to your Aunt Bertha’s birthday party, either. It’s okay to keep things a little bit mysterious.

, When you first start talking to a girl you like, giving her a nice, simple compliment that shows you’re paying attention can help win her over. If you’ve noticed she got a new haircut or is wearing a new dress, tell her you like it without making her too embarrassed. If she’s wearing a unique piece of jewelry and you even think she might have made it herself, you can compliment it and ask where she got it. If you’ve noticed really cool artwork on her notebooks, you can compliment her artistic talents and strike up a conversation about that, too.


Don’t say anything about her figure or she may get embarrassed or will take it the wrong way. But there’s nothing wrong with saying something as simple as, “That’s a funky sweater.”

, If you want to get the girl’s attention, then you have to be able to show her that you’re a confident guy who is happy with who he is. This may feel like a challenge when you don’t have much experience with girls, but you can build your way up to it. Don’t let your lack of experience make you lose confidence, and work on having the feeling that you’re a fun, smart, cool guy who has a lot to offer.


Stand tall, look her in the eye, and talk about all of the things you love in your life to show her that you’re a confident guy who is worth knowing. When it comes to having confidence, there’s something to be said for faking it until you make it.
Build up confidence can take a long time, but you can make an effort to address your flaws and learn to accept the things you can’t change about yourself little by little.
Another way to develop your confidence is to make sure to spend time with people who actually make you feel good about yourself. If your friends are always putting you down, then it’s time to consider finding a new group of people who are more supportive.

, One way to keep the girl’s attention is to show that you actually want to get to know her. You don’t want her to think that you’re only talking to her because you think she’s pretty or because you’re looking for a girlfriend. Take the time to get to know her by asking her questions about what her interests are, how her day is going, and whatever else is on her mind. Here are some things you can ask her about:


Her hobbies
Her pets
Her favorite bands, movies, TV shows, or actors
Her friendships
Her favorite places to visit
Her holiday plans

, If you want to keep the girl’s attention, then you have to show her that you care without making her feel overwhelmed. If you want her to be interested in you, then she has to feel like she stands out to you. Work on giving her a little extra attention compared to the other girls around, and on spending more time by her side when you can. Smile at her and make eye contact when you see her so she knows that she stands out to you.


If she’s obviously having a bad day, come up to her and ask her what’s wrong. Let her see that you’re not just planning on being there during the good times.
When you’re in a group or alone with her, flirt with her a little. Be playful, give her a gentle push on the arm or shoulder, and tease her in a friendly way. Take pleasure in making her laugh and let her see that you really do care without being too forward.

, You have to work on striking a balance between letting the girl see how much she means to you and not overwhelming her. You can’t be around all the time, call her every day, or be at her side every time she turns around, or she’ll want a break from you. Be around just enough to make things interesting while leaving her guessing and keeping her on her toes, too.


If you’re in a group setting, it’s nice to give her some extra attention, but that doesn’t mean you have to single her out too much, either. Talking to other girls will show that you’re less intense and open to being social with more people.
If you have her number, you shouldn’t always be the one who calls or texts her. Put the ball in her court, sometimes.

, If you want the girl to stay interested, then you have to make her see that you’re willing to put in the effort. You should go out of your way to do something nice for her, whether you help her with a school project, offer to help her fix her bike, or pick up her homework for her if she’s home sick from school. Making an effort to make her smile and to make her life easier will make her feel like you really do care.


You can even help her carry her books to class if her load is too heavy. Make sure she welcomes this kind of help, though.
You can help her out as long as you make sure she doesn’t take advantage of you. You want her to see you as a potential boyfriend, not as an errand boy.

, You don’t want to treat the girl as just a pretty face or arm candy. Let her see that you really care about her as a person and that you want to know what she thinks. You can ask her opinion on something that happened on the news, about a discussion you had in class, or about a book you’ve both read or a movie you both saw. Let her see that you really care about what goes on inside her head and that you want to know what she’s thinking, and she’ll be more charmed by you.


If you need advice about something, even if it’s just a question of what to wear to the school dance or more of a serious matter, like how to confront your friend about something he did wrong, turning to the girl you like can make her see that you really do value her opinion.
Make sure you don’t ramble on and on about topics like politics or music without stopping to ask her how she actually feels about it.

, Another way to build a connection with a girl is to find something that you have in common so you have more to talk about. As you get to know her more, you may find that you have more in common than you think, whether you both love Drake or whether you’re into learning to cook. As long as you have one or two things in common, you can work on building a relationship around your mutual interest for those things. If you don’t have much in common, though, don’t worry; you can always develop common interests as you get to know each other better.


Don’t be nervous about finding something you have in common right away. As you get to know the girl more, you’ll naturally find something.
You may not have many interests in common, but you can share other things, such as a similar background or a similar disposition.

, As you start to like the girl more and more, it’s only natural that you’ll both want to spend more time together. While you won’t be together every second, you should find ways to see her more, whether you walk to your classes together, sit near each other in the cafeteria, or even hang out at the mall or at a playground after school. Make an effort to see her more so you can spend more time getting to know each other, and you’ll have a better sense of whether or not she would be the girlfriend you’re looking for.


There’s no magical amount of time that you need to spend with the girl before you ask her to be your girlfriend. If you want to ask her after spending just a week together, that’s fine, too, as long as you’ve had some time to get to know each other.
You also don’t want to reach the point where you’ve spent months hanging out with her and haven’t asked her out. This may be leading you straight to the Friend Zone, and it can be tricky to get out of that.

, If you’re ready to take the next step with the girl you’ve found and want to ask her to be your girlfriend, then you should be a little bit thoughtful about it to improve your chances of getting a yes. Find a nice, quiet place where you’re not likely to be interrupted, and make sure she’s in a good mood and doesn’t have anywhere to rush off to, either. Ask her if she has a few minutes and make the most of your time together when you ask her to be yours.


If you’ve never really been alone with the girl before, then try to ask her in a private place, but don’t go out of your way to isolate her.
Before you ask her to meet you, try to check her mood. Make sure she seems happy, focused, and not stressed out.

, Don’t be nervous about it. After saying hi to her and making just a little bit of small talk, you can ask her to be your girlfriend as honestly and directly as possible. You can say something as simple as, “I really like spending time with you and would love to get to know you better. Will you be my girlfriend?” The sooner you ask her, the more relief you’ll feel.


Move a bit closer toward her and look her in the eyes when you ask. She’ll be impressed with your confidence.
You can compliment her a bit before you ask, but don’t lay it on too thick. You don’t want to make her uncomfortable.

, If she says yes to you, then great! You can celebrate, give her a hug, and let her see how excited you are by her good news. However, if she says she’d just like to be friends, there’s no need to be rude or mean. Instead, just be polite and respectful and keep your head up as you make sure to part on good terms. This will leave her with a good impression of you, and you can be proud of yourself for responding in a dignified manner.


If she does say she wants to be your girlfriend, let her see how happy this makes you. You don’t have to play it cool if you really do like her.
If she says no, don’t insult her or be mean to her. Treat her with respect, knowing that she really can’t help her feelings.

, If you and the girl have agreed to date each other, then you can work on taking it slow and really making the effort to get to know one another. You can keep things interesting by doing new things together, whether you make enchiladas together or take a snorkeling class, while also making time to do the things you love together regularly. The most important thing is that you never stop letting her see how much she means to you.


Don’t ever take your girlfriend for granted. You should always try to add some romance to the relationship, compliment her, and let her know how special she is.
Don’t let your lack of experience keep you from enjoying your relationship. There’s no need to worry about it and all you can do is focus on the present moment and enjoy every second with your girlfriend that you can.

However, it does mean that you should avoid wearing dirty or smelly clothing. The style can be whatever you feel suits you best. Just make sure that it is clean and not too worn out.Remember that it is important to be yourself. Choose the clothes that you feel your best in. No matter how you dress, you can still make sure that your clothes are clean and fresh-smelling.;
, You probably aren’t going to attract anyone if you don’t take good care of your hygiene. There are a lot of things you can do to improve your hygiene, and doing so will improve your confidence in yourself.Shower at least once a day. Showering daily will wash away any dirt, germs, and/or bacteria that has accumulated during the day. This will also help you stay fresh-smelling.
Brush your teeth at least two times per day. Carry a pack of sugar-free gum with you, and chew a piece after each meal. This will help keep your breath fresh and your teeth healthy.
Wear deodorant. It can be an easy thing to forget, but wearing deodorant will help you avoid the embarrassment of body odor. If you do a lot of sports and other physically active things, have some deodorant in your bag to put on beforehand.

, This doesn’t mean you have to look a certain way (e.g. preppy). It just means that you should put some effort into taking care of your hair and skin. Wash your face and apply moisturizer to keep it looking healthy and radiant.


You don’t necessarily need to wash your hair every single day but make sure that you wash it when it gets dirty and/or looks greasy.

, A smart girl will quickly see through any attempts to show off or act tough. Instead, just be who you are. Being able to be comfortable in your own skin does take some work, but most people really appreciate someone who is genuinely themselves.Sometimes it can be difficult to act naturally in front of someone we have a crush on, but just do your best. For example, if you are really involved in one of your school's clubs, don’t get out of it just because you heard she doesn’t think it's cool.
You can also be true to yourself by standing up for yourself. For example, if someone dares you to do something bold in front of your crush, but you don’t really want to do it, then don’t. This will show your crush that you’re mature enough to say “no” to something in spite of what others might think of you.
If you are being yourself and the smart girl you had your eye on isn’t interested, try to remind yourself that this isn’t an indication that you aren’t a good person. It may just be that you aren’t her type.

, You might think that the best way to attract a smart girl is to be tough and intimidating to those around you. However, unless that is really who you are, it probably isn’t the case. Instead, show her that you are a kind person. If she sees you being kind to others, she may start to think of you in a different way than she did before.For example, don’t allow someone to be a bully to someone that usually gets picked on.
Help out people whenever you can. This can be small things. Help someone pick up their things if they drop them.
Don’t make jokes at other people’s expense. This shows that you aren’t clever enough to make people laugh without using someone else.

, It’s important to understand that being confident does not at all mean being arrogant. Instead being confident means showing others that you feel good about yourself and who you are.There are lots of ways to show that you are confident. For example, you can use confident body language. Make eye contact with others, smile, and keep your body language open and inviting. Stand with your arms at your side, your posture straight, and your chin up.
Another way to display confidence is by speaking slowly and calmly. When you are talking to someone you are interested in, your natural reaction might be to talk more quickly than you naturally would. Try to notice how fast you are speaking, and slow it down a bit. This doesn’t mean that you should speak unnaturally slow, but rather that you should avoid talking so fast that she will have a hard time understanding you.Everyone experiences a lack of confidence at some point or another. This is OK, practice pretending that you are confident whenever you are struggling.

, When you are around her, show an interest in the things she likes and the things that are important to her. This will show her that you are genuine and not self-centered.For example, if she is talking about a movie that she really loves, ask her why she loves it. Don’t just nod and say “cool.”
If there is a particular subject she is interested in, ask her what makes her so passionate about it. For example, if she is passionate about animal welfare, you could say, “It’s really awesome that you work so hard for animal rights. What got you so interested in helping in the first place?” Not only will you show her that you care, you will also learn something new about her.

, A smart girl will probably want to be with someone who is also intelligent. This doesn’t mean you have to be a genius, but it does mean that you have to be able to keep up with her. When having a conversation with her, talk to her about the things that interest you and the dreams that you hope to accomplish.For example, if you are a huge fan of baseball, talk to her about why you enjoy it so much. For example, you can say, “My dad taught me about baseball when I was very little, and it is something that we’ve been enjoying together my entire life.” Don’t be afraid to be open about your life with her.
If you aren’t able to think of something that interests you, and you don’t have any dreams, then you should probably take the time to figure out who you are before worrying about attracting someone.
If you want to attract a smart girl, you’ll have to keep them interested. This means that you’ll really have to put in the effort when it comes to talking to them. They won’t find you very interesting if all you can talk about is the last football game you saw on TV.

, When asking a girl out, especially if she is smart, you’ll probably want to ask her when she is alone. This is because a smart girl probably won’t enjoy being put on the spot. Asking her alone will give her a bit more space to think about how she wants to respond. It will also show that you are thoughtful, and want to be respectful.If you’re having a hard time getting her alone, try casually asking her if you can talk to her alone for a minute. For example, if you have a class with her, try saying “Hey , do you have a minute after class today? I wanted to talk to you about something.”
Keep it light when you bring this up or she might get worried about what you want to talk about. For example, when you ask her to talk later, you can add in, “Don’t worry! It’s nothing bad or a big deal at all, I just need to ask you about something.” Keep your tone upbeat and happy.

, If you know there is something she is particularly interested in, try to make that into a date. You might get by going with a more traditional date idea (e.g. going to the movies), but a smart girl will be really impressed if you can come up with something out of the ordinary.


For example, if she is really interested in art, see if there are any art shows or museum exhibitions in your area that you could take her to.
If she is really into classical music, look to see if there is a symphony in your area.
When you ask her out, try showing her that you really thought about it. For example, say, “I know you’re a big fan of Van Gogh and I heard there is an exhibition at the museum this weekend. I’d love to take you if you’d like to go with me. Maybe we can grab some food afterward. What do you think?”

, Unfortunately, the hard truth is that you might get rejected. If you do, do your best to hide your disappointment. You will come off more confident and mature if you are able to say, “Oh, alright. Well, I understand. Have a nice a day!” than if you fly into a rage.If she says something like, “Oh, I have a boyfriend, I’m sorry” or “I’m not really interested in dating anyone right now,” you might feel tempted to backpedal and act like you weren’t actually asking her out. Don’t do this. It will only make you look insecure.
Of course, she might also say, “yes.” This is great news, but you should still try to keep your cool. Don’t start jumping up and down for joy. Instead, smile and say, “That’s great! What time should I pick you up?” You don’t want to give her the impression that you were convinced she would say no, even if you were.

, If you think you’re not quite ready to go straight to asking her out, try suggesting doing something together that doesn’t sound like going out on a date. This will give you a chance to spend time together, but will take some of the pressure off because it won’t actually be a date.


This will also give you a good chance to gauge her interest in you. When you are together, pay attention to the way she behaves. Is she behaving in a way that makes it seems as though she is interested? For example, is she making a lot of eye contact, laughing at everything you say, and casually touching your arm or your shoulder? If so, there is a good chance she is attracted to you.
Asking to study for an important test together is a good way to hang out and do something productive without making it seem like it is a date.

Talent and success are both attractive qualities. Getting more involved with something you’re good at can help you get noticed and acknowledged by others.;
, Shower every day. Choose a mild soap and make sure to wash all areas of your body, including under your fingernails. Keep your nails well-trimmed. Use deodorant or antiperspirant. Avoid bad breath by practicing good oral health. Make sure to wear clean clothing, including socks.Opt for cotton clothing if you have a tendency to sweat a lot.
You may want to wash your face up to twice per day. Shave as needed.
If you show up to classes well-groomed, you’ll probably feel better about yourself and attract more girls.

, Aim to dress maturely instead of boyishly. Wear classic pieces instead of splurging on what’s trendy. Dress appropriately for your climate. Wear what makes you feel good about yourself.For example, don’t buy oversized jeans just because they may be currently in fashion. You’ll feel more confident in well-fitted pants than if you’re constantly having to pull up your sagging jeans.
Consider wearing a polo shirt instead of a t-shirt.
Choose clothing that reflects the colors and necessary warmth of the season.

, Don’t mumble. Talk loudly enough to be heard. Don’t be afraid to give your opinion, but think about the impact of what you’re going to say first.For example, don’t compare a girl to someone you were in a previous relationship with.
Talking just for the sake of talking shows nervousness. Try asking yourself before you speak, “Is this the truth? Is it nice to say? Is it important to say?”, Smile, which shows that you’re positive and approachable! Keep your posture straight. Avoid fidgeting, which can make you appear nervous.Positive body language helps others relate to you and respect you.
If you’re having trouble with slouching, practice keeping your back straight against a wall or a chair.

, Nod, make eye contact, and stay focused on what a girl is talking to you about. Try to understand her emotions and point of view. Imagine how she feels as she speaks, and react accordingly.


Teen boys who empathize with their female peers are more likely to have girlfriends.For example, if she’s upset, hear her out. Then try saying, “I’m sorry that happened to you.”

, Think of ways you can connect with each other. Make conversation about school or hobbies. Try asking her questions about herself, which will show you’re interested in what she thinks.Teen relationships often start with friendship.If you’ve spoken to her before, try asking if you can add her as a friend on a social networking site.
If you’ve never spoken to her before, try asking her about a class, mutual friend, or after-school activity.
Try asking, “What type of music do you like?”, Notice something about a girl that you can give her a positive comment on. Don’t make something up; put thought into noticing something she’s put effort into. Then offer a sincere, heartfelt compliment.


Try saying, “Your hair looks great today.”
If you’ve witnessed her playing a sport or creating art in a class, you can compliment her on that.

, Make kind gestures whenever possible. Open doors for people. Offer your help when it may be appreciated, whether it’s with carrying something or studying.For example, offer to help a girl with putting her coat on.
If you see a girl carrying something bulky, try saying, “I can carry that for you.”
If you see a girl struggling with a school subject you understand, help explain it to them or offer to study together.

Be her knight in shining armor!,
Be yourself.",How to Attract a Smart Girl in High School (for Boys)," Is she outdoorsy or refined? What's her favorite color? Her favorite band? Book? Movie? If you can't answer these questions, you don't know enough about her. This is an easy fix: learn! Ask her if she's heard, seen, or read anything good lately. Pay attention to her mannerisms and likes or dislikes. Find common interests and build on them to learn more about her.;
, Sorry, guys, but usually smart girls like smart guys. Study a lot and work hard to be in honors or AP classes. This not only helps you be more attractive, but also you'll get the chance to hang out with her more, since there are usually fewer people in honors and AP classes and you see the same people throughout the day. Plus, it'll help you get a good job or get into college in the long run!

, Shower at least once daily, but twice is best - once before school and once before bed. Wash your body, your hair, and your face. Use soap with a clean, manly scent: try Irish Spring for outdoorsy girls, and Dove Men's for the more refined. For your face, try a cleanser suited to your skin type to keep your skin fresh and clean. Try to keep the acne and zits to a minimum with an anti-acne cleanser and a Salicylic acid or Benzoyl peroxide cream for spot treatment. Keep your hair clean and non-greasy with a good shampoo. Brush your hair and keep it nicely cut, but no gels or styling products are necessary.

, Watch the news or C-SPAN, read the newspaper or CNN - knowledge is power. Current events are great conversation starters (""Did you hear about that drought in Arizona? Wow!""). It's easier than ever to keep informed nowadays; get a CNN Update or NY Times app on your phone, which will send popup messages whenever something of note happens.

, Is there an independent film at your local movie theatre? Go see it! An Indie single on iTunes? Take a listen! See as many movies as possible and hone your taste in music and books. It'll help to make connections with girls, whether they like films, music, or books. Maybe you can even give her a few suggestions!

, Girls love a guy who knows his Shakespeare! Try memorizing a few of your favorite lines (or even a whole scene!) so that you can whip it out and impress a girl, should the opportunity come. Try purchasing a few of the classics at a bookstore like Barnes and Noble (now in hardcover versions, which look great on your bookshelf or out in public - she'll be sure to notice it). Charles Dickens, RL Stevenson, Mark Twain, Lewis Carroll, and Arthur Conan Doyle are all great classic authors.

, It's a fact: girls like kind guys! Be a good person overall - volunteer more, work harder, and be nice. Don't talk bad about people behind their backs; that's rude and catty, two very unattractive traits. Help out at the local animal shelter, tutor the kid in your math class who's having trouble, or show the new kid around.

, The way to a man's heart may be through his stomach, but the way to a woman's is through her funny bone! Even a bad joke shows a girl that you're at least trying. But remember: keep it clean! Entertain her with funny stories during lunch, or draw cute pictures on her notes during a teacher's lecture. That time you made her spray milk out of her nose? She'll remember it forever.

, ""Nice guys finish last""? Nah, not really! Chivalry is alive and well. Pull out her chair for her, hold open the door, and be polite. She'll appreciate the attention! Always be kind and considerate around her parents and friends. Try not to use foul language, and never, ever make crude or vulgar comments. A lewd, loudmouthed oaf never gets the girl!

, Do you love movies? Are you a Harry Potter addict? Is travelling the world your dream? Whatever your passion is, follow it. A girl isn't worth giving up what makes you, you.

Understanding will also help you to connect with her and find common ground between her beliefs and your own. What it means to be gothic might change from group to group and region to region, but there are three basic components to goth culture: the social scene, the personality, and the music.The gothic social scene provides places for like minded individuals, in this case goths, to come together as a community and share ideas. This may include places like gothic coffee shops, clothing stores, thrift stores, clubs, fetish stores, music stores, and more.The gothic personality is usually identified by a strong sense of individualism that has a strong appreciation for the darker side of things, the supernatural, beauty and dark aesthetics, art, emotion, mystery, and drama.

Gothic music is a very important aspect in goth culture. Music serves as a focal point around which the social scene revolves. Gothic music tends to have an eerie or surreal tone. Gothic bands generally make use of lyrics that focus on gothic themes, such as the grotesque and the mysterious, and may also portray gothic styles, like wearing mostly black clothing.;
, There's no rule book stating you have to wear a certain style of clothing, behavior a certain way, or listen to a certain band to identify as a goth. There's no guarantee that all common goth features will apply to your gothic lady friend. However, by learning common goth features, you can prepare yourself to compliment parts of her appearance and personality that she's worked hard to cultivate. You might take note of and compliment her:


Style. This might include the cut, color, or kind of clothing she is wearing. Accessories, especially those that are prominent, should be complimented as well. Take special note of unique articles of clothing, like fishnets, capes, studded/spiked clothing, ankhs, chokers, and more.Makeup. Goths tend to appreciate the sharp contrast of black and white, and to this end will often wear light colored makeup with dark accents on the lips and eyes. Compliment special flourishes and show interest by asking her how she managed to get her makeup so perfect.Musical involvement. You might make conversation with her about live music or her favorite bands. You could also show your interest by asking her what features she likes most about her favorite goth musicians., The gothic fascination with darkness and the supernatural make vampire, fantasy, horror, and sci-fi genres popular among goths. These novels will not only give you something to talk about with the goth girl you are trying to attract, but your reading will also give you more background knowledge about popular goth themes. And if novels reading isn't your favorite activity, you might find gothic themed comics more enjoyable.

The Sisters of Mercy, Her identity as a goth doesn't mean she doesn't have non-goth related interests and hobbies. You might find that you have a lot more in common than you first thought! Ask her about her favorite:


TV shows
Classes in school
Free time activities
Places to go

, The goth subculture might be new and strange to you, which can lead you to feeling out of your element and uncomfortable. Try not to be judgmental in this situation. After all, goths are people just like you and are simply looking for a place where they can be accepted and appreciated for their style and beliefs.It's likely that goths feel just as out of place in their daily life as you might when hanging out with them.


Try to understand how the girl you want to attract thinks. Listen to her and discuss what she says. You don't have to think the same things she does, but respect her views and show her you're interested in what's important to her.
It can be tempting to try and portray yourself in a way you think she'll like. This is natural, but can lead you to feel like the real you isn't good enough for her. Pretending to be something that you're not can also lead to strain in your relationship with her. Avoid pretending to be something that you're not., When you're having a conversation with her, try to summarize what she's said in your own words and ask her if you've got it right. This is a strong way of making her feel like you really understand what she is saying, which could lead to greater emotional honesty between you. And as your relationship deepens, so too might her feelings for you.In addition to helping create an open atmosphere between her and you, this technique will also help prevent misunderstandings between you. If you are regularly checking that you understand what she is saying, there is less of a chance you'll misinterpret something.

, Invest yourself in the things she is saying by asking follow up questions. When she makes a statement, you can ask why she thinks that way or what brought her to that viewpoint. Don't allow yourself to be distracted by other people, your phone, or what's happening around you. By showing her she has your complete attention, you're also showing her you care about her.Turn your phone off before you even meet up with her. Even if you're having a great time, your nervous habit of checking your phone or the reflex to fidget with it might make her think you aren't interested.

, This is an important point whenever you're pursuing someone you like. No matter if she is goth or not, she probably won't like it if you smell like body odor! Shower daily, wear deodorant, wear clean clothes, brush your teeth, and maybe even style your hair.


You don't have to imitate goth style to get her to like you. She may be looking for someone who complements her style instead of copying it. In this case, you might earn admiration in her eyes for not being goth. What's most important to her will be a sense of connection with you., Body language conveys a large amount of information to the people we interact with.Even if she doesn't recognize it, she will on some level pick up on your body posture. If your body is oriented at her, like when your toes, body, and hands are pointed in her direction, she'll feel as though you're more interested in her.Avoid crossing your arms. This closes off your main body from her, which will make her feel like you are closed off from her. Try to use open, inclusive gestures.

, This can be especially hard if you're nervous, but by holding eye contact can cause her to start thinking about you as more than just a friend.Beyond snagging her romantic interest, getting into the habit of maintaining eye contact could also help you have a healthy, satisfied relationship.Be careful not to space out while you're looking at her! If you do, she might think you're bored. To prevent your eyes from looking empty or cold, you could think about the things you like best about her while making eye contact.
Other techniques can be used so that your eyes look warm and inviting while maintaining eye contact. A dimly lit room, restaurant, or coffee house can also put her at ease and make her feel more attracted to you., When you smile, you naturally look more attractive to others.But good moods are also contagious, so if you spend your time together wearing a smile on you face, she's much more likely to associate time spent with you with fun.You might have to practice your smile before you're completely satisfied with it. Practicing your smile in front of a mirror everyday can exercise and loosen up your facial muscles so you're ready to crack a grin when she wanders into sight.

Get her attention.,
Dress nicely.,
Smell good!,
Have some questions ready, and approach her when she is walking or sitting by herself.,
Be confident.,
Be yourself.,
Be a good listener.,
Be on time.,
Be a gentleman.,
Break the touch barrier.",How to Attract Girls With Body Language," That doesn’t mean you have to stare at her until she feels creeped out and wonders why you’re looking at her. What you really need to do are things that will make her interested in knowing you before you approach her. That way, when you do approach her, she’ll be open to hearing what you have to say.


She'll want to know what you are trying to say, but you don't want to give your position away. If you want to know if she's right for you - match your personalities. Sprinkle in some questions about her to her or her friends. But not so many in a row or you may get her suspicious and scare her off.;
, Girls notice appearance right away, especially shoes. It’s how they assess whether you’re a safe person to talk to and someone interesting. Make sure you’re ready for the day when her eyes might meet yours. Always look your best and be on top of your game. That way, when she looks your way, you’ll feel confident.


Wear the clothes that make you feel good about yourself but also look good on you.
Wear cheerful colors. This doesn’t mean you have to wear tennis ball green, but if you wear muted colors like grays and blacks everyday, no one will notice you, especially the girl you’ve got your eye on.
Look neat. No one is interested in approaching a slob. If you look like you’re happy to get up and get dressed in the morning, everyone will want to know you, especially that special girl. Leave the smelly sneakers with holes in them in the garage and put effort into your look. Girls spend a lot of time getting ready and looking good, so they really appreciate a guy who puts the same effort into the way he looks. She will notice.

, Women have a perceptive sense of smell, and most of them love a man who smells good. Make sure she likes your scent.


Shower daily. If you are an athlete, shower after sports activities as well.
Brush your teeth well and don't forget the back of your tongue where all the smelly bacteria collects.
Floss your teeth daily. Removing bacteria between your teeth and on the back of your tongue will get rid of bad breath.
Have several winter fresh or spearmint breath-mints in your pocket. She will never kiss you if your breath is bad.
Wear cologne, but just a splash - one to two squirts max, not the whole bottle or the cologne will act as a girl repellent. It's recommended to get something from a department store and not a grocery store. One bottle will last most guys a year or more. If you really want to get to know this girl, she’ll be worth it. If you shower, brush, floss, wear a splash of cologne, and you pop a mint in your mouth right before you talk to her, she’ll not only talk to you, she’ll appreciate your cleanliness and remember your smell.

, To get the conversation started, you can ask something like, ""Can you believe she actually gave us homework over break?"" or, “Didn’t you love that band that played at the café last week?” Be friendly and greet her with a smile and a simple “Hello.” You’d be surprised how well hello works. Try to make the questions related to how you know each other, like the class you have together or the work training that you’re both in. Be positive and upbeat. How she feels when you are around her is the most important thing and what she will remember most when she thinks of you later. Always be ready to say sorry as it shows you are good-natured. Plus, a sorry won't let you down.


Comment on the surroundings if you meet this girl at a public place like a bar or park. For example, “Isn’t this a great park to just come and relax?” or, “Have you been here on funk night? It’s a blast!” Don’t offer to buy her a drink until she’s spoken to you for a couple of minutes.
Show enthusiasm about whatever topic you choose to bring up. A flat personality and monotone voice will only cause her to turn away and give you a one word answer. You can approach her on the dance floor, but be cautious. Her friends are going to protect her and naturally ward off predators. They came to dance and have a girls night after all. Your best bet is to approach her with a smile and put out your hand and say, “Hi. I’m (your name).” Then address her friends with something like, “Hello ladies. I’m (name).” Her friends will respect you for your bold confidence.
Ask her if she’d like to dance or if you can get her a drink at the bar after you've spoken for a few minutes. Remember to have a genuine smile. Girls are used to guys approaching them. She’ll have her guard up before you even say a word. Yet, with the right non-verbal cues, like a warm smile and a clean appearance, she’ll feel safe when she talks with you.

, Women are more aware of the confidence a guy has than anything else. How confident a person is can be seen from across a room, and she’ll feel comfortable talking with you if you give her the impression you believe in yourself and your abilities. This does not equate to arrogance. Be self aware and know your strengths.


Stand with your shoulders up, and let her know that you know who you are.
Take your hands out of your pockets and stand firm on both feet.
Wait for the right time to approach her rather than chasing her down.
Make eye contact and keep eye contact. Looking away on occasion is normal, but make sure you let her know you're listening to her. Expect to be the one to make the first move. She'll expect you to text or call her first.

, If you're funny, then make her laugh. If you're smart, then talk about something cool that you know. If you're a musician, talk about what it's like to play an instrument. Try sticking to common interests at first and don't try to impress her. Girls don't like show-offs.

, Listen to her stories about her friends or what she thinks is funny. You don't have to agree with her, but don't tell her what to do. Repeat back what she says to you on occasion and don't spend too much time talking about yourself. Give her a full smile to let her know you like her and you're enjoying time with her. Keep your eyes on her. Don't look at or talk about other girls when you're with her. She needs to know that she's the only one on your mind. And put your phone away.

, Never cancel a date with her and show up on time. This will show her that you have made her a priority and she's important to you. If you're picking her up for a date, plan on her possibly being late. Girls put a lot of work into the way they look, so be patient. Your patience will put her at ease and the night will go well.

, Open doors for her and let her walk ahead of you if there's only room for one person on a pathway. Most girls will really appreciate this consideration. Offer your sweatshirt or jacket to her if she gets cold. Girls love wearing the jacket of a guy they like.

, Once you’ve spent several hours together, and you know she enjoys spending time with you, reach out to her. Physical contact will help to make the conversation more intimate and meaningful.


Start by giving her hugs when you say goodbye. Make sure the hugs don't linger longer than 3-6 seconds or she might feel uncomfortable. If she squeezes you back and holds you, you're ready for the next step.
Reach for her hand. If she holds your hand back or intertwines her fingers with yours, she's really in to you and wants to be your girlfriend.

Get to know her.Like most methods, asking a girl out in a casual manner will be easier if the two of you are already on good terms.,
Have a plan.,
Catch her at the right time.,
Engage in light conversation.,
Mention how well you get along.,
Confess your feelings and ask her to be your girlfriend.,
React calmly regardless of her reply.",How to Ask a Girl to Be Your Girlfriend1," You do not need to be BFFs or especially close friends, but it helps if you are at least casual friends who greet each other regularly.


Make light conversation with her whenever possible. If you pass her by in a hallway or on the sidewalk, stop her and talk a bit about school, work, the weather, popular television shows, or any other casual topic that comes to mind.
Interact with her in a group setting. If your dream girl is always surrounded by other people, befriend the group to get to the girl. Interact with everyone in the group and try to make friends with her friends, but pay special attention to her as you converse by directing at least half of your comments her way.;
, Even though you may want to seem casual and easy-going when you ask her to be your girlfriend, you need to plan out your approach in order to succeed.


The benefit of this method is that you save face if she turns you down and minimize the amount of tension or pressure between the two of you. That does not, however, mean that you should be so casual about the matter that you ask her spontaneously or flippantly.
Have a first date in mind. When you ask her to be your girlfriend, you should also ask her to go out with you somewhere. Typically, you should choose a fairly informal activity that provides plenty of opportunity to converse further, like a coffee shop or a trip to the zoo or a museum. If you choose something like a movie, make sure that there is opportunity afterward to have a meal or a cup of coffee so that the two of you can talk.

, You need to wait for an opportunity to talk to her alone. If you randomly blurt out your feelings in front of a group of people, she may feel embarrassed, which could change her response in a negative way.


You need to be able to hold a conversation with her before asking her out. In other words, do not bring the subject up as you rush past her on the sidewalk, even if the two of you are the only ones around. Wait for an opportunity to talk to her one-on-one without any foreseeable interruptions.
If no such opportunity presents itself naturally, make one. As you pass her by, ask her to spare a few minutes for you sometime later. Say that you want to chat for a bit, but avoid acting jittery or overly serious about it. You can agree to meet somewhere ordinary, like outside of church, work, school, or wherever you usually come into contact with her, or you can meet somewhere like a nearby park or coffee shop.

, Set the mood of the occasion by talking casually for a few minutes before bringing the question up. Doing so will put her at ease and keep the setting pressure-free.


A good way to begin is by asking her about how her day and/or week has been. Likewise, you can also talk about yours after asking about hers.
Also talk about shared topics of interest or subjects you might usually bring up in conversation with her.

, Bridge the gap between unrelated conversation and the subject of a romantic relationship by drawing attention to the friendly relationship that already exists between you both.


Make sure that you bring the matter up immediately after you share a laugh, agree about something, or create a good mood between the two of you.
Say it in a casual but sincere way. Avoid being too over-dramatic about the way things are.
Good example: “You know, I always have a lot of fun talking to you like this. It seems like we have a lot in common. We get along pretty well, don't you think?”
Bad example: “You're the only person I'll ever meet who I can get along with this well. I'd be a miserable wreck if you weren't part of my life.”

, If the girl agrees with you about how well you get along, take the conversation further and tell her you would like to pursue something more.


Tell her how you feel in a sincere way but avoid being too pushy about it.
On the other hand, you also need to make sure that you do not ask her in a shallow or completely carefree way. She should be able to see that you mean what you say.
Good example: “Actually, I was hoping we might be able to be something more than 'just friends.' I like you a lot, and I'd really like the chance to date you.”
Bad example: “Actually, I don't just see you as a friend—I love you more than words can say. Please, please be my girlfriend. I swear I'll make you happier than any other guy ever could in a million years, so just say 'yes'...please?”
Bad example: “Actually, now that I think about it, you're pretty hot. I should make you my girlfriend.”

, Your spirits may soar if she says yes or crash into a burning, smoldering mess if she says no, but no matter what she says in response, you need to keep cool about it.


If she agrees to be your girlfriend, then congratulations! You can smile, laugh, confess that you were really nervous about asking her and relieved to hear her response, or say just about anything that lets her know how serious you are. That said, avoid completely overreacting. As long as you don't suddenly stand up and do a victory dance, you should be fine.
If she turns you down, then accept it graciously with her head held high. Do not cuss her out, accuse her of putting you in the “friend zone,” beg her to change her mind, or demand an explanation until she either slaps you or bursts into tears. Instead, thank her for an honest answer and let her know that you understand and accept her reply.

"
"
Befriend her.,
Ask her to spend time with you in a pressure-free setting.,
Consider giving her a small, inexpensive gift.Unless you frequently throw gifts her way, a gift lets the girl know that there is something different—and special—about your time together this day when compared to any other day.,
Tell her seriously how you feel.,
Accept her answer calmly.",How to Ask a Girl to Be Your Girlfriend2," Take the time to get to know her as a close friend before trying to progress to something more.


You may worry about being put in the dreaded “friend zone,” but the truth of the matter is that many girls do need to feel secure with a guy before they will consider going out with him. Letting her know that you genuinely care about her as a human and a friend will establish that trust.

, Once you reach a level of friendship that allows the two of you to hang out without being in a group, invite her to spend some time with you alone.


If you want to be cautious, ask her to visit someplace familiar yet different, like a different coffee shop or a nearby park that you have both talked about wanting to visit.
If you want to be a little bolder, ask her to spend the afternoon or evening with you without revealing your plans. You can take her out for a nice meal, an interesting show, or a night of dancing.
Insist on paying. If she puts up a fuss about it, tell her that you want to pay for her since you were the one who asked her to come out with you.

,


Flowers, chocolates, or stuffed animals are all fair game.
Avoid expensive gifts like jewelry or designer clothes.

, After you have spent some time enjoying each other's company, sit down with her and tell her that you have something important to say. Once you have her undivided attention, tell her honestly that you have strong feelings for her and would like her to be your girlfriend.


Do not pressure, but at the same time, avoid blowing it off as no big deal. You must be genuine without being pushy.
Good example: “I really enjoy the time I spend with you and consider you an important part of my life. I can't help but have feelings for you past those of friendship, though. If you feel the same way, or think you could see me as a boyfriend, then I'd like to go out with you.”
Bad example: “So, yeah. I just thought of something: you and I should become girlfriend and boyfriend.”
”Bad example: “I've never told you this, but I love you more than life itself. Please be mine. I don't know how I'll manage without you.”

, She may feel the same way, or she may not. Regardless of what she says, though, you need to respond to her answer in a calm, civilized manner.


If she agrees to be your girlfriend, express how happy that makes you but do not get wild and shout or dance about.
Don't pressure her into a relationship. If she hesitates before giving you an answer, do not begin begging for her to agree.
Let her know that this will not spell the end of your friendship. If she does not share your feelings at the present moment, do not tell her that this is “good-bye.” Let her know that it stings a little, but assure her that you still value her as a friend. Who knows—as long as you don't burn any bridges, she may eventually come to like you later on.

"
"
Talk to her in person.,
Slip her a “secret admirer” note.,
Consider attaching a small, cute gift.,
Watch for warning signs.,
Drop hints.,
Don't let things drag on.,
Make the “big reveal” memorable.,
Keep your cool when she responds.",How to Ask a Girl to Be Your Girlfriend3," While you may be tempted to use the “secret admirer” path as a way to ask a girl out without talking to her first, doing so is a bad idea. You need to make sure that she knows who you are in person before you can drop her secret hints about your feelings.


Make sure that the two of you get along fairly well before using this approach. You can still be in the beginning stages of acquaintanceship or friendship, but when you converse, you should be able to do so while smiling and maintaining a comfortable atmosphere.
The ideal situation is to begin your approach as soon as you realize your feelings for her.
It works even better if you can time things out so that, as the two of you talk more and get to know each other better, she begins to suspect and even hope that you are the one responsible for the mysterious signs of affection.

, These secret notes are a good way to inject a little mystery into the situation, and if the girl you have your eye on has a curious nature, this can also be a good way to pique her interest.Address the girl by name so that she knows, without a doubt, that the note is meant for her. Do not sign the note if you want to keep it a secret, though.
Keep things light. Avoid heavy sentiments or language that sounds “stalkerish.” Instead, opt for cute, light-hearted expressions of affection with no hint of pressure.
Don't be afraid to be a little cheesy. It may not work quite as well in person, but for a note like this, a few cheesy lines can help keep things light.
Elaborate a little. You do not need to write an essay about your love for her, but it helps to talk about your feelings a little so that she actually knows that your note is the real deal.
Good example: “To Jane Doe, This is just a little note to let you know you have a secret admirer—me! Of course, you probably don't know who I am yet, but still. You're a sweet girl. I admire your kindness and your wit, and I thought I should let you know that there's someone who really appreciates you.”
Good example: “Dear Jane Doe, Roses are red, violets are blue, here's a little note to say that I “like” like you! Sincerely, Your Secret Admirer”
Bad example: “My dearest, sweet Jane, I love you more than words can say. I watch you every day. I've looked at all of your Facebook photos and tweets, and I know more about you than you can imagine. Last week, when you were on your way home after dark, I even followed you from a distance to make sure you got back safe, because I love you so much and would die if anything happened to you. If I could, I'd watch you 24/7. With great and sincere love, Your Secret Admirer.”
Bad example: “Hey girl! I like you.”

, If you end up sending the object of your affection several secret notes, you can get creative and attach a small gift to a few of them. Keep the gifts “cute” and inexpensive, though.


Instead of giving her a box of chocolates, attach a small piece of foil-wrapped chocolate to a note reading something along the lines of, “A little sweet for a real sweetie! Signed, Your Secret Admirer”
Instead of sending her a bouquet of roses, attach a small clover flower or wildflower that you picked yourself.
Avoid gifts like CDs, movies, jewelry, or perfume.

, Even if you take every precaution possible to avoid making her feel paranoid or on edge, there still remains some chance that the girl in question will feel uncomfortable with someone leaving her anonymous notes. If you get the idea that she feels uncomfortable, stop immediately.


An obvious sign would be if she tears up the notes or throws them out upon receiving them.
If she suspects that you might be behind the notes and starts to ignore you or avoid you, you can take that as a sign that she feels uncomfortable about the situation.
If she does not suspect you and ends up confiding in you about the notes and about her uneasiness about the sender, confess that you were behind them and that you will stop now that you know how uncomfortable they made her feel.

, The best mysteries are the ones that seem as though they could be solved. Even though this is supposed to be a secret, drop hints without directly stating who you are so that she has some idea of who to expect once you reveal your feelings. You can drop hints through your notes and in person.


To drop a hint in one of your notes, make a remark that only you and a few others might be able to make. For instance, if only a few people know that the girl in question is obsessed with a certain band, write that you were listening to one of their songs or albums when you thought of her.
To drop a hint in person, flirt without directly stating your feelings. If your presence in her life increases as the notes continues, she will begin to think of you as a likely possibility.

, Send her a few notes over the course of a few weeks before you let her know who you are. Secret admirers can be cute and fun at first, but they can get creepy if they drag on for months or years.

, Instead of randomly revealing your identity, make a show of it and give her the option of playing along. As you reveal your identity, you should also state very clearly that you would like for her to be your girlfriend.


Do not write something like, “PS – I decided to tell you that this is John Smith.”
Instead, ask her to meet somewhere if she wants to know who you are. Choose a public location on neutral ground, and make sure she knows where the location is at.
Give her a heads up about your intentions by telling her, in the note, that you would like her to be your girlfriend.
Good example: “I think it's about time to stop this secrecy and finally ask you out. If you want to know who I am, I'll be waiting for your answer in front of the coffee shop near the office/school Tuesday at noon.”
Bad example: “I can't stand it anymore—I really want you to be mine. I'll be waiting outside your house tomorrow morning for your answer.”
Give her one last surprise when she meets you. An inexpensive bouquet of flowers or a few of her favorite candy bars can be a sweet gesture.

, You may have successfully wooed her. Then again, you may not have. Even if the girl is flattered by your affections, she may still tell you that she doesn't feel the same way.


If she agrees to be your girlfriend, stay calm but make sure she knows how happy you are.
If she does not agree to it, do not throw a tantrum, pout, or try to make her feel guilty about your wasted efforts.

First, be sure to know how to play guitar (it could be almost any cool instrument, but I highly recommend a guitar or in some cases a piano).,
If you're in a band (and again, I add the word COOL on everything), get a style.,Get an acoustic or electric-acoustic guitar, so you can carry it easily and play it at any time

,
Learn to play any romantic, slow, or even popular, upbeat songs from classic rock bands like The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Aerosmith, Queen, Pink Floyd, etc.

,
Invite her to your performances.,
Try some songs to get her attention.,
Get her to listen to your own music.",How to Get a Girl if You Play Guitar,";
, It could be with a bunch of Gothic stuff (buckles, cross necklaces or fingerless gloves), AC/DC stuff (with a uniform or a tux, wearing it Rock style, to be comfortable), Slash style (with a leather jacket, aviator sunglasses, and being all mysterious), or just the guy who doesn't care about his style (in fact, it DOES work sometimes). Use your style at all times. If she is in your school and you wear school uniforms, wear something little to mark your style. If you still can't, try hanging out with her outside school, and wear it then, but don't look like you're going to a performance or just ended one.

,,, I know it could be hard to invite busy girls to performances, but try to invite those types of girls when they are free. If you invite her to all of them and she can't go to any, she'll feel bad and the next one she'll feel obligated to go.


If you play piano or any keyboard in which you don't use your mouth, it's still cool, and a LOT more romantic. If it's a big piano, and you are like a good friend of hers, invite her over, tell her ""Hey, do you know (song name) song? because I can play it on piano (or guitar)"".

, If your band is a Hard Rock or Metal band, play a softer, but cool song from older bands (like Aerosmith or Van Halen). Some examples include ""Walk This Way"", ""Sweet Emotion"", ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"", ""You Really Got Me"", etc. If you sing too, say in the mic ""And this song is for ______"", and it will be a lot better. If you don't sing, do it anyway, and while playing, look at her from time to time. P.S. MAKE SURE SHE IS THERE.

, When you make a song, even when it's not inspired on her, but still romantic, tell her something like ""Hey, I've been like working on this song a while and I would like your opinion about it"" or, if any of her friends knows you like her, tell her to give you her opinion. Try not to ask your guy friends, unless they are really sensible. Try not to ask anyone but her if he or she doesn't know who you like. Your friends will tease you, and her friends will interrogate you AND tease you, but it will be worth it in the long run.

"
Figure out why she rejected you.,
Think over your current relationship.,
Examine your approach.,
Respect her answer.,
Be patient.,
Act like you were not phased.,
Become friendly with your crush again.,
Clean yourself up.,
Flirt with him and with others.,
Pay attention to his behavior around you.,
Use a different approach.",How to Ask Someone out if They've Already Rejected You," This can be difficult because you don't want to seem desperate or overly hurt, but if your crush didn't give you a good answer why she didn't want to go out with you, it could be good to meet up with her and ask her a few questions to gain some insight as to what she is thinking.If she very bluntly stated why she didn't want to go out with you like ""I'm not interested in you for this reason"" or ""I'm going through something difficult and don't need the stress of dating,"" then you don't want to irritate her by asking her for more explanation.
People are often caught off guard when asked out, and so a lot of times they come up with an answer on the spot that may not be the complete truth. Calmly approach your crush and ask her if she wouldn't mind grabbing coffee (not as a date) because you wanted to talk through some things with her. Then, when you are together ask her if there was a specific reason she didn't want to go out with you or if your approach was what turned her off. Do not then proceed to ask her out again, but thank her for giving you some insight and be understanding.;
, Sometimes it's the essence of the relationship that is what caused the rejection. Are you asking out your best friend and she is worried that it will ruin the relationship? Have there been conflicts recently that have left your crush confused or irritated with you? Thinking through your relationship can be helpful to know if it was part of the reason you were rejected. If you asked out someone you met once at a party or on a night out this doesn't necessarily apply to you, but if you asked out a good friend it's possible that she doesn't want to ruin your relationship or there's something else going on in her life that's keeping her from jumping into something new. It's also possible that at this point she just isn't attracted to you, which in that case it just takes time and patience before you can ask her out again.

, Did you just ask someone out that you didn't know in a very demeaning manner, were you confident or really nervous in your approach, or did you catch your friend off guard and she didn't know how to respond? If you have asked other people out, think about the approaches that were successful and those that weren't and think about how you came across to your crush.

, If you asked a girl out and were rejected, don't insist on taking her on a date. It can seem desperate and be incredibly annoying to your crush if you persist when she's already told you no. Once you have figured out why she rejected you, respect her answer and don't ask her out again right away.

, As previously stated, you want to respect the person you asked out by giving her time. Sometimes people need to process and think over things and over time they may realize that they are interested in you. Giving your crush space to think over her feelings towards you could lead to a much more positive answer later on., One of the biggest ways to show you were hurt by rejection is by acting weird or awkward around your crush or stepping completely out of his life. Now, you don't want to over assert yourself into his life, but it's helpful to act casual around him and not show any pain. If you step out of his life completely and become distant you'll lose an opportunity to ask him out later on.In some cases people do need space and after they learn that you are interested in them, they feel awkward and don't want to be around you all the time. Feel out the situation to see if it's best if you step back for a while or if you should be as present as you were before. It is important, though, that you don't show your crush you were incredibly hurt or that the rejection made you insecure. Most people don't find insecurity attractive, so continue to act confident.

, After you have given your crush some time to think over things, it's time to get back into his life. You may have decided to act like things are normal or maybe you gave him some space, but before you plan to ask him out again you want to develop a relationship with him.If you weren't friends before then becoming friends may be the key to gaining a date with your crush. It's possible that he didn't feel comfortable going out with someone he didn't know, so helping him get to know you could better your chances when you ask him out again.
If you were friends before, you don't want to just go right back to where you were before in the friend zone. That may lead your crush to think that you have accepted there is no future between the two of you, and your crush may stop considering the possibility that you still like him. It's best to develop a friendship again but to show that you are interested in other things too, then he won't feel awkward around you.

, This isn't a shoo-in, but it always helps someone say yes to a date if they find you attractive. Consider going to a gym or trying out a different hairstyle to pique your crush's interest. It's also important that you have proper hygiene -- people don't usually want to go out with someone who doesn't take care of their body!

, It could be helpful to occasionally flirt with your crush, to show him that you are playfully considering him. You don't want to only flirt with him or flirt with him frequently, though. Make it clear that your options are open and that you are considering other people. Sometimes all it takes is jealousy to make your crush realize he is interested in you.Don't turn all your attention on someone else if you want your crush to know you are still interested in him. This may lead him to feel confused or believe that you have moved on completely.

, Before you ask him out again, you'll want to see if anything has changed in the way he is interacting with you. If he is acting somewhat playful or is suddenly interested in your other romantic interests, it could be a sign that he is beginning to see you as more than a friend.

, Now that you've had time to better your relationship and pique your crush's interest, you're probably ready to ask him out. However, it could be good to change up your approach from the last time to better your chances. Be confident and ask him in the way you think would receive the best answer.


Be cool when you ask your crush out again -- don't seem desperate or like all you have been thinking about is asking him out again. Play it up like you'd love to treat him to lunch or coffee (or whatever it is you want to do) and make it seem somewhat casual. Or maybe do something fun like going to a concert, something that could also be done with a friend.Your crush may be more willing to go on a date like this if he feels you aren't trying to jump into something serious.If you did all this and were turned down again, it unfortunately may be a sign that you need to move on. A guy or girl may reject you once without really thinking about it, but if he or she rejects you a second time it means he or she had some time to think about it and still aren't interested. Respect his or her decision and understand that it obviously wasn't meant to be."

Come up with an idea for a date.,
Send her an opening text.,
Ask her out on a date.,
Respond to her answer.",How to Ask a Girl Out over Text1," If you know the person well enough, then consider her interests when coming up with date ideas. The more appealing the date sounds, the more likely she'll be to say yes. Furthermore, having a concrete plan with a place and time in mind makes you more decisive then if you said ""Let's hang out some time,"" or, ""I don't know, what do you want to do?"" Here are some date ideas you should consider before asking:


If you share similar tastes in music, then invite her to an upcoming show or concert.
Consider asking her to meet you for lunch or grabbing ice cream. If you enjoy cooking, then invite her over for a homemade dinner. Remember that dates don't necessarily have to revolve around meals; go for a hike together or hit the bowling alley!
Try to think of an activity that involves talking and getting to know each other. Avoid asking her to the movies, where you will be sitting in silence and won't get a chance to talk. However, if you're set on going to the movies, take her to dinner beforehand or go out for ice cream after, so you get a chance to get to know each other.;
, Greet her first to get the conversation going. If you have just met her and are unsure of whether she has your number saved in your phone, then you may need to remind her who you are. Say something like ""Hey, this is , we met the other day."" If you are positive she has your number, then text her something like ""Hey, what's up?"" or ""Hey, how's your day going?""


If you have seen her recently, then try to come up with an excuse to start a conversation based on your last interaction. For example, if you were recently at a party together, text her something like ""Hey, how was the rest of your night?"" If you are in a class together, try something like ""Are you ready for the test on Monday?""
Wait until she responds to your first text before asking her out. Remember that she may be occupied and not have her phone with her, so be patient.

, Once you have gotten the conversation going, it's time to ask her out. You may want to start by asking her what her plans are on a given day/weekend. If she says that she is free, then ask her out. Send a text saying ""Would you want to do activity with me?""


Don't wait too long to ask her out. You don't want the conversation to go on a tangent and make asking her out seem too awkward or unexpected. There's no need to make too much small talk when you're just texting each other.
Keep it short and simple. Just say something like, ""Interested in a movie?"" or ""Want to go bowling this Friday evening?""
Have a concrete place and a time where you want to meet. If you just say, ""Want to go see a movie some time?"" then you'll sound indecisive. It's important to state a time so she knows you're serious and you thought it out.
Give her an option to do something else. Maybe she wants to go out with you, but she's a terrible bowler; maybe she wants to go to dinner, but she just went to the place you suggested last night. Make it clear that you have a plan, but that you're open to doing something else, too.

, If she says yes, then iron out the details; decide on where/when you will meet and make driving arrangements if necessary. Once you have decided on the date, casually end the conversation by saying something like ""Great, see you on Saturday!"" Don't continue to text her too much afterward, or you may be coming on too strong. However, if she starts texting you a lot, then you can respond too.


Be sure to let her know that you are looking forward to the date if she says yes. This will make her feel special and have her looking forward to the date as well.
If she declines your offer, then let her know that there are no hard feelings and end the conversation. You want to keep your head up high and end things on a good note.

We are hard-wired to love! Attraction is based in brain chemistry. A group of neurotransmitters called monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) creates the feeling we experience as attraction.


Dopamine is one of your brain’s “feel-good” chemicals (it’s where the term “dope” comes from). It’s also involved in your brain’s motivation and reward systems. When you meet someone you’re attracted to, dopamine starts sending feel-good chemical “rewards” to your system.Norepinephrine, sometimes known as noradrenaline (but not the same thing as adrenalin), delivers messages to your central nervous system.Norepinephrine is responsible for your ability to “block out” information that isn’t as interesting as the smart partner in front of you.
Serotonin regulates a lot of functions in your body, including sexual behavior and body temperature. When you are very attracted to someone, serotonin decreases your body temperature, which makes your skin slightly more able to conduct electricity. This is the reason that love can literally make your skin tingle.In fact, experts say that attraction stimulates the same chemicals in the brain that addiction does, such as dopamine and oxytocin.If a girl isn’t attracted to you, it’s nothing to do with you: it’s all down to the chemicals in each person’s brain.
A researcher at Rutgers University suggests that it takes less than one second for the brain to decide whether it considers someone to be attractive or not.You may be able to overcome or cope with this split-second first impression, or you may not.
If not, don’t take it personally: people are not able to manage spontaneous impulses and what is judged may not have anything to do negatively with you. For instance, some women are drawn to men which are high risk-takers, some are more attracted to those who seem more cautious. There is nothing wrong with being either.


Understanding how attraction works may seem to take some of the mystery and magic from this human emotion. However, what it does make clear is that love and attraction is a fundamental part of how we are hard-wired. And it is on a level that is not heavily rational. And sometimes the chemistry literally is right or wrong.;
, Women are generally attracted to men or women who demonstrate that they are able to care for themselves. This includes good grooming, and an overall healthy look. Keeping your body feeling and looking strong and healthy, is a big evolutionary sign of your “reproductive fitness” — basically, a sign that your genes are strong and healthy too.Keeping yourself well-groomed and healthy suggests self-confidence and a healthy respect for yourself, which most people find attractive.
This does not mean you have to go overboard and become a marathoner or a bodybuilder. You may, however, want to consider join a gym or an ultimate Frisbee team to feel healthy and more confident about yourself, and thus be more attractive. Be the best version of yourself and be true to yourself, and remember that you do not have to be the best looking to be good looking.

, Your physical appearance and presence is the biggest first impression. It is also usually the strongest. You can have a great online profile and interaction, but if you finally meet the girl in real life and you reek of body odor and wear unflattering clothing, that will make a stronger impression than any online chat room.


Control odors. Women in most industrialized societies are put off by strong body odors. Someone who does not bathe regularly, does not use antiperspirant, or wears clothes that stink, will be unsuccessful.
Take care of your body. It is entirely possible to find love if one is imperfect: obese, have eczema, balding...whatever. However, doing your best to maximize your appearance will both directly look more attractive and make you feel more confident.
Wear attractive clothing. Every society has a sense of what sort of clothing is attractive, and puts forth social signals of virility, confidence, and masculinity. If your clothing is unattractive, off-putting, or really odd, that sends a signal that there may be something wrong with the wearer.

, Body language can be either conscious (like winking at someone) or subconscious (like your lips reddening or pupils dilating). People convey a variety of messages through body language, including the language of attraction. Most body language signs relevant to physical attraction communicate a few basic messages:I am available: Lack of a likely partner, and looks confident and emotionally balanced.
I am interested: When a person says hi, a friendly and possibly flirty conversation strikes up.
I am harmless: There is no aggressive or ""strange"" behavior.
I am fertile: An overall healthy, youthful, energetic appearance.
I am approachable: Body language appears to be open and relaxed.

, Body language cues that say “I’m available” and “I’m approachable” suggest that the other person is in a state of mind that is receptive to your advances. Look for things such as:Smiling
Making eye contact with you
Looking up (instead of staying absorbed with a phone, etc.)
Standing or sitting with the arms and legs relaxed and uncrossed
Keeping her feet pointed toward you if you’re having a conversation
Glancing at you from a distance, looking away for a time, then looking at you--not staring.

, Some body language is unconscious and happens when we are attracted to someone. Others are more conscious behaviors. Looking for these cues can help you figure out if your tender feeling for the girl is reciprocal.Flushed or reddened cheeks
Reddened lips or lips that appear to get plumper
Dilated pupilsThe person moves a “block” from out of your way--such as shifting a bag that had been in between you.
A suddenly racing heart or more rapid breathing
Licking her lipsSubtly echoing your body language. For instance, if you shift your weight from one side to the other, she does something similar a few moments later.
Momentary touches. For example, light, brief touch on your arm, wrist, or knee.
Remember: none of these behaviors will definitively mean she is attracted to you. While they are good signs, do not jump to conclusions. The girl with rosy cheeks and dilated pupils who moves her purse for you on the bus may just be a courteous and easily flushed girl who just came back from the eye doctor!
Never assume her sexuality. You may come off as rude and ruin chances of befriending her.

, A genuine smile from a woman may be a signal that she wants to make herself more attractive to you.(It may also just be a sign that she’s friendly, so make sure to check out her other body language cues as well.) Watch to see what facial muscles she uses when she smiles to get a sense of whether it’s real or not.


Genuine smiles, also called duchenne smiles, use the muscles around the eyes as well as the mouth. Fake smiles usually only move the muscles around the mouth, and these smiles may look tight or empty. There’s a reason Tyra Banks is always telling models to “smile with your eyes.”, Once you’ve determined whether you have a shot or not, you can do a few things with your own body language to tell the girl you’re interested in her.


Make eye contact with her and smile.
Get a little closer to her. Maybe move to a closer table in the coffee shop, or go grab a napkin while she is at the condiment station. This can help her pick up on your pheromones, which help signal attraction.Tilt your head if you are talking to her or looking at her. Head-tilting is a sign of interest.

, Also known as a “pickup line,” an opening gambit is how you initiate a conversation. Despite the general creepiness of the pickup artist community, you don’t have to be a 'creepster' to use an opening gambit. Studies suggest that there are three types:The direct opener. These are honest and get straight to the point, like “I think you’re really cute” or “I’m kind of shy, but I’d love to chat with you.” In general, men tend to prefer to receive these openers when others initiate conversations with them.
The innocuous opener. These get a conversation going but don’t go straight for a target, like “What do you think of this place?” or “Do you come here often?” In general, women tend to prefer these openers when others initiate conversations with them.
The cute/flippant opener. These involve humor, but are often cheesy or even nasty, such as “Do you like your eggs scrambled or fertilized?” Sometimes these work to ""break the ice"" but you also risk coming off as sleazy, desperate, or weird. Both men and women in general rank these as the least attractive option.
If you’re looking to strike up a conversation with a girl, your best bet is to use an innocuous opener.
Studies have also shown that honest and supportive gambits more often result in long-term relationships, whereas strategies that use manipulation or dishonesty (like the cute/flippant gambit) result in short-term relationships., Touching is a great way to signal physical attraction. If you have been talking for awhile and the girl seems interested in you, you can try a light brush of her arm or touch her hand.Do not touch a girl unless she is giving you strong signals that she is into you. Even then, proceed with caution. It is usually a good idea to wait until she has initiated some type of touch.
If the girl responds negatively to your touch, apologize, and do not try again for a while. Showing her respect and giving her space may well gain her good graces. Being overly aggressive will not.
Make sure your physical touches are culturally-appropriate. What is acceptable in Colorado may not be in Morocco. Also, what is considered fine at a public university in Toronto may not be for a very conservative Christian school in Oklahoma.
If you're unsure at all, ask for physical touching! For instance, holding out your hand to give it a friendly shake. Or asking, ""May I give you a hug?"" or, ""Would you like some help putting sunscreen on your back?"" This allows for physical touching in a way that respects her boundaries, and being straightforward about it.

Do not get fixated on touching the girl. You do not have to physically touch a girl in the early stages of flirting. Trying too hard, or putting undue pressure to touch can backfire severely and make you come off as ""creepy"".
The moment for a touch will often ""just happen"". If the connection and attraction is there, often a moment will simply organically happen. The two of you reach for the same tater tot at the cafeteria, or she puts her hand on yours at the movies, or something along those lines.

, Who wants to get into a serious relationship with someone who just sits around all day? If you want her to fall in love with you, get out there and do things that make you interesting and confident. Go out and do the things that make you happy, fill your life with learning and exploration, and pursue your dreams. People often are more interested in others who appear to live full, happy lives on their own.Have you always wanted to make your own video game? It is possible to do that! Write a book? Go get 'em, tiger! Become a master spelunker? You can do it! Follow your dreams and you'll find that girls are attracted to your passion and determination.
Maintaining your own interests after getting into a relationship will also help keep you from becoming “codependent.” Codependent relationships happen when one or both partners feel like they can’t be complete or happy without the other person. They’re unhealthy, and you can avoid this model by staying true to yourself. This will attract people who are true to themselves, too.

, People don't just decide with whom they want to fall in love. Love happens because the people involved have lovable qualities. Love often develops over time, so your job is to show the girl that you're worth being around. Let your personality shine through, and give her the chance to see who you really are and what you have to offer. It turns out that people often find traits such as humor, kindness, and honesty make you more physically attractive!Other qualities that can affect how people perceive your attractiveness include respectfulness, honesty, hard work, and intelligence.Studies also suggest that women are more likely to value personality and social traits such as kindness and intelligence over physical traits., Get a sense of humor. It's no secret that girls love others who can crack a joke or be funny — in fact, it’s science!Practice jokes on your friends every so often, and learn the jokes that work and the ones that don't work. When you're alone with a girl, telling a joke can be a great way to break the tension.


Remember: if you're not good at jokes, you can still have a good sense of humor — you just have to love laughing and being around people who are funny. Being a good audience is as important as being funny yourself.
Bitter or sarcastic humor isn’t a great idea. Try positive, even slightly self-deprecating humor.For example, if you’re at a coffee shop together, you might say something like “I hear there are two types of people: coffee people and sad people. What do you think?”

, One of the most important things both girls and guys look for in a partner is playfulness. So you want to be playful because she probably thinks that playfulness is attractive. How can you be playful? Make a boring routine, like studying, interesting and funny by turning your math problem into a song, for example. Don't take things too seriously. And most importantly, be able to laugh at yourself.


Being able to love fun, hang loose, and even poke fun at yourself suggests to girls that you aren’t uptight or aggressive. It also puts everyone around you at ease, making it more pleasant to hang out with you.

, To be genuinely lovable, you have to believe that you are worth being around. Most girls aren't attracted to people who are constantly putting themselves down. So be confident, but not cocky.Know what you are good at. Don't brag about it or show off, but put these things into your routine and don't be afraid to let them shine every once in a while.


The difference between real confidence and cockiness is in how you think about yourself. True self-confidence means you know who you are, and you’re comfortable and happy with that. Cockiness often stems from a need to compete with or put down others to make yourself feel confident. Truly confident guys and girls don’t need to belittle anyone or be a jerk to show that they know they’re cool.If you do feel the need to take a jab at yourself, make sure you present it as a joke. Laugh at the mistakes you make and the stupid things you do, as well as the things you don't like about yourself. ""Seriously, you DO NOT want me to ask you to dance. I'm a terrible dancer. Danger to myself and others. It's best for everyone.""

, Getting to know her is about more than just memorizing her birthday and where she was born. Spend time with her, build trust, and come to appreciate the things about her that she doesn’t often show. Learn about her fear of water (and why she’s afraid) or learn about her most embarrassing moment (and help her laugh it off). Understand how she thinks and what she believes. This will help you love her as a complete person, and she will appreciate that more than you can understand.One good way to start is by asking her an open-ended question. For example, social psychologist Arthur Aron has made headlines with his list of 36 questions to foster intimacy between people.They’re creative and open-ended, and they ask about more interesting things than her favorite movie.For example, you could try asking “Would you like to be famous? In what way?” or “What would constitute a perfect day for you?”
This will not only give you the chance to get to know her better, but it will also show her that you think she's smart and her opinions are worthwhile.

, Then do those things with her. Doing something that you know she likes has the added advantages that she feels comfortable and safe doing it. If she's comfortable when you're out on a date, she's more likely to get close to you, hold your hand, or even kiss you.


Whether she likes surfing, horseback riding, shopping, or baking, it's a good idea to try to involve her in what she likes doing best. Ask her friend what she enjoys doing in her free time, or ask her yourself if you're feeling brave. (Fortune favors you.) That way, she'll know that you've taken the time to find out what makes her tick, and that you're ready to go that extra mile to make sure she's happy.

, Bonding over something she likes doesn't need to be a date, but if you want love to blossom, you're going to have to ask her on a date at some point. When you're ready to take that step, try someplace familiar like the movies, a coffee shop, or a dance. Maybe try taking her to an amusement park or a haunted house; studies suggest that excitement or a sense of danger on a date helps release a chemical in the brain that bonds the two people together.Be strategic about whether you call it a ""date."" Generally, if you've already won the girl over, you want to make it clear that you're going on a date to make sure you're both on the same page. But if you haven't won the girl over yet, it's probably best to slow-play the courtship, and win her over as a friend before you move on to the romantic relationship. Sometimes, the girl will resist a romantic relationship if she's not sure about whether you're good friends.

, You probably don’t want to ask her to be your girlfriend the first time you meet her, or even the first few times you go out on a date. However, at some point you will need to tip your hand and declare your interest in her as romantic. If you wait too long, you run the risk of her considering you only as a friend. Ambiguity isn’t your friend.


You can also be clear when it comes to signalling your continuing interest. For example, if you had a great time, don’t end your conversation on a wishy-washy note. Say something like, “I had a wonderful time tonight. Would it be okay if I called you tomorrow?”

, Sometimes it’s tempting to tell a girl you’re into everything about yourself to show what a great catch you are, or how much you like her. This isn’t a great idea for two reasons:First, it means you’re talking a lot about yourself, which means you are spending less time listening to her.
Second, it means you may be talking about things too soon. The first few dates aren’t the time to trash your boss or talk about how much your ex sucked. This type of self-revelation can actually make you look bitter, indiscreet, or like you don’t have a good sense of personal boundaries.
You don’t have to remain a person of mystery, but start with your likes and dislikes and allow your conversations to grow organically. If she’s interested in you, she’ll ask you questions about yourself. Just be sure to keep a good balance between your sharing and hers.

, This doesn't mean playing hard-to-get, but give the girl control over what happens next. Suffocating her and bullying her into a relationship will do the opposite of what you're hoping for. Show her you respect her life outside of you; when you give a girl room to breathe, she will often come to love you on her own terms.


When you give her space, avoid being too distant. Keep calling her regularly and showing her that you're interested. If you're shy, don't give her too much space or she'll think you're not interested. You're going to have to come out of your shell a little bit if you want to get her attention.
If you've just gone on a date with her, and everything has gone really well, tell her you'll call her before the weekend is up if it's Friday. Let her do her own thing on Saturday, and then give her a call on Sunday and tell her you had a really good time and you'd like to do something soon, perhaps next weekend. This would be a great time to ask her out to any parties or dances that are happening.
Giving her space is all about showing her how confident you are. What you're basically saying is ""I had a great time with you, and I like you, but I'm not going to come on super strong because I'm not desperate."" Girls and guys are both attracted to people who are cool and calm, who don't jump the gun, and who aren't desperate.

, Every woman is her own person, with her own qualities, just like you are. Be very careful that you do not get into a frame of mind in which you come to negative conclusions about her. She is not a new car, in which you can pick and choose options as you please. You have to decide if that quirk, personality, or other thing about her is something you can handle, or not--but not try to change her into something you want.


If you decide you can live with whatever quirks she has, stick to that decision. Don’t try to change her. Don’t criticize or nitpick her for her quirks. Accept her as she is.Her personality doesn't make her a bad person. Even if you decide that something is a deal-breaker, there’s no need to be mean to her about it.

, In fact, if you can eliminate most of your “expectations” about her, you will probably be happier in your relationship.We often expect unreasonable things from other people that can make us feel anxious and unhappy when we don’t get them.Now, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have certain expectations or that you let yourself be mistreated. It’s perfectly okay to expect a person to show up when s/he says s/he will (unless something unavoidable happens), to treat you with kindness and respect, and to show compassion and kindness to others.
However, if you expect your girl to read your mind about your needs, you will probably be disappointed because no one is a mind-reader.
Furthermore, people’s personalities tend to be pretty set. If your girl always seems to be running late and you’ve talked to her about it bothering you but nothing’s changed, chances are this problem may not go away. You can decide that it’s too big for you to deal with, or you can decide to let her be her (late and all), but you can’t expect her to change.

, Don't get too hung up on getting one particular girl to fall in love with you, and don't try to ""force"" love on a girl who just isn't feeling it! Desperation is never attractive.


Get to know more girls and give love more opportunities to blossom. Go to school socials and functions. Don't be afraid to go to a different school's social if a friend invites you. You never know when you might meet that special someone who'll knock the wind out of your lungs.
Sometimes, when you stop looking for love, it hits you right in the face. The universe works in weird ways. Especially if you've tried really hard recently, or you think you've just run out of energy, don't be afraid to pull back from the fray. It sounds counter-intuitive, and it's frustrating to do, but it works: when you stop trying, girls tend to find you.
Be adventurous for her. Maybe the girls you know all have boyfriends, or maybe you aren’t interested in your friends. Plenty of people these days are finding love outside of their immediate circles. If you're old enough, try Internet dating. If you're interested in extracurriculars, get involved on a wider basis so that you could potentially travel. When looking for that girl of your dreams, it helps to keep an open mind and try as many different adventures as life throws at you.

, Try to see things from her point of view. Show her you appreciate her opinions, even if you disagree with them.It helps to ask her about these things, rather than making assumptions. When she talks to you about her thoughts or feelings, listen.

If you’re having trouble seeing things from her point of view, use “I”-statements to ask her to explain: “I really want to understand where you’re coming from, but I’m just not getting it. Could you explain what you’re feeling right now?”

, Honesty builds trust, but once the trust is broken, it never returns. From that moment on, your words will be suspect. Be yourself, and be honest.Show genuine intentions. Be honest and open about your plans, wants and desires. If she is not OK with these, you have, at least, established a starting point which can then be adjusted in order that you come to know each other more closely.
There’s a difference between being open and honest and being manipulated. For example, you don’t have to show someone your texts or emails to “prove” that you’re trustworthy. You don’t have to report on where you are at every minute of every day. This is intrusive behavior that doesn’t belong in healthy relationships., The most important aspect is to learn to listen patiently and actively.The understanding that you gain will help to communicate in a caring and helpful way In a healthy relationship, both people feel acknowledged and respected.Listen to what she says. Don’t work out what you’re going to say in response while she’s still talking. Ask her to clarify anything you don’t understand by saying something like, “I’m not sure I understood you correctly. I heard _____. Is that what you meant?” These kinds of clarifications will also help prevent misunderstanding and hurt feelings.
Avoid passive aggression. Passive aggression happens when your girlfriend asks you if something’s wrong and you say, “No, why would anything be wrong?” when you’re actually really upset. It’s a way to express anger or hurt without confronting it directly, and it can destroy relationship communication.Talk about your feelings openly and honestly, but stay respectful.
Use “I”-statements, such as “I feel hurt that you didn’t call me on Tuesday when you said you would,” rather than “You forgot to call me and you hurt my feelings.” “You”-statements can make people feel defensive and shut down.
Communication isn’t a one-way street. You should also feel like she listens to you and acknowledges your needs, too.

, Work to understand what make her unique. Actively celebrate her uniqueness and work to promote and enable her to pursue and develop the core activities which bring her happiness and satisfaction.It’s great if you can find something you both love doing to pursue together. Occasionally, one or the other of you will have to compromise. For example, you may want to see an action movie while she wants to see the latest Pixar (or vice versa). Take turns giving the other person space to pursue what makes them happy.

, Much like giving her space, you should help her do the things that she wants to do for herself. This will usually mean letting her spend time working on the things that she wants to work on, like school or a skill, or doing those things with her. When she sees that you are someone who supports her in the things she wants for her life, she’ll know that you’re exactly what she needs., Be there for her always, as a friend and a confidant. Forgive her weaknesses quickly and work to fortify the best in her. Similarly, be open to her making you into the best person you can be. Committed love is a partnership, where you both bring out the best in each other. Hold yourself to that standard, as you get her to fall for you and beyond.

, People talk about ""friendzoning"" when a person does not reciprocate the affection another feels. But remember that you can do and be everything right, and that does not mean that she will fall in love with you. She is an individual with free will, not an object to be won in a video game.

Determine whether or not she is interested in you romantically.,
Send an opening text.,
Let her know how you feel about her first.,
Ask her to be your girlfriend.,
React appropriately.",How to Ask a Girl Out over Text2," In most cases, you should only ask a girl to be your girlfriend after you have gone on several dates and know that she is interested in you as more than just a friend; if you're younger and are used to asking girls to be your girlfriend before going on dates, then look for signs that she likes you, such as her blushing when you talk, or the fact that she waits for you after class. Having an idea of whether or not she likes you back can improve your chances when you ask.


If you have never spoken to her, don't know her very well, or know that she is already romantically involved with somebody else, then don't ask her out. There are plenty of other fish in the sea!
You don't have to be 100% sure about whether or not she likes you, but try to read her body language and words the next time you're together. Does she turn her body toward you, seem a bit nervous in your presence, or look excited to see you? If so, then these are pretty good signs that she might be interested.

, Start off by greeting her with something like ""Hey you,"" ""Hey, how have you been?"" or ""Hey, how is your day going?"" This will help ease into the conversation and prepare her for the question. Let the conversation flow naturally. There's no need to be extra clever right at the beginning or to make what you think is a hilarious comment. It's better to be direct and to stick to the point; she'll be impressed by your confidence if you don't dilly dally too much.


Though you may not know what every second of her day looks like, try to send it at a time when she is likely to not be too busy. For example, if you know she has soccer practice right after school, send it a few hours after that.

, Tell her that you enjoy spending time with her, and compliment the qualities that make her unique, explaining why you like spending time with her so much. Try saying something like ""I've really enjoyed spending these last few weeks with you,"" or ""You really make me feel special,"" or ""I've never felt this way about anybody before."" Whatever you choose to say, be honest and only say things that you really mean. That said, you don't need to go overboard with the praise.


Wait for her to respond before asking her to be your girlfriend. How she responds to statements like these will help you determine whether or not she's interested in a relationship with you without you having to ask her explicitly.
See if she reciprocates. If she says that she feels the same way about you, then go ahead and ask her if she wants to be your girlfriend. If she doesn't respond, or simply says ""thanks"" without telling you how she feels, then she might not be interested.
Don't smother her with compliments, as this can come across and insincere and overwhelming.

, There are several ways to phrase this question. You can ask her straight-out by saying something like ""Do you want to be my girlfriend?"" or ""Can I call you my girlfriend?"" or ""Do you want to become an official couple?"" Don't wait too long to pop the question. The sooner you ask it, the sooner you can move forward.


Alternatively, you can leave her with a more open-ended question like ""So where do you see this going?"" or ""Are you open to the idea of having a boyfriend?"" Open-ended questions like these show her that you genuinely care about her wants and needs, and are willing to compromise to make her happy. This can take some of the pressure off, though you may not be getting the answer you want.

, If she wants to be your girlfriend, then great! The first thing you can do is to suggest a fun, simple activity that you can do together, like going to a show or going bowling, and also pick a time and a place to meet. This can make her see that you're really serious about her and have put a lot of thought into your potential relationship.


If she's not interested, then be nice and thank her for talking to you. It's best to leave things on a good note so you can feel proud of your mature reaction.

Determine whether or not she already has a date, if possible.,
Send her a friendly text first.,
Ask her to the dance.,
Make the necessary plans.",How to Ask a Girl Out over Text3," If she has a boyfriend, then you can safely assume that she is going to the dance with him. If you're unsure of whether or not she has a date, then don't worry; ask her out anyway! You can try to ask your friends if they know, or even to ask her friends if she has a date, but be aware that this makes it likely that it will get back to her; you may be better off just winging it.


Don't ask a girl to ditch her current date if she already has one. It will be unfair to the other guy and will reflect poorly on you.
Make sure you do this early enough that you have higher chances of getting a favorable response. If we're talking about the prom, then you should ask at least a month or two in advance, at the least. If it's a more common school dance, then give it a few weeks to be safe.

, Get the conversation started by texting her something like ""Hey, how's it going?"" or ""Hey, what are you up to?"" Wait until she responds before asking her out, and let the conversation flow naturally. If she doesn't have your number, let her know who you are and how you got her number; you don't want her to be uncomfortable or to ignore the text because she doesn't know who it's coming from.

, You either do this by sending a straight-forward text saying ""Would you like to go to the dance with me?"" or by first asking her whether or not she has plans for the dance. If she says no, then say something like ""I'd love it if you came with me,"" or ""I think it'd be really fun if we went together.""


If you want to, you can even make a crack about your dancing skills or say something about how she can show you how to rock the dance floor. There's no need to take yourself too seriously here!

, If she says yes, congratulations! Now you will have to set up a time and place to meet, coordinate outfits if applicable, and decide on transportation. Don't be nervous about it—the hard part is over and now you can just relax and enjoy the ride.


Let her know that you are excited to go with her and that you think it's going to be a great time. This will make her feel special and have her looking forward to going with you.
If she says no or already has plans, then let her know that there are no hard feelings and end the conversation. Try to play it cool and say something like ""No worries, I hope you have fun anyway!""

Think about why you want to date a musician.,
Think about the sort of musician you want to date, and what instrument you'd prefer they play.,
Develop a working knowledge of the history of pop music, especially that surrounding your genre.,
Dress for success.,
Develop a creative interest if you don't already have one and cultivate it.,
Learn about your local underground music scene and start going to shows.,
If you don't seem to have things in common, move on; a good relationship is based on common interests, and you want a relationship.

,
Take some lessons in guitar/piano/violin/etc.",How to Date a Musician (for Girls)," Is it for the glamor? The cool factor? The connection to genius (or at least musical competence)? The thought that you might get songs written about you? These aren't the best reasons in the book, and it'd probably be best to be glamorous, cool, or creative yourself.;
, Do you want a hip indie rocker in tight pants? A Macho metal guy? A dramatic goth boy? A political punk? A down to earth folk guy? An unfathomable avant-garde musician? Do you want a cocky lead guitarist? A cool bass player? A nice drummer? A keyboard player? A sousaphone player? (Note: the author has no idea where to find a sousaphone player, let alone how to date one, best of luck.) (Sub-note: you can find a sousaphone player in your high school or college marching band. A sousaphone is essentially a tuba made for marching.)

, Also develop a working knowledge of cultural phenomenon surrounding that movement (key books, movies, etc) so that when speaking with the likely very music/pop culture focused musician you display an awareness of music beyond the usual groupie squealing.

, Develop a style that both fits in with, and stands out from other girls in your desired scene. Do not dress in an overtly sexual manner, this will only get you one night stands, usually with the least attractive guy in the band. This does not mean dress like a nun, it means dressing like you would on a date. Think classy (or well, intellectual, or generally not ""have me now wear"" depending on the genre, punks are rarely ""classy"") Basically, you don't want to look like a groupie, you want to look like a potential girlfriend.

, It's usually best if this interest isn't music unless you're already talented in that area, badly done music is a turn off for most musicians. Musician's are creative types so they usually date girls of similar temperament.

, Pick some potential targets, and find out who has a girlfriend (from my knowledge, girls who hit on guys with girlfriends often get very bad reputations in the music scene) and strike up a conversation with one of the guys you're interested in. Mention you like the band (but don't rhapsodize about how they're the best thing ever) talk about music for a bit (tell him how they remind you of one of the bands you learned about in your studies that sound like they influenced the band, and then go off on general bands you like), and ask questions about the musician (not about the band). Ask him where he grew up, where he got that shirt, that sort of thing. Remember, he's probably sick of talking about the band.

,, This will not only improve your knowledge of music, it may even make you smarter than your prospective musician boyfriend, especially if he plays guitar or drums (no offense to guitarists and drummers). There's nothing better than having a partner who can give new insights into improving one's own craft. Girls who seem very educated in music (without being condescending) and are also passionate about it are very attractive to musicians. Note: You don't have to have a PhD to get the knowledge needed to impress him. Just read a few music theory books and you'll have him in awe.

Get creative.",How to Ask a Girl Out in Fifth Grade," If you want to ask a girl out, then she should know who you are and have some kind of a relationship or friendship with you. You don't have to be best buddies, but she has to know you before you ask her out so she isn't totally thrown off guard. Talk to her after class, say hi on the playground, or even talk to her for a few minutes after school. Let her know a little bit about yourself, like if you have a sister or what sports you like, or what you like to do after school.


If you really don't know her at all, just go up to her and say ""Hi,"" or ""What's up?"" She'll like that you're comfortable with talking to her as long as you don't come on too strong.;
, The girl should have an idea that you like her before you ask her out. She doesn't have to know for sure that you think she's really awesome, but she should have a sense that you think she's a cool girl before you ask her out so she's ready for your question. Just smile at her, compliment something she's wearing, or just pay a little bit of extra attention to her. For example, if she's standing with a group of her friends, make a point of saying hi to her first. Her friends will giggle at you, but that's part of the fun.


If you do know each other, then use her name the next time you talk to her. Say, ""Hi, Mandi, what's up?"" and she'll feel more special.
You shouldn't pay too much attention to her. Make her wonder whether or not you're thinking of her and she'll like you even more.
Flirt with her a little bit. Just be playful and tease her a little, making sure that you don't hurt her feelings.

, Though you don't have to know 100% whether she wants to go out with you or not, it will help to have an idea of whether she likes you before you take the plunge so you have more confidence and don't scare her. It would help to know if she has a crush on someone else or if she's going out with someone else, and to have an idea of what she thinks of you.


If you pass by her, does she blush, look away, or say hi to you? Or does she ignore you completely?
If you want to know what she thinks, you can try to ask your friends. Just don't ask her friends or they'll report right back to her and she'll know you like her.
If you want to know if she likes you, see how her friends act when you pass by her. Do they giggle, nudge her, or even tease you? If so, then there's a good chance she likes you.

, You shouldn't just ask the girl out on the spur of the moment, or you won't be prepared and won't know what to say. Though your choices of where to ask can be pretty limited in the 5th grade, your best bets are probably after school, in your neighborhood, or somewhere where you can get her alone without creeping her out. You don't want to isolate her too much since she's probably not used to being alone with guys, but try to do it so her friends aren't spying on you.


You can ask her to meet up after school, or just find her after school and talk to her. Just make sure she's not distracted and in a good mood.

, If you want to ask her out, then you can't just ask her out and then look confused when she does say yes. You have to think of something to do! Maybe you want to go to the carnival together. Maybe you want to go out for a slice of pizza or you know she likes to play video games and you can invite her over. Maybe you want to walk around the mall together or just see a new movie that's playing. The more specific your plan, the more likely she will be to say yes.


Saying something like, ""I see that (name of movie here) is playing. Do you want to go check it out with me?"" will make you sound much more confident than just saying, ""Will you go out with me?""

, Again, this part just means that her friends aren't breathing down your neck. See if you can get her to talk to you right after school, at a birthday party, or some place where you can steal a few minutes alone with her, like a school dance. Try not to ask her before school or she might still be tired and it could be awkward if she says no and then you have to be near her the whole day.


Try asking her at recess. That's a popular time for guys to ask girls out. Again the tricky part will be trying to separate her from her friends.

, If you want the girl to say yes, she has to think you know what you're talking about. Don't get too nervous, stutter, fidget, kick your feet, or look at the floor. Look her in the eyes and smile. Make her think that you're totally comfortable talking to her so that she feels more comfortable, too. Walk right up to her, wave, and say, ""Hi.""


You can practice this move in front of the mirror to feel more confident.
Remember that the worst thing that can happen is that she can say no. That won't be the end of the world, will it?

, You should say just a few things before you jump in and ask her out. Saying, ""Hi, will you go out with me?"" probably won't go over well. You should just say something like, ""How are you?"" ""How was your day?"" or ""Are you doing anything fun after school?"" And maybe tell her a thing or two about what you've been up to before you make your move. This will make her feel more comfortable and will hint at what is coming.


You can think of one thing to tell her or one thing to ask her in advance so you feel more comfortable when the time comes.

, Compliment her or just tell her that you really like her and say, ""Do you want to go out with me?"" It's as simple as that. You can practice this in front of the mirror to get more comfortable, too. You shouldn't be hanging out with her for more than a few minutes without asking her or she'll start to get confused. Just take a deep breath, look her in the eyes, and spit it out. You'll feel much better once you finally ask her.


Read her body language. Is she moving closer to you, smiling, and acting a little nervous? If so, then she's more likely to say yes.

, There are two things that will happen: either she says yes or she says no. If she says yes, then that's great! Let her know how happy you are without acting too over-excited and maybe give her a little hug if you know each other pretty well. Then, you can suggest the place where you'd like to go and start planning your next moves.


If she says no, keep your head up and thank her for talking to you and being nice anyway. Don't resort to name calling or be mean or she won't have any respect for you. Be a good sport about it and start thinking about your next crush.

, This is another cute way to ask her out. If you know where she sits, leave a simple note in her desk that says that you like her asking her if she'll go out with you. Just make sure that she will actually find it right away, and that she'll be alone when she does. If she discovers it with a group of her friends, they will tease you both. Keep it short. Just say, I like you. Will you go out with me? and you'll get the point across.

, Give her a cute pair of earrings, a bouquet of flowers, or a nice notebook that she can write in. The gift can have a message in it asking her out or you can give her the gift while you ask her out. Make sure it is really small, so she doesn't feel awkward if she says no to you.

, Though this isn't something you should do when you get a bit older and more experienced, if you're only ten years old or so, it's okay to have one of your friends talk to her to see if she likes you first. This will take some of the pressure off and will make you feel less bad if it doesn't work out.

, Though you're officially too young to be on Facebook, if you're both active on other social media or if you just have email accounts, this could be another cute way to ask her out. Just make sure she checks her account regularly so you know whether or not she got your question.

, If it's around the holidays, Valentine's Day, her birthday, or just because, then you can give her a cute card complimenting her that asks her if she wants to go out with you. She'll feel special because you made the extra effort of getting her a card and will see that you put some thought into asking her out. This will also make you look more mature.

, If you're really brave and creative, then you can think of an infinite amount of ways to ask her out. Throw her a paper airplane that asks her if she wants to go out with you. Serenade her at recess; in this case you can show her a there's a more sensitive side to you by writing her a song.Give her a cookie that asks her out in the frosting. Make her a bookmark that asks her out and sneak it into the book she is reading. Being more creative will mean that you have to put yourself out there a little more, but if you have nothing to lose, this will be a great way to catch her eye.

Online dating is perfect because everyone there is looking to find love, and you can read the profiles to determine whether someone would be a good match. Once you message back and forth with someone, you can arrange to meet up in-person.

Be honest in your dating profile. You may be tempted to lie about your job, height, or interests, but the lie will eventually come out.Keep an open mind. Even if you might not click one hundred percent with someone's profile, you might connect with them after messaging.;
, Many people find their partner through websites promoting what they love. If you're into a certain sport, TV series, or hobby, join a website for fans of that thing. As you chat with other members, you may find one that you have a lot in common with. You can then start messaging and getting to know her on a personal level., As outlandish as it may initially seem, some people find their significant others through virtual reality sites like Second Life or World of Warcraft.Talk to other players and get to know them. If you click with one of the players, ask them if you could add them on social media so you can message them.

Don't join an online gaming site specifically to meet women. Women on these gaming sites will be most interested in dating you if you share a passion for the game, not if you're looking for love.

, Some universities offer online social groups for those who graduated. Others are started up on social media websites by former students. Google alumni groups for the university you went to and get to know others in the group. You never know: you might connect with an alumnus nearby., Too much information about yourself, or too much intimate information, could chase away the other person. Save deeper conversations for after you get to know each other. While your first messages should have a good amount of information, avoid writing a novel: the other person might be intimidated and avoid responding.Also, keep from saying too much about yourself. Focus your messages on her and genuinely try getting to know her instead of impressing her., In online dating, original and open-ended questions will give you more responses than a simple, ""How are you?"" If you met them via online dating sites, read their profile and craft questions based on their likes. Open-ended questions (one that can't be answered by just ""yes"" or ""no"") are ideal because you'll get to know the other person more quickly.If you met them on another site, ask questions based on what you already know about them. For example, ask someone you met on an online gaming website how they got into gaming. Ask someone you met on an alumni group what they majored in and what they're up to now.
Don't just send a form message to everyone. Personalize the questions based on her specifically. This will show her that you care about her and that you have mutual hobbies.

, You may be tempted to tell a girl how beautiful her profile picture is, but instead tell her you think it's awesome she's into soccer or that she has a great sense of humor. Compliments about inner beauty instead of outer beauty feel more genuine.Men who send more general, personality-oriented compliments to potential dates over physical compliments receive more replies. People like to be complimented on who they are, not what they look like., Spend time getting to know each other before you decide to meet up. The more you know each other, the higher your potential to click in real life will be. Go with the flow, and when you feel comfortable with her, suggest meeting up in person.

Consider leaving it up to her to suggest meeting in-person. Some women may feel nervous meeting a stranger in-person, and letting her decide will give her control over the situation.

, Pick a safe space for your first date: a restaurant, gym, or outdoor park are all great places to meet up. Although you two have been chatting online, you still don't know her that well. Meeting in a public spot will be safest for both of you.While men say that their favorite place for first dates is restaurants, women prefer coffee shops. Keep in mind that a casual location might help her feel more comfortable., If you can't be bothered to show up on time, your date will feel like you don't care about her. Respect her time and show up at the determined time. Act respectful and avoid making offensive jokes or accidentally insulting her. You want to make a good, thoughtful first impression., For your first date, focus on broad and positive topics. Avoid getting into a debate with your date, especially if you tend towards heated conversations. Steer from mentioning previous relationships, especially if you're not quite over your ex. Mentioning an ex-lover on the first date tells her that you're already comparing her to that person. No woman wants that.

You may have heard that the golden rule for first dates is avoiding politics, but this is actually not true. If you both enjoy politics, go ahead and talk about it but remember to respect her opinions even if different from yours., Treat her as if you believe she already likes you. Worrying about whether she wants a second date later will only make you nervous, and you could accidentally sabotage any chemistry blossoming between you two. She agreed to meet up, so she's likely open to dating you. This date is time to see if you're mutually attracted to each other.

Remember, you don't look as anxious as you feel. People tend to overestimate the visibility of their own anxiety. If you don't feel confident, fake it until you make it., After the first date, don't retreat! Thank her via a quick message for a good time and, later, ask her if she's interested in a second date. Continue dating and communicating frequently, whether by text message or conversation in-person.

Sometimes finding someone interested in a second date may take time. If the first person you meet with declines, don't beat yourself up. Keep getting to know people and keep dating.

, Emotional intimacy takes time to develop. As it blossoms, you'll find your relationship with her strengthening. As you continue going on dates, slowly get to know her on a deeper level. When you feel comfortable, share more personal thoughts and feelings with her. She may follow suit when she feels ready., A ""DTR"" conversation stands for ""define the relationship."" After you two have gone on multiple dates and had lots of conversations, ask her whether she wants to start dating exclusively. If so, discuss where the relationship is going and how you want to proceed.Try to keep the conversation light and comfortable. Starting the conversation with, ""What are we?"" can make her feel anxious.
Let her know that you care about her no matter what and that you'll respect her choice, even if she doesn't want to be in a relationship.

, If she says she doesn't want to be your girlfriend, don't blame yourself. She may not be ready for commitment at this time, or the two of you might not connect romantically. Thank her for being honest and, if you feel comfortable, work to maintain a relationship as friends. Be kind and dignified, and respect her choices.

Sometimes, raw feelings may get in the way of keeping a friendship. If you need space to process your emotions, let her know.
Don't give up! When you're ready, return to dating online. In time, you may find ""the one.""

Try to compromise.",How to Date a Confident Girl," You don’t have to look like you’ve stepped off the runway, but you should take pride in your appearance when you’re planning to ask out a confident girl. That’s because she likely makes an effort to look good, and will expect the same from a potential date.Take care of all basic grooming habits, so you appear clean and neat when you talk to her.
You don’t have to wear the most expensive, trendy clothes, but your outfit should be clean and fit well.;
, A confident girl is usually going to want you to be confident as well, so you can’t wait for her to talk to you. Show her that you have plenty of your own confidence by having the guts to walk up to her and start a conversation.If you’re having trouble working up the confidence to approach a girl, try to do it in a situation where she’s more likely to be receptive, such as at a party or bar. In most cases, she’s more likely to be friendly when she’s in a social setting.
Remember to smile and maintain eye contact when you go to talk to her. If you keep your eyes down and fidget, she’s going to know that you’re nervous.

, Confident girls are direct themselves, so that’s what they typically want in their partners. That means you shouldn’t come up with some lame excuse for approaching her, such as pretending that you need directions or her advice on what to get your friend’s girlfriend for her birthday. Instead, make it clear from the start that you’re interested in her and want to make a connection.If you haven’t been formally introduced, you might go up to her and say, “I saw you across the room and had to come over and introduce myself.”
If you already know each other, you can approach her and say, “I’ve been thinking about you ever since the last time we talked.”
You can also try offering up a compliment that makes your interest clear, such as “You know, your smile lights up the room,” or “You’re the most beautiful girl in the room, hands down.”

, A confident girl is going to want to know that you’re genuinely interested in her and who she is, so you shouldn’t necessarily ask her out right after you approach her. Instead, start a conversation to get to know her better. Avoid simple yes or no questions that can slow down a chat. Open-ended questions are a better option because they give her an opportunity to really express herself.If she’s in school, you might ask her what her favorite classes are and why.
If she’s a frequent traveler, you might ask her to recommend some can’t-miss destinations.
Pay attention to what she says, and use it to build off of to keep the conversation going. For example, if she mentions that she’s a big football fan, you can tell her about the big game that you went to last weekend.

, Once you’ve gotten to know each other a little, it’s time to ask for a date. Don’t be vague -- asking “Would you maybe like to go out sometime?” isn’t going to impress a confident girl. Instead, make a concrete offer, such as “Would you like to get together tomorrow night?”It’s best not to make your first date something formal like dinner. Instead, go for something casual, such as grabbing a cup of coffee or a walk through a local park. That will keep things relaxed and low-key.

, While trying to make her jealous by mentioning your ex or flirting with other girls on social media may seem like a good way to get her attention, a confident girl isn’t going to feel threatened by other girls. In fact, she’s more likely to be annoyed so the ploy will probably backfire on you anyway.It’s inevitable that past relationships will come up in conversation when you’re dating someone -- and that’s okay. It only becomes a problem if you’re trying to use your ex to get a rise out of your current girlfriend.

, Because she doesn’t usually get jealous or irrational, a confident girl isn’t going to understand if you do. Don’t try to go through her phone when she’s not looking or guess her social media passwords so you can go through her accounts. Instead, try to be confident in your relationship and trust your girlfriend.If you’re concerned that there is a problem in your relationship, such as her relationship with an ex, just ask her about it. She’ll appreciate the direct approach, and is more likely to be honest with you.

, When it comes to making decisions in the relationship, a confident girl isn’t going to want to do all the work herself. She’s going to expect you to know what you want and be able to express that clearly.Even when it comes to a simple decision, such as where you should go for dinner, don’t say, “I don’t know” or “I don’t care.” Offer up a concrete suggestion, so the two of you can make a decision together.

, Just because a girl is confident doesn’t mean that she doesn’t like to hear about her strengths from other people sometimes, so don’t let those things go unsaid. Be supportive and tell her about the things you like best about her on a regular basis.Don’t limit your compliments to her physical appearance. Sure, she’ll appreciate hearing that she’s pretty, but she likely wants to be valued as a complete person. Compliment her intelligence, strength, kindness, and other positive qualities as often as you tell her that she looks beautiful in a certain dress.

, If you’re both strong, confident individuals, then you’re going to disagree sometimes. That’s actually part of a healthy relationship because differences of opinion allow you to learn from one another. The key is to focus on the issues that you disagree on and not attack each other. When you’re frustrated, it can be easy to resort to name-calling and low blows. Do your best to avoid sinking to that level because a confident girl probably isn’t going tolerate that kind of behavior.
Keep your tone of voice in mind. If you’re yelling to try to get your point across, chances are your girlfriend isn’t going to hear you. However, if you maintain a calm, even tone as you explain your feelings, she’s much more likely to take what you’re saying to heart.

, A confident girl is probably going to be able to express herself pretty well, so she’ll have no trouble telling you how she feels or what she thinks about your relationship. For a healthy, balanced relationship, you’ll need to do the same and tell the truth about how you feel. She doesn’t want to have to guess how you feel about her or how committed you are to the relationship.You have to be willing to open up to her even if you aren’t sure how she’ll react. Holding in your feelings may only lead to bigger problems down the road.
If you’re feeling like your relationship isn’t a priority for her or she doesn’t value your opinion, tell her. She may not be aware that she’s making you feel that way, so the only way to be certain is to express your feelings. If it turns out that she isn’t as committed to the relationship as you are, you’re better off knowing that, so you can decide whether you should move on.

, Being a good listener is part of developing effective communication skills, which means you shouldn’t interrupt or talk over her. She's going to want a partner who takes her feelings and opinions seriously, and you can't do that if you don't hear what she's saying. If you’re having trouble really processing what she’s saying, try rephrasing what she’s just said in your own words to ensure that you’re listening and understanding what she’s telling you., A confident girl doesn’t have a problem owning up to her mistakes, so she’s going to expect the same from you. If you’ve hurt her feelings or forgotten about a date, apologize and try to learn from the mistake., In a relationship between two strong, confident people, give and take is a necessity. If you make small concessions for her in a conflict or disagreement, it’s more likely that she’ll do the same for you, so both of you can feel like you have an equal say in the relationship.Don’t keep score. Not all compromises mean that you’re meeting in the middle. In some cases, you might have to concede more than she does and vice versa. If you compromise a little more than her on what to do on Friday night, that doesn’t mean that she “owes” you the next time you disagree. The goal is to find a solution that makes both of you as happy as possible on a case by case basis.

Real girls (girls with a strong sense of purpose and self-worth) don't like guys who have no lives or who cling to them like plastic wrap . Some girls do like that, but for all the wrong reasons—either they're insecure and needy for attention, or they're control freaks who have a need for dominating guys. Unless you want to sign up for one of those scenarios, focus filling your time with your own friendships, interests, hobbies, and goals. This also gives her a chance to do something with you without it becoming a date.;
, Keep yourself well groomed and in shape. If you want to get a girl to like you, basic cleanliness and appearance are extremely important. Girls notice things like bad breath, flab, body odor and greasy hair before they notice that winning personality. Give them a chance to see your good qualities by making a good first impression with your appearance.









Stay in shape. Work out regularly: run a mile or two, do some sit ups, get a six pack, etc. Note that while fitness is important, you shouldn't overdo it; having too many muscles can make it look like you care more about going to the gym than fostering meaningful relationships. Also, some girls dislike having the Incredible Hulk as a boyfriend, and it makes you look slightly stupid - thanks to the dumb jock cut-out. So make it clear you're fit, but not thick. In other words, stay fit without being obsessive or a pair of walking biceps.
Have good personal hygiene. Brush your teeth, shave etc. If you can't have access to a toothbrush, carry breath mints. When you take care of yourself, it makes you more appealing to others and it will thus have a positive impact on your level of confidence. Always be sure to smell and look nice, so shower regularly and nothing is worse than the post-gym stink out, so use deodorant.

, It's unlikely a girl will be at all interested in you if she doesn't know you exist. Make an effort to talk to her, even if approaching her seems scary at first. Highlight your compatibility as friends and more by talking about hobbies and interests that you have in common. Become her friend; she can't get close to you unless you're friends.









Find a hobby you both like. It doesn't matter if it is anything from sports to school. If you both like hockey, invite her to a game. If you both like video games, play one together, or she could cheer you on if she doesn't usually play. Girls are all different in likes and dislikes.
If your conversation skills need a polish, read a few of these:

How to have a great conversation
How to come up with good conversation topics

How to start a conversation when you don't have anything to talk about.



, Telling jokes or funny stories is a classic way to make a person laugh, but not the only way. Be bold and think of some antics that will make her laugh, like clowning around. Find out which are her favourite comedians, funny movies, or sitcoms. Watch them with her. Tell her to dare you to do something, then do it (as long as it's not illegal, of course). Laughter will come by itself if both of you are relaxed and enjoying each others company. The more she laughs, the more she wants - and she will want more.








, Girls don't just fall for random strangers. (Well, some do, but the relationship never goes very far!) Start being friendly to her in a non-invasive way. Get to know her and begin hanging out as friends.









If you're in the same lecture or tutorial as her, find out her name. Every time she walks into the room, smile and wave at her. Sometimes this is all it takes for a young woman to notice you. At the same time though, don't do this too often; It will just end up looking like you're obsessed with her. If you're worried, greet some of your girl friends as they enter, too. If she doesn't seem to see you, when she walks by, just say ""Hi _______,"" in a friendly way, but don't interrupt the class or any conversation she's holding.
If she's shy, she might just smile back, so don't take this as a sign that she doesn't like you.
If you want your relationship to move ahead faster, don't get stuck in the quicksand - that is, the 'Friend Zone'. Sometimes, a girl won't go out with you because she's afraid if the relationship will end badly, but that she'll lose your friendship! To start moving things along, be a little flirty; a woman will only be intimate with a man she knows, trusts and cares about, and this can only be achieved with taking the time to get to know her through friendly chat. However, don't come on too quickly - part of the fun of the relationship is the chase - and have patience. Girls HATE being forced into something, especially on the relationship front.

, Being flirty will help keep you out of the friend zone because it will remind the girl that you're attractive as well as a good friend. When you see or meet a girl you like, make brief eye contact and smile. Strike up a casual, flirty conversation and see how she reacts. If you avoid her eyes and act nervous, she's going to go into overdrive working out what on earth you mean. Girls react mainly on body language and emotions. If you make them feel happy, they'll see you as fun and caring. If you creep them out, they will get nervous - in the options between fight or flight, flight is the most preferable.










Relax. Chill. Don't put pressure on yourself or her by thinking of her as the girl of your dreams. Try not to stress about what will happen if you make a bad joke or say the wrong thing. She may be just as nervous, and small mistakes will likely go unnoticed or will simply be ignored. Don't worry if flirting seems difficult at first. The more you talk to girls, the more relaxed you'll become. Girls often are the most jumpy because of the thousands of different responses their brain puts together at every word. They stress over picking the right one, and that sets them so flustered that they'll barely notice the bad joke from trying to relieve your awkwardness.
Enjoy interacting with this attractive, friendly girl whose path crossed yours. While you don't want to stress yourself out, remember that the final goal is to get her to like you. Don't say things that will seem too forward or offensive. Mostly, the same girl is getting to like YOU.

, If you really like someone, you probably appreciate a lot of things about her. Why not let her know? If anything is different or new (her hairstyle, nail polish colour, shirt, etc.), make note of it. The more unique the compliment, the better received it will be.









Most girls like being complimented on something that makes them distinct, not something that plenty of other girls have. If you compliment her appearance, try to be original, perhaps by specifying a particular feature. Better yet, compliment her personality or skills. If you're not sure what's good or bad complimenting, read How to Compliment Girls.
Don't tell her she's beautiful too often. If she's very pretty, it's likely that several other guys have already mentioned it to her; it may sound trite after a while. If you're going to compliment her, stand out by making comments about her personality, how good she is at something, how she does things, etc. Complimenting her appearance too much may make her think you're shallow and maybe that you just want to have sex with her, and you don't want to give that impression.

, There's no one-size-fits-all solution here. What impresses one girl might make another roll her eyes. Your best bet is to be yourself. Demonstrate a unique skill, talent or something difficult to do that you're proud of, something that sets you apart from the crowd. Not only will this make her feel good about you, but it can boost your confidence, too.









Be careful not to be cocky. Impress her, but do not boast too much about your great achievements and plans. While self confidence is an attractive quality, extreme cockiness is a huge turnoff for most girls.

, There are several ways to touch a girl without being sleazy. Hold her coat while she puts it on. Offer her your hand when she's stepping on an uneven surface. Hold out your hand so you can lead her through a crowd, catch her if she stumbles, and hug and high-five her when she's euphoric. If she's worried, put your hand lightly on her shoulder to comfort her. These are all polite ways to get a little closer to someone without being creepy.









Girls feel touch more sensitively than most men, even if they put up a tough front, so make sure the touching is light; for example, don't slap her on the back, but pat her on the shoulder. If you see any signs of discomfort, stop!

, After there’s a bit of mutual attraction, start throwing out low-level “bait”—little jokes that hint at interest—to see if she bites. A good baiting statement should be light and playful, and usually ambiguous. ""Baiting” is how women flirt too, so be on the lookout for things she might be “joking” about or things that could have a double meaning.









There’s a certain look a woman will give you if you get that right (and if she’s the right girl to begin with). It’s like you gave her the secret handshake. She’ll look back at you for a couple of seconds, wondering if you “get it” or if you just accidentally stumbled on the right words. When she does this, hold eye contact, half-smile, and don’t react otherwise. This is like being one point of the world's high score: it's probably the most fragile moment in the history of both of you. Wait for her to say the next thing, and cross your fingers it'll be yes.

, Don't be pushy or needy. Nice girls normally need longer time than boys to develop deep feelings. Continue courting her by following the steps above, but don't rush things. If you end up in a relationship with this girl, she'll always remember how you made her feel when you were just getting to know each other.









Make her feel appreciated, not invisible or smothered. Do the chase slowly and gently (but steadily) to reduce fear of sexual advances (if any), avoid looking desperate, and to allow her to get accustomed to a new man in her life. Do not force the relationship; carefully look for clues on where and when you can see her again.

, Once you feel comfortable, invite her to go somewhere or to do something with you. Make sure it's something that you're both interested in. If you want, show her your world. Bring her somewhere that you feel comfortable and preferably, where you have or do something you're proud of.


Alternatively, you can express interest in seeing her world. Is she a musician? Ask if you can see her perform. Is she a mathematician? Ask to read her report or thesis.
If you aren't yet ready or comfortable with the idea of sharing your personal lives to that extent, just go out for lunch or do something simple together where you can get to know her better.

, Chivalry is not dead. Keep it up by opening doors, holding an umbrella over her, carrying stuff when she has her hands full, lending her your jumper, and basically caring for her. The mark of a true gentleman is to a lady feel like a lady. Girls want to feel important and valued. When communicating with her, make an effort to say more rather than less and to keep things personal rather than generic. When you want to ask her out or to do something with you, ask in person, preferably at her home. She needs to know that you're prepared to go the extra mile and not wuss out on her.

, The stereotypical icons of romance (roses, candles, chocolate and teddy bears) can only go so far. Think about what really gets that special someone excited. Recognize what makes her unique; find and do things that only she would appreciate. Being romantic means acknowledging how special a person is, and that means demonstrating that you know––better than anyone else in the world—–what makes her unique.


Pay attention when she's talking! Keep a mental list of things that she loves and that make her unique. What are her quirky (perhaps secret) interests, obsessions and fantasies? What makes her eyes light up? Girls are quick to notice if you remember things they told you a long while ago.

, Tell her what you really enjoy in life, what gets you excited and find out what gets her excited. Be positive. If you had a bad day, still greet her pleasantly with a big smile. Most importantly, listen to everything she says. Whether she talks about herself, her family, or her hobbies, pay attention. Some things could be useful or important to know later in the relationship. Nod to show that you're listening, and also respond to what she says so she knows that you really are listening. Women are very appreciative of guys who demonstrate sincere interest in what they say.

, You are unique. Be the authentic you. Bring out your best. Let her know you as who you truly are. Use your talents, gifts, and strengths and let yourself be known. If you have great sense of humor, share that with her. If you love science, music, poetry, politics, or sports, let her know what you love. The right woman will fall for you and love you just the way you are.

If your boyfriend or girlfriend wants to meet your parents, be ready to explain.",How to Date Without Your Parents Knowing," You're going to be lying to your parents constantly about something that is a big deal. Yes, it is a big deal. It matters enough to them to consider that you're not yet ready to date, so you must really think through the consequences of lying constantly and the potential of being caught out. Think about the following before going ahead with dating without telling them:


You cannot share the joy of your feelings with your parents.
You are lying all of the time. Not just once, twice or thrice, but constantly. That will wear you down eventually.
Things are bound to slip up somewhere. A mistaken word, a chance meeting, another parent making a comment...
Your parents have a good reason for forbidding the dating. Perhaps it's best to talk about that reason thoroughly before making your decision.;
, You have decades ahead of you to find that special person. This isn't a do or die decision, even if it feels like it at the time.

, Tell your parents that a guy or girl would like to date you and that you would like to do so. Explain that you understand they don't wish to permit it but give them plenty of reasons why you can be trusted, and give them plenty of leeway to make conditions that control the dating, such as being in a group only and getting home early after each date. This may be much better than creeping about and lying all of the time.


Read How to tell your parents you have a boyfriend for more information to help you.

, This way, your parents won't get suspicious as your date will be just one of the group.

, If your boyfriend or girlfriend asks you on a date, tell your parents that you're going out with your best friend, who has to be the same gender as you. Your best friend must be willing to cover for you, if needed. Another alternative is to say that you're going on a girls/guys night out.

, Think twice, and even three times, before using Facebook or Myspace to talk to your boyfriend/girlfriend.

,,, Once you start dating a guy/girl, it's probable that you'll be feeling really excited and happy. Most people will notice this change or ""glow"" that has come over you, and will surmise what's up. It's going to be even more evident if you're normally morose or glum. If your parent asks you what's up, just say something like ""I just don't think that it's right to be gloomy all the time, I'm trying to change and be more appreciative of everything"".

, Realize that this charade may have to go on for ages, and that's something you've got to carry within you and keep acting as if things are normal on the outside. Try to hide your relationship as much as possible until the pair of you break up or your parents decide you can start dating. When they tell you that you can start dating come home from school the next day, and tell them the news.

, If your parents pop the dreaded question, ""Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?"", tell them that you don't, nor have you thought about getting one. It's an outright lie, and if they have evidence to the contrary, realize that you'll have walked right into a trap and things will probably not proceed that well from here.

, If you can't hide it from your friends, only explain it to a few mutual friends and make them swear not to tell anyone. If they do tell someone, tell them that you are upset and not to tell anyone else. If the person that your friend told starts telling people, tell them to stop. If they don't stop tell them that it was a joke that you and your friend are playing on each other.

, Explain why you can't do this at the time.

Some methods for increasing confidence include:Eliminate negative thoughts about yourself. If you notice that you often have thoughts pop into your head that put yourself down, try to work on silencing and not dwelling on those thoughts.
Focus on others. One common trait of unconfident people is that they're too in their own heads. Try to focus more on what's going on around you, and what people are doing and saying.
Learn to accept failure. The truth is, you're going to rejected, and social situations of all sorts are not always going to go your way. Acceptance of this fact will take you far in terms of gaining confidence.;
, It may seem obvious, but it's worth saying that people with interests are more interesting. Find your passions and things to do beyond schooling, working, and socializing, and you will greatly increase your ability to attract girls. What interests you should develop are completely up to you. Think about what you like, and what hobbies you already have, and then find ways to pursue them further.For example, if you like computers, consider learning how to program as a hobby. There are many free websites that can be used to learn how to code.

, Simply put, the more in the loop you are about what people are talking about, the better conversationalist you're going to be. Sharing our thoughts and feelings about popular culture, such as movies, shows, and music, is one of the most common way through which people first bond with each other and establish friendships. And knowing about current events will make you a more worldly, informed person, which is attractive.Find a news website you like and start browsing it on a regular basis.
Talk to your friends about what shows and movies they've been into recently, and what music they've been listening to. You don't have to like everything that's popular, just learn what's out there and what you think of it.

, Girls like people who take care of themselves. Putting in a little extra effort in your hygiene will give you an advantage over most people.Brush your teeth and floss daily.
Get regular haircuts and wash and condition your hair regularly.
Always wear deodorant. And body wash is your friend.

, Believe it or not, girls care about the way you dress. Most people put very little effort into their outfits, so do yourself a favor and put some thought into the way you dress. Foremost, sure your clothes are always clean. Your clothes are a method of self-expression so find a style that reflects your personality and rock it., If the girl you like is someone you don't already have some kind of friendship with, you'll need to start by making yourself known to her. It's up to you where and how you do this but some of the best places are: at school, in the cafeteria or the classroom before or after class starts, at a party or live music show in-between bands, or at some sort of social hobby, like cooking classes or yoga. Just find a reason to talk to her a little and exchange names. Keep it simple.


What you say to her when you approach matters much less than being confident and friendly when you do it. When in doubt, just compliment her on something she's wearing. If you say it sincerely with a warm smile, there's a good chance she'll be open to talking to you.Often times, the best and easiest way to start a conversation with anyone, including the girl you like, is to comment on something that's going on around you. For example, at a live music show, ask her what songs she's looking forward to hearing the headliner play.

, Once you know each other well enough that it's not unusual for the two of you to have a few short conversations here and there, ask her for her number, that way you can talk to her through texting as well. If you know some of the people she sits with at lunch, ask if you can join them sometimes, or invite her to sit with you and your friends during lunch. Or, for example, if you go to the same yoga class, ask if she wants to join you and your friends for lunch after class.Add her on Facebook too for good measure. That way you'll have another avenue to interact with her. Liking some of her statuses and noticing whether she does the same is a good way to subtly gauge her interest in you. It's been shown that people who are interested in each other tend to interact on Facebook more.Be careful not to text her too much or try to be around her constantly, as this can come across as trying too hard.

, After you've introduced yourself, look for opportunities to get more familiar with her. If you have a class with her, don't be afraid to strike up conversations. Say hi to her in the mornings as you pass her in the hall, or as you clock in for work. If you're friendly to her regularly than she'll likely be friendly back.

, One of the most important part of making a good impression on a girl is being a good listener. When you talk to her, you should both be talking about the same amount, or, if she's talkative, let her talk a little more than you. And when she does talk, take an interest in what she's saying, and respond in a way that lets her know you're listening. The three keys to being a good listener are:Pay attention, in other words, don't be thinking about anything other than what she's saying. If she's talking about what she did over the weekend, don't be thinking about what you did over the weekend at the same time.
Make your interest in her words clear, through body language and facial expressions that react to what she's saying. The most basic example of this is nodding and saying ""uh-huh"" in an interested tone when she completes ideas, to show that you've heard and understand.
Give feedback, in the form of questions about what she's saying, and statements about how you can relate. For example, if she says she wants to get a cat once she moves to her new apartment, ask her if she had any pets growing up.

, Humor is one of the best ways to get a girl to like you. If you can get her to laugh regularly, then she'll like being around you. Everyone has their own style of humor, so the best thing to do is to let it come naturally. Make funny comments on things going on around you. Ideally, she'll even join in on the banter with you., Compliments do two good things, they make a girl feel special and appreciated, and they hint that you're interested in her, without being too forward. Don't compliment her constantly as that will come off as disingenuous. Just compliment her when something she does really stands out to you in a good way.Some of the best things to compliment girls on include: her clothes, her academic successes, positive traits in her personality, or her skill at a hobby she enjoys.

, If you want to be more than just friends with a girl, you'll have to behavior accordingly. That means flirting. Flirting is just special attention you give someone that you wouldn't give to a normal friend.There are many ways to flirt, such as:


Non-invasive touches like touching her upper arm when making a point or sitting next to her so your legs slightly touch.
Occasional eye contact with her that lasts longer than normal conversational eye contact.
Playful teasing about little things. This is best done when the conversation is non-serious.

, Girls will notice how you behave around her friends and her family, and they do care. Treating her friends with kindness and not like they are a burden to be dealt with will go a long way when it comes to attracting the girl you like. Depending on her relationship with her parents, this might even go doubly for them. Always be polite and kind when in the company of her parents. If you're invited over for dinner, bring a gift, offer to help with the dishes, and compliment the cook. Treating her parents and friends well isn't hard, but it is essential.

, Finally, once you've established a friendship and given her reason to believe you're interested in her, it's time to put your cards on the table. Ask her out on a date, and make sure that she knows it's a date. You can either do this by actually using the word ""date,"" or you can say something like ""it's my treat,"" or ""I want to do something with just the two of us,"" and pay for whatever it is you two do. Some date ideas include getting lunch, seeing a movie, or going to a park.If she doesn't accept, don't sweat it. Maybe she just needs to know you better first. It's not worth wondering what you could have done differently.

, On the first date, regardless of where it is, there are certain behaviors to avoid. Don't be late of course. Avoid using your phone, as that can easily become rude, and avoid talking too much. The conversation should be either be equal, or let her do more of the talking, and just be a good listener.It's important to make the first date feel differently than your previous interactions as just friends. This means you have to really open up, and be vulnerable.Signs of a good date include: lots of laughter, a combination of fun conversation and deep conversation, lots of eye contact and smiling, and most importantly, leaving the date feeling like you've really bonded.
This best way to make a good first date likely is to focus on three simple things: relax, be your whole and honest self, and focus on your desire to get to know her.

If you want to get a boy's attention, then you have to be happy with who you are first. This is the real way to make a guy notice you.

This doesn't mean that you have to try too hard to make the guy see that you're happy with who you are. Just keep things natural and he'll have a sense of how things are. If you try too much to laugh or look happy around him, he may think that you're showing off.;
, If you're not into makeup, then you don't have to pile it on your face to make a guy notice you. And that goes for hair, clothes, nails, and everything else. While putting some effort into your appearance shows that you do take some pride in your looks and in who you are, you have to remember to be true to yourself. If you're working too hard on your appearance, a guy may notice you, but not for the right reasons.


If you like dressing up and wearing mascara, lipgloss, and other make-up, then do your thing!

, You shouldn't smell like you stole your mother's perfume, but if you want to wear just a touch of perfume or some scented body lotion, then it'll catch a guy's eye for sure, if that's your thing. Taking the time to brush your teeth and shower regularly and keeping your body and hair smelling nice will also do the trick.

, You shouldn't wear anything too revealing or uncomfortable, and work on finding well-fitting clothes that are flattering and cute. Wear something because it makes you feel good, not because you think it'll make a guy notice you, and it'll have the exact effect you want. Make sure the clothes make you feel like you, not like some dolled-up version of yourself that you barely recognize. If you feel comfortable in your clothes, a guy will be able to tell.

, When a guy sees you, you should be smiling, looking happy, and generally giving off a good vibe. This will make you look more approachable and will make a guy more likely to come up to you. If you want the guy to really want to spend more time with you, then you should keep things light and upbeat, laugh, and give off an energy that says, ""I'm having a great time and I want you to join me."" Don't try to look upset or sad just so a guy will ask you what's wrong; that's not the best way to go about it.

, If you and the guy have things in common to talk about, then he will be very likely to notice you. Whether you're talking about the same sports team you like, the history class that you both like a lot, or the TV show you're both going to watch after school, if you find something that you and the guy have in common, then he will definitely notice you more. He'll think it's cool that you're more than just a pretty face and that the two of you can have something to actually talk about when you're together.


If you start a natural conversation with him and start talking about the things you like to do for fun or what you're doing that weekend, then you'll be able to find something you have in common eventually. Don't force it by asking him his ten favorite hobbies off the bat.

, Who says reading isn't cool? If you make a habit of reading books you like, watching the news or reading the papers, and listening to what's going on in the world, you'll be a much more interesting, intelligent person to talk to. If you know a lot of facts and have a sense of how the world works, the guy will be impressed and will think that you're a deep person who is worth knowing. You don't have to show off what you know, but if you're a well-read person, the stuff you know will show up naturally in a conversation. If you want a guy to notice you, then he has to notice your mind, too.


Don't think that guys just like ditzy, fun girls with no substance. That's myth and a stereotype that you should not have to buy in to.

, If you're good at something, whether it's singing, dancing, painting, or soccer, if you work really hard to succeed in it, then the guy will take notice. You shouldn't be good at it just to show off, but because you love it and it makes you feel good. If you're truly passionate about something, then the guy will admire you for it, and will like the fact that you're a complicated person with a lot of different interests.


If you want a guy to notice you, then he has to think that you have other interests besides pursuing guys. This will intrigue him even more.

, If you really want to get his attention, then you should avoid having your friends go up to him to ask him what he thinks about you or to bug him about you in general. It's likely he'll get annoyed by this and will think you're immature for not just talking to him yourself. Though your friends may offer to do this for you and it may be tempting to have someone else find out how he feels, you should avoid it if you want the guy to really like you.


Think about it: would you want a bunch of his friends to annoy you instead of having him come up to you himself?

, Though you shouldn't drop everything to start hanging out at the places where he likes to hang out, if you want to get his attention, then you do have to be in his orbit a bit more. If you're invited to a party you wouldn't normally go to but know that he'll be there, give it a shot. You may find that you'll end up having fun and that you'll be able to get his attention more because you'll be around him more.


If you know where he likes to get his coffee, maybe you can get your coffee there once a week instead of at your usual place. You can make yourself more noticeable by being around more without seeming like a stalker.

, If you do come in contact with him, a bit of flirting can go a long way. To flirt with him, all you have to do is to tease him a bit, laugh at what he says, and just be fun and playful with him. You shouldn't put it all on the table and let him know how much you like him and want to hang out, but just a little bit of harmless flirting can help you catch his eye and make him want to see you again.


When you talk to him and flirt with him, don't do it for more than a few minutes at a time. You don't want him to feel like your life revolves around him; you've got better things to do!

, Another way to get a guy's attention is to intrigue him and to make him want to be around you more. Flirting with him for a few minutes is fine, or saying hi when you walk by, and showing a bit of interest in him is great, but overall, you want him to feel like he should really chase you and make you want him even more. If you put it all out there, then he won't feel like he has to work to get your attention.


Boys love a chase. If he feels certain that you like him, then he won't feel like he has to win you over.

, Don't make the guy think that you're bored or sad and that you'll only light up when he's around. Instead, have a great time with your friends, laugh a lot, and generally look like you love what you're doing, no matter what. This will be very attractive to him, and he'll be intrigued by the fact that you're always out having a good time. Don't force it; just focus on having fun, wherever you are, and the guy is bound to notice.


If you know he's around, don't constantly look at him to check out his reaction to you. He should see that you're too busy to worry about impressing him.

, If you want to catch the guy's eye, then you have to master positive body language that makes you look confident, fun, and approachable. You should have good posture, look ahead instead of down at the floor, avoid hunching over, and keep your arms at your sides instead of crossing them. If you look relaxed and comfortable in your own body, the boy will think that you're happy with who you are and that it would be easy to talk to you.


If you're uncomfortable and fidget a lot or look around the room a lot, the guy may think that you're distracted and he'll be less likely to talk to you.

, Don't act too shy to lock eyes with the guy for a few seconds. If you make quick eye contact with him while you walk by and maybe even smile, he'll be likely to think, ""Who's that girl?"" If you just avoid his gaze and act like he doesn't exist, then he'll be less likely to think that you exist.

, You don't want the guy to think that he can learn everything about you after the first five minutes of you opening your mouth. Sure, you can tell him a few things about yourself, at first, but don't tell him every little thing you're thinking or he'll think that anyone can easily just get to know you. You want him to feel that getting to know you is more of a challenge, and that he should put in some work to figure out who you really are.


If you have to go, don't tell him where you're going. Lead him to wonder what you're up to!
If you talk regularly, you can reveal a bit more information about yourself every time. This will show that getting to know you is a process.

, You want the guy to think that you have a life and that you have a lot going on. If you're willing to drop anything to talk to him and are always just hanging around and acting bored, then he'll see that you don't have a lot happening in your life. If you have lots of friends, dance lessons, the school paper, or a bunch of other things to keep you busy, then he'll think you're an interesting person who has an exciting life.


You don't want him to think that you're so busy that you don't have time for people, but you should make it seem like you have a fun, active, and meaningful life that he should want to know more about.

, Don't think that you'll be able to get a guy's attention by loudly telling someone off or talking smack about a girl you don't like. Sure, that'll make him be aware of who you are, but not in a good way. Instead, work on treating people with the respect they deserve, even if you don't know them very well. Be nice to strangers, your teachers, and acquaintances, and he'll see that you're nice, outgoing, and kind. Guys don't want girls who are snobby or high drama, and if you are pleasant to everybody, he'll see that you're easygoing and will want to spend more time with you.


This doesn't mean that you should let mean people walk all over you. But it does mean that you should give people the benefit of the doubt and be nice as much as you can.

If your guy is a little hard to get, go for one of his friends first.,
Walk to class one day, when you're with his friend, and chances are he's going to also walk with his friend.,
Smile at him on seeing him in the hallway- just a glance, doesn't have to be a big grin.

,
Start a small conversation one day in the hallway.,
After you say that fast sentence, he would most likely respond.,
After that you should talk for a while and most likely joke around with each other.,
When you build up the courage to hug him, or if he hugs you, it would mean you're taking it into a different step.,
Ask him if he has an account on Facebook, an Instagram account, or one of your other social networks.,
When you're on your social networking site, and he asks for homework or something like that, say, ""I have to get off, but what's your number?",How to Get a Guy's Attention (Middle School)," This doesn't mean you have to like his friend. It just means that if you get close to his friend you might get a head start when talking to him.;
, If he walks with another one of his friends, then get your guy friend to walk with them just by saying, ""Hey there's ______ !"" and when they start talking to you, you can introduce yourself to your crush. Hopefully after that you will be able to start a conversation. What some people find works best is to just act outgoing and fun to be around.

,, Try to talk about what happened somewhere, like she said that she would be going to the fair with you. Just a short and fast sentence, say whatever you want to say but don't make it stupid and pointless. Maybe talk about a football game that night.

, Then you could ask him what class he's going to next, and he would probably tell you. He also might start a conversation. Walk with him for a little while, then go to your class. Don't do it everyday as it might start annoying him. Just do it occasionally when you run into him.

, Just make sure he is interested in you, like if he walks by and glances and then blushes at you, or pokes you, or greets you when you're at your locker. When your friend comes up say something along the lines of, ""He's my buddy,"" or ""This is my buddy (name)."" don't annoy him with it, its not his nickname. Just do it maybe twice, so he will notice.

, You're making progress towards a relationship, so make sure that is what you want. Smile when you hug him.

, If he says yes, then you could add him, and talk to him.


When talking to him on one of those networks try to avoid writing ""hey"" all the time, it may get really annoying to him.
While it's good to like and comment where relevant, doing it for every post may border on stalking.

, We can talk on the phone later."" He'll probably give it to you. Give it about two weeks and take this time and use it for talking, getting to know each other, and bonding then he'll probably think you're interesting enough to date.

Show off your curves. Wear form fitting clothes that will highlight your womanly curves.
Avoid intricate patterns. Patterns can draw the eye away from your body shape and send the message that you don’t want to be seen.
Wear red. Just looking at the color red can increase your heartrate. Red catches the eye and can add sex appeal to any outfit.;
, Use makeup to accentuate the most beautiful aspects of your face. Don’t wear too much though. You don’t want to look like a clown. You just want to draw attention to your best attributes.


Wear lipstick to show off soft luscious lips.
Use eyeliner to show off your gorgeous eyes.

, High heels will make your legs look longer and improve your posture to make you appear more confident. They’ll also cause you to stick out your butt and puff out your chest which draws attention to your feminine curves.


Another reason men are attracted to high heels is because they emphasize feminine movement like the rotation of your hips., There’s a cliché in films where a girl unties her ponytail to reveal her long, beautiful hair. Your hair is usually the first thing a guy will notice about you. Long flowing hair is perceived as an evolutionary sign of health.Let him admire the beauty and length of your hair.

, If you appear to be busy with something else, you’ll discourage him from approaching you. He won’t be worried about interrupting you if you act like you have nothing better to do.


Guys will rarely approach a girl who is concentrating on something for fear that they’ll be rejected.

, Guys love to play the part of the knight in shining armor. Give him an excuse to come talk to you by acting like you need his assistance. He’ll jump at the chance to prove his masculinity by helping you.Look around like you’re lost and need directions somewhere.
Walk up to a closed door with your hands full so he’ll need to open it for you.
Ask for help replacing a flat tire.

, Let him catch you looking at him and meet his gaze for a few seconds. After a few seconds, blush and turn away. Seeing you check him out will give him confidence that you’re interested.


Don’t overdo it. If you stare too deeply at him, you could weird him out.

, When he notices you looking at him, give him a quick smirk. Men look for signals that it is okay to talk to women. By smiling at him, you are tacitly letting him know that it’s okay to approach you.Don’t smile too big or you could look creepy. Keep it subtle.

, Keep your chest open facing him. You may feel nervous, but resist the urge to close yourself off by crossing your arms in front of your chest. At the very least, crossing your arms will make you appear less confident. You may even offend him as he could interpret your body language to mean that you’re not enjoying his company.Men tend to put their hands in their pockets when they get nervous. If you see him doing this, encourage him to open up by remaining open yourself.

, Display a genuine interest in getting to know who he is. Ask him questions about his hobbies, his life and his goals. Encourage him to talk about himself and make sure he knows you’re not judging him.He’ll relax and be able to enjoy talking to you.

, Be warm and friendly to him. Don’t try to impress him by acting disinterested. Actively listen to what he has to say. Nod your head gently while he speaks to show him you’re paying attention.


Laugh at his jokes.
React to his stories.
Smile as much as you can.

, He’ll most likely be able to sense if you’re pretending to be someone you’re not to impress him and it will make him feel like he needs to try to impress you. Show him your unique personality so that he feels at ease showing you his.

, Men like to be complimented just as much as women. Find opportunities to let him know what you like about him. Be genuine though, or he may think you’re making fun of him.


Say something like “You seem really strong, what gym do you go to?”
Say “I really like your hair style, what kind of product do you use to get it that way?”

, While you’re talking to him, run your fingers through your hair or flip it. Playing with your hair lets him know that you want to be noticed. It will also draw his attention to your hair’s softness and beauty.

, Find chances to touch him and make it seem accidental. By touching him, you’re letting him know that it’s ok for him to touch you. Pay attention to his reaction. If he blushes or starts to smile, he probably likes you.Brush up against his arm.
Touch his shoulder.
Lightly punch him when he tells a joke.
If you’re sitting down, lightly graze his knee with your own.

, If he doesn’t ask for your number on his own, say something like “I really enjoyed talking to you, it would be cool if we could talk again.” He should get the hint and ask you for your number.

, Become friends with him on social media. Every once in awhile, leave a comment on one of his pages. Make sure your comments are fun and innocent. Don’t leave too many comments though or he’ll think you’re desperate.


Like his pictures on instagram.
Comment on his pictures on facebook.
Follow and respond to his tweets.

, Text him to see what he’s up to every now and then. Use selective emoticons and memes to respond to his text messages. If he says something like “Work was so boring today.” send back a crying face emoticon or a meme of a cute kitten with the caption “Awe, poor baby!” If he has a sense of humor, he'll respond with his own flirty message.


Text him to ask what he’s doing that night. When he responds, say “whoops, I meant to send that to my friend, but yeah what are you doing tonight?” Teasing him will make him chase you., Push him to do things outside his comfort zone and he’ll do the same to you. Dare him to get out on the dance floor and show you his moves or to try something new and exciting that’s a bit scary like skydiving.Truth or dare can be a real fun and flirty game that allows you to challenge each other.

, When you’re hanging out at a party or bar that he’s at, let him see you having a great time. Be the life of the party. He’ll see that you stand out to everyone and he'll desperately want to flirt with you.


He'll see the attention you get from people as social proof that you're extremely attractive.

Don't start off naked or with parts of your body exposed.,
Talk for a little bit first.,
Flirt.,
Smile, girls absolutely love it when guys smile.,
Don't be pushy.",How to Get a Girl on Omegle or Chatroulette," Girls go to Chatroulette or Omegle for ""different reasons"" than guys do: girls think that it is fun and exciting, and they want to feel attractive and wanted. If your webcam shows her naked or exposed humans, a girl is going to think that you think of her as an object instead of a person, and she'll click away.


Look your best, their first impression will be looks, so try hard to be dressed well and looking dapper. Don't look like you just stepped out of bed with your pajamas still on. That will scream laziness.
Start off with a prop, like a guitar or a flag, and hold it there or do something interesting with it. All you need is for a girl to be intrigued, and she may start to talk to you.
Don't directly face the camera. Move your webcam so that you aren't directly facing the camera at first. You can come off as a little too intense, even if that's not your intent.;
, Get a good conversation going. Be your most interesting self. Any girl on chatroulette could go to her local bus stop and talk with a boring dude if she wanted to. But that is not what she wants. She wants you to be the most interesting man alive, like the guy from the Dos Equis commercials.


Familiarize yourself with a little bit of French, Spanish, German, Chinese, and Japanese. Be able to say ""hello"" and ""how are you?"" in each language. That way, when you start chatting with someone from a different country, you can whip out your amazing language ability and surprise her in a good way.
When in doubt, ask questions. If you run out of things to talk about, be sure to ask lots of questions. Questions are generally easier to come up with than interesting observations, and they make great conversation starters. Ask her personal questions, but not anything too personal. What was her childhood like? What does she like reading to listening to? What is her favorite food? Where is her dream vacation?

, After chit-chatting for awhile, start to get flirty. She will feel more comfortable around you, so they will most likely respond positively.


Be playful. Girls love guys who have a great sense of humor and are playful. A great sense of humor is hard to come by, but everyone can be playful. Mess around with your props in a non-threatening way. Make visual illusions using your webcam. Experiment with your lighting. The world is pretty much your oyster; you just have to learn how it play with it.
Do impersonations of famous people if you can. Ask her if she knows _______, and then knock an impersonation out of the park. The more you get her laughing, the better off you will be.

, That is because people want to be around other people who are happy; not only is attractive, it's infectious.


Laugh at her jokes. Girls are often told to laugh at guys' jokes, but guys can always do the same. It feels good for her to have someone she can laugh with. It will make her feel comfortable. The more comfortable she is, the higher your chances of success are.

, If she's not ready, don't bug her. You'll get more bees with honey than with vinegar. Don't force things, let things develop organically, and project your confidence whatever happens. Confidence is a huge turn on for girls. "

Is he the athletic type? Does he have a particular talent, like art or music? Is he brainy with straight As? Learning more about her crush can tell you a lot about what she looks for in a guy. Think about what the other guy is like and whether there’s a possibility that she could like you for the same reasons without you having to change your personality.Find out what other people have to say about the guy she has a crush on. If you go to school with him, ask people that know him what kind of person he is, what they like about him, etc. She may like nice guys, or she may be more attracted to the “bad boy” type.;
, Get to know the people she hangs out with and see what they’re like. Most likely, the qualities she looks for in choosing friends are the same ones that determine who she likes. Find out what you have in common with her clique. If things go well, your crush’s friends may become your friends, too, which means you’ll be able to spend more time around her.When talking to your crush’s friends, casually bring up the subject of what kinds of guys she normally falls for, and how she feels about you. If they like you, they’ll be willing to give you helpful advice about how to win her over.
Try not to act like you’re interrogating them. You’re trying to find out more about her by talking to her friends. If they feel like you’ve got ulterior motives or you’re being dishonest, you may end up doing more harm than good.

, Pay attention to the things she likes to do. Is she studious or social? Where does she like to hang out, and who does she hang out with? What type of music does she listen to? You’re looking for clues that will tell you more about what she’s into so that you can find ways to relate to her. Start taking notice of things she gets excited about, or that she finds uninteresting. This will help you decide what sorts of subjects to talk about the next time you’re around her.Be observant, but don’t be a stalker. There’s a difference between noticing details about her personality and spying on her.

, Use your newfound knowledge of the kind of guys she likes and what she looks for in a friend to tell you how you should present yourself to her in the future. If you want her to like you, the first thing you need to do is grab her attention by making her feel like you’re someone she wants to get to know. This doesn’t require that you change who you are, but it may allow you to play up one aspect of your character or another that you think she’ll be attracted to.Don’t try to be someone you’re not. There’s no use changing yourself to get someone to like you because even if you succeed you may not be happy with yourself anymore. Instead, look for existing similarities between the two of you and focus on showing her what you already have in common.
Take this time to think about what you do and don’t like about yourself. If there’s some area where you feel you need improvement, now is a good opportunity to change it. Likewise, if there’s some feature of yourself that you’re especially proud of, show this off to her. You want to highlight the positive and minimize or downplay the negative.

, You don’t have to outright emulate him, but you can try to act more like him in certain ways that she’ll respond to. If she’s drawn to jocks, start practicing a sport or try out for a school team. If she likes guys in bands, pick up an instrument. Not only will you be winning favor with her, it will also give you a chance to acquire new skills and interests.Rather than trying to beat him at his own game, think about ways that you and her crush are alike but also qualities you have that he doesn’t. Keep it from becoming a direct competition and make yourself the obvious choice by being more well-rounded.
Girls are sometimes attracted to jerks because they think a guy must have a lot going for him to treat other people with disrespect. This isn’t the case, and it’s one way you definitely don’t want to be like her crush.

, Like it or not, physical attraction is all about how you look. If you want to look good for the girl you’re trying to impress, you need to put some effort into eating right, exercising and looking after your physique. Start performing a few simple workouts during the week, and choose healthier nutrition options over junk food. You’ll start to look and feel better, and your hard work won’t go unnoticed.Basic exercises like push ups, pull ups, dips and squats can help you build muscle mass and are convenient to perform because they don’t require training equipment. Incorporate a few sets of calisthenic exercises into your daily training routine. You can also jog or swim a few miles a couple times a week to stay trim and in good shape.Lose the pizza, chips and soda and eat more whole foods containing a proper balance of protein, carbohydrates, fiber and fats., When you look good, you feel good. Put a little extra thought into your wardrobe choices every morning. Pick out clothes that are comfortable and stylish and look good on you. Clothes are often the first thing people notice about you when they see you frequently, so make sure you look sharp when the girl you like is around.Accessorize for each individual outfit with the right belt, shoes, watch or hat. People who know how to dress well always stand out.

, It’s a fact of life that confident people are well-liked. To up your confidence level, put your best foot forward and let people see what makes you unique. Take pride in your appearance. Concentrate on displaying the best parts of your personality, like your sense of humor or intellect. If you have a special talent, show it off. You should make it a point to always be comfortable with yourself in any situation. When you seem confident, fun and inviting, others will naturally gravitate to you.One of the most effective tricks for keeping your confidence up is to constantly reaffirm yourself. Remind yourself of your best traits and reinforce these in your mind while learning to overlook your shortcomings.
Don’t be afraid to laugh at yourself when you make a mistake. People love someone who doesn’t take himself too seriously.

, Put your most sociable side on display. Talk to the people around you, make new friends and laugh. Make sure you’re with your friends when she’s around and always be ready with a kind word or helping hand. She’ll see that you’re a popular guy who people like and will want to be around you herself.You don’t have to be an extrovert to be a people-person. Just smile and be friendly to everyone you meet. Those around you will be drawn to your charm.
Aim to be a genuinely likable person. Don’t just pretend to be nice when she’s watching in order to impress her.

, See about taking part in things that she likes to do. There are all sorts of clubs and teams at school you could join, or it might be as simple as discovering what her hobbies are and arranging to run into her at the right time and place. The more common ground she knows you share, the easier it will be for the two of you to become friends.Another benefit of finding ways to be around her is that you’ll be more present in her mind than the guy she likes, giving you more opportunity to get her to like you.
People who share passions tend to form strong bonds. Find out what’s especially important to her and see how your passions and interests align. You may learn that you have much more in common than you originally thought.

, One of the best ways to get more face time with the girl you like is to create circumstances in which you’re hanging out with the same people. Become acquainted with her friends and introduce them to your own. Strike up a mutual friendship between your social circles so that more of your time is spent around her and her friends. Once she’s a part of your group, you can begin to work on singling out her attention.Avoid social settings where her crush or his friends happen to be around.

, Make an effort to talk to her on a more personal level. Say hello to her when you pass her in the hallway or see her talking with someone you know to make an initial pass at conversation. Try to get to the point where she’s comfortable hanging out with you without other people around.If her crush is still just a crush, it probably means he’s unaware that she likes him or hasn’t acted on it. Engaging her first is your ticket to turning her head.
When the time is right, ask her about her personal life. If she doesn’t mention that he has a crush on anybody else, it’s probably a sign that she likes you.

, Don’t try to hide the fact that you like her. Take an interest in her and gradually make your feelings known. As your relationship blossoms, she’ll come to value having someone to talk to that cares about what she has to say. Be your best self around her and give her a reason to forget about the other guy.Be careful about coming on too strong. Stick to being casual friends at first and leave her wanting more.
Giving her your attention is also about capturing hers. The goal is to insulate her from her crush and get her to realize how she feels about you.

Take the relationship at the pace that feels comfortable to both of you.",How to Get a Girl to Like You if You Are Disabled (for Teenagers)," It's okay to have a disability. You are a unique and desirable person. Believe in yourself and that you have something to offer her. Recognize and capitalize on your personal strengths, such as if you are a great talker- then entertain her. If you're a joker, then amuse her. If you've got a nice smile- then show it to her when the time seems right.;
, Love her and treat her with ultimate respect. Many girls feel undervalued, or as though boys don't really hold a great deal of respect for them, doing this could help you stand out from the crowd. Spend time with her in as many sort of places and situations as you can and make sure she feels very relaxed and comfortable around/with you. Try talking about things that she is interested in so she will be more comfortable with the conversation and emphasize with her. If she feels as though she can talk to you and you understand, then she's more likely to want to talk to you in the future (above other people) when she's got an issue.

, Try making eye contact (if possible/when it seems right), catching her eye, and smiling at her and then consider breaking it again. Too much eye-contact is overkill, but she needs to know that you 'like' her as more than a friend. Use open body language so that she knows you're interested. If she reciprocates, mention meeting on a date outside of your usual settings/ away from your social group.

, It's there, but it's not important right now. While it may influence your life in an everyday sense, it's YOU who is chatting to her, not your disability. Spark a conversation about anything which seems right, her cute backpack, her cool science presentation, the fact that her sister is friends with your sister, ask what she did at the weekend... The opportunities are endless.

, People that are pleasant to be around, people that make them laugh, people that are laid back and easy to talk to. Listen to her thoughts, encourage her dreams, and let her know that you like talking to her.

, Mention your interests as you get to know her, and show her a thing or two. Encourage her to show her talents too. This way, she can get to know the real you, and you can get to know her better.

, When you are both ready, you can start dating, holding hands, kissing, and possibly going beyond that. Keep communication open, listen to each other, and love each other, and if you're right for each other, it'll go well.


Eventually, she should fall in love with the real you who is inside, not just what's outside.
If all else fails, then she is not worth it. You deserve better than someone who won't ever love you for who you truly are.

Let the eye contact last for about 1-2 seconds, then look away.
Prolonged eye contact before a conversation can be off putting. Staring makes people uncomfortable.
Good rules for eye contact during a successful personal conversation are to glance his face while you are listening, then glance away every so often when you are talking.;
, Smiling is key to friendly non-verbal communication.This puts forth that you are self confident.
A smile sets a pleasant tone for your interaction.
Smiling as body language communicates approval and affection.
Keep the rest of your face relaxed and casual.
Don't force a smile that is too big or fake.

, You don't need to reveal your deepest feelings to your crush when you are just getting his attention.Keep the topics of conversation light. Stick to things like school, your pets, your sports or other activities.
Don't be afraid to be playful during conversations. Add a little humor by making small jokes.
Keep your facial expressions bright and happy.
For example, if you are in the same classes you could talk with your crush about an assignment or test and offer to study together.
If you know he has a dog or a cat, ask to see pictures.
Talk about your sports games or his. If he isn't involved in sports, pick something else he does like theater, reading, art etc. to remark on.

, You don't want to seem closed off or nervous.Posture is very important for flirting. Don't use a ""closed"" posture; this is when you stand or sit with your arms crossed or legs tightly crossed.
If you turn your body away from your crush you will seem disinterested.
When flirting, try to keep your body relaxed and open. Keep your arms relaxed and uncrossed, and lean your body towards your crush.

, Say something nice about his accomplishments or appearance.Be honest and tell the truth when you give your compliment.
Try to keep your compliments away from his looks initially. Give a compliment such as ""You were great in last night's game"" or ""You were a really good partner during the group project"".
If you know he has worked on a project at school you can focus on that type of accomplishment: ""I saw your art project at the fair. It was really cool"".
You can compliment a guy on his looks, but don't focus all of your nice comments on personal appearance. This can make you seem too focused physical appearance.

, Gushing endlessly about yourself and your interests will make you seem self-centered.This communicates arrogance and self-focus.
When you are interacting with your crush, you do want to talk about yourself a little bit.
However, just stick to some relevant facts or stories about yourself.
For example, if he's talking about sports and you play them, respond with comments or a story about your own athletic games.
Listening is a very important skill when flirting.
Instead of focusing on yourself in the conversation, say a few things about yourself then ask about him. Listen intently to what he is saying.
For example, ""I was in the play last year and it was a great experience. Are you going to try out for a role this year?""
Nod and acknowledge that you are listening when he talks.

, Follow some of the same ideas for this type of talking.


Keep your initial messages very casual. Say ""Hey, what's going on?"" or ""Hi, what are you up to right now?""

You could say something like ""I see you have some pictures of you playing with your little brother. That's cute. What do you guys do for fun?""
Comment on the photos on his Facebook or Twitter.

, Try not to be stiff, nervous, or too formal when you do so.Bring it naturally into a conversation. If you are talking about a sports game, for example, you could interject with ""Would you like to go to the game together on Friday?""
Offer to do something that he is interested in: ""So you like rock music? Why don't we go to the concert next week?""
You could also be more direct and say ""Hey, I really like you and I'd like to go out sometime.""
Remember to be confident. Self confidence is attractive and shows the boy you like that you are interested in him.
Don't mumble or stutter when you ask a question. You want to seem happy and confident.

, Sometimes girls have trouble figuring out if they really do have a crush on ""him"". This is the time you have to do some investigating. Make a ""check list"" of 12 things you want most out of your typical dream guy. Sneak around and see what he does, but don't stalk him. He has to have the exact or related things to your quality on that list. He must get a result of 6/12 or above, otherwise he's not really for you. But, if he turns out to be your typical guy, talk to him once in a while to feel comfortable around him for later. Make sure he is into you even if you have to play hard to get.

, Simple things like smiling at him are not so hard. If you're constantly doing that already, then you can go ahead and skip this step. Don't overdo it though. Technically, the trick here is to not flirt with him (yet). Give him hints for about a week or two and see what happens. Don't overdo this step.

, By now, he should start to show some signs he has some interest towards you as well. Don't assume this is going to happen right away, it may take some time for him to express it. If nothing happens at all, repeat step 3 until he does. Signs he might show are:


constant staring
touching you on the arm or shoulder (doesn't necessarily include tapping)
smiling, etc.

, Now that he's showing signs, you should become friends (unless your crush is already your friend, you can skip this step and move on). This should happen before he asks you out because, it might be so sudden, you might say ""no"" and he'll feel kind of upset and leave you alone for some time. So, to become friends with him, do the same as you did when you became friends with a guy you don't have a crush on. If your crush is showing signs, the best way to be friends with him is to start by sitting next to him at lunch and start a conversation and find things in common(ex: you're both sports fanatics). Hang out with him for about 2 weeks and eventually you're friends. What might happen is that he might lose interest in you. So to boost his interest up, it's time for you to move on to step 6.

, It's like giving him hints, but a tad bit more advanced; your hand on his hand, your head on his shoulder (if he doesn't mind), still smiling constantly and turning away when he notices, kinda teasing him from time to time, hug him when he meets up with you to talk, giggling or making short laughs any time he tries to make you laugh. Do this for 10-13 days or until he starts to do the same back at you.


Don't overdo it - keep it light. Flirting with him too much could make him uncomfortable.

, Mostly at this point, girls may get a little jumpy. Keep cool though. Don't make it seem like you're planning something. To make your ""move"", tell your crush to meet you somewhere you know personally that not a lot of people go (but not somewhere dangerous, like an alley). If you want to do this after school, you could invite him over to your house to do homework together, but you can also choose a place like the park or the beach; maybe even in the back of the school or in the school courtyard.


Meet him at a time when there aren't many people around, like 5 or 6 o'clock. This way there's not too many people around to see you and him, but make sure the place isn't completely empty, because you don't want to make him feel suspicious about what's going on.

, When you meet him at the location, greet him by giving him a quick hug. Tell him to sit somewhere (grass, bench, etc.). After a short period of time being quiet, start a small conversation about something that happened a few days ago. If he gets more interested in the story, he might say something to make you smile at the end. Otherwise he'll probably start talking about whatever he likes to talk about. If you didn't like the story too much or it didn't catch your interest, tell another story and if he ends it with a really nice line, say something that might make him look at you and smile. If it does work, look at him and smile back. Try locking the gaze into a stare. Hold it long it enough to make him fade out his smile. Fade out your smile too to make it seem you lost control of yourself. Now he is under your spell. Move over a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) closer to him. If he moves forward too it means he's interested in what's happening. If he scoots backward and looks to his side, he's signaling that he's unsure on what's happening or he's shy. If he looks away or says something, it means he's not ready for what's about to happen.

, Now that you've locked in the gaze, it's time. If his hand is within reach, put your hand on top gently. He might take your fingers and wrap them under his hand. Lean in a little; if he leans in too, he signals he's definitely ready. Get closer, inches from each other's face. If he sits still, he's unsure if he's ready. If he's not really sure, let him know it's okay by putting your cheek against his then lightly plant a kiss on his cheek. If he lightens up, plant a kiss on his lips. If he responds to it by shivering a little or making any small movements, move in a little more and gently tug on his arm to signal him to get closer. Win his attention again by staring into his eyes. If it works, make the big move. Tilt your head 9 degrees in which ever way you are leaning into him. Sometimes boys don't respond to the first lip-to-lip. Try it again and again until he responds. When he does, start the kiss soft and passionate. Tip: think about happy things. This will make things more intense.


Bring your arms up slowly and wrap them around his neck gently. He might respond to that by putting his hands on your waist. Eventually, he doesn't have to respond. If you both are still kissing, then he's still into you and the moment.
If he backs away from you when you lean in, that's a no. Respect that; don't kiss him when he's not comfortable.

Be sure you really like this guy and that you're committed.,
Get to know him if you don't already.,
Flirt!,
After the date, make your move.,
Kiss him.",How to Flirt With Your Crush (for Girls)," Don't play hard to get and flirt with other guys to get his attention. It'll only make him think you're unavailable. A little chat or smile with another guy would be good enough. This will make him a little jealous and - most likely - want you more.;
, Have conversations about things you two have in common. Look him in the eyes and smile when you talk. If he smiles and makes eye contact with you, this may be a sign that he may be interested in you. Ask him some casual questions, just to know him better. However, don't ask too many! He will probably feel uncomfortable. You don't have to just focus on him - talk a little about yourself as well! If he likes you, he might start listening to your favorite band or have an interest in your hobbies to get your attention.

, Start off mildly and work your way up. For those who are beginners at flirting, make eye contact for a second and smile, then look away slowly. Don't stare for too long, as it will make things really awkward. Try making a little physical contact. Brush by him when you can and let your arm linger for a little bit. You could playfully pat his back and - if you're ready - start to hug him! However, be sure you know him well enough and that it won't be awkward if you hug him.


Making the first move may be different for everyone. Maybe one person wants to just hang out or go on a date. Perhaps another person wants to start becoming boyfriend and girlfriend. This step will focus on choice two. Dress up, but don't try too hard.
Approach him and give him a smile. Ask him if he wants to hang out after school, or go catch a movie. If he agrees, tell him, ""Okay, see ya"" and give him a smile or a hug, then walk off. If he politely declines, then he probably just wants to be friends. Don't get discouraged, because there are many fish in the sea!

, Tell him you had a great time and that you would like to do it again. If he looks like he had a good time, then this is a good sign. Now face him and look him in the eyes, and say ""I really like you, and I was wondering if we could be more than friends."" Smile at him and be confident. Try not to be shy. If he says yes, then you just made a move. If he says no, then just be friends. Don't push him into anything!

, Some girls may skip this step, but others may want to try it. When you're about to leave, give him a quick, soft kiss on the cheek and walk off, not looking back. If you're already dating him and you've already kissed him before, move onto the mouth if he looks happy. If he's not ready, don't push it. Give him a hug.

Let him pursue you, so he gets the thrill of the chase.,
Flirt in a subtle way to give him clues you like him.,
Give him space, to make him long for more contact.",How to Get a Boy to Like You Without It Being Obvious1," Boys are born hunters. It’s also just human nature. People are more likely to prize something they had to work hard to win. At the same time, you don’t want to play games to such a degree that you seem manipulative. So it can be a fine line.You can seem like a prize if you boost your own self-esteem. Never be arrogant, but do act confident. Understand your worth, and don’t beg or plead. Don't seem desperate by clinging or always making the first move or following him around too much.
Let him text you first. Don’t always be available for him – have your own interests and friends, too. Don’t always respond immediately every time he calls or messages you. This doesn’t mean you should ignore him completely. You could go too far and he might lose interest or think you don’t like him. There’s nothing wrong with going up to him with a simple hello.

Be mysterious. One way to do this is not to reply to every question. So, if he asks, “What’s your favorite color?” you could say, “Guess.” Or: Look into his eyes for three seconds, and then look away. That will make him try harder to see if he can look into your eyes again.;
, You do need to give him hints that you like him. This will actually MAKE him chase you. It’s all about giving him clues without being too obvious. That way he will build up enough confidence to let you know he likes you too. Some contact is key – eye contact, physical contact, mental contact – just not too much.


Look at him, then look away or down, as if shyly, and then look at him again. Don't hold his gaze for too long with a stare. That can seem creepy. But eye contact is really important.

Touch him. Although you don’t want to seem too clingy or desperate, you can make brief physical contact with him in a way that intrigues him or gives him hints that you like him. For example, you could brush your arm or leg against his, or touch his shoulder as you pass him in the hall.
You could playfully punch his arm while joking around with him – just do it softly! You could also talk more quietly, so he has to lean in to hear you. Playing with your hair will give him signals you like him. Make the touches seem unintentional.Click ""like"" on a few of his photos on Facebook or Instagram. Not too much – just one or two so that he notices you and realizes you have noticed him. Text him a joke or casual comment. Use emojis.They are flirty.

Talk to him! You need to build a friendship first. If you always ignore him, he will probably think you don’t like him, and he might never make a move. So you do need to strike up a conversation now and then.

, You should keep it light in the beginning. Something like “Wow! That was some storm last night, huh?” or “Hey, you’re pretty good at basketball! Do you play?” is the tone you should have. Do NOT follow him around like a lost puppy.


Strike up conversations with him – but not all the time. Make eye contact with him – but not all the time. Show interest in what he likes to do – but not all the time. Text him sometimes – but not all the time.
Treat him like he’s a good friend in the beginning, while giving him subtle hints there could be more (through body language, a smile, a flirty text). Just be chill around him, and hang out.
Get to know him in a group. Maybe a bunch of friends go out to a movie, and you see if he wants to come along. Slowly, get to know him better by including him in activities with other people.

Self-confidence will attract others. Having self-confidence doesn't mean go out and do stupid things in front of everyone. This will make you seem like a foolish attention seeker. It also doesn't mean to think you're better that everyone. Confidence is being nice to those around you, and not letting the opinions of others consume you. Be comfortable in your own skin, and love your body.
Don't be afraid to be your own person. You have your own interests and preferences.
You don't have to make yourself into a clone of your crush to get him to like you. Being different might make you seem more interesting to him.
Maintain your own friendships even though you have a crush on a guy. Inviting him to do things with your group of friends might be a good way to break the ice.
For example, if you are going to a sports game or ice skating with your friends, invite him to join in. Ask him to bring a friend or two if its awkward at first.

, Find out some of the things he likes and surprise him.Find out what type of cookie or snack he likes. Bring them to school and put them in his locker with a nice note.
Make him a playlist of his favorite music and send it to him.
Give him a jersey from his favorite sports team or a band t-shirt.

, If he plays a sport or is in a school club, find ways where you can join in the fun.For example, if your crush plays a sport try to volunteer to help out during team events.
At the very least, show up to his sports games or other extracurricular events to show support.
Taking an interest in the same activities will let him know you are interested in him.
If you can't outright join the clubs or activities he is in, offer to help out with an event.
For example: ""I am really good at artwork. I could help your theater group make some scenery for your play this month"" or ""I heard your team is having a charity bake sale. I would love to bake some cookies to help out.""

, Always be friendly and casual around them. By blending social groups, you might be able to spend some more time with your crush or learn things about him.
Being nice and friendly to his friends will let your crush know that you can spend time together with his social group.
For example, if you know they are going to an event, ask if you can tag along.
Invite his friends to do things when you are going out with your friends.
Don't engage in gossip or rumors about him or his friends. Gossip can be very off putting to a guy.

, Wear clothes that fit your body type. Make sure your outfits look put together and tidy.Keep your hair in good condition. Make sure it is nicely styled for school and other events.
You don't have to wear it in any particular style, and you can even experiment with different looks to see what he likes.
Keep your makeup simple. Wearing heavy makeup can make you look like you are trying too hard.
Go for a natural look that plays up your eyes and lips. Try a simple mascara and some neutral lipstick or lipgloss.
Although dressing nice is a good way to get your crush to notice you, DON'T OVERDO IT. If you come to school with 50 pounds of makeup on, this will make him think you're seeking attention and fishing for compliments. Consider wearing a nice blouse and cute jeans. There is no need to wear 8-inch heels and a skin-tight minidress with sequins covering it. This will not only make you look like a Barbie doll, your crush will think you are trying to get other boys to like you.
Making an effort in your appearance might get your crush to notice you, but you don't have to dress in a style that isn't ""you"". Go for a neat appearance in a style that fits your personality.
You don't have to change your entire style. If your crush is into sports, consider wearing a sporty shirt or jersey the next day.

If he likes to hang out in the library, for example, you could go there sometimes too, and eventually he might start talking to you.


Trying out his interests will create a common conversation and make you appealing to him. If you’re in science class with him, talk to him about an assignment or what you’re learning.
Don’t talk to him constantly about things he’s not interested in. This will bore a boy to tears.Determine his personality type. If he’s an extrovert, he will respond differently than he will if he’s an introvert. Extroverts are personality types who need a lot of interaction and conversation with people, so be friendly, talkative, and reach out. Introverts need their space. They feel drained after too much interaction with people. So don’t crowd him too much. Don’t feel rejected because he needs a little time to himself.

, This is part of the confidence building part. You should never become a chameleon who turns into something you are not to hook a boy. Boys can spot a fake a mile away. There are a lot of things girls do subconsciously to make guys love them, and these should come naturally.


The way they move, their laughter, their sadness, their energy, their intuition, their sense of humor, their common sense, their enigmatic mystical nature. These are some of the things that boys like about girls. These things will come naturally if it is a good match.
Focus on other things in your life sometimes – your studies, your family, your circle of girl friends. This will show him that you are confident in your own life, and he will see you in a better light.
Show him you're smart. If a guy is threatened by intelligent girls, he’s probably someone you shouldn’t like anyway. Don’t try to “play dumb” because you think boys like that. They don’t.

, If you can make a guy laugh, he will probably feel positively about you. Don’t take yourself so seriously all the time. Be able to make jokes – including about yourself. Don’t overdo it, though. You don’t want to come across as never serious either.


You have to be a little assertive. Strike up conversations with him. Ask him about his day. Seem positive. Some girls think if they act sad or depressed, they will get a guy’s attention. They might – but it won’t be the right kind. Being happy is attractive.
Laugh at his jokes too! Even if his jokes aren’t really that good, what does it hurt to smile and act like it’s funny? This is a way to flirt with him, and he won't even realize it's flirting."

Go to places where he is likely to be, although don't over do this. But if you know he likes to attend basketball games or hangs out at a certain restaurant, you could show up too. This would work best if there are a group of people going, so ask some of your friends to tag along at first.
You could let him know through friends that you like him, so they can get a sense of his reaction before you approach him directly. This is a subtler way to clue him in than telling him yourself.
Go up and talk to him! Keep it casual. But start a conversation. Smile, and say hi, and then next time, talk to him a bit more. Maybe ask him something about a class you're in or that he's had, or something easy-going like that.

, Most boys want a girl they can hang out with who isn’t too much work. Of course, it helps to be pretty. But do highlight your natural beauty. Guys are visual creatures.


No one wants to run their fingers through hair coated with hair spray. Guys tend to like shiny, healthy hair that has bounce to it and that makes them want to run their fingers through it!
If you’re old enough, a little mascara, a little blush, and a little lip gloss should be all you need. Avoid overly dramatic makeup or heavy eye shadow in bright colors.
That doesn’t mean you should look messy. Take care of yourself, and dress nicely. Just be who you really are, and be OK with that. You don’t have to wear expensive or designer clothes to look good. You should also eat right and stay in shape. That’s just healthy and of course being healthy will increase your appeal.

, You want to be someone he could introduce to his friends or his mom. That means showing you have class.


Dress well, but in a way that is true to your personality. You don't need to overdo it for him, but spend some time figuring out what you look best in.
Don’t always dress in sweatpants or a hoodie, either, though. Show him you're making an effort.
Wear a light body spray only. You don’t want to smell like a grandmother or a department store. But a little hint of something – like vanilla – will drive him crazy. You should have a signature scent, so he gets used to how you smell.

Just say something positive to him about him. Who doesn’t like that? If he made a good play in a sport, let him know.Ask for his help with something. This will make him feel good and it will make him realize that you think highly of him. This is a good way to approach a boy who doesn't know you very well or even realize you have a crush on him.
Never forget that boys are pretty insecure. They aren’t sure whether you like them, either. They don’t know what to do. So a compliment here or there can give him the clue to make a move without feeling like you’re chasing him too much.
Ask him questions, so you don’t seem like you are talking about yourself all of the time.You want to seem like you are interested in who he is and what he likes.

, People are drawn to people who smile. It makes them feel good, and shows you’re confident. No slouching or looking away when you run into him!


If you smile, you are going to look prettier much faster than if you cake on makeup. People are drawn to people who seem happy because they want to be happy too.
Have a gentle, caring nature. Boys like that. Don’t just text him a boring “hey or ‘sup.”

, This might work in the short run, but it will backfire big-time in the long run, and it’s kind of mean. You might end up chasing him away.


Be modest and selfless. Show caring about others. Don’t be a mean girl - even about people not in his presence.
Avoid bringing drama or negativity into his life all the time. Boys can’t stand this. This also means you shouldn’t gossip or be mean about other people, including other girls, in his presence.
Don't act too jealous of him, too. It shows a lack of confidence. And understand that he needs time to hang out with the boys.

Girls just take that as ""you just like my pants because they are tight enough to see my butt"" and that will send the wrong message to her. Girls are very sensitive about their body, and if you say something that involves their private areas, they will definitely get the wrong message.

, Girls love guys who are sensitive and understand them. When they start getting upset and maybe even cry about something, don't just run off and use the stupid ""sorry, I can't help you, I'm not a girl"" excuse. If you actually listen to what she is saying, she will like you even more. Most guys think that girls like ""bad boys"" who spray paint buildings and get in trouble at school, but actually, it's the total opposite. Girls hate guys to try to be bad because they think it's cool, but really, it's not. So don't try to be all ""gangster"" or anything because girls hate that.

, Girls like guys who are open and will tell her things. And when you open up to her, she will really get to know you as a person and will like you even more. Don't make up fake hobbies or anything, just tell them what you really like. Girls don't care how many war video games you play, or how many push-ups you can do. So don't lie. And plus, if she really likes you for you, and is a good person, she will like you just the way you are.

, Crack a joke, don't laugh at it, otherwise they will find it dumb. Do this and you'll see the results. It might even get you popular at school.

, Once you get to know the girl, you can tease her in a fun and friendly way. You can tease her for always wearing the color purple or say that she looks like a certain celebrity with her new haircut. Just make sure you don't say anything that may offend her because she may take your teasing the wrong way. This is a great way to flirt, and soon, she'll be teasing you right back!

Make sure she is available.,
Choose the right time.,
Seek out common interests.,
Make eye contact.,

Start a conversation.,
Smile!,

Make jokes and be funny.,

Relax.",How to Flirt With the Girl You Like," You don't want to flirt with a girl that has a boyfriend. Flirting with a taken girl is a big no-no. And a bit of a turn off as she may think you are desperate.;
, This may be as wide as a range as from a party, to her walking in the hall, or just plain bored outside during recess. Be aware of what she is doing at that moment. Don't try to flirt when she is busy talking or having fun, this will make her agitated because you are intruding. The best time would be a lag in a conversation or most likely when she is alone. Then you do not need to worry about people interrupting or stealing her away. But do NOT bolt her where she is by locking onto her arm or droning on with a boring conversation.

, This is key to approaching her without her dying to leave. If you both like soccer, comment on a recent game. If you both like a popular show, talk about last night's episode. But keep in mind, girls hate it when boys lie to seem interesting. And they will find out. Do not lie and say you absolutely love to watch a certain show and then get caught in a question any dedicated viewer would know. Be real, don't fake it. If she can't accept you for who you are, then she doesn't deserve you.

, Look her way, but don't stare! If your eyes meet, don't lower your eyes in humility. Lock your eyes with her pretty ones and you'll find it hard to look away. Just make sure your eyes are not bugged out. Keep them relaxed, add a smile, even a little wave. This will show you're interested.

, Don't approach her after you've worked out. All you will accomplish with greasy hair, horrible breath, and strong B.O. is seeing how fast she can run away. Shower with soap, wash your hair, brush your teeth and tongue, and apply a light layer of cologne.

, It can be in the classroom, in the hall, outside, anywhere. Just as long as she isn't already engaged in one, you can start a light conversation. It's best to start with a question, that way she is immediately engaged and you have her attention.

, Don't grin from ear to ear every second, but don't be a block of ice either. Warmly smile periodically.

, The ""Touch Barrier"" is a line most guys are afraid to cross because it means physical contact with someone they don't know extremely well. But this line isn't all that hard to cross if you know how. Light, innocent contact works best. Brush a strand of hair out of her eyes, hold her hand to lead her somewhere, a quick hug, or a soft shoulder rub when consoling will go a long way. Be sure to do QUICK touches though, don't rough her up, and DON'T keep her in one place. This will frighten her and work the opposite way you desire.

, Girls love funny guys and if you make her laugh then that's a good sign she's not regretting spending time with you. If you have to, embarrass yourself a little. This does NOT mean passing gas or slipping in mud for other's entertainment. If you stumble a bit or lose your balance, and she laughs, that's a great way to smile and give a playful nudge and say, ""Don't laugh,"" or something of the sort.

, Don't hold back your true self from her. Show who you really are and have fun with the flirting. Don't waste time thinking of wonderful aspects of your life to make up to make you sound more interesting. Be you! Like before, if she can't accept that, there's somebody out there a million times better who can.

, You have no obligation to flirt with her. You like her! So make it your own experience. If you both are giggling, smiling, and having fun, then you're doing it right. If it's awkward, laugh about it! Say, ""Well this is awkward..."" Chances are, she'll smile and agree, and it'll be an easy inside joke.

, As long as you're comfortable, confident, and prepared, you'll do fine. And it can even lead to something more.

Keep him or her updated on your life back home and vice versa.",How to Cope With a Sibling Leaving for College," You may find that college is all she or he wants to talk about, and that is OK. Share in this excitement and even play along since you are probably in some way excited for the change.


College and moving out is a time filled with big change. If you have questions, ask them. Get the ball rolling with questions like ""How do you feel about this big change? Are you excited?"" Your sibling will probably enjoy talking about the new adventure and it gives you time together.
Share in the excitement by getting involved in the preparations. This not only distracts you from feeling bad but gives you extra time with your sibling before moving day.;
, Do not be afraid to speak up to your sibling or your parents about the fear. It's common for siblings left behind to have these worries. No one will be mad at you for speaking up about how you feel. There are some things you can do to ease these worries.Spend some time alone with your sibling before he or she leaves to make new memories and share in any knowledge he or she may feel they need to pass on to you before the move.
Don't be angry at him or her for leaving. Be happy. Going to college is a rite of passage. Soon, you will be the one leaving the household.

, The sibling who is not going anywhere may be temporarily forgotten during the flurry of activity prior to one child starting college. Don’t feel bad about expressing your concerns to your parents, if you feel this way.Moving day—and the days leading up to it—is probably going to be pretty stressful so getting angry if you are feeling left out is not going to be helpful. Instead ask for some quiet time to talk to mom or dad about your feelings. ""Mom? Dad? Can I talk to you guys for a moment?...I've been feeling really left out lately.""
Do not be afraid to ask for your mom or dad to give you some one-on-one time to talk about your fears and reservations about the move. You may be surprised to know that they are also probably feeling a mix of emotions., It’s OK to be sad and to take time to adjust to the change. Don't fall into the line of thinking that showing sadness is lame or weak. Your sibling will no doubt be touched that he or she has such an impact on you that leaving makes you upset.You can overcome grief or sadness by talking about it with either your sibling, your parents, or a close friend.
Don't be afraid to show your emotions. Bottling up how you feel often makes it much worse. Sometimes, it helps to just get it all out and show your sibling how you feel. That being said, don't make it so dramatic to the point that he or she feels guilty about leaving.

, Your sister or brother is likely to be feeling a host of emotions—fear, sadness, anxiety, and enthusiasm. Ask what you can do to make the transition easier. A simple ""Is there anything I can do to help?"" can make your sister or brother feel less alone during this big transition.


Another way to show support is to distract your sibling from the big move. Distractions can work wonders to deal with the stress of the move. Sometimes, the best support is just taking the time to step away from packing to do something fun the two of you used to do together like riding your bikes or going for a walk in the park.

, Creating new memories before he or she leaves will help you two stay connected. It might be fun to plan a going away party, help your brother or sister come up with decorations for the dorm, or visit campus to see where he or she will be living soon.Siblings like to feel a connection to family and like they are creating a legacy. So, take some time to ask your brother or sister for advice before the move.

, Giving your brother or sister a special gift can go along way towards helping him or her adjust to college life and helping you express your emotions. The gift doesn’t have to cost a lot. But, it should mean something to both of you.


Pictures or frames make great gifts to take to college and use as decorations. You can also make your sister or brother a special gift that bring up memories for him or her.
Matching items like a special pillow or stuffed animal you both can keep on your beds make for a cute gift as well.

, Get engaged with a new hobby. Spend more time with your existing friends. Your life shouldn’t stop when your brother or sister goes away to college. Plus, getting involved in new activities will keep your calendar full and help you better cope with his or her departure., You and your sibling probably used to stay up talking to each other until late at night about everything. Now that he or she is gone, you may feel more alone.Luckily, with the various forms of technology available today, you can connect with your sibling in a ton of different ways.


Establish a schedule for calls so you are not left feeling bad if the sibling isn’t able to answer. While traditional phone calls are still a great communication tool, using additional methods allows the student to check messages and comments at a time that is convenient for them.
Texting works great for anytime use because you can write back and forth when available instead of needing the other person to connect right away.
You can also connect through e-mail, Skype, Facebook, Instant Messenger, etc. You can even video chat or call with video to see each other as often as you are both available.

, Being able to visualize the small block of time between the move and the visit will help you to look forward to the visit instead of focusing on the sadness of the move.


Make home visits special. Be sure to do plenty of fun activities with the whole family that allows all of you to be together again, like old times.

, A big part of this is sharing the fun of your new role with the sibling, chances are he or she is going to like the fact you are growing up and taking on new roles."

Annoy your siblings while they're sleeping.,
Venture into your sibling's room a lot.,
Cheat at games and deny cheating.,
Act like a mime for a while around them alone.",How to Annoy Your Siblings1," If they're trying to get to sleep, they'll be really annoyed that you're not letting them sleep. If they're already asleep, they'll be annoyed that you woke them up for no reason.


When your sibling is sleeping, put your face right on top of theirs, stare at them, breathe hard, cough on them, or sneeze on them.






If your sibling is sleeping, go get some make-up and paint a clown face on your face(if you don't have makeup, use non toxic markers!). Then, get a flashlight, and wake him up. As he opens his eyes, shine the flashlight on your face. He'll see the clown face and get really scared.






If your sibling is trying to get to sleep, keep asking him or her a ridiculous question like ""Where do frogs come from?"" over and over again. Keep asking the same question until your sibling wants to scream.





;
, Call your sibling nice things, then ask them to read in their room because it's a nice spot. You can also read over their shoulder. This is very annoying, especially when they're reading a book they don't want you to see. When they're gone, move some of their stuff and read one of their books. Make sure there are other people around that could have moved them, so there are more suspects. If they blame it on you, say something like ""I didn't mean to"" or "" I looked at them, and forgot where they went.""

, If they win, then say ""I win! I win!"" and keep on saying it. When you beat your sibling at your favorite game, shout ""You lose!"" repeatedly.


Whenever you're playing a game with your sibling, take the game very seriously when you are winning. Whenever your sibling is winning, act like you don't care. Don't make a big deal if your sibling loses interest when you're winning — they want you to get upset!







, Pretend to be in an invisible box, then if someone else comes in the room, act normal. If your sibling calls you names, do something random that fits what they said and point at them. Get in their face to creep them out.

Flirting is about confidence, and your physical grooming — or the lack thereof — says a lot about how confident you are.


You don't need to look like you're going to the White House to meet the president, but you want to look elegant and clean. Make sure what you're wearing fits you, is not a fashion statement from the 70s or 80s, unless you intended it to be, and is something you're comfortable in.

Shower or otherwise clean yourself regularly. Wear deodorant, brush your teeth, wash your face, cut your nails, etc. Don't forget to use mouthwash right before you see/talk to your crush.
Wear your hair in a style that makes you feel pretty/handsome and compliments your facial structure. Don't be afraid to do something fancy with your hair if you're a girl.
If you're a guy, take it easy on the cologne. Guys are notoriously heavy-handed with cologne. They sometimes spray on enough cologne to injure small animals. Seriously, though — a little cologne goes a long way.;
, Flirting comes naturally if you're confident. You visualize success instead of fearing failure. You go after your goals because you believe in yourself. If flirting were a sport, confidence-building would be the training your coach would put you through in order to succeed.


Surround yourself with other people before you flirt. Be around members of the opposite gender right before you flirt. It will get you accustomed to feeling comfortable around them. It will also get you in the mood to be social, helping you gradually build up to that knock-out confidence you'll want to flirt.
Find a way to pump yourself up right before you flirt. Do something you do really well right before you flirt: it will make you more confident, and it will give you a little bit of an ego boost. This could be playing sports, practicing an instrument, or acing a test.

, Flirting can seem hard to some because the stakes are so high: if the person doesn't flirt back with you, or give signs that they like you, you feel inadequate as a person. Don't let that feeling overcome you. Your worth as a person is much more than whether you can flirt.


Shrug off mistakes. Everyone messes up a line when they're nervous around someone they like. It literally happens to everyone. The flirting pros just shrug off these mistakes and don't let it dent their confidence. Don't let it dent yours.
Ask yourself: what's the worst that could happen? If you're feeling really nervous, try to ask yourself this question. It helps put things in perspective. Flirting is nerve-racking, but it's actually not a huge deal. If the person you're flirting with doesn't flirt back, it's not the end of the world. If you have love to give, someone will love you back eventually.
Don't make one person the all-or-nothing. The key to flirting is flirt with more than one person. You have your crush, and that's fine, but you can practice around other people. The truth is that you're going to get rejected some of the time — that's just the way life is. If you hang around a couple people you're interested in, rejection from one person won't be as crushing.

, One advantage of flirting online is that the other person won't necessarily know that you're nervous. So take advantage of that and be as casual as you can. Here are some casual openers you can start with:


""Hey, how's it going?""
""Hey, do you happen to know the homework from History class?""
""Hi, did you hear that is having a party one week from Friday?""

, You want your crush to feel good about themselves, right? One easy way to do that is to keep the conversation (mainly) focused on them. Be comfortable talking about yourself, but don't forget to ask them some basic, non-threatening questions that they can easily talk about:


""So I hear you're a finalist for the district science project? Congratulations! What's your project about?""
""I'm new to this part of town. What do people around here usually do for fun?""
""Have any plans for summer break? I think I just might die if I have to stay around the house the whole time.""

, It wouldn't be flirting without a compliment or two. Complimenting tells your crush that you notice and value what they do. Try to stay as casual as possible when you compliment.


If you're a guy complimenting a girl, don't compliment the feminine areas. That means no mention of breasts, butt, or the like. Guys treat girls like sex objects all the time. Be a man and show her you value her personality first and foremost.
Reinforce how they want to be viewed. There's a good chance that if you reinforce how they want to be viewed by other people, they'll act favorably to you. If they fancy themselves an athlete, compliment how sporty they are; if they fancy themselves an intellectual, compliment how smart they are.
Don't compliment them too much. The more you compliment them, the less each one of your compliments means. Choose a couple compliments that can't be misinterpreted and leave it at that. Your crush will catch on.
Here are some ideas that you can try or elaborate on when you compliment:

""It's so nice talking to you. Thanks for being so open and friendly!""
""What does a gorgeous girl/handsome boy like you do for fun on a Friday night?""
""So how is it that someone as smart and attractive as you doesn't have a boyfriend/girlfriend?""
""I know this is a little unfair to the other boys/girls at school, but you really make it easy to go to class on Mondays.""



, Cheesy pick-up lines are like pet rocks: they sound cool, but they're absolutely useless. On top of that, they're hard to respond to. It's way better to stay sincere if you can't think of something interesting to say.

, If you're on friendly terms with your crush, don't be afraid of teasing them a little as a way of flirting. Be careful that they know you're teasing, being ironic, or sarcastic — over the internet, it can be hard to tell whether or not someone's being serious.


Tease them gently about something they're good at/confident about. If your crush is a star athlete, and you say ""So how many extra goals is your team going to have to score when they don't have you on the field?"" it'll be perfectly clear that you're joking. Plus, there's almost no chance that they get offended because they know they're a good athlete.
Tell inside jokes. Talk about things you both experienced together, and tell inside jokes from time to time. Inside jokes strengthen your camaraderie and help you connect over the small things in life.

, Don't be afraid to cut the conversation short if it's going really well. It's better than leaving the conversation when there's nothing to say or something wrong was said. Leave your crush wanting more rather than wanting less.


At the end of your conversation, say something like ""You're fun to talk to — text me later?"" or ""See you tomorrow at school?"" to build on the progress you made.

, These are two of the biggest rules of flirting. Flirt with your eyes and don't forget to smile. We communicate so much with our eyes and our lips, and they're some of our most flattering features. Use them to your advantage!


Look into your crushes eyes a little more than is comfortable. It's hard to do, but it sends the signal that your crush is irresistible — something everyone wants to feel like.
Make eye contact when you talk with your crush. Learn to hold your crush's eyes with yours when you talk. If you do this the right way, it won't hardly matter what you say, because your crush will be mesmerized by your gaze.
Smile from a distance and up close. Smiling from a distance is inviting: it says, ""Come closer, I won't bite."" When your crush is up close, smiling says, ""Stay a little longer, you make me happy."" A great smile can be the difference between a successful flirt and one that fails.

, Conversation starters are just ways to get the conversation going. They're usually very basic, and you don't have to put too much thought into them:


""That dress looks great on you. Did you make it yourself?""
""Did you hear what did over the weekend? I heard he set a Guinness World Record....""
""You seem like a math whiz. Can you help me do this algebraic equation?""

, Introduce yourself if you haven't already. You can do this after your conversation starter (it's pretty casual, and very cool), or you can use the introduction as the conversation starter: ""Hi, I'm Georgia, I don't think we've met before."" Remember to smile and hold their eyes as you introduce yourself!

, Always try to figure out their interest level: if they seem bored or not very talkative, you may want to wind down the conversation and try another time. Keep the following in mind as you continue to talk to your crush:


Find common ground. Relate to the other person with your own personal experiences, and share similarities. If you both love surfing, talk about Hawaiian waves or surf competitions you've been to. Exploring common ground will help you feel connected to your crush, and make your crush feel connected to you.
Avoid sticky subjects, like politics or religion, unless your crush invites the conversation. Politics and religion are hard to talk about because they involve strong emotional reactions. They can divide as much as they connect, so stay away from talking about them if possible.

, Hug, touch him or her on the shoulder, or give a flirty smile instead of just saying a simple goodbye.


In general, women can get away with touching much earlier in a conversation than men can. Many women feel a little threatened when a man they just met enters their personal space, while most men are more open to being touched. In any case, proceed with caution, and back off if you get negative or mixed signals from the person.
Learn to touch the safe areas. These areas include the hand, the arm, the shoulder, or the back. When you're talking to your crush, touch their shoulder briefly to make a point. Or do the same with their hand. If they're interested, it'll send a shiver up their spine.
Get a little bolder as you grow more comfortable. Hold the person's hand when you cross the street, or if walking to a seat or a table, lead them by gently holding their arm. Brush up against them softly when you're walking together, or accidentally bump into the other person to get their attention.

, We went over complimenting in Part Two, but here are some reminders of what to do when you're complimenting:


Never compliment overly sexual traits. It's really easy to go too far and turn the other person off. Only compliment the following physical attributes:

Eyes
Smile
Lips
Hair
Clothing


Reinforce how they want to be viewed. If they fancy themselves an athlete, compliment how sporty they are.
Don't compliment them too much. The more you compliment them, the less each one of your compliments mean.
Keep your eyes focused on the other person and your smile bright. These traits will make your already-great compliments go even further!
Be casual with your compliments. Try to make the compliment flow naturally into the conversation if you can.
Be bold! If you're feeling adventurous — and you should, because fortune favors the bold — try something funny and bold at the same time: ""I'm sure you get this all the time, but you're absolutely the most beautiful person I've seen...in the last three minutes.""

, Flirty conversation can last quite a while, but usually it's over within a matter of minutes. And that's a good thing! You want to flirt with the other person while the window of opportunity is there, and then leave them wanting more, so they come back and you have a chance to flirt with them again, and again, and again....


After 5-10 minutes, find an excuse to leave. ""Oh, I was going to help my friend with some homework"" works fine. Try to end the conversation on a high note.
Don't obsessively talk to the person every single day. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, they say. Keep the other person guessing. Be mysterious. Don't be an open book.
Let the other person work a little for you, too. Now that you've successfully flirted with your crush, make them flirt back with you! It doesn't have to be a game, but make them work a little for your heart. People like a little bit of a challenge.

, It doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl — it's perfectly fine for girls can ask guys out on the first date, as long as the guy sets up the second date.


Ask them what they're up to a week or so in advance: ""Hey are you busy this coming Saturday? I have a couple tickets to that movie that just came out.""
Choose a public place and an exciting date. A public place will make your crush feel comfortable, and an exciting activity will help both of you bond together as you enjoy it.
If you're really feeling confident, just go out and say it: ""You and I work well together. How about a date later this weekend? Dinner and a movie?""
You don't have to call it a date if you don't want to. Just ask the other person to join you in what you're doing. If your crush asks you whether it's a date, then you can say it is.

Play with an imaginary object.,
Learn a foreign language that they don't know.,
Follow your sibling around and stare at them wherever they go.,
Point at them.,
Ignore them ruthlessly even when they get upset.,
Call your brother a girl or your sister a boy.",How to Annoy Your Siblings2," If your sibling says something like ""you're an idiot,"" turn around and, if there's a pencil behind you, pick up the pencil and say ""It's all right, pencil, he/she didn't mean it.""


This gets very annoying if you keep talking to the imaginary object instead of your sibling.






Your sibling might even scold you back like ""You're the fool who's talking to a pencil."" The backup plan for this is to tell your teacher or parent that your sibling not only scolded the pencil but also scolded you.







, Start insulting them in that language. Make sure your parents don't know the language. To make it easier, don't just learn bad words, get insults, curse words, or mean phrases in your vocabulary.


Or, you can just say ""Hi, your name is (name)"" or some other random phrase, and make them think you are insulting them. Then, after they beg you (or tell on you), you can tell them what it really means.






Another proven method is to call them ""benevolent,"" which means nice. After they disagree and you tell them what it really means, continue this a few days, and one day change ""benevolent"" to ""malevolent,"" which means ""mean"" or ""nasty.""






Make up your own language and start insulting them in it. Make sure it is hard to understand. If they understand it then they can tell your parents.







, This is another super-annoying trick. If they stare back, then start staring at them with very very wide eyes and a scary face. Put your face about an inch away from theirs, and make it obnoxious.


Stare at the back of your siblings head till they turn around. Just smile and wave. Then do it over and over again till they get annoyed!







, You don't even need to look at them, but if they move, keep following them with your finger. For some reason, pointing is really threatening and annoying. Siblings hate it!

, When your sibling is talking to you, be quiet and ignore them like they are not there. This works very well when they are asking you where something is.

, Siblings hate it when another sibling pretends they're a different gender, especially if they're a boy. Calling a boy a girl is one of those things that should really annoy him.


Mistakenly call them the opposite of what they are. For example, if you have a brother and you're talking to someone right in front of your brother, say ""My brother is so annoying! She... I meant he! said..."". Do this over and over.

Play the kazoo or another very annoying instrument.,
Make random noises every now and again.,
Slurp every drink you have as loudly as you can.",How to Annoy Your Siblings3," A kazoo is a very annoying instrument. Play it loudly and obnoxiously. Do it in the morning, at night; pretty much whenever your sibling is trying to concentrate or wants quiet.


Another annoying instrument to be playing all over the place is a recorder. This time, take the top part of it off, and blow into it ""loudly"" when your sibling is doing homework, watching TV, talking on the phone, etc.







, Make sure that they do not see you. They will get annoyed, wondering where it is coming from. You can just sit around the corner watching and laughing!

, If you're alone with your sibling(s) and you get thirsty, get a glass of water (or any other liquid) and slurp it. It will drive them nuts after a little while.

Sing a song over and over again.,
Sing goofy things like turiht turiht wakka wakka e e bananananananana.,
Mimic your sibling.,
Rub it in your sibling's face.,
Keep saying ""What?"",
Make a continuous, incessant sound.",How to Annoy Your Siblings4," Choose songs that become annoying when sung over and over again. Sing it in an annoying tone, and make sure that they don't like the song.


Sing la la la la la in your sibling's ear. When they turn around, run but keep on doing it until they yell.
Sing an annoying song such as ""What does the fox say?"" and make up words to go with it.

, Over and over and over again., It's very annoying when you say exactly what your sibling said back at him/her. It's a form of ignoring what they're saying.


If they say ""you're stupid"", for example, say ""I know you are, but what am I?"" They'll just say ""You're stupid!"" again. Keep saying ""I know you are, but what am I?"". This will get them very annoyed at you.






If they keep calling you ""stupid/mean/dumb/etc."" try to use some general knowledge and say: ""The people who call others stupid/mean/dumb are actually the most stupid/mean/dumb people in the universe, which means that you're stupid/mean/dumb. Goodbye!""






If your sibling calls you a copycat, just say: ""That's what you think, and what you want it to be."" Then keep saying exactly what they say until they walk away, furious and frustrated.







, When your mom or dad tells your sibling anything (not something like ""you got straight A's"" or something!), say ""Yeah, ."" If your parent tells your sister to clean up her room, for example, just say ""Yeah, Clara."" Do this whenever your parents give your siblings an order.

, to everything your sibling says. If they ask you where something is, say ""What?"". If someone else comes and says something to you, don't say ""What?"" to them.

, It could be anything: beeping, humming, singing, etc. When they get annoyed and tell you to stop, say no and continue doing whatever sound you are making. They will make another incessant sound just to annoy you into stopping. Even if it is, act like it doesn't and shrug. They will try to compromise and then scream and leave."
"
Get your sibling into trouble.,
Tell on your sibling.",How to Annoy Your Siblings5," If you're by yourself with your sibling, lie on the ground and scream. When your mom or dad comes, say that he/she pushed you. Your parents will punish them.

, If your sibling is doing something that they don't want your parents to know about, tell on them. They'll really dislike that. Make sure that you have proof of them doing whatever they're doing by videotaping, audio recording, or photographing it. It's sweet, sweet revenge.

Steal something from her.,
Hide her clothes.,
Scare her.,
Cover her room with toilet paper.,
Pretend she hurt you.,
Annoy her while she's sleeping.,
Throw water balloons at her.,
Turn off the light while she's in the bathroom.,
Mess with her food and drink.,
Send messages from her phone.,
Make a splash.",How to Bug Your Sister1," One of the best ways to bug your sister is to steal her things.


Sneak into her room and take something really important, like her iPod, her favorite pair of earrings, or the stuffed animal she sleeps with every night.
When she confronts you about it, deny that you took it - you should practice your innocent face beforehand. You could also pretend to be really offended that she accused you.
Make sure that you've hidden the item well, in case she decides to search your room for it. Then, when she's out of the house, put the item back exactly where you found it. She'll start to think she's gone crazy!;
, Everyone knows how much girls love their clothes, so what better way to annoy your sister than to hide them all!


When she's out of the house, sneak into her room with a big bag and dump all of her clothes inside. Hide them somewhere she won't think to look for them, like the bathtub or the garden shed.
She'll probably freak out when she sees that her wardrobe is empty, so have a good excuse prepared. Try telling her that your mom decided that she had too many clothes and gave them all away to charity!

, There's nothing more satisfying than giving your sister a good scare, especially if she screams!


Plan your attack carefully. Lie in wait for her in a dark room, behind her bedroom door or behind the shower curtain in the bathroom.
When she comes in, you have two options: you can either scream at the top of your lungs or creep up behind her and grab her - both can be really effective.
For added effect, try wearing a scary clown mask or brandish a fake knife.

, Another great practical joke that will definitely drive your sister crazy is to cover her room with toilet paper.


Grab a roll from the bathroom and just go crazy. Try to zig-zag the paper across the room by hanging it from the ceiling light, the windows and the wardrobe.
Cover her bed in piles of the stuff (or even put it in the bed). If you want to get really creative, soak some of the toilet paper in water and throw it at her walls, ceiling and mirror. This should make it stick.
Just be warned that if your parents find out, you'll probably be the one who has to clean it up - so don't go too crazy!

, Get your sister in trouble with your parents by pretending that she hurt you - either physically or emotionally.


Just before they walk into a room, lie down on the ground in front of your sister and cry out, as if in pain. When your parent ask what's wrong, tell them she pushed you.
Pinch your own arm so that it leaves a red mark, then tell your parents that your sister did it. They'll never believe that you intentionally hurt yourself, so she'll get in trouble.
Tell your parents that your sister called you stupid, or ugly or that you have no friends - the meaner the better. She won't be able to prove that you made it up!

, Annoying your sister while she's sleeping is so easy to do, and produces some pretty hilarious results!


One of the best practical jokes you can play is to squirt shaving foam or whipped cream into her hand and then tickle her nose. She'll try to scratch her nose and wind up with a face full of cream!
Alternatively, you can try waking her up in the middle of the night. Wake her up in some annoying way, like jumping on her bed or poking her face. Tell her it's 8.30 am and she's going to be late for school. (If you're really clever, you'll change the time on her alarm clock as well.) Hopefully she'll get up in a panic and start getting dressed for school - even though it's really 5 am!

, Water balloons are the perfect tool to bug your sister with, especially if she hates getting her hair wet!


Get your hands on some water balloons, fill them with cold water and carefully tie the ends. Lie in wait for your sister (somewhere outdoors or your parents will kill you) and when she comes attack her with water balloons.
It'll be extra funny if you wait until she's sunbathing with a bunch of friends in the garden, or hanging out with her boyfriend. Be warned though - soaking her with water balloons is sure to make her see red - so run away as fast as you can afterwards!

, Have you ever been sitting on the toilet when someone accidentally turns off the light in the bathroom? Not fun, is it?


Use this technique to bug your sister - especially if she's hogging the bathroom, again. It's easier if the light switch is on the outside, but if it's on the inside just open the door very quietly and flick it off before she notices.
If you can, try locking the bathroom door from the outside, leaving her stuck inside in the dark. Don't leave her in there for too long though, have mercy!
If your sister leaves the bathroom door unlocked while she's in the shower, you could also try sneaking in and flushing the toilet. Sometimes this will turn the shower water cold, which she'll hate!

, Messing with your sister's food and drink is one surefire way to drive her up the wall!


If you're sitting at the kitchen table and she has a glass of water or soda in front of her, point out the window and say ""look!"". When she turns back around, tell her you just spat in her drink (you don't actually need to spit in her drink, just say you did!) She'll be so disgusted, she'll have to pour the drink down the sink!
If your sister is eating something tasty, like a muffin or a bar of chocolate, try grabbing it really quickly and licking it all over. She'll be so grossed out that she won't want it anymore and you'll get to eat it instead!
If your sister is drinking a can of soda, wait until she puts it down somewhere and leaves the room. Then, very quickly, pour the rest of her soda down the drain and fill the can with milk (or some drink she hates) instead. Then when she comes back and takes a drink she'll be so surprised she might spit it out again.
If you wanted to be really mean, you could put something like soy sauce or juice from the pickle jar into the can instead.

, Your sister probably always has her phone in her hands, so it may be tricky to pull this one off. But if you can manage to steal her phone somehow, this will be the best prank of all.


Once you have the phone, go somewhere private to do your mischief. Look through her phonebook for the names of boys in her class, then send them all a message like ""I have a massive crush on you. Wanna go on a date on Friday night?"" Your sister will be mortified when she finds out!
You could also message a few of her best friends saying something like ""I am so mad at you right now...I'm telling everyone your secret"". Be careful with this one though - you might end up starting a major catfight!
If your sister has a smartphone, try logging into her Facebook or Instagram account from the apps on her phone. Take a picture of yourself and post it to her wall, saying something like ""I have the best brother/sister in the whole world! I love him/her soooooo much"". Your sister will go crazy when she sees it!

,


Get electric tape, duct tape or scotch tape.
Stick a piece under the faucet. Leave a small part toward the front of the faucet uncovered.
Make sure no tape is showing.
When your sister turns on the faucet, the water will spray up and onto her; she will get soaked and you will crack up.

Talk loudly.,
Brag and boast your accomplishments.There have been psychological studies done that indicate most people find arrogance and bragging to be superbly annoying traits in a person.,
Approach your brother with something at a bad time.,
Ask lots of questions.,
Spout gossip.Gossip be an source of enjoyment for some people under the right circumstances, but for people on the outside looking in, it's incredibly annoying.,
Repeat jokes and stories.,
Make yourself look like the best child.,
Keep your parents up to date on his life.,
Make a scene in public.,
Pull a silly prank.,
Use social media to annoy your brother publically.If you are ""friends"" with your older brother over social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter, you can use these sites as vessels for your irritations.,
Listen to your music loudly.Hearing is generally seen as the sense with the most potential for annoyance.,
Sing loudly in the shower.If you're living in the same place as your brother, the close quarters has potential to drive anyone mad.,
Put your bodily functions to use.,
Make a mess of the house.,
Look up ""Annoying Activities"" lists.Although there isn't a lot of serious advice on the internet available on how to intentionally annoy someone, there are fun lists around that might give you some inspiration as you're starting out.

,
Keep your irritations mild.,
Make up for it afterwards if you need to.It is very possible that you might take your irritations too far.",How to Annoy Your Older Brother Without Getting in Trouble," Noise is arguably the most important contributing factor towards annoyance.Anything you say can be made annoying based on volume alone. Whenever you're attempting to be annoying, make an effort to keep your speaking voice loud. Try to stay clear of outright screaming, however, as it's not sustainable. To truly annoy someone, you need to keep your irritating habits up for a while.


If you don't want to get in trouble, you should gauge what your parents (or other authority figures) will think of your loud volume. Although you may be trying to annoy your older brother specifically, there's a good chance you may end up annoying others in the process.
For a boost to your volume, try speaking directly into your brother's ear. The invasion of personal space can be a great annoyance tactic in of itself.;
, If you're trying to be annoying, you should put this research to the test. If you performed well on a test at school, you should talk his ear off about it. If you like a certain trait about yourself, you should make an effort to brag about it at every twist and turn.


If you brag to your parents about things you've accomplished, it might make you look better in their eyes.
This technique is best used in tandem with a loud volume. Unless your brother has wits of iron, this technique alone should start to show cracks in his psyche.

, Stress and annoyance is affected by someone's ability to cope with their current mood and workload.If your brother is carefree, it will take a lot more to annoy him than if he's already at his wit's end. Try to look for signs that he's feeling stressed:


He's already irritable and prone to anger.
You know he's really busy with work or school.
You've seen him react badly to everyday things.

, Question-asking is a vital part of conversation in mild doses, but if you constantly ask questions that have little relevance to the conversation at hand, it tends to get annoying fast. If you and your brother are having a conversation, you should make an effort to turn your talk into a sequence of questions about things of little value. Ask him how his day was, then proceed to interrogate him about the smallest parts of his day. How was the sandwich he ate for lunch earlier that day? Was the seat on the bus ride home plushy enough for his likings? These questions are usually worthless, but being bombarded by them will get the proper response out of him.


If you want to get meta with your annoying questions, you might ask him ""What is it that annoys you most?"" If he's gullible enough to answer you honestly, you should put that new information to good use.

, If you heard something juicy about a friend of yours, you should start rambling senselessly about it. It's fine if your brother doesn't know anything about the people you're gossiping about; to him, it'll just make your banter seem al the more pointless.


Gossiping isn't so likely to get you in trouble with parents if they don't know the people, but you do run the risk of getting into trouble with others if they find out you've ben talking about them behind their backs.
This is especially worthwhile if you know the people your brother is friends with. People get annoyed fast if they hear people they care about being discussed in a bad light.

, Even if a joke is good in the first place, it can be transformed in an evil weapon of annoyance if it's repeated enough times.The same goes for stories, catchphrases or questions. Repeating things has a cumulative effect: The more you repeat something, the more annoying it becomes.


With the right kind of determination, you can drive an older brother crazy simply by repeating a single catchphrase.

, One common way young people annoy their older siblings is through making themselves out to look like the superior child in a family. This can be done through overachieving in school, work, creative endeavours (like music) or social magnetism (like popularity.) Try to keep in mind whenever your parents are watching you, and do your best to excel in whatever ways you can. By contrast, your older brother may look less successful, and this by itself will be annoying to him.


Although no one likes a brown noser, most parents love to see their child trying to impress them somehow.
Keep in mind that making yourself look like the best is not necessarily compatible with being annoying in more obnoxious ways. On its own however, it's incredibly annoying.

, It is natural for children to keep a level of privacy from their parents. As a relative peer of your older brother, you have a potentially greater insight into what your brother's personal and social life looks like. By ""innocently"" telling your parents about whatever's going on in your brother's life, the broken privacy will annoy him to no end. What's better, there's a level of plausible deniability in doing this. If your brother tries to get angry with you about this, you can pretend like you were simply telling your parents out of admiration for your sibling.

, Exclaiming something outrageous in public turns every bystander into fuel for your brother's annoyance. If you and your brother are out in public together, acting obnoxious can embarrass and irritate your brother via association. Venues like the shopping mall or a library can be great for shouting matches. If being annoying by association doesn't seem like enough, you can turn the embarrassment directly on him by accusing him of something ridiculous.


For example, if your brother is a very sombre person, you can scream at the top of your lungs in public: ""Why do you wear that obnoxious clown costume to bed every night?"" The weirdness of a statement like that will get everyone's attention, and your brother won't have anything to say in response to it.
Make sure your parents aren't with you when you make a scene. If they are, you'll make them feel even more embarrassed than your brother. This will almost undoubtedly get you into trouble. You should also do a quick scan to make sure no one is watching that might report the scene to your parents.

, Pranks come in all shapes and sizes. The mild irritation of a prank is often combined with the social embarrassment it causes. This makes pranks a fairly heavy weapon in your arsenal. Try placing a whoopee cushion on his seat before he sits down for dinner. Better still, put salt in his beverage. Pranks more better if other people are in on the joke as well. It's important to make sure you don't tell anyone who might spill the beans to your brother. If this happens, you may run the risk of having the prank backfiring on you.


Purely embarrassing pranks are good if you don't want to get in trouble. The emotional annoyance of being embarrassed is hard to measure for someone else. This makes it perfect if you're trying not to get in trouble.
Make sure there isn't any material damage. You can slip away without getting in trouble for relatively ""harmless"" pranks, but parents are much more likely to get you in trouble if there's lasting damage.
You get bonus points if everyone else thinks its funny. The laughter will help embarrass your brother even further.

, Comment on all of his posts, and start sending messages to people he is friends with online. Intruding yourself on his social life is a quick way to get your brother annoyed.


If your parents are also on social media, it's a good idea to keep your posts innocuous and pleasant. Going out of your way to be annoying or crude will get on their radar, but a sickly-sweet tone might be seen by them as one sibling trying to bond with another.

, Music is a great way to annoy someone, especially if your tastes in music differ. If your rooms are next to each other, try blasting music while he's trying to sleep or study. It helps if you know in advance that he hates the music you're putting on.


Keep in mind that this runs the risk of you getting into trouble with your family. Keep your parents' tolerance in mind, or save this for when they're not around.

, A shower is a great opportunity to simultaneously test the limits of your vocal cords and your family's patience. If you know your brother is nearby, try belting out the most obnoxious song you can think of. Whatever's charting on a Top 40 list is a great place to start with if you're unsure what to sing.

, Farting, sneezing, burping and cracking your knuckles are all but a few of the tools your body offers you when it comes to being annoying. Gross-out humour using your body can turn an older sibling off his dinner, or distract him from his studying while he's trying to focus. If you try this, you should consider what tolerance for rudeness other members of your family have. You should only try to annoy one person at a time. If you're doing this with family around, you should be reasonably sure your brother will be the only one that objects.


If you're not usually a gassy type, eating a healthy dose of beans will get you on the right track.

, A messy environment will get on a lot of peoples' nerves without them sometimes even realizing it. If your brother is a neat freak and likes to keep things tidy, making an intentional mess of areas he's usually in will put him on edge. Although a mess may not be enough to annoy your brother on its own, it does have the effect of making him more sensitive to other irritating activities.


This may be more annoying to your parents than your brother. After all, it's their place. If you do make a mess, you should try to clean up before they notice.
If you think you can manage it, try going into his room and messing things up a little bit.

,, Part of annoying someone means not taking it too far. Annoyance does not include bullying or being truly mean-spirited. At the end of the day, you should make sure you and your brother's relationship is okay., Annoying someone directly is one thing, but embarrassing him in front of his friends can result in potentially serious damage to his relationships. If you accidentally take something to that point, it's a good idea to stop while you're ahead. Apologize to him, and offer to make it up somehow.


If you manage to get in trouble with your parents, making amends with your brother will be a good way of easing the consequences on your end.
Buying your brother lunch is a good way to make up if you go too far.

Make your sibling a meal, ask them what they want.",How to Annoy Your Siblings6," If they're in the bathroom and the door is open, or they're at their desk quietly doing homework, sneak up on them and yell ""Boo!"" really loud or make an alarm go off really loudly.

, Then crumple some of it up and say ""I'm crumpling up your homework"" and go on an rip it up. Throw the pieces at them, then keep doing this every hour., Let's say your sibling likes to play computer or video games, for example. If you mess with their progress so they have to do the same level over again, they'll get really annoyed.


If your sibling is playing a video game, wait until they leave the room. Once they've left the room, restart the level or the whole game and quickly hide. Make sure you have more than one sibling, so there are more suspects. Deny everything your sibling accuses you of, saying that he/she may have restarted himself/herself because he/she wanted to relive the thrill of the game.






Bonus points if they're playing a game like Call of Duty or Halo with long campaign levels, and you reset the level when they haven't saved for several missions/levels/etc.
Ask your sibling if he/she needs help on a level and then purposely die or harm the character's progress. Say ""whoopsie!"" Put down the controller and walk away.






If they are on the computer all day long, unplug the modem and plug it back in, or find another way to get the internet down (like making a call if you still have dial-up).






When your little sibling has just sat down to play his/her new favorite video game, get a long, wide towel and rush over to the room s/he's in with the towel wrapped around you. Sit in a chair behind them. They'll look at you and ask what you're doing, but don't say anything. When his/her attention is fully back on the game, slowly make your way over to the TV screen. Then, quickly cover the screen and hold it there so she/he can't see her/his game. He/she will start to get angry and when she/he looks like she/he is about to explode with anger, take down the towel and run away.







, If your sibling is in the bathtub with the curtain closed and has left the door open, go inside, turn off the light and shut the door. They'll have to get out of the warm bath in order to see.


If your sibling is quietly doing homework at night with the light on, keep slowly and quietly coming into the room and turn off the lights. Each time, they'll have to get up out of their seat and turn on the lights before they can see the homework.







, It is even better is to hide it in another sibling's closet, so the blame goes on them and not you. You've just killed two birds with one stone!

, If they are eating their breakfast/lunch/dinner, ask them if they would like some milk. Go to the fridge and fill the glass up with water, then pour a tiny bit of milk to make it look white. Serve it to them and say ""This is the last bit of milk. You're welcome! And then run away.


Put salt in their soft drink. Ask them if they want a soda. Open the soda, dump a bunch of salt in the soda, and wait until they drink it. When they complain, just say ""Soda isn't healthy for you anyway! I'm looking out for you bro/sis!""






If you don't want to put salt in their cola, just shake the cola up really hard right before you bring it to them. When they open it up, it'll spray everywhere. Also you can put mints in their cola just before you give it to them so it will shoot everywhere.







, If you are watching TV or just lying on your bed and you hear your sibling coming close, act like you are sleeping. They will either leave or come near you. If they come near you, jump up and scream, scaring the daylights out of them. Bonus points if it's in their ear.

, If you want to get them really good, put Saran wrap or other plastic wrap on the toilet seat and tell them that the bathroom is open. When they have to go, they'll have to deal with the big mess. Boys can also pee on the seat, so  be careful about that.

, Then tickle their nose a little and run. Jump in your bed and pretend to be asleep, if they come in your room and try to do the same thing to you, put it in their face. Classic!

, Say they typed something like ""My name is billy"" You can change it to ""My name is barley"" or something like that. You can add, change, or delete their work.

, Move their desks, beds,and all their stuff. Do it while your parents are busy somewhere else in the house and while your sibling(s) are gone. Then it is possible that your parents did it (the more suspects the better).

, Put on a ghost movie or Toy Story before starting. They will think that their room is haunted or that their toys came to life.

, Make it for them but add some hard to notice tricks. Say they want milk to drink, add water. Maybe they want a sandwich, add a little extra ingredient. Make any changes small, and if they ask, make something up.

Play the paper basket game.,
Record yourself saying: ""You suck"" in a stupid sounding sing song voice.",How to Annoy Your Siblings7," If your sibling is mad and in their room with the door shut, knock on the door over and over again until they come to the door. If they come to the door and ask you what you want, pause and say, ""Hi"" and run off. That will get them extremely mad.

, Yell their name over and over in variations of nicknames that they hate, right in their ear when they are busy. Or hide and say it, so that they can't find you.

, If your sibling is older, hang around him/her when their friends are along. When he/she tells you to back off, don't say anything and keep following them. Do this until one of your parents tells you to back off.


If your parents tell you to stop, tell them ""I was just trying to be friendly! I don't have any friends"" and your parents might force your sibling to include you.






If your sibling starts calling you names, throwing things at you, or intimidating you, bring this evidence to your parents and try to get your sibling in trouble.

This works best on siblings when it is their first day in a new school.,
Tease your sibling about a girlfriend/boyfriend they don't have.,
Pretend to be your sibling on one of their accounts.,
Don't sit there and take it.,
Hang around your older sibling when they're spending time with a boy/girlfriend.,
Mess with them while they're on the phone.,

XOXO Love, Mommy"" on a post-it in pink marker or gel pen, and put it in their lunch box., When she/he is talking on the phone, run around in circles yelling ""has a girl/boyfriend.""


This only really works with younger siblings. Older siblings aren't as ashamed to have a girlfriend or boyfriend.







, When your sibling is IMing their friends or using Facebook, wait until they get up to go the bathroom or take a break and leave the room. Sneak over there and type some words into the chat or change your sibling's status to something really random like ""I like horses shaped like clouds!""

, If your sibling tries to make fun of you without evidence to back it up, like ""you're stupid"" or ""loser,"" attack them with an embarrassing story or a time when they failed. This is really effective when others are around.


For example: ""Remember that time when you went to the dance at school with Emily and you had diarrhea, and when you came back your pants were dripping."" Details magnify effect. Tease them about it. You can make up stories too, and if they deny it, it will seem more true.







, If they're snuggling in the living room while they watch a movie, sit down and start watching. It will be a test of wills, so be prepared to outlast them.

, While they're on the phone with their friend, get on the phone secretly to listen. You may get in trouble, but it's all worth it. When revealing you were listening, say it at a perfect time, but not too early.


While they're talking on the phone, try calling your sibling from a restricted number so they don't know it's you. When they answer pretend to be an old grandpa asking for cheese, for example, or something like that.






If an older brother/sister is on the phone with his/her boyfriend/girlfriend and there's an extension phone, make burping sounds down the line.
Pretend one of your parents needs them to do something right away and or is calling them. When they put the phone down to go check what it is they need to do, hang up the phone.







, In the middle of a restaurant, or in front of their friends, embrace them in a huge hug and say ""I love you so much!"" over and over again. If you want to make it worse, wear bright, bright pink/red lipstick and kiss them all over their face.

, If a friend is coming over, steal their diary or wherever they keep best secrets. Read it and start gushing the secrets in front of their friend.

, Pretend you are their crush and write a letter to them asking them to meet them somewhere at a time of your choice. This mostly works with older siblings and you will have to do some work to find out their crush.

, Do your best to copy their handwriting, to make it look convincing. Again, this mostly works with older siblings and you will have to do some work to decide who has a crush on them.

, They will run.

Sing an annoying song - constantly.,
Imitate everything she says.,
Stare at her all the time.,
Learn a language she doesn't understand.,
Completely ignore her.,
Make up an annoying nickname for her.,
If you want to get your sister really mad, you should take her diary, where she writes all of her innermost thoughts and secrets.,
Poke her.,
Laugh at everything she says.,
Wear her clothes and pretend you're her.",How to Bug Your Sister2," Choose a really annoying song, like ""La Cucaracha"" or ""The Birdie Song"" and sing it or hum it constantly when your sister is around. Soon it'll drive her crazy!


Alternatively, you could play a really annoying instrument, like the kazoo or a tambourine. Play it loudly when your sister is trying to do her homework or watch her favorite TV show.
When she tells you to knock it off, act really offended and tell her she's interfering with your musical genius.

, This is the oldest trick in the book when it comes to annoying your sister, but it still works like a charm. Whenever your sister says anything, repeat it - it'll infuriate her pretty quickly!


To make it even more annoying, put on a high-pitched, girly voice while you do it, and pretend that you can't pronounce your Rs properly, or that you have a lisp.
If she tries to get clever and say something like ""I'm an annoying little brat"" just so you'll repeat it, outsmart her by changing the ""I'm"" to ""you're"", so you say ""you're an annoying little brat"" instead.

, Try to freak your sister out by staring at her constantly, without speaking. Do it at the breakfast table, while she's watching TV, or when you're in the car. Make your eyes really wide and blink as little as possible.


Try sneaking into your sister's room in the morning, before she wakes up. Lean over her and place your face about on inch away from hers, staring at her. When she wakes up and the first thing she sees is your staring eyes she'll be completely freaked out!
You could also go outside and stand outside her bedroom window. Then when she opens her curtains, you'll just appear in front of her! She'll probably scream!

, Try learning a few phrases (or curse words!) from a language that your sister doesn't understand, and say them to her over and over again. This will drive her crazy, especially if she tends to be a bit of a know-it-all!


You could learn phrases from a real language, such as French or German, or from a made-up language, such as pig latin or gibberish.
You could also just learn some big words in English that you know she won't understand. You don't need to use them in context or anything, just say them as if you know what they mean. Some good ones include malevolent, perfidious and animalistic.

, Sometimes the best way to annoy your sister is not to do anything at all - just pretend she doesn't exist!


Don't ever look at her or acknowledge her presence at all. She may not notice or care at first, but after a while it'll start to drive her crazy!
Whenever she says something to you, don't reply, pretend you didn't hear anything. You could even look around you in a bewildered way and say something like ""who said that?"" or ""did you hear that?""
You can take this even further by pretending she doesn't even exist. When you set the table for dinner leave her place blank. Or when anyone mentions her name, look really confused and ask ""who?""

, Calling your sister by an annoying nickname is one surefire way to get her blood boiling.


Come up with a nickname that rhymes with her real name, like if her name is Hannah or Anna, you could call her ""banana"". Or if her name is Lucy, you could call her ""goosey"".
Or else just come up with something really offensive. For example, you could refer to her as ""The Squid"" or ""dog-face"" or ""Miss Piggy"".

,


When you're done, you can leave the diary somewhere obvious, along with a note that says something like ""I know all your secrets"". In fact, you don't even need to read her diary (nor should you), you just need to make her think you did.
However, if you do decide to read it (which you shouldn't), try to memorize some of the best bits. Then you can recite them back to her when she least expects it. For example, when she's doing her homework you could walk into the room and say ""I wish Ryan would notice me, but he acts like I'm invisible."" in a high-pitched, girly voice. Then you should run for your life!

, Simple, but effective - you can drive your sister crazy just by poking her over and over again. Do it in the car, at the dinner table, while she's watching TV, when she's in bed - basically whenever you can get close to her!


You can either poke her in the stomach, where it tickles or poke her face, where it's just really annoying. You could even make a face while you poke her and say something like ""Ewww, what is that?"" This will make her really paranoid - she'll think she has a huge pimple or something!
Just be warned that sisters tend to poke back - so don't give it if you can't take it!

, Another good way to bug your sister is to laugh at absolutely everything she says, even if she's being completely serious.


This will drive her particularly crazy if she's upset about something, such as a fight with her friend or getting a bad grade at school. Laugh and point, like Nelson from the Simpsons - ""haha!""
Or else you can laugh hysterically when she actually tries to make a joke or be funny. But keep laughing for a really long time, until it's obvious that you're just being sarcastic.

, Sneak into her room and snag some of her clothes. The more she likes those particular items, the better.

Dress like her. Use the same combination of skirt and blouse that she wears. If your feet are the same size or smaller, put on the shoes she'd wear with that dress.
Arrange your hair in a similar way if you can. If not, find a wig somewhere.
Come down to breakfast one morning as her. Mimic her speech patterns, hand movements and stuff like that. It won't take long before she howls for your mom or dad to make you stop!

Copy everything he or she says when they're in a mood.,

,
At school just go up to her and say ""Hi"" and ""How 're you doing?,
Be the family's princess, if they get told off, say ""I will never do that!,
Try saying one word over and over again and when he or she gets really mad, say one random word.

Poke and prod your sibling.,
Bug your sibling on long car-rides.",How to Annoy Your Siblings9," If you sleep in the same room as them, poke them without being seen. Do this a few times, and then purposely get caught. It will annoy them more if they know it's you.


Continually poke them and jump backwards if they attempt to retaliate. This is famous for annoying people. Poke your sibling, run back, then quickly pick up a book and start reading.







, Car-rides can get really annoying for siblings because you're stuck in the same place together for a while.


Offer to give your sibling the front seat and sit directly behind them. Periodically, give them:





A wet-willy. Suck on your finger and stick it into their ear.






A tickle on or near their ribs.






An annoying nudge on the back of their seat with your legs.






A breath of air right on the back of their neck.






A kick in the back of their seat.

Remove your siblings from their activity.,
Hide the gear.",How to Annoy Your Little Siblings1," For example, if they are on the computer, pick them up and carry them upstairs (or downstairs if the computer is upstairs). Move them away from wherever they are enjoying their activity.;
, When your sibling's playing video games, hide the controller in advance. This also works with TV, the DVD player, etc.

"
"
Mimic his voice.,
Take bites off his plate.,
Boss him around like you're his parent.,
Make stuff up.,
Embarrass him in front of his friends.,
Use the silent treatment.,
Try to be his friend, too.",How to Annoy Your Brother1," Any time your brother says anything, repeat what he said, but in a high-pitched girly voice. This has been driving little brothers crazy since the dawn of time. This is especially effective when he's telling you, ""Stop doing that!"" or ""I'm telling!""


When your parents come in, quickly switch over to your regular voice so you don't get caught.;
, While you're eating dinner, wait until nobody is looking and start sneaking bites off his plate. Make sure it's his favorite food, too. Before he notices, make comment like, ""Jeez, where's all your food going.""

, Little brothers want to be older so badly that the more you draw attention to their youth, the more annoyed they'll be. Treat him like he's much younger than you all the time.


If you have to do chores together, keep commenting about how he's slow, or can't keep up with you because you're older.
Assign him chores, even if it's not your job to do chore-assignments.
Call him a baby any time he asks you for help, or doesn't understand something. Always talk about how he's too small, too short, or not old enough to know something.

, Little brothers are impressionable little goofs. One way to annoy them is to make up ridiculous lies about the world and get them to believe it. If you can even get them to repeat it like it's real? That's a total win.


Tell your brother avocados are actually dinosaur eggs. And they're poisonous.
Tell your brother he wasn't actually born, your parents grew him in a bucket from catfish heads.
Tell your brother that you have the power to read minds. He's thinking, ""No you don't.""
Tell your brother that the dog speaks when he's not around. And says it wants to eat him.
Tell your brother Star Wars is a documentary. It really happened.
Tell your brother when he turns whatever age he turns next, his nipples will fall off, then grow back.

, If your brother has some friends coming over, it's a great time to mess with him and embarrass him in front of others. Bring out some of his baby pictures, or talk about something embarrassing he did the day before when his friends are over. He'll get really annoyed.


Nuclear warfare: Dump a glass of water on his bed, so it looks like he peed it the night before. Wait until his friends come over and let them find it.
Be really careful about doing this. If you're a cool older kid, you should probably have better things to do than messing around with your younger brother in front of his friends. You might just look like a loser doing this.

, If you really want payback for something, just ignoring your brother is sometimes the best option. He probably wants attention, and keeping that from him will drive hime even more crazy than anything you can do.


Don't let him do stuff that you're doing. If you're going to watch a movie, say he can't, because it's only for older kids. Freeze him out of whatever you're doing.

, Younger brothers usually look up to older kids. Just because your little brother might be annoying sometimes, Try to remember that you can be a good influence on him too. Instead of trying to annoy him, try to teach him to be cool. Don't make him a nuisance.


Only use these methods to get back at your brother for doing something that's mean. Don't make this a regular habit.

Remember that your parents have more life experience than you.,
Remember that sometimes you can be wrong.,
Don't argue.,
Never disrespect your parents.,
Look out for parental disapproval on friends.,
Remember that parents are human too.",How to Obey and Respect Your Parents," If your parents don't want you to do something, try to think about why they don't want you to. They often have good reasons that you may not understand at first. Maybe they've done something similar and don't want you to learn the hard way.;
, If a parent has a differing point of view, don't argue with them. Talk logically, and perhaps one of you will decide the other is right.

, Instead, listen to their points of view and calmly state your own. If they get angry, don't let the conversation evolve into a shouting match. If your parents say that they are right and you are wrong, respect their decision. If you do not agree, however, please don't force yourself. You have a right to your own opinions, and obeying your parents is not your duty. But doing it is worth it!

, If a parent says that you have to go to bed at a certain time, do it. If they tell you you absolutely must not do something, don't do it. It's not worth the severe drop in trust levels you will experience.

, Pay attention to how this friend behaves: Do they do drugs? Skip school? Are they a good role model for you?

, They aren't demons trying to take away all your fun - they often have good reasons for what they do. Treat your parents like human beings and they will treat you like one too.

Pick a good time and place.,
Begin talking.,
Let them know what's in it for them.,
Speak the truth.,
Talk about yourself.,
Back up what you say.,
Hear your parents out.,
Be civil.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Do Something1," You need to know exactly what you want to happen when you have the conversation. Do you want to go to a dance? Do you want a later curfew? Do you want to go out to a special dinner with your parents? Think about what you want from the conversation., It can even help to write it down. Make sure you have all the important details. Having details will help you answer questions. Answering questions will calm your parents down.For instance, if you want to spend the night at friend's house, you'll need to know if her parents will be there, when the night will start, what you'll need to bring, and when your parents can pick you up. It also might help to have a phone number for your friend's parents. That way, your parents can call her parents.

, You don't want to talk when your parents are busy. Pick a time when they have a moment to sit down with you. It should be a time when you can have their full attention. If you can't figure out a time, ask your parents when a good time would be., If you keep trying to draw it out, you're just going to get more nervous. As soon as you get your parents together, just begin what you have to say.For instance, you could start by saying, ""I have something I want to discuss with you, and I hope you will keep an open mind. I'd like to go to the dance this Saturday night.""
If you absolutely can't get it out right away, it's okay to start the conversation with something else, as long as you get to the point eventually., A good way to convince someone to do something is to tell the person what good it will do them.Think about how your parents will benefit from what you are doing, and bring that up.As an example, if you're trying to get your parents to let you go out for a night, you could say, ""As an added bonus, you'd get the house all to yourself!""
Another example is if you're trying to get your parents to eat out somewhere, mention their favorite dishes.

, If you try to like or give a half truth, your parents may not trust you in the future if they find out. Plus, they know you pretty well, so they can probably tell when you're lying., That is, you might have a tendency to blame your parents. Most people do in serious conversations. However, you should try to stick to what you're feeling or thinking, not what you blame your parents for.In other words, use ""I"" instead of ""you."" Say, ""I feel upset when I can't go out when my friends do,"" not ""You're awful for not letting me go out with my friends."" The second one puts your parents on their guard, while the first one just expresses what you're feeling.

, If you can, have details to back up what you say. As noted in the previous section, having details about where you're going is important. But it's equally important to have details in other conversations, too. Having someone with more authority than you, such as one of your friend's parents, a teacher, or a researcher through an article, to back you up can help persuade your parents.For instance, if you're trying to convince your parents that you should be in the band, you could have research articles stating how music can help you do better in math. You could say, ""As this research shows, being in band can help me do better in math. I'll let you have these pages so you can read up on it.""

, If you are trying to get your parents to do something they don't want to do, then hearing why may help you. Your parents may have good points to bring up about the problem. In turn, you may be able to deal with those problems by finding solutions., It's important that you approach your parents politely.Getting angry or upset will not help you convince them of anything. In fact, it makes you seem immature.

Go into his room.,

Hide his stuff.,
Shut off the Internet when he's on it.,
Try to snoop on him.,
Wake him up really early.,
Ease off sometimes.",How to Annoy Your Brother2," Older brothers are going to get pretty defensive about their rooms. If your brother has his own room, just keep going into it without being asked. Ask him a million questions and start messing with his stuff.


Wait until he starts getting up to tell your parents, then leave really quickly and go back to your room. If they ask you about it, say, ""He's making it up.""
Do something weird in his room while he's out, like pull out all his clothes and put them in a pile, or take sticky notes and label everything. Put one on the window that says, ""Window."" Put one on the computer that says, ""Computer."" Find his change jar and label it ""143 cents."" He'll be so confused.
Play innocent. If he tries to beat you up, or chases you out, tell your parents you just tried to ask him a question and he started hitting you.

, Wait until your brother is busy doing something, like playing a complicated game, talking to a girl, or doing his homework. Then, it's time to strike. Make stupid noises with your mouth, or with your armpit, or with your toys. Make a big racket.


Make sure your parents are in another room, so you can stop in enough time before you get into trouble.

, Hide his phone, keys, books for homework, or anything specific that he thinks is really important. Make it really hard to find, putting it in a box in the attic, or somewhere strange out in the garage.


Be careful not to leave incriminating evidence in your room, if you are to do this. Be smart, don't hide stuff under your pillow. If its found, you can always play ignorant and no one will be able to prove it was you.
You can also come clean when your brother is looking. Say, ""Oh, you need your phone? I know where it is. Give me a ride to the comic book store and I'll tell you.""

, Find the Internet router in your house, if you have one, and find the ""reset"" button. When your brother's busy talking to chicks on the Internet, keep hitting the reset so he'll get really annoyed.


If you don't know where the router is, ask your parents to show you, because you're curious. Don't let on that you want to mess with it. Just say, ""How does the Internet work? Can you show me?"" They'll be impressed.

, Older brothers and privacy are made to be separated. If your brother really values his privacy on his computer, phone, and in his room, start trying to invade it as much as possible. Mess with him in little ways that'll drive him nuts.


Try to swipe his phone. Delete contacts on his phone, or change the names of people. Find his best friend and change it to ""Stupid McButtsniffer.""
Try to log into his Facebook and make embarrassing posts, or change his pictures, or comment on other people's stuff with dumb comments.

, If your brother went out really late the night before, wake him up by blasting some loud rock music, like Linkin Park or AC/DC, or starting a battle scene from Lord of the Rings really loud. Do it in his room at 6.00 AM on a Saturday. Instant annoyance.


If he has an alarm, reset it for like two hours earlier than he would normally wake up. Nobody should have to wake up at 4 am. Except your older brother.

, It might not always seem like it, but you're lucky to have a brother, and you'll probably get along a lot better when you're older. Annoying your brother, however annoying he may be to you, can be pretty immature and get you both into trouble. Try to get a long as much as you can.


Instead of annoying an older brother, try to learn as much as you can from him. Older siblings usually know a lot more about their younger siblings. Instead of annoying him, try to understand why he does what he does.

Discuss a possible solution.,
Accept their decision.,
Continue to have discussions.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Do Something2," To come to a solution, you both will probably need to compromise. That is, you parents might need to give a little, and you might need to give a little. If you both give in a little bit, you might find a solution you're both happy with.When you're trying to compromise, you have to figure out what both of you want or need. For instance, your parents are probably most concerned with your safety and well-being. You're probably most concerned with getting what you want, such as a little more independence.
Say you want to spend the night at your friend's house. Your parents may not want you to because they don't know the parents and so, they don't know if you'll be safe. You can come to a compromise where you start out by everyone going out together, so your parents can meet her parents. Then, when you do go over, you can agree to check in with your parents every so often so they know you're okay. That way, you both can feel a little better about what you want.
However, your parents might be unwilling to compromise if they think you won't be safe, so think about that when trying to make a compromise.

, You may not get what you want. Your parents may not be persuaded by your arguments. If that's the case, it's best to accept what they have to say for now. In the future, you may be able to try again. If you whine and complain now, it will make your parents think you're less trustworthy, not more., One way to help your parents understand how you're feeling on the topic is to discuss your feelings and thoughts openly with them. That doesn't mean that you nag them constantly about changing their minds. Rather, you need to have an open dialogue about why you feel the way you do.For instance, if you're trying to get your parents to let you go out more, don't say, ""You're awful. You need to change this decision."" Instead, say things such as, ""I know you want to protect me, but I feel really left out when my friends go out without me. I don't want to go to parties or get drunk. My friends like to go out to coffee or to the movies, and I feel like these activities should be acceptable.""

"
"
Be trustworthy.,
Apologize if you betray your parents' trust.,
Prioritize your wants and needs.,
Choose what to push for.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Do Something3," That is, show up on time and do what you're saying you're going to do. Take up responsibility around the house. It's all these little things that will help you build good will with your parents, so they might be more inclined to say ""yes"" in the future.One way to build trust is to tell your parents the truth. When you don't, your parents may find out, and then they will be less likely to trust you.
Another way to build trust is to do what you say you will. That means you come home on time. You are where you say you're going to be. When you say you'll do your homework, you actually do it. All of these small things add up to building trust.

, Your parents will let you know if you've betrayed their trust. Generally, it means that you've done something wrong in a situation where they believed you would act as you said you would without them checking up on you. For instance, if they trust you to go to your friend's house and instead, you've gone to a party, that's a betrayal o trust.When you realize you've screwed up, say ""I'm very sorry that I've betrayed your trust. I know that it's worse than just breaking a rule because you've given me extra leeway. How can I begin to make it up to you?""

, Your needs are what you have to have to live, which includes things like shelter, clothing, and food. It also includes things basic to your happiness, such as the support of your family and friends. Wants are what goes on top of that. Wants may include that new jacket you've been eyeing or going out with your friends on the weekends, when you often see them during the week.Just because something is a want or desire doesn't mean you shouldn't have it. However, you need to think about what you find most important in your wants. Maybe going out with a friend one weekend is more important to you than going to a dance the next. By figuring out what you want most, you're in a better position to talk to your parents.
When trying to decide what's most important, think about what would make you saddest to miss or not to have. That's what's most important to you.

, Just like your parents have to pick their battles when it comes to what you do, you need to decide what you're going to try to persuade your parents to give you. That is, if you push your parents on everything, your parents are more likely to push back and tell you ""no."" Try to pick just one or a couple of things that you really want, and then when you go to your parents with a request, you won't have already asked for ten things this week. It will help your parents know that you really do feel this subject or request is important.For instance, you could say, ""I've been thinking hard about what's most important to me. While I understand that you don't want me going over to my friend's house, could we possibly go out to coffee? You can drop me off there if that makes you feel better about the situation.""

Enjoy your new-found Internet anonymity!

",How to Hide Your Online Activities from Parents," Learn how to delete your browser history without arousing suspicion. All you need to do is delete it, then open a few inconspicuous yet connected webpages that can explain the two hours you spent on the laptop last night in your room. As mentioned above, make sure they're connected; for example, you wouldn't see 'how to bathe a cat - Google search', then the next page visited being the The Big Bang Theory website. Also, make the pages relevant to you; don't search for something your parents know you don't have an interest in.;
, Most browsers that are updated to the latest version will have private browsers that don't track anything you browse on the Internet. This can be useful if your parents check your history daily to see what sites you go on.

Do note that if your parents get in touch with the internet service provider, they can still find out the sites you visit.

, To tab switch, open a page your parents allow you to use an keep that page open. In another tab, open a site you want to use. When a parent approaches you while using the site you want to use, switch to the site they will let you use. When you`re finished, clear the history that leads to that site.

When you tab switch, do it calmly and normally to avoid unsuspected suspicion from your parents for switching tabs too quickly when they enter the room.

, Get your Twitter or Tumblr account, by creating a new email address only you have access to. Don't make your username '@charlie_simms' if your name is Charlie Simms; instead, use something relevant to you yet not including your name. For example, if you were a fan of The Big Bang Theory, your username could be something like 'sheldon_cooper_hugz'. Never post your username on your Facebook page, as your friend's parents may see it and decide to check it out, only to find smutty fanfiction and some very disturbing Shenny or Shamy pictures. If you're going to be using a parent's phone to access your secret account, be sure to log it off properly after. You don't want them coming across your fanfictions that you've written, do you?

, If you have a family computer, make yourself a password-protected user account of your own. It'll be easier to use your desired site without people seeing. Also, if you happen to come across something bad, like a fanfiction, make sure it doesn't affect you. You could read a gay fanfiction about two characters from a movie, only to find out the next day your parents are taking you to see it in the cinema. You don't want to be sat there for two hours either with a smirk or a horrified expression. This will trigger responses and questions that can be sometimes very different to answer logically.

, Obviously, there's no point having your 1,000 Twitter followers or 3,000 reblogs on Tumblr if you're not going to do anything with them. However, it's important not to let yourself spend an excessive amount of time on the computer, or else your parents may begin to be a little concerned and ask to see your history. If you can't show them what you've 'done' on the computer in the past few days, they're obviously going to get suspicious.

, If anything comes up even remotely related to you, find the account it's on and delete it. If you've posted...disturbing...fanart, and it appears on a Google Search result, delete it and move it to another account. Googling your name can be the easiest way for parents to really discover what you're doing online. If it's happened to a friend of yours, you will see and understand how embarrassing it is.

, Parents will twig something's up if you start behaving differently. If you want to change your image, sit down with them and talk about it.

, Don't act secretive about it.

, That's the general rule. You can post Photoshops of celebrities and the like, but if it's your life, then they may object to that not to mention total strangers finding out what goes on in your day-to-day activities.

, That's what's recommended. If a family member approaches you and says they found your Twitter account, be honest and admit it. If it's completely anonymous, and there's no way you could identify who runs the account/blog, you could always vehemently deny it on the grounds they have no proof. At worst, you could say it's a friend's account and they asked you to look at something on there; don't tell them the friend's name if they ask.

If your income fluctuates slightly, figure out a monthly average by looking at the past six months of your pay. If your income fluctuates wildly every month, moving out might not be the best option.


If you need to figure out an average of your monthly income, add up the past six months of your income, then divide by 6. This is your average income.
If you haven’t had a job for more than 6 months or if you have a temporary job, wait for a more stable time to move out.;
, Multiply your monthly income by .28 to find the largest sum of rent you can afford.Keep this number handy, and use it to find affordable housing.

, These expenses include: rent, monthly loans, car insurance and car loans, credit card(s), health insurance (if it isn’t deducted from your salary), phone, internet, utilities, cable, and any other sort of debt. You will also want to figure out how much you spend per month on food, entertainment, clothes, gas, and miscellaneous shopping.


Some expenses are only semi-annual, such as car registration; don’t forget about these.
Don’t underestimate the amount you spend on food and entertainment. You want to preserve your lifestyle when moving out.

, You might discover additional fees when you relocate, such as:


Pet and rent deposits (these vary depending on your lease)
Utility deposits for power, heat, cable/internet
Hiring a moving team
Buying a parking permit
Buying essential items like a television or couch

, If you live as close to school or work as you can, the cost of parking, gas, and insurance will also change. It is smart to research these trade-offs early, as they will help plan your budget.

, Add up all of your monthly costs. This should be 10% less than your income to account for emergency expenses.For example, if you make $2,000 a month, only plan to spend $1,800. Now, decide if you can survive month-to-month on your own. If you can, add up all your moving costs, and see if you have enough money saved to afford them.


It may be months or years before you can save up money to afford moving costs.
Be patient; moving out before you are financially ready can lead to a lifetime of debt.
Don’t feel alone if you can’t afford living on your own: around 31% of 18-34 year olds cannot afford to move out of their parents’ homes., You aren’t completely hopeless if you can’t afford to live on your own. Now more than ever, people are living with roommates to afford rent.Consider this option carefully, however; trying to find a roommate will split the cost of rent and utilities in half, but it can add a lot of stress as well. Consider a few key issues before searching for a roommate:


Would you be comfortable sharing a room or an apartment?Are you expecting your roommate to be your best friend?
Do you feel comfortable having someone around your personal belongings?
How clean are you? Are you loud? How clean and loud would you want your roommate to be?

, Sharing a room with a brother, sister, or cousin is great training for life with a roommate. If you are close with one of your siblings, you may want to move out together. Make sure you trust one another to pay the bills on time.

, There are many ways to find roommates, whether it is through mutual friends or social media sites, but once you found someone who wants to live in the same area as you and is financially stable, talk to them in person. Some questions you should ask are:


How clean are you?When do you go to bed, and how often do you have company?
Do you have any pets, and will a significant other be living with you?
Can you pay all bills on time?
See if these questions influence your decision to live with the potential roommate. Your lifestyles should be mostly similar.

, Conflict is bound to happen when living with others. What matters is how you deal with it. Pretending to not be bothered by your roommate’s behavior will lead to frustration, but constant bickering is stressful. If you need to confront your roommate, choose your words carefully so your roommate does not feel attacked.


“I feel frustrated when you don’t wash the dishes because the room smells” is better than “You’re a slob.”
Focus on the behavior, not the person.
Confront problems as they arise, not when you are frustrated and overwhelmed.
If your roommate confronts you, remember that they are trying to improve your relationship. Listen and reflect on what your roommate tells you.

, Sometimes parents prefer their kids to be gone by the age of 18. However, there are times when it might be in your best interest, and theirs, to stay at home longer. Living at home a few extra years is a great way to save money, go to college, and build up work experience.


Start a conversation with your parents. Pick a time when none of you are busy, then ask, “How would you feel if I moved out?”
If your parents completely support you now, find out how much help they will give if you move out. This could change your budget.
If you parents are sad or upset that you want to move out, that is normal. Reassure them you will visit and keep in touch., If you are nervous about moving out, say so. Honesty about your concerns is important. Your family can offer encouragement and advice that mentally and emotionally prepares your for life outside the nest.

, Some families have a rich uncle, and other families have vacation homes. Ask your family for financial help if and when you need it. First-time renters may also need an adult with good credit to co-sign a lease with them. Be gracious for any help your family offers.

, Sometimes, parents cook for, clean up after, and dote on their children. If you enjoy living at home and don’t need to move for school or work, consider staying at home. However, if you dread going home, get into fights with your parents, or will be going to a school far away, moving out is the best option.Reflect on your feelings.

, Remember, your rent should be no more than 28% of your monthly income. Try to rent in safer neighborhoods, and use the internet, newspaper, or word-of-mouth to find a place that fits your budget. Consider parking, amenities, and distance from work and school when searching for a new home.

, The list of essential items you need to live on your own can be more extensive than you thought. Items such as towels, toilet paper, laundry detergent, and toothpaste will impact how comfortably you live.A beginner’s list of items you need may include:


Bathroom supplies: toothpaste, bath towels, a bathmat and shower curtain (optional), toilet bowl and shower cleaner, plunger, and toilet brush.
Kitchen supplies: food, dish soap and sponges, cups, plates, silverware, pots and pans, cooking utensils, kitchen appliances, paper towels, spray cleaner.
Miscellaneous household items: a vacuum, trash can and bags, couch and bed, linens, broom and dustpan, first aid kit, duct tape, a computer, and a television.

, Make certain that you set aside money each month for your expenses, and use a calendar to keep track of when bills are due. Any money you have left over can go into a savings account, or you can spend it, but only after bills are paid.

, Let people know at least a couple of weeks in advance when you are moving to see if they are available to help. Having 2-3 helpers can greatly speed up the moving process, especially if you have furniture and a lot of boxes.

,, When you power it on, turn off all the speakers (or immediately plug in headphones) and avoid watching videos. The sound may awaken your parents and will result in you getting caught.

, Don't close your parent's one as they may hear it or notice the next day.

,,, You could;


Go to the bathroom as normal as possible, after you flush, take off running to your room. Your parents might wake up but will just assume that you went back to bed.






You can also just sneak back. This is harder than it sounds. The noises you make in the middle of the night can seem a lot louder than in the day. Before you go to bed, test to see where the creaks are on your floor (if you have any), a loud creak might just give you away so it helps to be prepared and know where the floor creaks.







,, Put your blanket slightly over the lid and dim the display so there's less light.

Have a cover story.",How to Hide Things from Parents," Places like your underwear drawer, under the mattress, or at the top of your closet are obvious hiding locations for things. Your parents probably tried these areas when they were younger! Use strange or more complicated hiding areas for greater success.


Try hiding something in a sibling’s room. Those obvious locations become a little less obvious if they are looking for something specific to you. Note that this does not work if your parents do regular sweeps of the house for secrets.
Tape things to the underside of your dresser or inside the top of the drawers. This keeps items from being discovered by a quick look under the dresser. Another idea is if you have an old school backpack or an old bag, then you can hide things there, your parents won't suspect anything!;
, Wrap your item in tissues or put it in a plastic bag (or both!) and hide it in the basement under some old clothes. Camouflage the item so that it looks like it “belongs” wherever you hide it.


Make sure to use things your parents are guaranteed not to use, move or throw away.
Storing the item in a plastic bag or wrapping it in saran wrap can open up a few additional hiding opportunities. The bottom of a potted plant will go unchecked for months, and a proper liner can protect your items from water damage. , There are loads of weird and wonderful ways of making one, and they are often easy to make. Grab old appliances, bottles, jars or other items that aren’t in heavy use anymore and see if they can support a few small items. This is especially useful if your household doesn’t use certain items such as television remotes or products that aren’t often kept in the storage container they come with.


Pull off the plastic head of a spray deodorant can and remove the cover to where the deodorant is stored (this comes off easily with the help of some basic tools). Put the plastic head back on (use this as a lid).
Old bottles or food containers make for good hiding places and can easily blend in with your room. Combine with a good liner and store in the freezer for greater camouflage. Note that what you can use as a stash container depends on what you are trying to hide. Some items will not fit in a bottle or deodorant can.

, If what you are hiding is small enough, just leave it in your pocket or wallet. Remember to take it out of your pockets when you or your parents do laundry.


You can be more inventive with carrying items. If you wear the same coat every day, make hidden pockets like up the sleeves or on the inside of your collar. You can make pockets by sewing/gluing/taping a flap where you want the pocket.
Tape things to the inside of your shoes. This works well at the end of pointy shoes, just past where your toes reach.
Flat items such as notes or money can be hidden underneath the insole of the shoe.
Some shoes come with tiny compartments for storing things, such as on the back of the heel or on the tongue. , Televisions, video game consoles and DVD players have flaps that open or other compartments that you can use to hide things away. Just make sure these aren't used or known by your parents.


These cavities occasionally house important parts of the appliance, such as an Ethernet plug or soft reset switch. Make sure the inserting something into the cavity will not damage the appliance.

, The attic is used for long term storage and is a place that few people go on a regular basis. Hide the item somewhere easy for you to access, but out of plain view in case someone needs to move something to or from the attic. Valuable items are found in attics all the time, and there’s a reason for that – people rarely have reason to enter the attic! Put the item in a garbage bag and cover it with old clothes you no longer want to better camouflage the item.
Labeling the bag can help add to the disguise. For example, writing ""Christmas decorations"" on the bag will prevent the bag from being examined until the appropriate time of the year.

, Hide something at a friend’s house if they have more space to spare, or there is no danger of getting them in trouble for doing so. For example, if your parents frown on junk food or soda, a friend’s place makes the perfect stash spot.


Make sure your stuff gets hidden properly or marked appropriately as yours. You don’t want someone to take your stuff.

, Your parents might not approve of this idea, especially if the safe is in plain sight. You can store the safe in the attic or somewhere else hidden to keep your parents from being suspicious.


A mini fridge for your room might can serve the same purpose as a safe and will look much less out of place if you keep it in plain sight. Look for a mini fridge that comes with a locking mechanism to keep just anyone from checking out your fridge.
Safes and mini fridges can also be camouflaged. Tape some cardboard around the safe to create the illusion that the safe is simply a storage box full of your things. , This is a fun way to hide things that is particularly effective if you do a lot of reading. Make sure it's a book that fits your reading habits.


Keep an actual copy of the book you hollowed out in case your parents or siblings ever want to actually borrow that book.
This same technique works with items such as old VHS tapes or DVD cases. Throw them in a box of old tapes or other junk to complete the look.
Several websites offer services for hollowing out books, and can cut the storage area out to your specifications. , Hiding items outside gives you a much larger area to work with when hiding items and makes tracing items back to you more difficult. Take care when hiding items outside that someone else doesn’t find and take the item – your parents aren’t the only ones to worry about if you choose this route.


Make sure you put them somewhere very well hidden so nobody will find them. The woods are a great place with plenty of nooks and crannies to hide things. Try hiding a few green carrier bags in a thick prickly bush, but make sure they are out of sight.
The shed or garage is a good place to hide larger items. These areas are mostly used for storing items that are used only occasionally, such as the lawnmower or power tools. Make sure to properly mask the item you are hiding by placing it in a bag or other container first.
Dig a hole and hide something there. Make sure the item is properly protected to avoid damage from the elements. Avoid digging in a spot that might give away your handiwork. For example, digging a hole in a grassy patch will leave a telltale bald area of fresh dirt.
Large partitions under the house or patio also allow for storage without drawing much suspicion. If items such as the lawnmower are also stored there, be ready to move your stash when it comes time to mow the lawn. , Web browsers will record a history of sites visited by default. Your parents can check the history window to see all sites that were visited during a certain time period. Go into the settings of your web browser to delete the history. You can delete individual websites or clear the entire browsing history if preferred.


In Google Chrome, go to Settings, followed by the History tab to access History settings. You can also navigate Privacy settings here. In Microsoft Edge, go to Settings and click on “Choose what to clear.” You can choose from several different types of files to clear, including browsing and download history. While it’s possible to keep browsers from tracking history altogether, your parents will likely notice this setting when they attempt to access their own history. If the browser supports multiple users, make sure that settings are unique to each user. Otherwise, it’s best to delete only particular pieces of browsing history.

, Move files you are trying to hide, such as chat logs or passwords, into folders that require passwords to access. Remove the files from plain sight – the idea is to make finding the files as difficult and oblique as possible.


Rename the file into something innocuous that doesn’t give away the purpose of the file. “Passwords.txt” is a bad choice!
Files can also be hidden in file folders for existing programs that otherwise have nothing to do with your chat logs or passwords, such as the data folder of a game application.
Files can be made invisible with the “hidden” property on Windows OS. You can find this option under the Attributes field in file Properties. Hiding files in a similar fashion on Mac OX is a bit more complicated – it may be easier to physically hide the file in this case. Cloud services such as DropBox or OneDrive can store your files while also requiring additional login steps to help reinforce your security.

, Give your phone a password to prevent your parents from having access to your texts and phone call history. If you have to leave your phone laying around to take care of a quick errand, make sure to put the phone to sleep in order to enable the lock. It’s a good idea to keep your phone on your person at most times.


Use a unique password this is difficult or impossible to guess.
Use a combination of letters, number and special characters when possible.Consider fingerprint unlocking if your phone supports the feature. This provides an extra layer of security to your phone.
For additional security, apps such as Snapchat can help you delete texts and photos automatically if you don’t want them to be discovered.

, Facebook, Instagram and other social media sites you use should be kept private. This will keep your parents (or others) from finding your account and freely viewing your messages and photos. You’ll have to add them to your network for them to see your activity.


Make a second, family friendly account if you are concerned about your family seeing certain activities, but don’t want to shut them out of your social accounts completely.
Adjust your sharing settings. Facebook offers selective sharing options that can help filter out who gets particular access to your photos and posts. , If your items or chat log does get find out, be ready with a believable excuse. Parents aren’t necessarily prone to believing such stories, but depending on the item and the nature of your friends, you might be able to create a convincing argument. Just don’t throw your friend under the bus!


A few examples include, ""I'm keeping that for a friend,” or “A friend grabbed my phone and took these pictures.”
Use a friend that your parents don’t know in your cover story. You don’t want your parents to give your friend’s parents a call and blow your cover.

Limit your contact with the narcissistic parent.,
Avoid badmouthing the other parent to the children.,
Provide consistent structure when you can.,
Model healthy communication.,
Refrain from shielding your child from the narcissist.",How to Help Your Child when the Other Parent Is a Narcissist1," If you and the narcissist have split up, your best option is to minimize your communication with your child’s parent. Narcissists are generally high-conflict people. To prevent exposing your child to a battle they can’t understand, limit interactions between you and the other parent as much as possible.


Speak to the narcissist only when absolutely necessary and keep the subject of your communications strictly related to parenting.;
, While dating or being married to a narcissist results in psychological damage, it’s not your place to enlighten your child about their parent’s negative traits. As hard as it may be, try your best to speak highly (or not at all) about the other parent to your child.This goes beyond direct communication to family, friends, and the larger community. Avoid talking negatively about the other parent to loved ones or acquaintances who might inadvertently spread the message back to your child. Only discuss the woes of your relationship with your most trusted friends and family—far away from the listening ears of your child.

, Narcissists may use their offspring simply for the purposes of boosting their own egos, which often breeds perfectionism and people-pleasing habits in children. To counteract some of the emotional damage inflicted on your child by the narcissist, implement strong boundaries and consistent structure when they are in your care.


Set firm guidelines about the behavior you expect in your home, and discipline or reward accordingly. If you say you will do something, follow through.
Help them learn a sense of responsibility in terms of their conduct, academics, chores, etc.
Teach them to share, take turns, and cope with unexpected change so that they understand the world does not revolve around them. This is especially important if your child spends a lot of time around the narcissistic parent.
Reinforce positive rules and values so that they develop into stable, law-abiding citizens in society., Children of narcissists are subjected to guilt-tripping, bribery, and emotional manipulation of the highest degree. Do your best to serve as a positive role model for communication.Practice active listening by letting them finish talking before sharing a response. Make eye contact. Talk to your child at an age-appropriate level.
Avoid labels like “bad” or “disrespectful.” Instead speak in terms of feelings like, “I feel disappointed because you didn’t turn in your school project.” Avoid criticizing your child. Instead, explain your views and actions to them rationally.
Be clear and direct with your child rather than hiding behind an agenda or manipulating them. As much as possible, answer your child’s questions honestly.

, Emotional abuse is the narcissist’s weapon of choice. Unless you are vying for full custody with no parental visits, it may be impossible to fully protect your child from their parent’s emotional games. It may not be a good idea to try to ""protect"" your child anyway. Doing so shields them from learning how to effectively interact with the narcissist.Instead of trying to protect your child from their emotions, simply strive to counteract any damage with structure, boundaries, and unconditional love. However, you do want to ensure that your child is not in any danger while under the supervision of the narcissist.
Signs of child abuse or neglect may include:Having unexplained injuries or bruises
Wearing inappropriate clothing to cover up bruises
Shying away from the abuser’s touch; flinching after sudden movements
Being on alert
Having poor hygiene
Lacking any sort of bond with abuser
Missing school or important engagements

Encourage individuality.,
Show consistent love to foster positive self-esteem.,
Offer opportunities to build self-confidence.,
Help them see mistakes as learning opportunities.,
Surround the child with other healthy adult confidants.",How to Help Your Child when the Other Parent Is a Narcissist2," Children of narcissists have the tendency to develop intense people-pleasing habits as a result of being idolized when they act according to the narcissist’s wishes and belittled when they don’t. The narcissistic parent basically erases the child’s sense of self.To counteract this unhealthy habit, help your child acknowledge their individual strengths and talents.


All children tend to follow the styles or mannerisms of their peers. This can be healthy in terms of finding out their likes and dislikes.
However, give your child permission to explore their own ways of acting or thinking by letting them choose hobbies and clothes that suit their interests. Let them know that it’s okay to be different., Narcissists often parent with conditional love, subjecting their children to rigid standards that determine whether they receive appreciation or affection.What’s more, the narcissist may be so focused on themselves, they may not provide the ingredients needed to build a healthy self-esteem in their children.Ensure that your child receives positive praise and affection that is not dependent on behavior or accomplishments. Tell your child “You’re so smart” or “You’re such a good friend” to remind them of their good traits.
Be sure to offer genuine praise when they do something good. This can help to counteract the negative influence they may be getting from the narcissistic parent.
Furthermore, tailor language so that children don’t think they’re better than others. Say, “You’re special to me” rather than “You’re the most special girl in the world.”

, When your child learns new things, they expand their skillsets and boost confidence. This can thwart poor self-esteem that may develop from a narcissistic parent telling them they aren’t worthy unless they do this or that.


Sign your child up for an interesting club or organization. Encourage them to try out a new sport or creative pursuit. Learn a new language or skill together to further develop your bond., Narcissists attach their sense of self on being admired, accomplished, and acquainted with powerful people. By proxy, your child may develop a perfectionistic viewpoint of themselves and the world.


Mistakes and failure offer chances to improve and grow. Help your child prevent or overcome perfectionism by challenging them to fail bigger. Make it a game for them to try activities that don’t come easy for them. Have them come to you and tell you how they failed. Applaud their failure as a chance to grow.
Let your child know that many successful people failed along their way to success, like Oprah who was fired from her first job as a TV anchor.On the other hand, applaud their successes, but don’t exaggerate them. Focusing too much on success places pressure on children, which makes them less likely to step out of their comfort zones in the future., Your child may feel a clear deficit in their emotional connection with the narcissistic parent. Being a positive role model yourself can offset this. However, it can be beneficial to expose your child to other positive adults who can offer support, encouragement, and a listening ear.Reach out to adults in your community who your child can forge relationships with, such as teachers, religious or spiritual advisors, coaches, school counselors, relatives or family friends. Tell your child, “I want to make sure you know that someone is always there for you. If you don’t feel comfortable coming to me with an issue, I hope you know your aunt/teacher/coach is willing to listen.”

Aid your child in developing empathy.,
Emphasize the importance of genuine friendship.,
Take incidents of manipulation or exploitation seriously.,
Consult with a counselor.",How to Help Your Child when the Other Parent Is a Narcissist3," One of the most identifiable traits of the narcissist is a lack of empathy.Of course, children and teens are naturally self-centered. In order to prevent these normal behaviors from developing into pathological narcissism, you’ll want to boost their ability to relate to others.


No matter how old your child is, help them build an ability to consider other’s emotions. Empathy is grounded in being able to step in someone else’s shoes.
While watching TV or reading books, ask your child, “How do you think this character feels?” to get them thinking.If your child tells you about a friend at school who was bullied, ask them to name some feelings the child might experience (e.g. sadness, embarrassment, rejection, etc.).

, A narcissistic parent rarely has true friendships. Friends and acquaintances may be purely a means to an end. Your child may pick up on this unhealthy relational pattern and exploit their own peers.


To prevent this, encourage your child to make friends from diverse backgrounds that don’t revolve around status. This helps them to recognize they are worthy not because of who they know, but because of who they are.
In addition, emphasize the significance of keeping confidences, demonstrating loyalty, sharing, and resolving conflict., All children test the limits or behave inappropriately at times. However, you can set the bar for building positive relationships and empathy by not overlooking negative behaviors.


Let’s say, your child manipulates a friend by saying, “If you don’t let me play with your doll, I won’t be your friend anymore.” Pull them aside and suggest that they step into the other person’s shoes. How would they feel if the friend did this to them? Is it fair to hold friendship over their heads? Is there another way to ask to play with the doll without being manipulative?
Counteract manipulation by encouraging kindness. Ask your child each day what they did nice for others. Get your child to do anonymous acts of kindness in which they don’t receive any recognition for doing good.You can also encourage your child to volunteer to help build their empathy for other people.

, Unfortunately, children of narcissists are at risk of developing this personality trait, too. If your adolescent child uses or exploits others, lacks empathy, or bullies, you may need to seek professional help before these traits get out of hand.A professional mental health therapist can work with your child to address the root causes of narcissism and build healthier relational behaviors. Talk to your pediatrician, family doctor, or school counselor for a referral.

Consider the reasonability of your request.,
Map out how you are going to say your request.,
Plan your ""refusal response method"".,
Reconsider your request plan.",How to Get Your Way with Your Parents1," Is the fulfillment of your request harmless? Are your parents able to provide what you want to you? Have you done some good deeds to deserve what you want? If so, the request you are about to make is most likely reasonable. If not, your request is rather boisterous. Think about it carefully. Once you have decided that your request is reasonable, please go to the next step.;
, Remember that an authoritatively gentle, firm but respectful voice is more likely to bring you what you want than an overly demanding, unkind threat. Say something like, ""Mom/Dad, considering how obedient and dutiful I have been to you and my father lately, I believe that I deserve a reward for it. I would like to respectfully request a (insert your desire here). Do you agree?"" Be mature and respectful. Do not be demanding of your parents, and remember that respect is more effective than a threat.


Never say something like, ""I want a phone, and if you don't give me one I will no longer respect you."" This is a threat, and threats are ineffective and disrespectful. You will not get what you want simply by uttering a threat.
It is acceptable to plan out your request beforehand: Be obedient and respectful to your parents and elders for a week, and then make your request, or do a few extra chores for three to seven days and say your request then. This is often way more effective.

, Always plan a refusal response. If your parents say no, you want to know how to respond politely but firmly against their refusal. Have at least three good reasons ready to say. For example, you deserve a dog because you did most of your brother's chores for three weeks, kept your room exceptionally clean for nine days and obeyed and respected your parents and teachers completely for half a month. These are good reasons. To say you deserve a dog simply because you took out the garbage for your mother two times last week is not powerful enough. The better the reward you want, the more powerful your persuasions have to be.


Having a refusal response plan is very important. Never set out to request something without a plan like this.
Plan out also the tone of voice in which you are going to carry out your request. You may want to rehearse it in your household washroom in front of the mirror if you feel that you need it.

, See if any parts of it are lacking. Can your parents poke any counterarguments through your request? For example, did you obey and respect your parents but complain everyday for having to do it? If so, find a different reason. Your former one is not powerful enough.


Also think about your parents' style of parenting. Are they a permissive, neglecting, authoritative or authoritarian parent? Are they hot-tempered or tranquil? Are they reasonable or boisterous? Think about it--it will help you.

Consider the size of the item.,
Search their bedroom.,
Look in cluttered rooms.,
Search your own room.,
Scour the garage.",How to Find Something Your Parents Have Hidden1," If your parents have hidden something big, then it will be hidden in a very different place than something small, like your favorite DVD. Think about where something fits and is concealed best.


Very small items like DVDs can be hidden in very tight places. Look between books, inside bags, under lightweight items.
If you're looking for something like a bicycle, avoid rooms where it obviously won't fit without being noticeable, like the bathroom.;
, The parents' bedroom is normally off-limits, so it’s the most obvious place to hide something. Think about whichever place is the most private, the location you’d get in the most trouble for investigating.


Check their drawers. Sock and underwear drawers are definitely off limits, and a bit odd to sift through. This is a very natural hiding spot.
Look in their closet. The space in the closet allows for a lot of hiding spots. Make sure you check the shelves, between folded clothes, and in any messy looking location.
Crawl under the bed. For some reason, people think under the bed is a good hiding spot. For adults it’s a more difficult location to see because it requires getting on the floor.
Take a peek behind the TV. The spot behind the TV is often dusty because the TV is heavy and hard to move. This is a natural hiding spot because people don’t see the spot often.
Spot-check their bathroom. There aren’t a lot of great hiding spots in your parent’s bathroom, so look in a few obvious locations.

, The more items in a room, the easier it is to camouflage something. Colors, shapes, and patterns blend into a background when there are multiple items in the way. Additionally, the more items that need to be moved, the less likely someone is to go through the effort of searching.


The pantry is a perfect hiding spot. Lots of heavy cans, cookbooks, and assorted odds-and-ends obstruct the view. Moving a bunch of food all around makes it harder to find.
Check the linen closet. If you don't change your own sheets or towels, the linen closet could be your jackpot. This is a great hiding spot for thin items like DVDs, books, and games.
If your parents have a home office, there is a good chance a bunch of stuff is in there. Papers litter the desk, multiple drawers too. Sift between every item and leave no page unturned.

, Yes, search your room. Hiding something where you’d least expect it – like your drawer full of dress socks – is actually a pretty creative idea. More than likely, they'll hide it where you don't look. If they are always harping on you about cleaning your room, it’s very possible they just hid your item within your mess.


Check your closet. If you rarely look at the top of the closet, that could be a good location.
Most people rarely look behind dressers or cabinets. If you're searching for something thin, try taking a peek behind either location.

, The garage is full of nearly unlimited hiding potential. Check behind or inside trash cans, recycle bins, and paint cans. Other cases, like those for power drills, usually have a few small spots to hide things as well.


The garage opener shroud is an easily removable casing.Look in large containers that appear to be old junk. A foot-locker or plastic tub is a seldom touched place that's perfect for hiding.

Ask them why they don't allow this.,
Be on your best behavior.,
Make a list of reasons why you should be able to do this.,
Have friends walk with you to the bus stop.,
Call, text, or email them once you are on the bus.,
Create a time schedule for when you should be getting on/off the bus, and when you should arrive home.",How to Get Your Parents to Allow You to Take a Bus by Yourself," You should first understand their opinions on this rule. You might be too young, or they don't think you are ready for this yet. Parents want to keep their kids safe always, and they most likely do not want you to get hurt.;
, If their answer is ""You aren't mature enough"", then this is one of your best opportunities. You can do things without being asked to, help them out with things, and take things under your own wing. If they complain that your grade in math class is too low, maybe you could go to the teacher and see what you can do to get your grade up.

, You could say things like ""I will still follow your rules"", and give your own reasons why you should be able to ride the bus by yourself.

, If they are concerned about something happening to you on the way home, your friends can help with that. Power in numbers is a big deal. Maybe walk with two or three other friends so they know that you get there safely. People are less likely to hurt someone if they are with other people. Never go anywhere alone!

, This is one of the easiest ways for them to know where you are.

, If you follow the schedule, they should start letting loose on protecting you. This should create more trust between you and your parents or guardian.

Try to figure out why your parents don't want you to get contacts.,
If you can convince just one parent, do that instead.,
Save up your own money.,
Stretch the truth about your age.,
Do some research.,
Schedule your appointment accordingly.,
Don't get 'over-sold'.,
Take good care of your lenses so you have no problems.,
Hide your contacts somewhere even the nosiest of parents would not find them.

",How to Get Contact Lenses Behind Your Parents' Back if They Won't Let You Have Them," One parent may have had a problem with contacts in the past. Maybe they don't want you to worry about your looks just yet. It might even be for religious reasons (some religions prohibit contact lenses except for medical necessity, believe it or not) Maybe they're not sure you're responsible enough.

You should not even consider doing this under most circumstances, because the consequences can be pretty bad if you are caught (though not as bad as coming home with a tattoo or piercing). If their reason is something you can talk your way around, it's best to convince them to let you get the contacts. (Plus, you won't have to use your own money.)
The only reason one would ever reasonably consider going to these measures are if they have the kind of parents who refuse to give reasons for their decisions and resent being questioned.



 

;
, You only need one parental consent signature. This works well if your parents are divorced and/or separated.

, You will not be able to use your parents' money if you go behind their back.

, If you're at least 15, you can almost certainly pass for 18 in most cases. Just add a couple of years to your birthdate (i.e. if you were born in 1992 tell the optician you were born in 1989 or 1990, etc.) Opticians virtually NEVER check ID. Contact lenses aren't like getting a tattoo or piercing. But don't make a big deal about your ""age"". Don't get into an explanation such as ""people think I'm younger, but I'm 18."" If an optician asks for ID, simply state that you forgot it. If they refuse to examine you, leave quietly and go somewhere else.

, Find opticians in your area. Or better yet, if you have the means to go somewhere out of your immediate area, do so. Visit one in person, other than where you go to get your glasses, and make an appointment. If they ask if you are at least 18, simply say ""yes."" Don't go into a story about how people frequently think you're younger. This will draw attention to yourself. If they ask for ID, show them your fake ID. It is virtually unheard of for opticians to validate IDs. If they even ask, and you have one, that is almost always good enough (especially out of state).

, Don't schedule your contact lens exam during school hours (don't tell the optician about school, though), and make sure you're scheduled for a day and time when your parents will be away from the house for a while. School holidays are great, because workplaces don't get as many days off as schools do. The best time to do this, however, is in the summer when school is out.

, When you see the eye doctor for your exam, beware that they will try to sell you the most expensive contact lenses they can (or whatever generates the best profit margin for them). Push to get a prescription for Acuvue 2 or a good two-week or monthly lens. They are the best value and as long as you take care of them, should be just fine. (Dailies are highway robbery in most cases)

, As long as you use them exactly as directed, it is very unlikely you will have problems. If you get an eye infection, you're probably busted.

Find an appropriate time to make your request.,
Approach your parents respectfully.,
Say your request the way you rehearsed or planned it.,
Remain calm and collected.,
Ask your parents to think it over alone before responding.",How to Get Your Way with Your Parents2," In the morning of a weekday is a terrible time; your parents are trying to get out of the house for work as efficiently as possible, so do not even bother requesting your desire before them; you will get a ""no"" regardless of the level of reasonability of your request. At the table when you are having dinner is a wonderful idea. Be calculating about this; the time in which you make your request is going to significantly affect the answer you receive and the power of your persuasion if you get a refusal.

, Running over to them shouting, ""Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad!"" is a disrespectful way to approach your parents. Walking to them and reverently saying, ""Honorable Mom and Dad, do you mind sitting down with me and talking to me? I would like to make a reasonable and respectful question"" is a completely filial way to do it. Try it!

, Do not change any parts of it yet. It is important to stick to your plans. If you change anything in a well-evaluated plan, it will likely affect your persuasion and reasoning negatively. So if you planned to request the purchasing of a pizza because you did your chores without more than one reminder last week, say so, even if you feel embarrassed about any part of it. You will likely eliminate your humiliation quickly.

, Always maintain a calm, serene temperament in such situations and situations that are similar to this one. Never make your request in a manner that tells your parents you are incapable of handling its fulfillment. And remember that your parents are not you, so they may think of the issue differently. Respect, but don't give in to, their refusals.


Do not say all your reasons immediately. If you do, you will not have much time to think of other reasons than your planned ones if your parents happen to have reasonable counterarguments for each of them. Say them politely one by one and remember that if your parents can counter all your arguments, they probably have a strong argument, too.
Be courteous and tranquil. Smile slightly when you are making your request. Always be polite, or your rudeness will deliberately take virtue from your argument.

, You may end your request with, ""Virtuous parents, I respectfully suggest that you discuss my humble request privately before responding with 'Yes' or 'No'. I will respect a refusal, but shall not give in to it.""


Do not nag your parents for an answer; go to your room and do something you like to do. Wait approximately twenty minutes before going and asking your parents politely if they have a response.
If your parents are still hesitant after twenty minutes and say that they aren't yet ready to supply an answer, apologize sincerely for disturbing them, bow deeply, and go away. Do not disturb them again. Leave them for approximately an hour before inquiring again.

"
"
Politely approach your parents.,
Listen patiently.,
Say your reasons eloquently.,
Continue.",How to Get Your Way with Your Parents3," Ask them if they are ready to supply a response yet, and if they are, smile and thank them for considering your request. Ask them to sit down somewhere and bring them each a glass of water smilingly. Then, ask them to give you their answer.

, When your parents are speaking, even if you get an immediate ""no"", do not respond at once. Let your parents finish and nod along the way to show that you are listening attentively. When they are done, say to them, ""Thank you for supplying your answer with eloquence and clarity.""


Even if your parents' answer wasn't eloquent or clear, thank them in this way, and be sincere. It is worth telling a partial lie if it will please your parents, benefit your argument and convince them that you are not a thankless or spoiled son/daughter.

, This is only necessary if your parents said no. If they said yes, embrace each of them and thank them calmly, not ecstatically. If they refused, however, say one of your reasons with tranquility and clarity. Smile and ask them politely if they have any counterarguments against your reason. If they do, use another reason to cover the hole and ask for further objections. Keep saying reasons one by one, not all at once.


It is important to ask your parents if they have counterarguments after you have said each reason for your desire. This will tell your parents that you respect their opinions and decisions.
Never let the situation turn ugly if your parents refuse. Keep it eloquent, kind, calm and simple, and if you feel yourself getting angry, apologize for your anger and suggest that you continue the debate tomorrow. Go cool off and continue tomorrow.
Above all, be respectful of your parents. Bringing them a cup of water, tea or coffee will benefit all of you and your argument. It's worth doing something nice to get your way... and to make your parents happy!

, Keep politely debating until one party decides that th other is right. Lose graciously and win modestly. Remember that, whether or not you get your way in the end, you have debated wisely and are compassionate. Be proud.

Climb up to the attic.,
Jump in the car.,
Think about your parents' hobbies.,
Look in ventilation ducts.In many air ducts, there is a deep reservoir to push items back.",How to Find Something Your Parents Have Hidden2," Attics are common hiding places, but difficult to search thoroughly and stealthily. Try looking when you're home alone, but be very careful not to step where there is not a board. You don’t want to bust through the ceiling and leave incriminating evidence you can’t possibly cover.

, If you're not allowed to use their car, that makes it a perfect hiding spot. Pretend to forget something out there after a car trip and search quickly. There are only so many places to hide items in the car, so look to the most obvious spots.


The glove box is an obvious pick for hiding something. If you're searching for something small like keys or a remote, try the glove box.
An arm rest area is another obvious hiding spot. Sift through the oil change print outs and the car registration to find thin items like cards, phones, and games.
Pop the trunk. There is usually a button to get it open. Larger items can be hidden very easily in the trunk.

, More than likely your parents have a few things they like to do in their spare time. Those items provide good hiding spots because they check back often, and know when things are out of order.


Golf bags are a perfect, deep spot for longer gifts. If you suspect you’re getting a baseball bat, that’s an ideal location.
If your father does a lot of yard work, or your mother does a lot of gardening, their tools are probably pretty dirty. They may think you’ll be less likely to look among these items, and that’s why they will use that spot to hide things.
Crossword puzzles and Sudoku books are a great spot for thin items like gift cards, pictures, and concert tickets.

, If they use this location, it’s more than likely going to be a short-term hiding spot. They wouldn’t want to block the air-flow into the house for very long.


Large presents or items need somewhere big enough to conceal the size of the item. Check the largest air return first.
Small vents often have quick turns in them. A shorter item would likely fall into the ventilation system. Search for longer items here, ones that wouldn't fall through.

"
"
Check the freezer.,
Check the vegetables.,
Check fake bottles.,
Look at appliances.",How to Find Something Your Parents Have Hidden3," The freezer is just an odd place to hide things because of the temperature. Some items can be ruined in the freezer, and there isn’t a lot of room for storage. Think about smaller items that won’t be affected by the temperatures.


Mini-sized items fit perfectly in frozen vegetable bags. They know you don’t like broccoli, so they put what they want to hide where you’d least want to go.
Hiding something in a frozen dessert would be a clever choice. A box of ice cream sandwiches is prime for hiding things. Your parents know you want desserts and aren’t allowed to have them without permission. More than likely have an idea of how much is left.
Check behind the ice. If there are ice cube trays, move them and check underneath or behind. Also, some older freezers get a bit of ice buildup in them, a great spot to hide something small like a charger.

, Believe it or not, there are safes and hiding spots made to look just like food. Books, cases, and folders are way more obvious than food hiding locations.


Who would even think about hiding something inside a head of lettuce? Well, it’s been done.Frozen bags of vegetables are very tricky locations to hide from kids. Parents know you're very unlikely to look there.
Look behind vegetables in the pantry. Vegetables are often bunched together, which would make a prime hiding spot for kids who don't like vegetables.

, The fact there are so many options makes the hiding spot time-consuming to discover. They may have even wrapped the hidden contents in bubble-wrap so there is no noise.


Sniff the spices. Emptied coffee cans or spice jars are great diversion safes. They’re fairly common, but really difficult to find since there are so many spices. Shake pill bottles. Emptied out medicine bottles are brilliant spots for tiny items or rolls of money. Check their medicine cabinet or maybe even a potted plant.Squirt some lotion. An emptied out lotion bottle is an ideal location for spare keys, small remotes, cell phones, and credit cards., Your parents already know you're not going to use several appliances in the house. Try searching in, on, or behind appliances that are big enough to conceal something.


Pull out the vacuum. The vacuum cleaner is perfect for hiding big things out in the open. Vacuums have a large, easily accessible cavity to stuff in various items.Mixers often have bowls big enough to use as hiding spots. Tip each bowl carefully and see if there is something inside.
Open doors on all appliances. The oven, the microwave, the toaster-oven, they all make great hiding spots, especially if your parents are the only ones who cook.

Leave wrapped items alone.,
Cover your tracks.,
Delete your browser history.",How to Find Something Your Parents Have Hidden4," No matter how careful you are, you won’t be able to make the present look pristine and untouched. Follow a few of these steps if you're uncertain about whether you should mess with something or not:


Removing tape will likely tear the wrapping paper, leaving evidence. Don't mess with the tape.
Wrapping paper is difficult to put back precisely. Trying to rewrap an item is sure to fail, because parents have years of experience wrapping presents to make them look better.
Bows are a definite stop sign. Once a bow is unwrapped or curled the wrong way, they can be so delicate that you can't put them back together.

, Make sure to put everything back where you found it. If you looked under a pile of books or something, don't just pile the books on the floor and leave them there. Your parents will know you've been snooping.


Make sure you know the order of items, not just the positioning. Your parents may have things alphabetically organized or put in some other order.
Pay attention to folds and creases, especially in clothing. They'll know you've been in their stuff if the folds are different than the norm.
Clean off smudges from glass items. Use your shirt or a paper towel to remove any incriminating evidence if you happened to have touched glass and left a visible fingerprint.

, Make sure they don't see this page! If they see this page, it doesn’t matter how well you covered your tracks. They’ll know your intent and won’t trust you. If your parents find out you've been snooping around, they may even dedicate time into finding a better hiding spot.
Log off the computer. Leave no evidence you were on it.
Turn the computer off. If the computer was off to begin with, you want to make sure and power it down.

Keep communication open.,
Welcome the couple and grandchildren with open arms.,
Establish basic ground rules to ensure privacy and fair sharing of space.,
Do not be afraid to talk to the couple about their financial status.,
Give each person who has moved in a household chore to do.,
Respect one another's' feelings.,
Find ways to escape from the house now and then.",How to Handle Adult Children Staying with a Parent," Both you and the couple need to openly talk about what you each expect of one another and what your boundaries are. For example, topics to discuss include grandchildren, eating habits, usage of household items, contributions toward the costs of power, etc. It is also very important to discuss the length of time needed to stay with the parent. This enables both parties to plan ahead.;
, Give advice but do not force your preferences and opinions onto the adult children. They need your help as a parent, not as a teacher or boss. Offer to help them with the move in whatever way you can, such as physically, financially or by watching the children.

, As a parent who has lived without children for quite some time, it is likely that you will feel your privacy being invaded.


If the children are under the same roof, you'll find your peace and quiet shattered. This may end up curtailing your usual activities, such as inviting friends over, enjoying your usual cooking habits, and even control over the television channels.
Talk to the couple and ask them to be considerate of your lifestyle. Explain how important your privacy, space and routine are to you and say that while you're willing to make some compromises, you draw the line at the things that are really important to you and expect them to work around your needs with respect to those things.
Original boundaries might be broken, so apply patience. Ask them politely to be considerate of your habits. For example, if you like to sleep late in the morning, ask them to keep the children occupied and doors closed to block out sound.

, They may not want to discuss this with anyone, especially you, the parent, but remember, they made it your business when they asked to move in. Be polite and offer advice. They might need help drawing up and keeping to a budget. Give them advice on where to make 'cuts' and how to save.

, This will make the household run much smoother and lessen the burden on you. Tell your children and grandchildren that it's a matter of ""mi casa es su casa"" (Spanish for ""my house is your house"") and that each person has a role to contribute in its upkeep. This will also help them to feel less of a burden to you.


Even the very young can be given specific chores to help out. Chores can help children feel needed, and for teens, it can be a good way for them to feel useful (even if they grumble).

, This includes requests for privacy and space, feeling down on occasion and wanting to express emotions to get feedback from you.

, When the noise and fuss gets too much, take a drive, visit a friend, sleep over if possible at a friend's house for a weekend. It might feel like a 'holiday'.


It can also be helpful to have the children sleep over at a friend's house or another relative now and then, for a break.

Choose an appropriate time to talk.,
State your intentions.,
Ask why they kept the secret from you.,
Be honest.,
Ask a medical professional to talk with elderly parents.",How to Deal with Your Parents Keeping Secrets As an Adult1," If you want to have a serious conversation with your parents about keeping secrets, you should broach the topic when your parents are not busy. It would be difficult to have an important and meaningful conversation when your parents are preoccupied with another task.For example, ask your parents to go on a walk or go for a car ride. This will allow you to have their undivided attention and will give you an opportunity to talk with them about your feelings.;
, A good way to begin a tough conversation with your parents is by being straightforward and communicating what it is that you want from the conversation. You could begin by saying ""Mom and dad, I have something that I want to get off my chest and I need you to listen to me."" This communicates to your parents that you want them to pay attention to what you are about to say.You could also say, ""I need to ask you a question and I am looking for some advice on how we can handle this situation better if it arises again in the future.""
This way you are communicating to your parents that you value their opinions and want to come to an agreeable solution.

, Once you have a clear mind, you can approach your parents and ask them why they chose to keep a secret from you. For example, they may have been protecting you or maybe they were worried about how you would react to the news.If your parents give you feedback that they kept something from you because they were worried about how you might react, try to be receptive to this constructive criticism. Being willing to listen to what they have to say can help to improve your relationship and the flow of your communication.
Think back on previous times when your parents have confided in you and ask yourself: “Did I keep the secret?” “Was I judgmental about things they told me?”

, When you are communicating with your parents about keeping secrets, you should be honest. For instance, if you are concerned that your parents are keeping important information about their health and well-being from you, then you should explain to them why this concerns you.For example, you could say ""Dad, let me know the next time you are feeling pain in your knee that way I can help you with some tasks around the house.""

, If you are unable to get through to your parents, you can ask their family doctor to talk with them about the importance of telling people when they need help. When this type of information comes from a medical professional, your parents may be more apt to accept that they need your support.You can also have someone else who they trust talk with them about this issue, such as a family friend, cousin, or spiritual leader.

If you're getting dinner and you're the one picking the restaurant, make sure to be considerate of your date's food preferences. Be sure to ask your date if there are any foods they won't eat, whether due to medical issues, religious beliefs, or personal tastes. For example, if your date is vegetarian, don't take him or her to a steakhouse. Likewise, if your date has a gluten sensitivity, check the menu for wheat-free options before hitting up a pizza place.;
, You never know how your date may go, and the two of you may end up back at your place. You don't want your date to think you're a slob, so take some time to clean if your place is a mess. Pay special attention to your living room, bedroom, and bathroom., While you shouldn't be fiddling with it during dinner, your phone is important to have ready just in case.


If you get lost on the way there or while heading back home, you can use your phone's GPS for help.
If either you or your date is running late or has to cancel because of a last-minute emergency, you'll need your phone for communication.
If you want to keep the night going and head to a cafe or bar after your planned destination, you can use your phone to help find the best place nearby., Even if your date ends up treating you, make sure you have the ability to at least offer to pay. Double-check that your preferred credit card is in your wallet and that your wallet is in your purse or jacket pocket. It's also a good idea to have cash to make splitting the bill easier or just in case the place you're going doesn't take credit cards.Have your purse or wallet ready ahead of time. In addition to money, pack gum, breath mints, tampons, pads, condoms, and/or a phone charger.

, Look up directions at least a few hours ahead of time. You can always us a GPS app on your phone, but you should definitely figure out how long it'll take and what transportation to use in advance.In addition to directions, make sure you have the right transportation to get you to your date on time. Unless your date is with a longtime significant other, don't depend on the other person for transportation.
If you're driving during rush hour or using public transportation, make sure to give yourself extra time and leave early.

, The less nervous you are, the better your date will go. If you've taken care of everything on this list, then you have nothing to worry about. Take the last few minutes before you meet up with your date to chill out.


Stay calm through breathing exercises. Take slow, deep breaths, hold them in for a moment, and then exhale slowly.
Do a quick round of mindful meditation. Look down or close your eyes. Clear your mind of all other thoughts and simply pay attention to your bodily sensations at that moment., If you really want to be proactive, figure out what you'll wear a few days before your date. It's best to do this sooner rather than later to keep from rushing around at the last minute to find the perfect shirt.


What you'll wear will come down to your personal tastes and what type of date you're going to. For example, if the date is at a classy restaurant, you might wear a suit or a nice dress. If you were going to the beach, you'd want to wear a swimsuit and a t-shirt or cover-up.
Above all, make sure that whatever you are wearing is comfortable. While looking nice should also be a priority, comfort will go a long way to help you relax and feel confident.
Set everything aside and make sure to keep it clean. If you don't have pets, lay it out on your bed while you get ready. If you do have a cat or a dog who may take a nap on your clothes, hang them up in a specific place. Get dressed after showering., You want to be nice and clean to impress your date. Use mildly-scented shampoo, conditioner, and soap. Be sure to wash your face thoroughly without irritating the skin. Try to be a little more diligent cleaning yourself than you usually are.If you have a hair type that needs less frequent washing, you don't necessarily have to wash it right before a date. Just make sure it looks and smells clean.

, After you've gotten yourself nice and squeaky clean, take some time to manage your facial and body hair before your date.


If you have a beard, make sure it's trimmed to perfection.
If your date may get intimate, you might want to groom your pubic area.
If you take pride in your perfectly-shaped eyebrows, give them a quick check and pluck out any stray hairs you may find.
If you have nose and/or ear hair, be sure to pluck or trim those, too., You'll be spending a lot of time talking to (and possibly kissing) your date, so be considerate and get your mouth clean. You don't want to show up with bad breath.Take two minutes to brush your teeth.
Floss to make sure you don't have any embarrassing food particles stuck between your teeth.
Swish with a little mouthwash for extra-fresh breath.
Don't forget to bring some gum or breath mints for after you eat.

, If you washed your hair, be sure it's dry before you leave. You don't want to show up for your date with wet, messy hair.


Since a date is a type of special occasion, consider spicing up your look by styling your hair a little different than usual. For example, if you usually keep your long hair up, wear it down. If you usually wear it down, try styling it into a simple but elegant updo.

, Many people, especially girls, wear makeup when going out. Just like your outfit, what makeup you put on will depend on the type of date and the look you're going for.


For a casual date, you may want to stick to more natural-looking makeup.
For a fancy dinner, try bold makeup that incorporates both smoky eyes and red lips.
Don't forget that guys can wear makeup, too. Most men who wear makeup stick to the natural ""no makeup"" look.

, Be mindful when selecting products with strong scents. This is especially important when dating someone new, as you won't be sure of their tastes and sensitivities. You need to walk a fine line between smelling nice and noxious.


Don't bathe yourself in perfume, cologne, or body spray. Even a mild fragrance can be overpowering when used in large amounts. Instead, either lightly spritz it on or spray some in front of you and quickly walk through the mist.Don't forget to wear deodorant. Even if you're not a fan of fragrances, deodorant is a must. You may be nervous and sweat more than usual on a date, so be sure to apply some right before you go out.

Buy tickets for them.,
Research.,
Be kind.,
Tell them that they need to spend more time together.,
Try a trick to drive them out, if you really want.,
Never be rude.,
Give them a lovely message written in a post-it of their favorite color.,
Show them indirectly that you need some time to be alone.,
Be honest and assertive.,


",How to Get Your Parents to Go Out," A good way to make your parents go out is buying tickets for the cinema or a concert and telling them that these were the only tickets left. In this way, they won't force you to come with them. Tell them also that they have cost you very much money, so that they will be sensitized and won't refuse your suggestion.;
, You should search on the internet or in the newspaper for an upcoming festival or celebration in your town. If you find something interesting, tell your parents about it, while using such phrases: ""I'm sure you will love it!"" and ""Haven't you always wanted to go to something like this?"" or ""Aw, I'll be sad if you miss it..."" while making a puppy face. They may find it hard to resist.

, Let them know about your unique traits, so that they will compliment you. After that, they are more likely to do what you ask them to.

, Try to make it clear that they are barely alone with each other and that they need to spend some constructive time in two. Moreover, a trick which is very very effective is to tell them that seeing them go out together makes you happy and satisfied. They will instantly understand and go out.

, For example, spray the house with egg perfume or something similar that they can't stand the smell of. If they insist on staying home though, tell them that they could go out and that you could make the situation right. (Just open all windows for a long time!).

, Never try to say something like ""Ooh, will you go out at last?"" Never hurt or curse them. Calling someone hurtful names only worsens the situations, and as a result, your parents will never let you stay home alone.

, It could contain a poem like this: ""My parents never go out, I do not know if they love each other, my parents never leave me alone, what if they hate one another?"" and add a ""frowning face"" emoticon.

, For example, you could say loudly: ""Ugh, I have so much work to do! Why is everyone here shouting like that? Could you please be very silent so I can concentrate?"" They should get the message.

, If nothing works, tell them directly that you want to be alone and that they should go out. But remember: don't swear or hurt!

Remember that they are probably nervous too.",How to Get Ready for a First Date (Teen Girls)," Make a list of everything you want to get done before your first date, and calculate about how long it will take. (example: Taking a shower, blow-drying hair...) This is a good time to think of some fun topics or questions to ask him to keep the conversation fun and interesting. Think of something funny that happened to you recently to share - don't bring up how you hate your mom or why your sister is the worst - save drama for later. Maybe you learned what fleet means or your soccer team did something cool - stories that are fun and show off that you are relaxed and go with the flow but can also make fun of yourself and others. Guys like that.;
,, Make sure your parents have a steam shower first. If not, sit in a bath. Go nuts with those bath bombs - but don't trip out. Sometimes hours can go by as you watch that orange zesty fizz. Don't miss your date but maybe use some of your bath salt stash instead to be safe. Epson salts keep your muscles relaxed. Shampoo and condition your hair well. Wash your body to cleanse and have a good smell when you're on the date. When in the shower/bath, if needed, shave anything you feel needed (Legs, armpits...).

, For blow-drying/ironing, do it when hair is still damp and don't wait too much. Put some hair cream in it to keep it looking healthy and finger combing works best for not ruining done-hair.

, Take dating quizzes, Google teen dating tips, talk to friends even. (Try Cosmo Girl and Seventeen for teen dating advice)

, For a bit of taste add the juice from a lemon/orange or some water Flavoring Drink Mix. Try to avoid anything fat or sugar-y the few hours before the date, so you can eat at the date and still look fit.

, Don't know how? Sit on a comfy couch, bean bag, floor, carpet... in a comfortable position that isn't slouched or lazy, (pick a spot away from people, somewhere private and quiet, close your eyes, and think happy thoughts. Don't think about the date, and don't analyze yourself or him. Think or something relaxing, something that makes you feel good. Don't have to be cheesy, but it has to be comforting. Do it with classical or Harmonica music in the back ground, and do it before you get dressed.

, Do either something creative and wacky, or simple and basic. When it comes to nails, you can hardly go overboard, and it's a good way to be expressive and make a statement without being judged.

,, When choosing an outfit know what flatters you, and what makes you feel more secure and comfy. If you're young, don't feel like you have to dress ""sexy"" or older than you feel to impress your date. If you're older, showing a little skin isn't bad, but again, don't feel forced. If you have an area that you're insecure about, cover it up a bit, but put more focus on things you love. This will make you feel more confident. For example, if you don't like your legs but feel great about your face, wear a maxi skirt with a flattering top and a statement necklace to bring attention upwards.

, Even if you aren't gonna get anywhere, wear a color-coordinated set of underwear, something that won't be noticed from above (panty lines!) that are both flattering and unseen to the eye. Wear something form-fitting and your size. Wear a bra if you need, ask a close friend or a female in your family if you're not sure if you need or not, and tell them to be frank.

, For example, if you're seeing a movie, you'll be in the dark so you don't need so much. If it's raining or very hot, or you're going swimming, you'll need to set your makeup well and wear waterproof products. Be careful not to apply too much or it may give you a bad impression of insecurity or trying too hard. Also be sure that if you're young that your parents are okay with you wearing makeup.

, If you have beautiful eyes, put some eyeliner and mascara, those basic eye makeups always do best. Put lip gloss and foundation if you'd like, then you're out the door.


If you have a zit, or a problem area, put oil-free make-up on it, just a pea size though, spread it a bit, then don't touch it anymore.

, Most people prefer putting their hair down on dates, but try out updos too. They make you look taller and longer, which makes you look thinner and it brings out eyes and makes you look more mature. Otherwise, don't always blow-dry. Fun waves and curls are fun too, and these days original, and it makes you look like a natural beauty. If you have curly hair, a ponytail looks the best, with a pair of nice earrings- that's real nice .

, If you know you're going to be walking quite a bit then put shoes that match your outfit yet are walkable and comfy. If you don't know how to walk in heels, don't wear them on a first date- practice first.

, Bad breath is a big turn-off, and it's especially useful if you want a goodnight kiss at the end of the date. Brushing and flossing on a regular basis is all you need. If you're still feeling insecure, take breathe-mints or sugar-free minty bubblegum, but it's not a replacement for actually brushing your teeth. Mouth wash when you're done.

, Wear something age appropriate that you like, such as a fruity body mist like Victoria's Secret. Spray once on one of your wrists but avoid rubbing your wrists together or against any other surface because the odour particles in the fragrance break down, making the scent dissipate quickly.

, Perfume is not a replacement for deodorant. Deodorant is far more important that perfume. Put an extra deodorant in the purse you're taking to the date, and go to the bathroom one time during the date to put more on.

, Are there drugs? Double-check. You might get bored or gassy. Sometimes your stomach knots up with nerves so keep some antacids or anti-gas tablets if you're anxious.Cellphone (don't use it too much during the date), iPod (to listen to while waiting), keys, bubblegum or breath-mints, deodorant, tissues, money, lip gloss (apply regularly). Ask him to carry your purse if you wanna have a little fun.

, Wearing bracelets and necklaces that match and make a statement is always a plus, 1-3 rings are okay, earrings are always good (hoop earrings are a bit a few years ago though, best are studs and ones that stick close to the ear, or drops)Wear a cool belt, or a brooch to match your outfit and make it special, but it's on of those things where you can actually go overboard. Don't go too kitschy, or clichéd or out-there, especially if you're just going to the mall. A statement necklace brings attention to your face.

, Never talk about being nervous, it sounds good but it ends up being weird, good luck!

Relax.",How to Get Ready for a Date (Teen Girls)," If you’re going out to eat and you aren’t familiar with the restaurant, check the restaurant’s Yelp page to see their “attire” and “ambience” info. This will tell you if the restaurant is casual, fancy, or somewhere in between. If you’re going to be doing an activity, like having a picnic, seeing a movie, or going to a concert, make sure you’re dressed appropriately.A miniskirt and high heels might make you feel glamorous, but they aren’t appropriate for go-karting or bowling. Use your common sense to dress in a way that’s fitting for the occasion.
If you’re stumped on outfit ideas, Pinterest can be a great resource. Type in “outfit” and whatever activity you’re doing, and you can see a gallery of outfits that other people might wear.;
, This is extremely important. Your date might not remember the exact outfit you wear on your date, but if you’re wearing something that makes you feel poised and gorgeous, he will absolutely remember your confidence! Alternatively, your date will likely remember if you’re tugging and fidgeting with your outfit all night, appearing insecure and uncomfortable.It can be fun to buy a whole new outfit for a date, but you must make sure that it fits properly and comfortably before you head out on your date.
When in doubt, wear your “go-to” favorite outfit. If you have a get-up that makes you feel awesome and is appropriate for the date, wear it!

, This is particularly important if you’re wearing something new or going on a date with an activity. If you’re going bowling and you discover that you can’t really move your arms in a tight shirt, that’s good to find out beforehand. If you’re seeing a movie and the jeans you picked out are miserably uncomfortable to sit in for long periods of time, find something else.


By trying on your outfit beforehand, you ensure that it fits well, it’s comfortable, it looks great, and it’ll work for the specific date environment. Nothing is more stressful than having to find a new outfit five minutes before your date arrives! Set yourself up for success.

, This needs to be done the day of the date, and it can cause last-minute outfit changes. This step might not be necessary depending on where you live, but if you live in an area with temperamental weather, it’s very important! If you picked out a sundress and neglect to notice a cold front and thunderstorm moving in, you’re going to be one miserable date by the end of the night.


The biggest thing you should remember when picking out an outfit for a date is simply that the outfit is not the star of the show. You are! Your clothing should fit the occasion and the weather so that it isn’t a distraction on your date.
You want to spend your time having fun with your date, not worrying about your outfit. That is why planning ahead is key– get the worrying out of the way before your date begins.

, While you have many options for whatever hairstyle you choose to do, your hair should look fresh and neat. Minimize the grease by shampooing it in the shower that day or spraying it with some dry shampoo. Comb it and try to keep it out of your face.


Your date will probably be distracted if greasy strands of hair are hanging over your eyes. Let him focus on you, not your hair.

, If you’re doing something more straightforward like going out to eat or seeing a movie, style your hair however you prefer. However, if you’re doing something active, it might be best to tie your hair up in a ponytail. Again, the most important thing is that your hair adds to your overall appearance without being a distraction.

, Use your makeup to enhance your natural beauty, not create an entirely new face. It can be tempting to go all out when you’re excited for a date, but try to keep your makeup soft and natural.Your date already asked you out, so clearly they like your face the way it is!


That said, makeup is only a fun addition to your look, but it isn’t absolutely necessary. If you don’t wear makeup regularly and don’t find it necessary, skip it! Don’t feel pressure to wear makeup simply because you’re going on a date.

, Just like with your outfit, it’s beneficial to use the products you know and love for your date. It’s fun to experiment with new lipsticks and eye shadows, but probably not before a big date.Instead, use the products you use on a day-to-day basis so that you know how to apply it all properly and can ensure that you’ll like the way you look.


If you are eager to use a new product, just give it a test run before your date. That will ensure you know how to apply it properly and you love the way it looks.

, Makeup can wear off quickly depending on what you’re doing on your date, so it’s nice to be able to fix it up sporadically. Bring some small products in your purse so that you can touch it up a little bit whenever you head to the bathroom.


If you aren’t concerned with your makeup wearing off, you can certainly skip this step. The only thing that matters is that you feel confident and gorgeous for the entirety of the date.

, Don’t worry about planning every word you’re going to say to your date, because that’s completely unrealistic. However, it can be helpful to have a few conversation topics tucked away in the back of your mind in case there is a lull in conversation. For example, you can plan to ask him about his family, his classes, or one of his hobbies.You might not need or want to discuss these topics once the date starts, but it can help calm your nerves by having them prepared.

, This might sound silly, but if you’re in a happy, energized mood, it’ll set the tone of the date. If you’re sitting in silence, anxious about how the date is going to go, you may appear nervous and uncomfortable once the date begins. Instead, pop on some of your favorite pump-up music to distract yourself, get your endorphins flowing, and put you in a great mood before your date., Remember, dating is meant to be fun. Your date is most likely just as nervous as you are, and you two are in it together! You will probably date lots of people over the course of your life, so it doesn’t matter if every single one goes perfectly. Have fun, be yourself, and everything will happen how it’s meant to."

Consider waiting until the date is over before trying for a kiss.",How to Get a Kiss on the First Date," Not everyone is comfortable with kissing on the first date. If you don't know your date very well and they haven't been hinting at wanting a kiss, don't make assumptions; give them the opportunity to say ""no"" or stop you. Some people want to move slowly, so give your date the opportunity to communicate their boundaries - and remember that they do have the right to turn down a kiss.


You can test the general mood by using other tactics of flirting - holding hands, putting an arm around their shoulder, hugs, and gentle teasing and joking. However, receptiveness to flirting doesn't necessarily mean receptiveness to a kiss.
Remember that different types of kissing will be received differently, as well. A kiss on the cheek, for example, is different than a kiss on the lips. Someone may be okay with one type of kiss, but not another. If in doubt, ask.
Giving your date a kiss when they're not comfortable with it can ruin your chances of a second date.;
, If you've been having an enthusiastic air hockey battle and have been enjoying it together, that's great, but you probably won't have the proper atmosphere for a kiss. The mood of the moment really does matter, so try to find a good time to kiss your date that won't feel awkward, tense, or forced.


Privacy is usually best for a first kiss, so it might be better to wait until there aren't so many people around. This doesn't mean that you should lead your date to a secluded area, though - that might make them think you're up to something.
Kissing in the middle of a conversation often doesn't go over very well. Wait until you two have a moment where the conversation is minimal (but not when it's an awkward silence).
Don't kiss them while driving a car - while it may seem tempting to just kiss them no matter where you are, it's not worth risking a car accident for a kiss.

, Whether seated or standing, it's vital to have good balance, as toppling over spoils the moment.

, You can try various methods of getting closer to your date. Examples include stepping closer to them or putting your arm around them.


If your partner pulls away, save the kiss for another time. They're not ready, and you're getting a subtle indication that now is not the right moment.

, Stroke their arm or hold their hand.

, Move in slowly - this allows your date to tell what you're doing and react appropriately.


Making eye contact will increase the anticipation for both of you.

, Smile and look at their lips, then back at their eyes. Your partner will most likely grasp that you'd like to try for a kiss.


If they seem uncertain or confused, ask for permission. A simple, ""Can I kiss you?"" is all that's necessary.

, If your date has been receptive, then you're safe to give them a kiss. Gently touch your lips to your partner's lips and start kissing. To make it more special, kiss for at least 5 seconds.


Don't proceed into more intense kisses, such as French kisses or making out - some people are fine with it, but it's risky for a first date.

, How you end the kiss is just as important as how you start it. Don't back away quickly; take it easy, smile, and if it feels right, give them a compliment that suits the mood.

, If your partner makes a move first, don't panic. Just act naturally and go with the flow.

, For example, rest your head on his shoulder or smell her hair. Talk about what you want in a person and ask him if they agree––that way, both of you will be on the same page.

, Avoid vulgarities or inappropriate humor, but other than that, don't act like somebody you aren't. If they like you for who you are, they'll still be likely to ask for a kiss.

, Kissing someone becomes much less enjoyable when one person has bad breath. Brush your teeth before the date, and before you plan to kiss the person, try to slip a breath mint or some gum into your mouth, especially if you've just had a meal together. Just make sure to find a moment to spit out the gum before you kiss!

, While a kiss could happen at any time during a first date, the end of the date might be the perfect moment to give him or her thanks. Many people would be expecting a kiss at this stage, making it more likely that they're ready for a kiss.

Don’t take it personally.,
Step away from the situation.,
Try to understand their perspective.",How to Deal with Your Parents Keeping Secrets As an Adult2," If you find out (either from your parents or another relative/friend) that your parents have been keeping a secret from you, try not to take it personally. Most likely your parents feel as though they are protecting you or doing you a favour by not keeping you informed.Or, it may also have something to do with your parents own personal hangups or insecurities.


For example, if one of your parents has a serious illness they may keep it from you for a while until they know more details. They are likely doing this to protect you, or because they are still processing the news themselves.

, Before responding, you should take some time to calm down and clear your thoughts. When you first find out that you have been left in the dark, you may feel upset, betrayed, or even angry. It is best not to react to the news from an emotional place. Instead, take some time to yourself so that you can collect your thoughts.If you react to the secret immediately, you may actually make the situation worse.
As you take some time away from the situation, you can also call a trusted friend to get some perspective and find out if you are reacting in a reasonable way.

, Your parents may be keeping secrets from you for a variety of different reasons. For example, they may cover up health issues or money problems so that they can maintain control over their daily lives. By admitting to you that they are struggling, they fear that you will drastically change their lifestyle. Many aging parents, for instance, fear being placed in a long term care facility.You could say ""I understand that you want to stay in your own home as long as possible. In order to do this, I need to know if you need extra help. We could hire someone to clean your house, or have your meals delivered.""
Let your parents know that you understand their position and that you want to help them.

Respect their decision.,
Forgive your parents.,
Understand that being left out is not always bad.,
Seek professional help.",How to Deal with Your Parents Keeping Secrets As an Adult3," The best way to move on, is to understand and respect your parents’ decision not to tell you their secret. Even if you do not agree with their decision, try your best to empathize with them. Think about the situation from their point of view and try and rationalize why they left you out., The best way to move past a secret is to let it go and forgive your parents. Carrying around a grudge is mentally exhausting, so the quicker you can accept the situation and forgive your parents the better. Once you have forgiven them, you will be able to move on with your relationship.For example, one of your parents may have fallen down the stairs and kept this from you because they are worried you will begin to look at them as frail.
Let them know that you understand why they left you out, but that in the future they need to tell you, for their own safety.
You may need to find a formal way to do this, such as by writing them a letter expressing your forgiveness. Even if you never give them this letter, it can be therapeutic for you to write it.

, In some instances secrets can be difficult to process and a burden to carry. Once you are let in on a family secret, you may be asked to continue to keep that secret from other people in your life. This could lead to dishonesty.For example, your parents may confide in you that they are getting a divorce, but ask you not to tell your siblings because they are still young and it might be too hard for them.
Alternatively, one of your parents may inform you that they are having an affair and ask you to keep this from your other parent. This information would be hard for you to process and it would be a huge burden to keep that information a secret.

, In some instances, your parents will tell you a major, life changing secret that you need help processing. For example, your parents may tell you in early adulthood that you are adopted and they are not your biological parents. You may find this news extremely difficult to process on your own. As a result, you may want to seek out a therapist to work through this new information.Going to family counseling can also be a helpful way to strengthen your relationships with your parents and improve your communication with them.

Smile.",How to Date Successfully As a Teenage Guy," First and foremost, your partner will want to feel like you care about them as a person, not as an object.;
, This will make your date feel you like them more than your money. If they decline and would rather go Dutch (splitting the bill), go with what they want. Don't take it personally.

, Your date decided to go out with you and not some other guy for a reason. Whatever you do, don't mislead your date about who you are in any way, shape or form - it'll come back to bite you later.

, Offer to carry her books for her, open doors for her (especially when she is getting in and out of your car), and call her parents Mr. and Mrs. when you meet them.

, This doesn't mean you shouldn't have your own style - on the contrary. But when a boy becomes a teenager, his body changes, and you need to dress a little differently to look your age - you will impress a potential date more if you look as mature as your age. This means tidying yourself up throughout the day - make sure you are clean and not wrinkled, and that your hair is looking good. Wear a belt regardless of whether your shirt is tucked in or not. As a boy ages, he usually loses some of the ""curve"" of a boy's frame, and that's why most grown men you see are wearing a belt! You'll get used to the tighter feeling. Also, make sure your clothes fit well and are appropriate for the occasion. Consider being trendy, but be yourself too. Develop a style, but remember that men generally have less options than women and, though the world has changed, men are still expected to dress a certain way, especially for fancier occasions. So if you're going out, dress a little nicer than you would if you were lazing away a weekend. But, you must have your own style and individuality.

, Let them know some of your interests, whether it's in movies, books, or music. This is always a good way to start a conversation. It will be easy for them to reply on one of the subjects mentioned. If you have a class with them, then mention something about that class. They will come back with either they did not notice you in class, or will mention that they did notice you. This way, the conversation can be woven around the class, and will go from there.

, Compliment how your date looks, which is always appreciated, but also compliment them on other things, such as their abilities in art or sports. If your date is kind, say so. It is important not to lie for the sake of giving a compliment, however, because people usually know what they truly are worthy of being complimented for and will feel patronized if they catch on that you are lying.

, Do not talk only about yourself; ask about things that interest your date, such as their hobbies, friends, or what matters most to them. If your date asks you a question about yourself, answer, then say something like, ""What about you?"" in order to avoid monopolizing conversation. This will also help you learn more about them.

, Smile when either of you speak, make eye contact consistently -especially when sitting at a table having a bite to eat - always look directly at your date when they talk to you. It is irritating and annoying to talk to someone while they scan the room with their eyes or turn around to look at someone who just walked by. It shows a total lack of interest in whatever they are talking about and makes them feel that you are not interested either in them, or what she is saying.

, If your partner is not reacting well to the date, does not want to hold hands when you try, or does not converse easily, then back off for awhile. If, however, your date just looks bored and not interested in you, cut the date short, and take them home. It's okay, and it's not your fault. Remember, this is just practice, and with enough practice, every date will go well.

, It will show your date you're having fun and that you genuinely like them.

Research where you will be going to meet him.,
Adjust to the time of day.,
Balance casual looks with class.,
Avoid covering a nice outfit with casual outerwear and accessories.,
Wear comfortable shoes.",How to Dress to Meet a Boy for the First Time1," When you are trying to decide what to where it is helpful to know when and where you will be going. You dress differently for church than you do for school than you do for the club. In the same way, it is good to know what is considered acceptable for the the place you will meet. Your outfit will be influenced by your surroundings.


Look the place up online and find pictures to see how fancy or casual it is. Look for pictures with other people in them to give you an idea of how people tend to dress there.
Swing by the place before you meet him so you can get the vibe in person.;
, The time of day you will be meeting is also going to effect what you wear. Beyond dressing appropriately for the temperature, there are differences between daytime and nighttime clothing.Daytime calls for light or bright colors and a more casual style with less jewelry. You can still wear a dress, but tone it down to a simple shift, shirt dress, or wrap dress.
Meeting at night means a more formal style like that little black dress with some heels and that one piece of eye-catching jewelry.

, If you decide to dress casually, you want to be sure you still look put together and not sloppy. Combine very casual clothing with something a little fancier to keep the casual in check.Make distressed jeans work for you by pairing them with a nice pair of black heels and a sweater or silk blouse.
Combine an oversized shirt with something fitted like tights or leggings so your outfit doesn’t look baggy or ill-fitting.

, Once you have put together the perfect attire for the evening, the last thing you want to do is ruin it by covering your nice dress with an old coat, or slinging your big, beat up handbag over your shoulder. Think ahead when it comes to the necessities and make sure they enhance your outfit instead of detracting from it.Black leather jackets have style and class, and go with almost anything. They are a great addition to your wardrobe.
Accessorize with a hands-free purse like a clutch or wristlet. These look more sleek and sophisticated than fussing with a large bag. If you need more space to carry things, use your jacket pockets.

, Medium to low heels and flats are fine for a casual look. When you are going for formal, heels can look great, but also can be terribly painful. When you are choosing heels the fit is just as important as the fashion. Choose a heel which is comfortable on your feet and easy to walk in.Avoid heels which are incredibly high. Not only may they be difficult to walk in, but you might tower over him if they are too tall.

Avoid over-dressing or under-dressing for the occasion.,
Wear a color that suits rather than your favorite color.,
Be careful to take advice only if it works for you.,
Avoid looking too vampy or flirtatious on a first date.,
Know what looks good on you.,
Use a modest amount of perfume.,
Wear what works, not what the latest catwalk model is dancing around in.,
Wear your hair as much as possible in the way you usually do.",How to Dress to Impress on a First Date," Find out before attending your date where it will be, so that you know what sort of clothes will be appropriate. For example, if you're going to the local sideshow and taking rides, your jeans and a colorful sweater or t-shirt would work well, whereas going to a posh restaurant would require an elegant evening outfit.


Accept that clothes send out signals. What are the signals your presentation will be sending out should the question at the foremost of your mind when selecting the clothes.;
, It may be that both are one and the same but if not, prefer a color that you know brings out the very best in you.

, It can be fun to invite a girlfriend to come over to help you select which clothes to wear but it can also be confusing if she doesn't have the same dressing style like you. You could end up dressed in a way that doesn't reflect your own style or that is an image of what she thinks you should look like.

, You don't really know each other well romantically yet and being suggestive or provocative on a first date is a definite no-no. Worst still, looking too vampy can cause your date to relegate you to the one-night date rather than treating you as a serious long-term prospect. There will be plenty more time to see more of you as the dates progress, and if the date doesn't work out, well then, he didn't deserve to see anything more! Clothing to avoid on a first date includes:


Anything too low cut, low slung. If you wear a low-cut top, don't pair it with a short skirt, or vice versa. One slightly suggestive item of clothing is more than sufficient; don't ruin it by making an overall statement.
Your butt sticking out of your jeans. He doesn't need to see your underwear yet, in any shape or form.
A tummy roll over your jeans. Unpleasant and unlikely to garner further interest no matter how much you think it's your right to dress this way. Save it for non-date occasions.
Short, figure-hugging clothing. The shorter it is, the less appropriate it is for a first date.
Lace-up tops, bodices that evict your bust, anything see-through.

, If you don't, then ask your mom or a sibling to be honest about the clothes they like you in. You are in charge of your destiny where self-presentation comes into it, and part of this is knowing what sets off your own assets to greatest advantage.

, You don't want to asphyxiate your date with your fragrance, the poor man could faint. Instead use just enough perfume to caress and seduce his senses in a subtle way

, You can wear those sexy high heels shoes as long as you can walk in them. High heels shoes will make you look taller, give you a nice posture and make your legs look longer. But if you're not used to wearing high heels don't put them on for your first date. It could make you look insecure, walk clumsy and you could even hurt your ankle; that's not the best scene for a successful date. Make the right choice.


There are also shoes with small heels (kitten heels) that might give you that sexy look.
Can't find a shoe that fits the occasion and you are low on budget? What are friends for? Take a look at their shoe collection. They may have just what you need.
Make sure the shoes fit you well and feel comfortable. It might have worked out for Cinderella to lose a shoe but it could spoil your date and make you feel embarrassed.

, It's fine to try to make it look nicer as long as it doesn't give your date a wrong impression of who you are or smell like a firebomb of hairspray. For the first date keep it simple and real, same thing goes for your make-up.


Elaborate hairstyles that cause you pain during the date will have your mind focused on overcoming the pain rather than on your date. Forget anything that twists and pulls your hair in strange new ways and wear your hair in a way that you know feels good.

, Use deodorant and cologne, because girls really like it when guys smell nice. This will encourage girls to stay closer to you.

, You can start by saying Hey. Some girls are really shy and don't make it obvious that they like you, so you try starting up a conversation with her about who she is and what she likes to do.

Dating someone who goes to the same school as you is often the most convenient and safest option for a teenage girl.


A classmate is more likely to have a similar schedule to yours. This will make planning and going on dates much easier.
You likely share some social connections with a classmate and may be able to ask a friend of a friend about his or her reputation.If you see someone you like in one of your classes, you can let that person know you're interested in him or her in subtle ways. You can smile at him or her in class or as you walk by in the hallway. If your classmate stops to talk to you, bring the conversation around to what you enjoy doing for fun. Mention a movie you really want to see or a restaurant you want to try. Your classmate might take the hint and ask you on a date. If your classmate doesn't, try being more direct and ask him or her out on a date yourself. There's no reason a girl can't ask someone out.;
, Don't just date the first person who asks you out or you think is cute. Try to find someone who you have chemistry with and who seems trustworthy. Don't feel pressured to find a significant other just because all your friends have their own., This doesn't mean you have to turn someone down over an age gap of just a few months. However, it's best to always date someone with a similar maturity level to your own. A difference of one to two years is fine, but a gap of three or more years may be trouble.Remember that some age gaps in teen relationships are illegal. Know the age of consent laws in your area.
Some older men and women may be ready for a more intimate relationship and could pressure you into doing things you aren't ready for.
Younger girls who date older guys are at greater risk of unwanted pregnancy., Dating is meant to start as casual fun and only potentially develop into a more serious relationship later on. It's normal to date a few different people until you find someone you feel a romantic spark with. Don't force yourself into a relationship you're not feeling., There's no reason to date someone if you don't personally feel ready to do so. Remember that all girls develop at different rates, and there's no magic age when you're ""supposed"" to start dating. If you're uncomfortable with the idea of dating, don't., It's important to mentally set boundaries for yourself before you start dating. Otherwise, you may find yourself getting into situations you don't want to be in.Always remember to use protection. Sex as a teen is risky, but if you're ready for it you need to minimize that risk as much as possible. Many teen girls use some type of hormonal birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies. It's also important to use a condom, as hormonal birth control isn't 100% effective and won't protect you from sexually transmitted infections. Don't let one night of fun derail your entire life., If you want to start going out with someone but still feel a little intimidated by the idea of one-on-one dates, compromise by taking him or her on a date with friends. This is actually the most common type of ""dating"" for most teens today.If you think about it, most traditional dating ideas are easy to enjoy in a group setting. Specific activities great for group dates are:


Dinner, especially at a more casual restaurant. Places that specialize in intimate candlelit dinners aren't as accommodating to a large crowd of teens.
Going to events like movies and concerts.
Trips to zoos, aquariums, or museums.
Simply hanging out at someone's house, a park, or even after school.

, At least until you start seeing each other exclusively, it's a good idea to not post anything publicly. Once you do decide to make your relationship ""official"" on Facebook, avoid annoying your friends by spamming them with pictures and statuses about your dates., Red flags are things your date may do or say that are warning signs of a bad relationship or even abuse to come. Don't just brush it off if you find your date doing any of the following:


Insulting or belittling to you or others.
Forcing you to do anything you don't want to do.
Invading your privacy, such as demanding to see a text message..

, Hopefully your date will go smoothly and safely, but that isn't always the case. Anyone who dates should think about their safety while dating a new person, but teenage girls are especially vulnerable.


Let a third party know what time your date starts, where you're going, and what time you expect to be back by.
When you're a minor, that third party should ideally be your parents or some other trusted adult. If you can't go to them for help or you're an older teen, a reliable friend or sibling will also work.
Make sure the person is local and can come help you in case of an emergency.
If the date goes on significantly longer than expected, be sure to text that person to let him or her know everything is ok., What ""your best"" may be will depend on your date's location and your own personal tastes.



Pick out an outfit to wear.

Apply makeup if you want to wear it.
Consider putting a new twist on your hair style, just so you look a little special. Try putting your hair up, letting it down, or wearing an interesting hair clip.

, You want to be calm and start a date off on the right foot. It's much harder to keep your cool when you're rushing around.


This is especially important when going on a first date if you don't know the other person very well. You want to make a good impression.
On the other hand, an established boyfriend or girlfriend will be a lot more understanding., Being yourself is part of the most important aspect of a date: getting to know each other. You can think of those first few dates as a job interview where the ""job"" is a more serious romantic relationship. You want to make sure the two of you are really compatible, which you can't do if you pretend to like everything your date is into or agree with your date's political opinions when you really don't.


It's totally normal to want to impress your date by pretending to be someone you aren't. It doesn't make you weird or fake. Just remember it's better for both of you to be honest in the long run.
You want someone to love the real you. Don't dress up or act the way you think your date likes. Be you., While you should be yourself, to stay out of drama you should probably not bring up or discuss certain sensitive topics. While sometimes it's good to use these issues to screen out incompatible romantic interests, many people consider it rude, especially on a first date. You also don't know the person well enough to gauge whether or not an argument could get heated or even dangerous. The major topics to avoid are:


Politics
Religion
Previous relationships
Financial issues (both personal and familial), If you're going on a dinner date with a guy, it's traditional that he pays. However, be sure to still offer to pay for your half to avoid looking cheap or entitled. If you're dating a girl, you can offer to pay for either your half of the meal or the whole bill.


Don't play games. If you offer to pay and the other person doesn't insist you don't, follow through and actually pay up.
It's also polite for the person who asked the other out or picked the restaurant to pay.
If your date pays the entire check, consider treating him or her the next time., As the date winds down, if it went especially well, consider talking to the other person about the next time he or she would like to meet up.


Only do this if the other person seems interested. If your date doesn't seem especially enthusiastic, asking during the date may get awkward.
It's more common to plan out your next date a little later on, usually waiting until at least the next day.
If you had a good time, don't wait for the other person to make the next move. Be sure to let your date know you had fun and mention wanting to do it again soon."

People with a more casual look come off as friendlier and more adventurous.

, You know what the outfit means to you, but the perceiver could form an entirely different opinion. Choose a friend or two who you know will be honest with you and ask what they think of your outfit. Don’t just ask if they like it, but ask what impression they get from you when you are wearing it. What would it say about you if they had never met you before?Try asking a guy friend so you can get a male perspective.
Get more than one opinion, because your relationship to different friends can effect their perception of your outfit.
Tone the outfit up or down, or change it entirely and start over based on your friend’s response.

, If you know that you and the boy have similar interests, wear something which will bring you together. Certain clothing can identify you as being part of the group.If you are both really into music, you could wear a band t-shirt.
Put on the necklace, bracelet or skirt you got overseas to show you are a free-spirited adventurer.
Cowboy boots will give off the impression of a country, outdoors type. Doc Martens will set you off as more of a punk rocker.

, Remember this is not all about him, it’s about you too. You want to attract the kind of boy that you like. Your outfit is part of your own personal branding and says something about you. Letting your personality shine through your outfit is going to help you find out if this boy is a good match right from the start.Stick with your normal style rather than trying to change your look for the first meeting.

Don’t sweat it too much.",How to Dress to Meet a Boy for the First Time3," People tend to react more positively toward people they can relate to, including people who dress more like them.The more you know about him, the easier it will be to appeal to what he likes. Think of a few questions you can ask to learn more about his personality and style.Ask where he grew up. Certain regions have different styles. Someone from Brooklyn may be more on the cutting edge of style than someone who grew up in the country in Montana.
Ask what his hobbies are. If he spends time in coffee shops and record stores, he is probably more of a hipster. Someone interested in sports is probably more of a t-shirt and shorts type of guy.

, There are already enough unknowns in a first meet. You want to appear confident. Now is not the time to try to put together a new outfit. Choose clothes you already really like, that make you feel good.Think about what outfits you have gotten compliments on in the past.
Choose comfortable clothing which fits well. You don’t want to have to worry about adjusting yourself all night.

, Avoid wearing something that you think is too much of anything. This could mean it is too short, too tight, too flashy, or too boring. If you are already questioning it, don’t wear it.Save the daring choices for a later date when you want to spice things up.

, It’s sad but true that people react more positively to girls who are wearing makeup than bare-faced girls. It’s a double-edged sword, because that respect can also be negated if you are wearing too much makeup.Stick to just some powder, blush, mascara and lip color.
Avoid excessive eye makeup or bold lip color for the first meeting.

, He may not be the type of person who puts a lot of thought, effort or money into his own clothing. If this is the case, he is less likely to pick up on clothing cues or really care too much about what you are wearing.If he does spend a lot of money or time on his outfit, then he is probably just as worried about how he looks as you are.

Don't let the silence grow.,

Show how you feel.",How to Be Liked During the First Date," Dresses are a popular option. Don't pick one of the simple or everyday dresses that he has seen several times before. Pay attention to it. If you choose to wear a top, find a nice skirt, pair of jeans or trousers or shorts too. Try the outfit out beforehand and wear it around the house for a little while to make sure it's comfortable and looks good even after walking, sitting down and standing up a few times. If you don't buy a new outfit (you don't need to buy new outfit for a date, you don’t know if he is worth it or not) pick the dress that you have been complimented on before. It is better, it makes you confident and you don't have to worry about how you may look. Don't wear something he would have seen several times before, either in real life or in photographs online.;
, You may think ""He has been seeing me all the time at school, here’s the chance to change my look"". A change of look is fine but don't show too much skin. If the guy doesn't like that kind of girl, it might give him the impression that he has misjudged you and diminish his attraction to you. He won't relax with you because all he thinks about is the proportion of your unprotected skin. A lot of guys want to get to know their dates a little and find too much bare skin a little too attractive or a bit embarrassing. He may also read the signs wrong. Either show off your legs or your cleavage. If the relationship goes well you can show a little more skin. Show him that you will only show skin for someone special, not just anyone you go on a date with, and then use it to show you like him and you think he is special.

, You may have your own favorite color. Choose a shade that flatters your skin tone and eye colour. People say pink makes people approachable and kind-hearted and makes women look more feminine so it might be a good choice for a first date. Black is slimming, easy to dress up with some special, personal jewellery and, being a blank canvas, draws attention to your face. Red conveys excitement and passion - but also danger. Use it sparingly for the first date. White and cream suggest purity and cleanliness but also that you are an uncomplicated person and have an approachable and straightforward personality. Blues and yellows are in turn too relaxing and anxiety-inducing so you might want to limit them to the accessories!

, Guys like them. Earrings, bracelets and necklaces do well. It shouldn't be too big or too bright. Just make sure it won't annoy anybody. You should position them so they bring attention to your best features. Got a slim waist? Pin a flower at a gathered waist.

, Some people like to wear their usual make up but others put on a little extra to show they have made a special effort and to make sure they look their best. Bring attention to your best features. Got lovely blue eyes? Try terracotta, purple, orange, neutral smokey eyes or bronze to make them pop. Your makeup has to look good with the dress. Choose colours that compliment each other or contrast. If the dress is loud, tone down the make up and vice versa.

, Paint your nails, even if you are not the girl who pay a lot of time to care your beauty, make it perfect on the first date at least. Shave well. Clean well. Clean your feet and the toes too. Take a bath and shampoo your hair. Check your teeth and make your mouth smell good.

, If you know how your hair looks its best, keep that look on the date. Loose curls, straight hair or a simple up do are all easy to do and compliment most face shapes. Find the hairstyle that best suits your face shape.Messy buns and ponytails are beautiful- but that doesn't mean the ponytail you do with an elastic band when you're pulling your hair out of your face as you study. Spend at least fifteen minutes on your hair.  Treat your hair with a mask or conditioner to make sure it's shy and co-operative. Hair is the best way to make you look young and thin, use it well!

, You can change it to attractive or powerful next time, whatever you like. On the first date, cute is the one and only definitely way to get a guy like you. Put on a smile all the time, and act like you are impressed by him, try to be innocent, guys do fall for that look. Don't bring your claws out. Be the innocent one! That doesn't mean you have to have a complete personality change but let down your guard just enough that he can get to know you a little.

, That’s the smooth part. It is as important as how you look! Prepare the topics; if you really care about this first date and you think he is not an active type, think about the topics to talk earlier. Chat about hobbies, school, work, ambitions, music, sports or just take cues from your surroundings- what is your favourite food? do you like the movie? Let him lead the conversation and let him talk. Ask him simple questions and engage with what he is saying. People do like to talk and they go for the good listeners. Remember, if you have good chemistry the conversation should flow naturally once the ice has been broken so don't beat yourself up if it's not working out too well initially.

, Break the silence by saying something sweet. Don't start asking every time you are in silence. Say something that you care about him. Say something about you too, but you should have prepared what to tell about yourself at home. If not, you are not sure where to stop.

, Keep an open mind and have a habit of turning simple things into fun way of talking. The more you make him laugh, the more you win him. Some girls don't naturally have that ability so don't be depressed if you are not a fun person. He might like your sense of humour and he might not. Be safe rather than sorry and avoid any smutty or potentially offensive jokes.

, If he admits to mistakes, be understanding. Even if he turns out not the one you thought who he was, don’t look disappointed. You don't have to go beyond this date and you can go home right away if you really want. Even if he does say things that make you upset, don't show it and put a smile. You could gently say that you'd prefer not to talk about something or change the topic. If he doesn't take the hint you can be blunt and say he offended you. He can't change if he doesn't know what to change, right?

, It makes people remember that time and value it too. ""It’s my first kiss; it’s my first time going to this lake."" If it is not your first time of anything, think of happy memories you have of the place from childhood, without mentioning other dates or talking too much about your friends.

, Sometimes we think if we show how we feel, it will make us feel more, but it also makes him feel more. Say ""I am happy to be with you."" But don't come too strong. And make is subtle and let some mystery that it would be just a tradition or you really mean it.

Make eye contact and smile.,
Evaluate the person's body language.,
Introduce yourself.,
Start a conversation.,
Listen to what they have to say.,
Ask them out.",How to Ask for a Date1," Eye contact and smiling are two universal acts of flirting. Looking at someone from across a room lets them know that you notice them.When you smile, you're showing them that you are open to talking to them and that you may be interested in them, or that you like how they look.


You can meet a potential date at school, work, a grocery store, a bar, or in other social situations.
Smiling also releases endorphins that make you happier and can make other people react in a positive way.Don't force a smile or stare at them.
Maintain eye contact for two to three seconds before looking away. If you look back and the person is still looking in your direction, this is a good sign that they meant to lock eyes with you.;
, If the person smiles back, it's a good indicator that they wouldn't mind your company. If they hold your gaze for more than two seconds, it's a good sign that they would talk to you. If they avoid your gaze, look uncomfortable, or avoid you altogether, this is a sign that they aren't interested.Look for other signs, like if their arms and legs are crossed or if their knees are pointed away from you. This indicates a lack of interest and a closed-off demeanor.Signs that they may be interested include pointing their body or feet toward you and leaning in your direction.

, Once you've evaluated that they like your attention, you can introduce yourself. Walk up to them with confidence by standing upright and keeping your shoulders back.Start by offering a handshake and saying hello. Begin the conversation by talking about something relatable. As you approach them, make sure to pay close attention to their body language and facial expressions. If they look disgusted, disinterested, or frightened, you may not want to introduce yourself.


You can say something like, ""Hey, my name's Alex. This band rocks. What do you think of them?""
Ask them for their name.

, Once you've introduced yourself to them and they appear receptive to you, you can start a conversation. Start by asking small questions, like how their day is so far or if they live in the area. If the conversation seems like it's stalling, ask them questions about themselves.Practice active listening by paying close attention to what the person has to say and where they are coming from. Improve your communication and listening skills by providing feedback, deferring judgemental thoughts, and responding appropriately. Instead of waiting for your turn to say something, internalize and listen to what the person is saying and show them that you're invested in the conversation.You can enhance your listening skills by summarizing or repeating something that the person said.
For example, if they explain how they liked a band before they went mainstream, you can say something like, ""So what you're saying is that you liked their underground sound more than their poppy new music, right?""
Some good starter questions include: What do you like to do in your spare time? What kind of music do you prefer? Are you a student? Do you like art? or What's your favorite movie?
Don't plainly ask the question by itself. Integrate it into the conversation. For example say, ""I just saw the new Guillermo Del Toro film and thought it was amazing. What movies do you like?""

, If you listen to what they have to say, you'll determine whether the person would be interested in seeing you again. If they mention a significant other, then they will most likely not go on a date with you. If they seem happy and enthusiastic to talk to you, then it's likely they want to see you again.


If they avoid eye contact altogether and have short responses, you should take this as a sign to leave.

, If they seem comfortable and happy while talking to you, it's a good hint that they will say yes if you ask them out. Ask them for their contact information first, then see how they feel about meeting up with you later. It may be stressful to ask the question, but don't wait too long to ask, or you may never get the opportunity.


You can say something like, ""I had a fun time talking to you. Do you want to do this again?""

Talk to them about their romantic life.,
Determine if there is any chemistry.,
Determine their interests.,
Ask them out.",How to Ask for a Date2," Determine whether the person you're interested in has a significant other, or whether they aren't interested in dating right now. Since you already know the person, it will be easier to have the conversation without making it seem like you are interested. Ask questions about where they are right now romantically, and determine whether they are ready to date.


You can start the conversation by saying, ""Have you been dating around recently or just hanging out by yourself?""
You can also say, ""I thought you were still seeing Derrick. Are you not together anymore?""
If you've noticed that the person isn't regularly in a relationship, ask them something like, ""I notice that you don't date that often. Are you trying to concentrate on your studies instead?""
Do your best to talk to them so that they open up and start talking about their romantic desires.
Sometimes people don't date because they are busy with school or work, have recently got out of a relationship, or are enjoying their time being single.
Some single people may want to stay single.

, At this point, you already know that you like the person, but that doesn't mean that they like you back. Determine if there is any romantic chemistry by thinking about the times that you've spent together and whether there is any sexual tension when you hang out.Think about what you share in common and how you make each other feel. If you are playful and flirtatious, the chances are that the chemistry already exists.


If you are platonic friends, asking your friend out may upset them.

, Learn more about the person that you plan on asking out on a date. Ask them questions about what kinds of things make them happy. Have deep and honest conversations with them by opening up yourself. If you tell them what interests you, they will feel inclined to offer their opinions as well. Figure out what they enjoy, what they dislike, and how they like to spend their time socially. Use this information to come up with a date that they will enjoy and appreciate.


If they like staying inside, you can watch a movie on the TV instead of going out.
If they like to party, you can take them to the club or bar.
If they are interested in theater, you can search for shows coming up in your area.

, Once you feel comfortable and confident asking them out, give them a call on the phone or talk to them in person. Don't build up the event in your head and don't overthink your execution. This can actually create unrealistic expectations and you'll be upset if you are let down.Simply ask the person if they would like to go out with you at a particular time and date.


You can say something like, ""Hey, I know you like plays and Wicked is coming into town. Would you like to go with me next Friday?""
If they can't go because of their schedule, ask them if they can go at a different time or date.

Ask them out through a text or direct message online.,
Get a friend to ask them out for you.,
Ask for a date indirectly during a conversation.",How to Ask for a Date3," The stress of asking someone out can be too overwhelming for some people. In this case, asking someone out through a text or direct message may be easier. The downside is that they don't need to respond and technical issues could prevent them from seeing the message altogether.


In text you could write, ""Hey. I'm going to see Spiderman this weekend. Would you want to come with me?""
If they don't respond, don't obsess over it. Wait a couple of hours before sending them a follow-up text.

, If you don't have the person's contact information or are unable to ask them yourself, it's possible that you could get a mutual friend to ask for you. Contact your friend and tell them that you'd want to go on a date with the person. Tell your friend where you'd like to meet up and at what time and they can convey the message to the person that you like.


You can say something like, ""Hey, I really like Mark, but I'm too nervous to ask him out. Do you think you could ask if he'd meet up after school for me?""
Sometimes if you let a friend know that you like someone, the person that you like will reach out to you themselves if they feel the same way.

, There are a couple of methods that you can employ that will make asking the person you know out much easier. One of these is through framing the question as a suggestion.For example, you can ask, ""What are you doing this weekend?"" If they say ""Not sure"" you can say something like ""I was going to go to the movies. Would you want to come since you're not doing anything?""


You can also frame the question like it was their idea. For example, you can ask ""What's the best Mexican restaurant around here?"" If they respond, ""La Tacerquio,"" you can say, ""Sounds good. Do you want to go with me on Thursday for lunch?""

Get to know them first.,
Google them.,
Tell someone.,
Ask a friend to check in on you.,
Meet in a public place.,
Be responsible for your own transportation.,
Do not feel inclined to dress conservatively.,
Pack the appropriate items.",How to Be Safe on a First Date1," Before you ever agree to go on a first date with someone, you should know basic information about them. Not only should you have some idea of whether or not your personalities are similar or if you share overlapping hobbies, you will want to know things like what their name is, what school they go to / what they do for a living, and their age. Preferably you should have an idea of what they look like as well and contact information.


If your date does not want to give out their telephone number before asking for your own, that is considered sketchy.
Do not be lulled into a false sense of security just because you know someone; 8 out of 10 rape victims know their assailant.Have a healthy amount of skepticism: just because someone tells you something doesn't mean they couldn't be lying, particularly if it sounds too good to be true.;
, What a person tells you they're like and what they may actually be like can be two different things. A Google search of their name may bring back results on Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social media websites that may give you a better feel for what your potential date is like when they're not trying to present their best side to you., Pick a reliable friend, roommate, or family member and tell them that you're going on a date.Tell them where you're going, what time the date is supposed to start, and when it is expected to end. Tell them your date's full name, and if you have it their telephone number, give them that as well. Make sure they also have your telephone number.

, After you've given them your cell phone number for your date, ask them to please check in on you once or twice during the date with a phone call or text. Tell them that if you do not respond within two hours of a text or phone call that they should call the police.

, Never invite a stranger to your home, agree to meet them at theirs, or agree to meet at any other private place for a first meeting.The ideal first-date location should be a place that is public and where there will be many people, like a restaurant, movie theater, or a club. It is important that you not go somewhere with someone you do not know well where you could be easily isolated.


If you have another friend who is also dating who would be willing, you could try making it a double-date so that you're sure to not be alone.

, Police recommend that you never tell a date where you live early on in the dating stages.You do not want an unsuccessful date to turn into a stalking situation. Having transportation of your own means you are not dependent on them if things go south.


If you take a bus or have someone coming to pick you up from your date, that gives you an extra excuse to leave if you need it.

, Dressing conservatively does not guarantee your safety. Women get mistreated wearing sweatshirts as well as cocktail dresses, and it is not OK either way. Do not think that dressing a certain way will either protect you, or encourage untoward behavior.


People have traditionally blamed women for ""asking for it"", when sexually assaulted when wearing sexy clothing, but this is no excuse or reason.
Dress for mobility. If you have to leave a situation, or walk a block to get to the bus stop, be sure you can do so without getting blisters, tottering on too-high heels, getting frostbite, or otherwise unable to simply go if you need to.

, Make sure that you never leave for a first date without your cell phone and a wallet with cash. If you end up splitting the bill for dinner, avoiding using a credit or debit card means that you won't leave behind a paper trail that could link you to your workplace or home address.You will need your cell phone to send and receive texts and phone calls, and it may be handy in case of an emergency.


Although some people may feel they are unnecessary, bringing mace and/or a rape whistle on the off chance your date turns violent could prevent you from becoming a victim, and should be very seriously considered.

Ask her out.,
Don't feel like you have to be brilliant or novel-worthy to catch the eye of your brainy beauty.",How to Make a Smart Girl Fall for You (Teen Boys)," Smart girls, like most girls, know their way around appearances, so they know when you aren't taking care of yourself. And more often than not, dirtiness is associated with sloppiness and an apathy, or carelessness, about the way you look. That is not appealing.


Like any girl, she isn't going to be drawn to a gross guy. Clean up your act to attract any girl: shower about every day and take the time to find clothes that fit properly.;
, She wants her guy to impress her with knowledge, not fashion.

, You know the saying ""fake it 'till you make it""? This is where it comes into play. The importance of good speech cannot be overstated when attempting to impress a clever girl. Often people judge your intelligence based on how you speak. I'm not talking about using really fancy words, but just thinking before you talk. Phrasing your sentences properly and trying


It can also risk a huge turn-off. Particularly in written text, now what you're doing. There is nothing hotter than a guy who knows his way around a semi-colon. Don't use internet slang or abbreviate your words.
Avoid using words like ""ain't"" and ""sup"".

, This is where you make your move. If you've now been speaking to your girl for a while, she might have already picked up on your interest in her. That's okay, but now take it one step further. If she isn't attracted to you, she has probably already let you know. If there are no telltale signs of danger, make your move. Start small like a high-five or even a light hug. Then move on to more intimate stuff if she lets you in.


Girls like this often value physical relationships more than other girls. When they are interested in a guy it is a meeting of minds. This makes physical affection more special. Some smart girls may not be comfortable with physical touch. In a world of education, there's not a lot of experience with touch.

, Make it known throughout the lands. Do it face to face, forget social media or a text. Gather your guts and ask her in a romantic way. These ladies have been reading fairy tales since they were little girls. They dreamed of Prince Charming and roses. They're much harder to sweep off their feet when they've grown up with standards like Sir Lancelot and Mr. Darcy. Make it charming and meaningful.

, The most desirable thing for any guy to be is cheerful, charming, and confident.


Smart girls know when you're lying or nervous or mean. The key to making her happy is to be completely upfront about yourself. She is understanding of real life and flaws.
Be happy with yourself and she will be happy with you.

Go in for the 'kill'.",How to Improve Your Odds of Hooking Up," Mother of all virtues, it does not go amiss when trying to find your significant other for the night (or longer). The key to this guide is accepting that it is a process that cannot be breezed through, but demands a certain amount of luck and thus a high amount of waiting.;
, As opposed to uttering some lame pick-up line, where the aim becomes apparent immediately, the best way is to 'coincidentally' find yourself in a situation which you both experience emotionally the same way. For example when you both are waiting at the bar for that barman who takes an eternity to serve you. Now that's a conversation starter and moreover, doesn't come across as a predatory comment.

, Although this seems like a script, real-life seldom is. You now have your drinks and are chatting effortlessly and you already feel like you won. Naturally, you start planning your next move. Problem is, you turn around for a second and some other guy takes advantage and starts talking to the object of your current desires. Keep calm, accept that not everything can be planned. Navigate through the rocks as best as you can but know that uncertainty is part of the game.

, Remember: you do not want to come across as some sex-starved fool who will do anything for a quickie. Talk to her but not to much. If she leaves, don't follow her around. Let her go her way and bump into her later. Better yet, leave first and go talk to your friends or, for the daring ones, to another woman. The more you run after a woman, the less she wants you. Basic principle of offer and demand.

, This guide assumes you want to look more than the average Joe. be nice, be a gentleman. Make everything appear natural as if you were not on the prowl but had found yourself in that situation by chance, while all you wanted was to get a drink and join your friends.

, It is now late and you are still talking with your 'date'. If she hasn't left at this point, you're pretty much in the end zone. The little secret is pauses. While she talks to you, let your glaze drift in the distance and look like you are suddenly taken aback for a moment, to some other memories. Women love mystery, they crave it, it's biology. The fact that you will not give her your full attention will make her doubt about her self, thus lowering her self-esteem, thus making an already easy task a child's play.

, The last point is the only leap you will take throughout the whole process: at some point, a relatively small window of opportunity will open where you will be able to kiss her. Do it before, you're out, do it after, you're out. Defining the perfect moment is a skill that needs to be honed over and over again but once you have it, the prize is yours.

Be Yourself.",How to Have Every Guy in School Be Interested in You," Take a shower every day, and wash your hair every day, every other day, or every week depending on your hair type. You do NOT want your hair to look greasy- no guy will want that. Make sure your eyebrows are always in shape, and that you always use deodorant. No guy would be interested in a girl that just lets herself go.;
, This means wearing makeup if you're old enough, if you need it. Now, most guys would not want a girl with clown makeup caked on her face. What you should use is concealer, face powder, mascara, light blush, light lip gloss, maybe simple eyeshadow and if you're good, eyeliner. You do NOT want your makeup to be center of attention, and this is a common mistake for girls to make- they think that experimenting with different colored eye shadows and weird glittery stuff is attractive for every day- maybe for special events, but not every day. The thing about guys is, they find it weird if your face looks different some days. So lets say you wear eyeliner, dark eyeshadow, bronzer, and red lipstick one day, and then wear just some light mascara and blush the next. Guys don't like that. Stick with the same basic look every day and try to just wear enough makeup to keep yourself looking fresh. If you can do that without it, do it. But don't always wear the EXACT same style or you won't be visually interesting.

, If you walk up and talk with a guy, do you think he would prefer you kind of putting your head down with your hands in your pockets and mumbling your words, or smiling, keeping good posture and looking like you like yourself? The thing is, subconsciously, guys think that if you don't like yourself, why should they like you?

, Don't go up to every guy and all out flirting with them, but kind of be friendly and sweet to every guy and do little things like touch their arms and laugh at their jokes. They love this. And it leaves them wanting more of you- make sure you don't go too far with each guy though, or else they'll think your weird or trying too hard.

, If a guy doesn't seem interested, then just smile and say, ""Well see you around then?"" And go talk to someone else. Hold conversations with guys about anything- the stupid teacher, music, whatever. Try to steer clear of religion or politics, because it can either be boring to him or you could offend him.

, Be kind, respect others so that they respect you, and always have polite manners.

, This sounds stupid, but it works. If a guy looks down, just say ""Hey, cheer up! Does someone need a hug?"" And smile. If he's a jerk and rejects you, make a joke out of it instead of getting offended or looking flustered. Just say, ""Well then, be that way! But when you do need a hug, don't come crying to me."" And kind of laugh and smile, to let him know you don't let small things get to you. He's probably not worth your time anyway, but still.

, This makes you look like every standard girl in the school if you have a reputation of talking about people. You have to seem laid back enough to chill with the guys.

, Be calm and cool enough to hang out with the boys, but you can't turn into a tomboy that's only interested in football and video games. You have to dress and act feminine while still being cool and collected.

, Don't dress sloppy or too dressy everyday. Maybe a cute tank top with a cardigan, jeans and cute shoes is my every day look. You can also go with a cute tee, jeans, boots, and a fashion scarf. The point is, you have to look casual while still being girly. You don't have to have lots of money to do this.

, This sounds like the cheesiest thing in the world, right? But it's true. You can't go on as someone you're not forever. Just be who you are while still keeping a level of maturity.

Courtesy-text your friend.,
Ask good questions.,
Be assertive.,
Watch out for disturbing behavior.,
Trust your instincts.,
Stay sober.,
Don't leave your drink unattended.,
Be prepared to split.",How to Be Safe on a First Date2," Make sure that you respond to your friend that you asked to make sure you're okay. You don't want them to become falsely alarmed! Additionally, you can text them when you're arriving to the location, when you're leaving, and when you make it safely back home. It would also be polite to let them know if your date is going long.

, While you're on your date, of course you will have the opportunity to talk and get to know each other better. Don't waste this opportunity with small talk about the weather or your food. Use it to ask meaningful questions, like if they have any close friends, what their family was like growing up, and what their current most important goal is.Questions like these will reveal to you what kinds of values and mindset your date has, and give you greater insight as to whether this is someone you'd be interested in continuing to see.

, Only you can determine for yourself what you are comfortable with, whether it's if you want to move on to a more intimate setting, reveal more detailed information about yourself, or engage in sexual activities. If your date starts to pressure you for things you are not ready to do, don't feel like you have to give in to their desires. Just tell them a polite but firm no.


A good partner will not be impatient and will respect your boundaries and opinions.
Someone who continues to pressure you after you have said 'no' is putting off a very strong red flag.

, Listen to the things that your date is saying and be on the look-out for warning signs.A date is the time for a person to be putting their best foot forward to impress you, and their behaviors will only become more relaxed with time. If they are behaving in ways that make you uncomfortable or anxious, this will probably not improve over time.


They show up inappropriately angry or in a bad mood, which may or may not become directed toward you.
They treat the waitstaff, employees, or strangers at any place where you meet poorly or aggressively.
They refer to their exes or members of the opposite sex using derogatory language, or call them ""crazy.""
They insult you or put you down.
They tell you information that directly contradicts things they've told you previously, ie: it looks like they're lying to you.
They make strange comments that seem out of place, like talking about their machete collection or punching exes.They ask questions about your or offer details about their sexual or marital history that seems inappropriate for a first date.
They start making explicitly sexual comments or advances, or reveal their genitalia in public places.

, Your brain has a way of trying to communicate with you when it recognizes logically that something dangerous or unsafe is happening by manipulating how you feel; we often call these feelings ""gut instincts."" When your brain registers that something unsafe is happening, it will create feelings of unease and tension in your stomach.Do not be afraid to listen to these feelings!


Do not fall into the trap of feeling like you have to explain away or excuse a date's bad or strange behavior.

, There's nothing wrong with going out for a drink, but it's generally inadvisable to get drunk. Drinking leads to lowered inhibitions, the reduced ability to assess risks and make good choices, impedes the ability to give consent, and makes it harder to fight back should someone try to sexually assault you.It can also lead people to being aggressors of sexual assault.

, Regardless of what you are drinking, whether it's alcohol or water, do not leave your glass unattended, even to use the restroom. GHB, Ketamine, and Rohypnol are all fast-acting drugs commonly referred to as ""date rape drugs"" that can be slipped into a beverage without you ever knowing it.Only accept drinks directly from a bartender or waiter; don't even let it pass through your date's hands.


If you leave for the restroom and come back and forgot to finish your drink off before-hand, ask for a new one. If your date has a problem with that, the issue is with them, not you.

, Although it would be nice to be honest if you're not into a person or not feeling safe with them, it is impossible to tell how someone may react to hearing that kind of statement. Particularly if you're feeling unsafe, there may be good reason for that, and you don't want them to react violently. So have some reason prepared for just-in-case, and don't be afraid to use it!


If you arrived by public transportation, you could say that you have to leave to catch the bus.
If your friend drove you, say that they have to pick you up early because they had a schedule conflict on their end.
Get your friend to text you about a sick pet or a breakup and say that you're needed elsewhere.

Leave.,
Get assistance.,
Fight back.,
Get somewhere safe.,
Call 9-1-1.",How to Be Safe on a First Date3," If your date appears to violent, emotionally unstable, or makes you uncomfortable for any reason, it is okay to leave. Use any of the excuses that you have prepared and get out of there.


If you are truly desperate and don't want them to know you're leaving, tell them you're going to the bathroom and take any personal items with you, then sneak out another way.

, If your date tries to prevent you from leaving, physically or through verbal coercion, get someone nearby to help you, like a waiter or another couple. This could be as simple as asking them to get the manager or call the police, but the point is that by drawing other people into the situation, an aggressive person is more likely to back off out of a desire to not get into trouble.


Get loud. Although embarrassment might make you want to keep quiet and not make a spectacle, it is to your advantage to be loud and make sure other people can hear that you are not interested in this person's advances or company. This may convince people, without your solicitation, to come help you.

, If for some reason you should be cornered and there is no way to avoid violence, use proper self defense techniques to make your assailant back off. If you have it with you, using mace is perhaps the easiest method. When attacking, aim for the areas of the body where you can do the most damage in the least amount of time; these include the eyes, nose, ears, neck, knees, and groin.Kick the side of the knee to injure or even incapacitate an attacker.
Gouge, poke, or scratch an attacker's eyes with your fingers or knuckles.
If your attacker is very close to you, user the heel of your palm to strike the under portion of their nose, throwing the whole weight of your body into the motion.
The goal of attacking your attacker is not to beat them up but to prevent them from following you and, in the case that they are holding you, make them let go.

, Once your attacker lets go, run away, preferably in the opposite direction. If your attacker recovers and gets a hold of you after being hurt, they will likely be very angry, so the situation will be even more dangerous for you. Go somewhere where there are a lot of people, or get into your car to drive away.


Do not immediately go back home. Should this person be capable of following you, you do not want to accidentally show them where you live.

, If you have been attacked, this is considered an emergency situation. You will want to call 9-1-1 so that police can be dispatched to help you and, if necessary, make an arrest. Be prepared that when you contact the emergency operator you will need to try to tell them exactly what happened, where it happened, and where you are now.Stay on the line. A sudden disconnect could mean that something has gone very wrong for you, and the operator will try to call you back. This could delay emergency response time and tie up the lines, so be sure to stay on the line until you are told you can hang up.

Pick up a new hobby together.",How to Be the Cutest Couple Ever (for Teens and Tweens)1," Going out together provides a fun way to spend time together outside of school, and an added bonus is that you may be seen by classmates. Go to the park and walk, play sports, or play on the playground like you did as kids. Go to museums and learn new things together.Whether or not you can drive and if you have any money to spend will determine the range of dates you can go on together. Going to a fancy dinner can be fun but may not be practical.;
, Working out or playing sports together gives you a new way to be together besides hanging out at home or school. If your school has a fitness center, work out as a couple after school. Play co-ed intramurals or on club sports teams outside of school.Being active together can be as simple as walking or shooting baskets at the park.
When people see that you care about your health and you enjoy exercising together, they will see your cuteness in a new way.

, When you show up to a bonfire or weekly social event, stick together and mingle with the other guests as a couple. Rather than separating to find your own friends, sticking together shows you can still be a couple in a group of people.Visit groups of each person’s friends so that you both still get to talk to who you want to.
It’s okay to split up and get a little alone time, but when you stay together it is easier for people to see how cute you are.

, Hobbies give you a chance to do something fun and bond through that activity. Your communication will improve because talking during an activity is easier than sitting face to face. Telling people you took a dance class together or hiked the local national park will impress them.Do winter sports like skiing, snowboarding or snowmobiling. Take an art class at the community center. Go to a martial arts studio and practice self defense together.
You don’t necessarily have to start a new hobby. Find something that you both like doing and do it together instead of separately.

Hold hands in public.,
Use special nicknames in front of other people.,
Hug each other often.,
Pass notes at school.",How to Be the Cutest Couple Ever (for Teens and Tweens)2," Hold hands while you walk through the halls at school. Hold hands while you sit at sporting events. Sit by each other on the bus and hold hands while you ride. Anytime you are around your friends or in public, hold hands so people know you are a couple.


Holding hands can be an exciting step in the early stages of a relationship. In middle school and high school, people who are holding hands are almost always seen as a couple.

, Come up with cute nicknames that reveal something about your relationship. Use these names when you are calling to each other across the room or when you talk on the phone.Nicknames can be simple like sweetie, pumpkin, honeybunch, or love. Make your nicknames more specific by incorporating your real names. For example, on How I Met Your Mother, Marshall and Lily call each other Marshmallow and Lilypad.

, When you first see each other in the morning, make a habit of giving each other a big, long hug. People will start to notice this as your morning routine. Hug each other in between class and anytime you leave each other for the day.Go out of your way to hug each other and let people see you hugging. Hug each other for longer than you ever hug someone who is just a friend.

, Pass notes when you see each other in the hall. Reading them will entertain you during class. Find sneaky ways to pass your notes during class, like rolling the note up and putting it inside a pen. Put a note in a gum wrapper and pass it.You might get caught, so don’t include anything too private in your notes. If the teacher catches you and reads your note, you might be embarrassed if you write secrets.

Trading clothing with your name on it is a great way to be a cute couple. Trade clothing even if it doesn’t have your name on it. You’ll feel closer to each other and people will notice.


If you are very different in size, this may not always work. Small people can wear big clothes, but big people in small clothes might look silly rather than cute. If you want to wear your partner’s clothes, even if they are tight, though, go for it.

, When the school semester is dragging on, or you are bored in the hot days of summer, pick out each other’s clothes and wear what your partner chooses. Have fun styling each other in fancy or silly outfits. Make each other look good and increase your cuteness as a couple.Pick a theme for each day like what you’d wear to a fancy dinner, how’d you dress on a day off, or an unfashionable, mismatched outfit for something silly.
Make a deal that you have to wear whatever you pick out for each other. Be sure to tell people that you styled each other that week.

, Any chance you get to wear a costume is a perfect opportunity to match. Select a famous character couple from a book, TV, or movie. Dress up as different versions of the same character or theme. Be sure it’s obvious that your costumes go together.Look at costumes that people have already designed or come up with an original idea and design it yourself.
For example, you could dress up as Ash and Pikachu from Pokemon, Red Riding Hood and the Wolf, or a slice of pizza and the pizza delivery guy.

, Look through each other’s closets and find outfits that match. If you have the exact same shirt, like from a club or sports team, this always works. Choose similar color schemes or patterns that make you look great together.The main goal is to be on the same level of fanciness in your attire. If one person wears a nice dress and the other wears sweatpants, it’s not really matching.
Wear jeans and flannels, your fanciest outfit, or matching tracksuits.

Kiss him when you pass each other, but let him eat lunch with his friends sometimes. This is especially true if you are a new young girl dating an upperclassmen boy.;
, If your boyfriend isn't the type to pack lunch, boys usually aren't, save him a few dollars by packing some of your mom's leftovers from the night before or making some fresh food for lunch or breakfast by waking up a little earlier. This will be highly appreciated.

, If your boyfriend's in sports, don't overwhelm him with complicated text messages when he gets home from practice. Do the same if your boyfriend's in an academic team or club, attend events and watch his games.

, If you're lucky enough to attend the same high school as your boyfriend, don't let him let go of his grades. Encourage him. Help him if he needs it. If he needs a day off school, don't nag him for it, let him be and encourage him to go back in the next day.

, If you know some students who are office aides, buy him his favorite drink and write a note and have it delivered if you can't deliver it yourself. Hug him warmly in the halls.

, If he introduces you to his friends, be cool around them, but do not flirt with them. If he wants you to meet his favorite teacher, do so respectfully. If he has younger siblings, look out for them and help them if they need it.

Think about the things that they like and try to find gifts that fit within that. You might have to do some snooping around with their friends or family to find out what they like.


Stuck for ideas? Make your own! Duct tape roses, a jar of love notes and baked goods are all great examples of personal gifts that don’t cost very much. They’ll appreciate the work you put into your gift., Pay attention to the little things to show that you care! If they get a new haircut, tell them it looks great. If they’ve got a new outfit on, they’re probably hoping that you’ll notice it. Mention these things when you notice them and always in a nice way.


If complimenting a haircut, think about specifics, like “I like what you did with your bangs.”
When you want to compliment an outfit, try saying things like “I love that color on you” or “I love that skirt.”, They’ve probably had their friends longer than they’ve been your partner, and there’s a good reason they’ve chosen to keep them around.

If their friends are mean or taking advantage of your partner, then you should talk about it with an adult., Your partner might think you don’t care about their feelings, or about the relationship!

Consider the importance of the occasion.,
Weigh romantic versus practical gifts.,
Avoid novelty gifts.,
Base your choice on his interests.,
Pay attention to your boyfriend's needs.The process of getting your boyfriend a gift can begin months before you actually buy it.,
Ask his friends for advice.,
Consider something unpredictable.,
Make sure the gift is high-quality.In most cases, you'll have a selection to choose from.,
Buy an experience instead of an item.As a way to protest materialism and enrich the experience of life, many people have shifted away from traditional gift-giving and turned instead to buying experiences for their loved ones.,
Choose something that recalls a shared memory.,
Emphasize thoughtfulness over expense.The ultimate value of the gift you'll be giving lies in the thought you've invested in it.,
Create something yourself.",How to Buy a Gift for Your Boyfriend2," Not all occasions are created equally. A six month relationship milestone isn't nearly as impossible as a one year, for example. Generally speaking, you should have a good understanding how important a gift-giving occasion will be to your boyfriend. The size and value of your gift should roughly correlate with that.


Keep in mind that you don't need an occasion to make it worth giving a gift. Gifts are always welcome, and never mean anything less if you give them spontaneously.

, There are different sorts of gift you could give to a boyfriend. they will have different effects and suit different occasions. Romantic gifts are a primarily symbolic gesture of your love, whereas practical gifts are something with real value and use. Whether you choose one over the other should depend on the occasion, the relationship and the boyfriend's tastes.Romantic gifts include roses, heartfelt letters and wine. They're good for romantic occasions like an anniversary of Valentine's Day.
Practical gifts are things that have real use. These range from socks to entertainment like video games. They're not romantic gifts in the traditional sense, but the gifts are arguably more appreciated in the long run than something purely romantic. Practical gifts don't require a specific occasion, but they are well suited to birthdays and Christmas.

, Novelty gifts are a fun thing to give at parties, but the effect is very short-lasted. These are usually best-suited for friendship relationships. Novelty gifts (like an intentionally ugly sweater) will make the two of you laugh, but it won't feel romantic, and the use won't extend far past the time you give it.

, If you're trying to purchase a gift for someone, you should first attend to that person's main interests. Maybe your boyfriend loves sports or music the most. Maybe he's a reading sort, or obsessed with the outdoors. It is most likely you already have an in-depth knowledge of what your boyfriend is interested in. Take advantage of that knowledge, and let it guide you towards a gift.


For instance, if your boyfriend is into sports, you can buy a signed collector's jersey from his favourite team.
As another example, if your boyfriend loves orthodox black metal, you might consider ordering a Deathspell Omega vinyl or some merch from Europe.

, Over the course of your usual conversations, he'll probably off-handedly remark about some things he wants or needs in the near future. Keeping your ears peeled and buying something he says he wants is a sneaky way of getting your boyfriend to do the decision work himself. What's more, the fact that you'll have listened so intently to what he says will make you seem like an even sweeter girlfriend.

, If your boyfriend has close friends, they might have a fresh perspective on the things he's most interested in at the moment. Talking to them about it when your boyfriend's not around could offer some insight into what you'll ultimately be getting him. Even if they haven't heard anything from him directly, they may be able to offer suggestions as to suitable gifts. Brainstorming with other people who know your boyfriend can be very helpful if you're having trouble thinking of a gift.


Although his friends should be onboard with you if you're intending this to be a surprise gift, you should nonetheless steer clear of friends you think might spoil the surprise in advance.

, One of the factors of a great gift is the element of surprise. If your boyfriend knows exactly what you're going to get for him in advance, it won't feel as special.With that in mind, try striking a balance between unpredictability and desirability. At the end of the day, it's more important that your boyfriend actually likes what you get him, but the surprise factor will make the gift-giving that much more enjoyable for the both of you.

, If you're buying a gift, you're trying to show someone that you care about them. If you know generally what you want to get, aim for a higher-quality item. This often (but not always) lines up with the price of the item. In the age of the internet, it's pretty easy to look up a gift and see how much someone spent on it compared to other products.


Check online reviews to get a good idea of the product's quality..

, Instead of a storebought item, for example, you could buy your boyfriend a ticket to his favourite progressive rock band performing live.


Get yourself a ticket as well to turn the gift into the opportunity for a shared experience., As a couple, it's likely that you'll have many inside jokes and concepts that are only known to the two of you. Some of the most significant gifts you can give to someone in a romantic pairing are gifts that somehow symbolize your history together. This can take some creativity to properly work out, but if you're simply browsing gifts, you might find one that reminds you of your relationship somehow.


For example, if the two of you first met at the zoo in the African Safari section, a plush Lion would represent much more than a cushioned toy. It would be an acknowledgement of your origins as a couple.

, Though you shouldn't be afraid to spend the extra dollar on a truly memorable gift, it's important to remember that there are more important things at stake than the item you're picking up for him. The connection the two of you share is priceless. The gift is meant to be a reflection of that.

, Gifts don't necessarily need to be purchased. In some cases, it can feel even more thoughtful if you make something yourself. If you have a talent like art or music, you can use it to your advantage. Write a song for your boyfriend and present it to him. Draw him a portrait.These gifts are usually the cheapest, but they're also some of the most heartfelt and meaningful.

Compare prices.,
Accommodate for shipping times if you're shopping online.,
Order or purchase your gift.,
Prepare or wrap the gift.Although wrapping is sometimes seen as an unnecessary add-on, the time it takes to unwrap the gift adds to the suspense, making the gift-giving more enjoyable for both you and your boyfriend.,
Store it somewhere secret.Keeping a gift hidden until you're ready to present it to your boyfriend can be easy or difficult, depending on your living situation.",How to Buy a Gift for Your Boyfriend3," Although you shouldn't let yourself worry too much about the expense of a gift, it can't hurt to see if and where you can get a deal on the gift you've chosen to purchase. If it's a fairly common item, you'll probably have an option of a few different stores near you. Although prices for some items are standardized, there's always a possibility that one store will have some sort of edge over the others. Checking to compare prices of stores or online marketplaces doesn't take long to do, and you could end up saving yourself some money by doing so.


You can sometimes take advantage of great sales. Certain sales, like Black Friday or Cyber Monday, offer major discounts on items., If you're buying this gift for a particular date, such as a birthday or anniversary, it stands to reason that you'll need the gift ready on the day of, and preferably at least a few days before that. Much postage takes 1-2 weeks to get a package on your doorstep. You should take this delay into consideration when you make your purchase. Due to unforeseen issues with the postal service, it's a good idea to give yourself at least a week's leeway.


If your boyfriend lives with you, you should consider the risk that he may be the one to see the package on your doorstep before you. If this is a risk you should have the package shipped somewhere else like a friend's place.

, Whether you're going to a store or buying the gift online, there will come a moment of truth where you hand over your money and get the gift. Although it's most likely your boyfriend will love the gift you bought for him, it's always good form to ask for a gift receipt. That way, if for whatever reason your boyfriend would prefer something else, he can get store credit instead.


Online purchases will take at least a week to arrive on your doorstep.

,


You can put your gift in an envelope as well if it's fairly small.

, If you live with your boyfriend in a fairly small apartment for instance, it might be tough to find a place where he is sure not to look. Inconspicuous places like the backs of kitchen cupboards and cleaning supply closets can be great for hiding the gift until the time is right.


If you think it's going to be enough of an issue to hide it, you can always hide it somewhere away from home, such as your parents' home or a friend's place.

Let them know you’re thinking about them.,
Listen to them.,
Forget about winning arguments.,
Give your partner their space.",How to Be a Good Boyfriend in Middle School2," Don’t be afraid of being random! It can be when you wake up, before you go to bed or when you’re doing homework. People love to know that they matter to someone else!

They may want your opinion, or just want to know that you care about what bothers them. You don’t need to listen like they’re your teacher and you’re taking notes for the test, but pay attention. Ask questions and comment sometimes to show that you’re listening.


If they’re talking about a problem with a friend, you can ask questions about their history, or their motivations.
General comments, like “I can’t believe it!”, “Tell me more about that” and “I see” show that you’re listening., That’s not to say that you should always agree with what they say, but you shouldn’t be trying to win. Be nice, and always try to fix the problem instead of just wanting to be the one who’s right. This shows that you’re mature and care more about fixing a problem than just winning.


A common argument in middle school is how often you see your partner. Instead of trying to just get what you want, try to find a middle ground that works for both of you., It’s easy, especially in a new relationship, to want to spend as much time with your partner as possible. You have to try and let your partner do their own thing. Strike a balance between letting your partner enjoy their hobbies without you and getting some quality time together.

Take a pottery class together.,
Make a book of all of the emails you've written to each other.",How to Be Romantic with Your Boyfriend1," Your boyfriend would expect you to write ""I love you"" at the end of a letter or a text message, but he won't expect to see it written in the steam after his shower, in the hot sauce on his morning omelet, or on a blank page of his notebook that he sees when he's about to take notes for class. Finding a creative and unique place to write ""I love you"" will make him think even more fondly of you when you're not there, and will make him feel more romantic because you've made a special effort to let him know that you care.


Just doing this once or twice a month can really show your boyfriend that you care. You don't have to overdo it.;
, This can be a CD that reminds him of ""your songs"" or one that really takes his musical tastes into account and is a mix of things you actually think he likes.

When he turns on the car, he'll get a pleasant surprise.


Make sure you know what music he listens to, what music he already owns, and what he likes before you go and do this.

, Put together a scrapbook of all of your most meaningful memories.

Keep it a surprise.Presents are best if the other person doesn't know what it is yet.,
Include a romantic letter or card.Even if you're not a particularly skilled writer, there's a certain beauty in trying to describe your feelings for your significant other on paper.,
Wait for a special moment.You want to present your gift at a point where the two of you are relaxed and things are pleasant.,

Sweeten the deal by getting romantic.",How to Buy a Gift for Your Boyfriend4," There's a certain pleasure in having something kept a surprise, both for the person giving and the gift's receiver. It may be tempting to tell your boyfriend about the awesome gift you got him, but its well worth it to stay silent until the moment of truth.

, It doesn't have to be anything special. Write something about what the gift is supposed to mean (your love for him, for instance) and how much you care about him. Even if you say these things all the time to him, it will feel really special to see it written down as such.

, A gift-giving shouldn't be rushed at all, and there shouldn't be anything else on the go when you give it. For this sake, it is recommended that a gift be presented following a meal.

, You should tell your boyfriend to wait while you go get the present from wherever your stored it. Making him wait while you retrieve it will increase the suspense on his part, and might make it more fun for you if he keeps trying to guess what it is you purchased for him.

, Hand over the gift you bought for your boyfriend. In most cases, your boyfriend should respond very warmly to the gesture. The way you give it should be fairly simple. If you want, you can say something like ""This is for you"" as you deliver it over. From there, you'll be able to watch him unwrap the gift and gauge his reaction.

Be there for her.",How to Be a Good Boyfriend As a Teen," If you want to be a good boyfriend as a teen, then you have to learn to be honest with your girlfriend. This doesn't mean that you have to tell her every thought that runs through your head, but it does mean that you should be able to tell her if you're in a bad mood, if you're upset because you did poorly on the math test, or that you wish she wouldn't call you every five minutes.


Part of honesty is tact. If you have to be honest about something you wish she did or didn't do, tell her in a kind and sympathetic way so she doesn't get mad at you.
Don't pretend that you never had another girlfriend if you did. You don't have to go into all the details with your girlfriend, but you shouldn't lie about your past.
You don't have to tell your girlfriend everything -- for example, if you think the girl in your gym class is cute, you can just keep that to yourself.
If she finds out that you've been dishonest, that will break her trust very quickly.;
, Part of growing up and being a good boyfriend, as well as being a good son and friend, is learning that you can't always get what you want. You may want to see the new Bond movie with your friends, but she may really want to have a date night -- you have to learn how to pick your battles and how to make sure that both people in the relationship are happy.


Remember that it's better to be happy than right. If you think your girlfriend really wants something while you just kind of want it, let her get her way.
Be mature. If you and your girlfriend are arguing about something, sit down and make a list of all the pros and cons of each decision. That can help you both get perspective on the situation.
Make sure that both people are compromising. It's not a real compromise if you always end up getting your way, or if your girlfriend always ends up getting what she wants.
Learn to take turns. Maybe you can pick the dinner place tonight, but she can pick the movie tomorrow.

, Part of being a master communicator is learning to say you're sorry if you made a mistake. You may think that admitting you're wrong will only make you look worse, but quite the contrary is true. If you acknowledge that you've made a mistake and even apologize by giving the girl flowers or a sweet note, she'll like you much more than if you ignore the fact that you did something wrong and hope she'll get over it.


It's not easy to say you're sorry -- it can be very humiliating or embarrassing. But if you get into the habit of apologizing when you've done something wrong, it will feel much more natural.
When you say you're sorry, you should sound like you mean it. Sit down, look into your girlfriend's eyes, and even take her hands if you need to. This will show her that you're making time to apologize. If you just mutter the word ""Sorry"" as you pass by, or apologize in a text message, she won't take you seriously.

, It's important to have disagreements from time to time and to work together to find a solution to the problem, but constantly fighting for no reason and with little provocation is a quick way to ruin your relationship. Teenage couples are prone to fighting a lot because they don't have a lot of experience compromising or having serious discussions with people they're romantically involved with, and this does take practice.


Whenever you find yourself raising your voice or even shouting, just calm down and take a few deep breaths. You won't resolve anything if you're feeling emotional or heated.
If you think your girlfriend is starting a lot of fights, communicate about why this is happening and how it can be changed.
If you're kind of annoyed about something minor and have the urge to pick a fight, ask yourself if it's really worth it.
Don't let your anger build up -- if you're really mad about something, it's better to communicate about it than to avoid the topic and wait for weeks until so much anger has built up that you feel like fighting.

, Some teenage girls are prone to mood swings because of their raging hormones, and because of the natural confusion that comes with growing up. If you want to be a good boyfriend, then you have to be attentive to her moods and to understand when she's feeling happy or when she's annoyed or even upset. She may be trying to hide her moods, but as you get to know her better, you should understand how she's really feeling.


If she's clearly upset about something, you can ask her to open up about why. If she doesn't want to talk about it, don't push it or keep asking about it, or she'll feel much worse.
If she's sad, give her some love and affection. Ask if she wants to stay in instead of going out, or how she feels like dealing with her mood. She may want to be left alone, or she may just want to snuggle with you.
Don't say, ""I can tell you're in a bad mood."" Instead, say, ""Is something wrong? I'm worried that you're upset. Talk to me."" If you accuse her of being in a bad mood, she may get annoyed and defensive.

, If you really want to be a good boyfriend, then you should be attentive to her needs. Maybe she's really busy during lunch because she has to cram for her Spanish exam -- offer to buy her lunch in the lunch line while she studies. If she stays home sick, offer to pick up her homework from her teachers.


If she needs a ride somewhere, offer to give her one if you can drive.
If she needs help, she may not admit it right away, so be attentive and see if there's anything you can do.
Make sure there's a balance. If you do favors for her, she should help you out, too. If it's a one-way street, then she may be taking advantage of you.

, You should recognize that your girlfriend is her own person and that you should support her as she tries to reach her goals as well as when she deals with any conflict in her life. Here are some ways to be supportive:


If you know she has a big test coming up, then you should either give her space to study or help her if you can.
If she's really passionate about soccer, tennis, or some other school sport, then you should cheer her on the sidelines during her big games.
If she's going through some trouble at home, make sure to be extra attentive and to ask if there's anything you can do. And if she doesn't want to talk about it, she doesn't want to talk about it.
Ask about her interests. If you know she's passionate about painting or playing the violin, support her by letting her talk about these interests and sharing how much they mean to her.

, It's very important to be attentive to your girlfriend, and it's also key to pay attention to her friends. Friends can make or break teenage relationships, and if her friends love you, they'll tell her how lucky she is to have found an amazing guy like you. But if they don't like you because you're rude or ignore them, they'll tell her that you're a jerk and may even convince her that she can do better and that she should break up with you ASAP.


Be friendly to her friends. Say hi, even if your girlfriend isn't around, and ask them how they're doing. You can even talk to them about their interests and get to know them a bit.
Don't ignore them. If you approach your girlfriend when she's with a group of friends, make sure to greet them when you do.
Don't tell your girlfriend that you don't like her friends. Even if they're a little annoying, they mean a lot to her, and if you admit this, you'll be making a rift in your relationship.

, This is an important point. If your girlfriend is hanging out with you and your buddies, or even if you're hanging out in a group surrounded by all of your friends, you should still pay attention to her and let her know that she's important to you. Don't ditch her as soon as your friends show up, or she'll start to feel like a burden or like a last priority.


If you two are hanging out with your friends, you should sit next to her and include her in the conversation. Don't leave her hanging.
Help your friends get to know her. If your friends are shy or awkward around your girlfriend, it'll be hard to have a good time. Bring up some common interests for your friends and your girlfriend to talk about.

, If you want to be a good boyfriend, you should be attentive to your appearance. You don't have to look like a teenage pop star to show your girlfriend that you care about how you look when you're around her. Just shower regularly, shave if that's what you normally do, and wear flattering, well-fitting, and unwrinkled clothes.


If you look sloppy around her, she'll think that she's not important to you.
It's important to look nice, especially before you pick her up on a date. Show her that she's worth the effort it takes to look nice.

, Though it may be hard to be a gentleman when you're a teenager, you should try to treat your girlfriend with respect as much as you can. Part of being a gentleman means being attentive to your girlfriend's needs, from opening the door for her or her friends to hanging up her coat if she comes over.


If you pick her up, open the car door for her.
Let her walk into a room first, before you.
If she looks cold, offer her your coat.
If you take her out to dinner, pull out her chair for her to sit down.

, If you really want to be attentive, then you should notice when your girlfriend wants to be left alone. Space and privacy are necessary for every healthy relationship, so don't be put off if it seems like your girlfriend wants a night to herself or even a night with the girls. If you're always around, then your relationship may be becoming too intense. Take some time apart from your girlfriend so you have time to gain perspective and realize how much you miss each other.


If you're always around, then she may start to feel that you're controlling or domineering. Let her do her own thing.
If she wants to be alone, be cool with it. If you look upset or hurt, she'll think you're insecure.
Leave some room in her schedule. Don't try to plan your weekends so you're together every second and don't have time for your families or other friends.

, It's natural if you feel a bit shy about complimenting your girlfriend. If you're a teen, then this may be your first, or one of your first relationships, and you may feel awkward about telling your girlfriend that she looks nice or for complimenting her outfit, but you should get into the habit of complimenting her. This will let her know that you like her and notice her, and that she means a lot to you.


You should compliment her even more if she gets a new haircut or wears a new outfit.
You can tell her she looks pretty whenever you want to -- it doesn't have to be only when she's all dressed up. If she looks cute in a tank top and a pair of casual shorts, let her know.
You don't have to overdo it -- just make sure to compliment her at least once every time you see her.
You don't only have to compliment her looks -- you can compliment an aspect of her personality, like her amazing sense of humor, or you can tell her that she's an amazing gymnast or that she's great at French.

, If you want to be affectionate, you should put your arm around your girlfriend from time to time, hold hands, or even give her a quick kiss when you see her. You don't have to overwhelm her or put your hands all over her whenever you see her, but you should give her some sign that you like being around her, even if it's just a gentle squeeze on the hand after class.



Learn to cuddle. Spend some time hugging her, stroking her hair, or showering her with kisses. Put you arms around her waist! Girls love this, they feel protected and safe in your arms.
Only be as affectionate as she wants you to be. Don't make her feel like she's getting groped in public or like she doesn't have room to breathe.
Take it easy on the PDA (Public Display of Affection). You'll find that often, the couples that are the most comfortable with each other don't need to hold hands 24/7 or to make out in public. You can show her affection in public, but only as much as makes her comfortable.

, Do not pressure her though. It will make her very uncomfortable.


You can do this by literally asking her.
You can also try something new out whenever it seems natural, whether during a kiss or something out of the blue. But just be careful to read both her verbal reactions and her physical cues clearly, and stop if she's not comfortable.
Don't rush her! Let her work at her own pace. If she says she doesn't want to, don't keep asking, or you could jeopardize how safe she feels with you.

, Gifts are a great way to show your affection for your girlfriend, no matter how small or silly they are. If you're a teen, you probably don't have a lot of spending money, and you don't have to save up to get her a diamond necklace. Just give her a cute and silly teddy bear for Valentine's Day, a bouquet of flowers on her birthday, or tickets to the movie she wanted to see as a special treat.


It's not the actual gift that counts -- it's the gesture. A gift shows that you've taken the time to think about her.

, Sweet notes are another old-fashioned and romantic way to let your girlfriend know that you've been thinking about her. Leave them in her locker or hand them to her after school, or even at the end of a romantic date. You don't have to say much in the notes -- just tell her that you've been thinking about her and compliment something about her.


Don't leave the notes if it feels forced. But if you really want to show your affection this way, she'll love it.
You can also just text her randomly, saying things like ""I love you"" or ""Thinking of you"". This feels a little less personal than leaving notes, but it is better than nothing, especially if you're apart for a period of time and can't leave her notes.

, Part of being affectionate is making time when just the two of you can hang out, go on a date, and talk about how much you like each other -- or about nothing at all. You should try to have a ""date night"" at least once every week or two so you and your girlfriend can have time to make your relationship move forward.


You and your girlfriend can alternate picking where you'll go and what you'll do. Maybe she wants to go mini-golfing one weekend and you want to go to the beach another time.
Almost any situation can be romantic if you're alone with your girlfriend and show her lots of affection. You can have a romantic time at the county fair or even when you're watching a silly movie.
You should also make time for the guys, but don't make your girlfriend feel like she's the last priority.

, If you want to be a good boyfriend and to make your relationship last a long time, then you and your girlfriend should find some interests to pursue together. Though it may be hard to do this with your busy schedules, you should find an activity that you both like to do, like playing tennis together on weekends, or trying every sushi restaurant in town.


You can even find a new TV show that you're both addicted to.
It doesn't matter what you do -- what matters is that you're building more interests together, which will give you more to look forward to and to talk about throughout the course of your relationship.

, If you've been with your girlfriend for a while, things can begin to fall into a routine, and you may feel like your relationship is losing that special spark. Make sure to keep things interesting by finding new ways to compliment your girlfriend, going to new spots during your date nights, and finding new interests to pursue together.



Be spontaneous. Pick her up after school and drive her to a park for an impromptu picnic.
Don't do the same thing every weekend. Make sure you try at least one new things together every time you go out, even if it means seeing the same movie in a different theater.
Don't forget about your looks. You should continue to look nice, even if you've been together for a while. If you slack off in this department, she may think you don't care anymore.

, If you're in a teenage relationship, then it's never a good idea to spend all of your time together with your significant other. Let's face it -- teenage relationships are less likely to last than adult relationships, or even college relationships, so you shouldn't invest 100% of your time in each other or you may both be disappointed. Your relationship can continue to grow and strengthen while both of you still remember who you are without each other.


Continue to make time for your guy friends. Don't ditch them completely to hang out with your girlfriend.
Don't let your girlfriend ditch her friends to hang out with you all the time, either.
Don't stop pursuing your interests just because of your girlfriend. Continue to practice with your band, even if she doesn't like the music.
If you and your girlfriend are always together, you won't have any room to step back and gain some perspective. Being apart helps you value what you have, and to think about anything that may not be working.

, If you're a teenage guy, then it's likely that you have raging hormones and want to make out, or do much more, with your girlfriend whenever you can. But whether you want to move a little further than kissing or to go all the way, you have to make sure that your girlfriend is completely ready to take this step.


Don't ever pressure your girlfriend to do more than she wants to do. She may feel forced to give in to you, and she will regret it later.
If you keep trying to move too fast, your girlfriend may think that you're not in the relationship for the right reasons.
Let your girlfriend make the calls sometimes. Wait for her to tell you what she wants instead of making it clear that you want more.
You should avoid moving too fast not only in the bedroom, but in general. Don't start talking about college or your potential futures together until you've been together for a long time and feel truly serious about each other.

, When you don't text back, she may get paranoid, so when you do text back say ""Sorry I took so long, I had to help my mom"", or whatever reason you didn't reply.


Take care when you text other friends. Girlfriends can get very jealous if they see you texting another girl. However, this doesn't mean you can't text other girls. If you are going to text another girl, just make it clear that you are taken and do not flirt with them. If your girl catches you texting another girl in a more than friendly way, she'll drop you faster than hot coal, unless she loves you.

, She's beautiful, gorgeous, lovely, and kind, and that other girl you just glanced at is not worth it. Your girlfriend will probably do anything for you, so don't forget how much you mean to her.


Let her know you care. Sometimes she will want to be treated like the only person who matters, show her you care about her by telling her so. Listen to her ideas and opinions, if you disagree with them no need to start an argument, sharing ideologies can be fun.
Do not talk about her faults. Never ever talk about her faults or flaws, your opinion is very important to her so by saying mean things you could really damage her self-esteem. Recognize her good qualities and make sure she knows about them. However, if you girlfriend is...let's say, really bossy and controlling, this may be something you need to point out.

, If she is in a spot of trouble, help the girl out. Always be there for your girlfriend when she needs help and back her up when she needs it. If she is sad, try to help her sort out her problems and she should do the same for you. Remember, relationships are a two-way street, she has to put in effort too.

Make sure you’re equally mature.,
Share interests.,
Look for someone with self-awareness.,
Choose someone who is respectful.,
Take it slow.,
Learn to compromise.,
Stay faithful.,
Keep the friendship intact.,
Suggest fun date ideas.,

Refrain from gossip.",How to Be a Good Girlfriend as a Teen," This can be a tough one when you’re a teenager. Everyone around you is in the process of maturing, and you’re probably all doing so at different rates. Even so, do your best to pick someone who seems to be at a similar place on that journey as you are. It will ultimately make things easier.A good way to know if you’re equally mature is to notice how comfortable you feel around this person and how easy they are to talk to.
Do you find yourself feeling annoyed by them because they’re immature, or do they seem stuck up and think they’re somehow above you and your friends? In either of these cases, you may be at very different levels of maturity.
Some people like to say that, “age is just a number.” That’s sometimes true, but age can also be a helpful indicator when you’re trying to tell if a relationship will work out.;
, Sharing interests is an important way that people in romantic relationships connect. Of course, you don’t need to have everything in common or like all of the same things, but if you enjoy similar activities, you’ll always be able to find fun things to do together.Meeting someone through an activity you enjoy can make for a great relationship. You could meet a potential partner as part of a club you’re involved in, student government, or an extracurricular activity.
If you don’t love the same kinds of activities but you share similar values or backgrounds, that can also be something that brings you together. For example, maybe you love sports but your partner is into the arts. It may seem that you don’t have a lot in common, but if you have similar religious or spiritual practices, that can bring you together in a deep way.

, This one can be tough when you’re a teen, since not everyone is going to be mature enough to have self-awareness. Self-awareness means that a person has some conscientiousness about their behavior and their effect on others. They’re able to look at themselves honestly and critically and make changes, if needed.A person with self-awareness will have some patience and self-control. They won’t try to rush you or the relationship before you’re ready.
Self-awareness helps a person be a better partner because they can see how their actions affect you and the relationship.

, It is important that you find a partner who is respectful and avoid those who might be manipulative or abusive. Early relationships are all about learning, and this is a good time to set your boundaries and understand your rights in a partnership. Abusive people can be very charming, so it's important you learn to look past what a person says and really look at their behavior and how they treat you.

Common characteristics of abusers include: extremes in behavior and mood, overly protective to the point of being controlling, rigid ideas about gender roles, inflexible and judgmental, intense and codependent, bottles up their emotions. This person may also be very charming, talented, and popular.A potentially abusive person may also push for things to get very serious very quickly.
If you notice troubling signs from this person — they demand that you always check in with them, they try to control how you dress, they constantly criticize you or put you down, they don't acknowledge your feelings — then this is not someone you should get involved with. As much as you may like the person or feel like they are just misunderstood, this is not a healthy dynamic.
Set boundaries about what you will and will not accept in a relationship and stick to them. For instance, you may set a boundary that you will not be with someone who calls you names or will not respect your desire to take things slow. If the person you are interested in knowingly violates these boundaries and chooses not to respect them, then you should end the relationship.

, When you meet someone you’re super excited about, you may want to dive right into a relationship with them. That can be thrilling in the moment, but you may get hurt if the relationship crashes and burns.Let yourself date for a while before deciding to officially be this person’s girlfriend. If they press the issue, you can be honest.
Say something like, “I really like you, which is why I want to take things slowly. I want to make sure that if I’m going to be your girlfriend, I can be a great girlfriend.”
You can also say something like, “I really like you, but I’m not sure if I’m ready to be someone’s girlfriend,” if that’s how you feel.

, Anyone who’s ever been in a relationship will tell you that being able to compromise is key; however, it’s important to know the difference between healthy compromises and unhealthy ones.Both you and your partner are going to have to do some compromising for the relationship to work. Figure out what’s important to you and communicate about that. For example, you can say, “I take dance really seriously, so it’s important to me that you come to all of my recitals if you can.”
Let this go both ways. If your partner has said that an event is really important to them, make the time to attend, even if it’s not your usual type of thing.
As a couple, you won’t always do things the way you would do them yourself. For example, your partner might want to stay up later that you normally would, or might want to go to a movie or restaurant that wouldn’t always be your first choice. That’s perfectly normal. Make sure that you both give a little.

, This one is crucial for a healthy relationship. If you’ve committed to being someone’s girlfriend, that generally means that you’ve committed to being romantic only with them until you break up. Avoid flirting or otherwise being romantic with other people.Some people prefer to be in open relationships where it’s okay to be romantic or sexual with more than one person; however, this takes a lot of maturity and communication from all parties. Never assume a relationship is open or think that it’s okay to act on this without talking about it.
Though flirting with someone else is not technically cheating, it can make some people jealous. Avoid doing this in front of your partner out of respect. Would you like it if they flirted with someone else in front of you?
If you find yourself seriously tempted to cheat, you may not be ready for a relationship, or this may not be the right person for you right now.

, If you like someone enough to be their girlfriend, you hopefully like them enough to be their friend, too. Friends know how to have fun together and support each other. Keep those things at the center of your relationship, even though it’s now romantic.Ask your partner how their day was. Check in with them when they’re sick or struggling. Send them cute notes and make sure they know you care.
Keep doing the kinds of things you enjoy together. Just because you’re a couple doesn’t mean that now you have to spend all of your time cuddling or kissing. That’s an easy way to lose some of the powerful connection you initially shared.

, Don’t assume your partner will have all of the great date ideas. Show that you’re invested in the relationship and in staying active together by coming up with fun things you can do together.Classic dates include movies, dinner, sporting events, and concerts.
You can also go for fun outdoor dates like hikes, bike rides, or a walk in the park or a swim in a nearby lake or river.
Volunteer somewhere together, such as at a soup kitchen or community event.
Sign up to run or walk a local 5K together.

, A big reason many people seek out partners is for the companionship and support they offer. Being a good girlfriend means being a support for your partner during good times and bad.If you know your partner isn’t feeling well or is having a hard time, send them a cute note or a handmade card. Let them know you’re thinking about them and ask if there’s anything you can do to help.
If you don’t live near your partner or you don’t go to school together, send them messages to let them know you miss them and are thinking about them.
Offer to help when help is needed. They may need help studying for a test, putting up posters for their student government campaign, or setting up for a party. Let them know you’re happy to help if they need it.

, You probably know couples that seem so into each other that they do absolutely everything together. While this may seem like total bliss, it’s actually usually not very healthy. In a healthy relationship, each person maintains their own sense of self, even when they do things together.It’s great to be willing to try new things because your partner is into them; just make sure you’re being honest about your actual level of interest. And make sure to keep up with your own interests as well.
Make sure you both still spend time doing things on your own with your own friends. Your partner may need some time to just hang out with friends without you. That’s perfectly healthy. Make sure you take the time to do the same, too.
Try saying something like, ""I love spending time with you and I also love spending time with my friends. I haven't seen them all week, so I'm going to hang out with them on Friday and we can plan to see each other another day.""

, Sometimes, something will happen in your relationship and you’ll just want to vent or gush to the whole world; however, remember that things that end up on social media can be seen by tons of people, sometimes forever.Even if you want to let the world know how wonderful and sweet your partner is because of something they did for you, tone it down. Remember that they might be embarrassed or have thought of that gesture as something private and just between you.
Likewise, if you had a big fight or they did something that upset you, stop yourself before you tell the whole world about that, too. That may make them even more embarrassed, and could make things between you even worse.

, Refraining from gossip means that you don’t listen to gossip or start it yourself. Gossip can mean telling people private things about your partner that other people wouldn’t know. It can also mean listening to things people tell you about them.Especially in high school, people can be prone to gossiping about each other’s relationships. If you hear something about your partner or your relationship that’s news to you, ask them about it before engaging in gossip or believing what someone else tells you.
If you want to share something from your relationship with friends, check in with your partner to find out what they think of as particularly private. If they’ve said something like, “This is just between us,” you know that it’s not something you should share.

Never forget to tell her how much you like her.",How to Get With Any Girl (No Matter What You Look Like)," If you want to get a girl's attention, then you have to make it look like you actually want her to come up to you. This may seem obvious, but you'll be surprised by how unapproachable you may look just because you're nervous about talking to the girl. If you want her to like you, then you can't act like you're too busy, too cool, or too distracted to talk to the girl. If she comes up to you, put away your phone, stop looking around, and give her your attention. Here are some other ways to be approachable:


Smile at the girl if she walks over to you or passes you.
Use open body posturing; don't stand around with your arms crossed.
Be aware of your resting facial expressions; don't scowl or glare at her or anyone else.
Don't fidget or look down at the floor.;
, If you're worried about approaching a girl no matter what you look like, then you may lack some confidence when it comes to your looks. That's okay: most guys doubt their appearance now and again. However, if you want to get the girl, you don't have to be the most handsome guy in the room, but you should act like you're happy with how you look. If you're not pleased with your appearance and don't carry yourself confidently, the girl will be able to tell, and she'll be less likely to talk to you. Here's how you do it:


Stand tall when you walk up to her.
Look her in the eye.
Remind yourself that you are worthy of her attention.
Avoid making fun of yourself or putting yourself down too much.

, If you're trying to be someone else, your love interest will never have a chance to like you because she will never know who you really are. Though you can work on self-improvement and on being more appealing to girls, you shouldn't have to change your entire personality to get a girl's attention. If you're being dishonest or not being yourself at all, the girl will be able to tell and she won't be impressed. Remember that, at the end, the girl has to like you for who you really are.


When you meet a new girl, yeah, the goal is for her to like the person who you really are, at the end of the day. But that doesn't mean you should put it all on the table at the beginning -- getting to know you will be a process. You don't have to tell her about your bug collection or your obsession with video games until you know each other better.

, Communication is important in all areas of life, not just talking to your potential future girlfriend, so you should work on improving your communication skills. A lot of guys, especially if they are in high school younger, have a hard time really communicating with girls, or even with other guys, and if you're comfortable enough to have a meaningful conversation with the girl, then you will stand out to her. Here are some ways to communicate effectively:


Ask her questions. Show that you care about her life.
Listen to her. Don't interrupt her when she's trying to tell you something.
Compliment her and learn to take her compliments.
Learn to express her feelings when the time is right.

, This does not mean you have to buy her tons of presents or pay for every meal that she eats. Emotional support is key to keeping a girl's attention. Simple things like listening to her when she has had a bad day or congratulating her on a recent accomplishment go a long way. Once you get to know each other, you have to show her that you're supportive of her goals and daily life, and will be there whether she's having a great day or a terrible one. Show that you're not only there for the good times.


Finding ways to support her, from going to her soccer games to texting her to see how her math test went, can show her that she's always on your mind.
Remember that her goals are just as important as yours. Take her goals and accomplishments seriously so she knows that you really care.

, Though girls want a guy that they can have a meaningful connection with, they also want to have some fun. Girls should see you as a guy who is easy to hang out with, who makes them laugh, and who is easily able to just go with the flow. You don't want to be seen as a stick in the mud who is always complaining or only wants to do the same three things all the time. Here are some ways to be fun to be around:


Plan an adventurous date for the two of you or for a group of her friends. Go hiking, build a fort, or just do something wild and crazy.
Don't complain about activities she wants to share with you. Try them out! You never know what you will enjoy doing when the company is right.
Don't take yourself too seriously. Learn to poke fun at yourself, and the girl will be more comfortable around you.

, Belching at the dinner table, telling racist jokes, or making fun of people is no way to win a lady's heart. Treat her with the same kindness and respect that you would show to your mother. Remember that she is not your closest bro friend, and she won't laugh at all of the same jokes. You don't have to be incredibly proper around her, but you should be respectful and say things that make her feel comfortable.


Hold doors for her.
Be polite to the people around you, too, from teachers to waiters. If you're nice to her, but rude to others, the girl will notice.
If you really want to stand out from the other guys out there, then having good manners is one of the best ways to do it. Unfortunately, it's all too common for guys to have terrible manners. If you have good manners, the girl will see you as mature and worth knowing.

, You should practice approaching females, even if they are not the ones you are interested in pursuing. Practice doesn't always make perfect, but it certainly helps. Spend some time approaching new girls and making new friends. Not only will this help with nervousness, but it will help you develop your own style of interacting with girls that you like. The more comfortable you get with talking to girls, the more likely you'll be to be yourself and to stop worrying about rejection.


You should work on being nice to all of the girls around you, not just the girls you like. You want to get a reputation of being a nice guy.

, If you really want to get any girl you want, then you have to know how to give her a meaningful compliment. Just saying, ""You look hot in that dress"" probably won't win her over because it won't make her feel like you're really paying attention to who she is and to what makes her special. Instead, you have to work on being a careful observer and on noticing what really makes the girl stand out from the others. Here are some meaningful compliments you can give:


""You're so good at talking to new people. How do you do it?""
""You have the most amazing laugh I've ever heard.""
""You really know how to cheer people up. That's a real skill.""

, If you want to get a girl to want to be around you, then you have to make her see that you don't just see her as an object, but that you see her as a real person who you care about. Make sure to ask her about herself, from what her goals for the future are to which classes she likes in school or if she has any pets. At first, you don't have to ask her anything deep or serious, but you should ask her questions to show that you want to get to know her. Here are some things you can ask her about:


Her favorite hobbies
Her favorite bands, TV shows, or books
Her friends
Her siblings
Her favorite places
How her day was

, Another way to make a girl feel special is to ask her opinion about things. You don't have to talk about anything too controversial, at first, or you may get off on the wrong foot. However, you should ask her what she thinks you should do in a certain situation, getting her advice to show you value her opinion. Ask her about her thoughts on a new band, on what she thinks of your new shoes, or what she thinks about the history class you're both taking. She'll see that you really care about her if you show that her opinion matters to you.


Asking for the girl's opinion on stuff will show that you think of her as more than just a pretty face.

, Listening to a girl -- for real -- will definitely make her feel special and will make her want to be with you. When she talks to you, don't interrupt her, don't try to solve her problems, and don't compare everything she says to your own problems. Take her problems at face value and show her that you really do care about what she has to say. When she's said her part, you can ask her more questions about the situation and her feelings; don't just move on to talk about yourself once she's done talking.


You should also remember what she tells you so you can recall it later. Saying something like, ""Did you have that talk with your sister that you were telling me about? How did it go?"" will show that you actually care about her.

, Let the girl know that she stands out to you in a real way. Tell her that she's different from her friends and different from the other girls you know. This may make her blush a little bit, but it will definitely make her want to be with you more. Here are some things you can say:


""You're so different from the other girls here. You're just so comfortable with yourself. Anyone can tell that you don't care about impressing people.""
""You're so different from the other girls I know. It's just so easy to be around you.""

, If you really want to show the girl that you care, then you can't act aloof and like you're way too busy to hang out. While you shouldn't always be available for her and should show that you have your own life, you shouldn't ignore her when she wants to hang out, either. Spending enough time with her will help your relationship grow and will make her see that you really care about deepening your bond.


This doesn't mean you should give up all of your boys' nights to hang out with her. But it does mean that you should free up some time for her if you want her to see that you care.

, If you want the girl to see that you're thinking of her when she's not around, then you should make an effort to check in with her every once in a while. You shouldn't text her every five seconds or call her all the time or you'll be smothering her, but if you're apart for a little while, just text her to say something like, ""I've been thinking of you,"" or ""How was your aunt's birthday party?"" to show that she's on your mind when you're apart.


You don't want the girl to think that you've stopped caring about her as soon as she walks away. Getting in touch with her when you're apart is a way to show her that you still care.
Just make sure that she checks in with you, too, so all of your communication when you're apart isn't one-sided.

, If you and the girl have started a relationship, then you should start letting her know that you really care for her. You shouldn't do this too much, or too soon, but once it's been established that you're a couple and you're hanging out a lot, don't act too cool to say, ""I really like you"" or ""I love being with you"" when the mood strikes you. While you don't want to smother her with affection, you don't want her to feel neglected, either. Make sure that you never stop letting her know how much she means to you.


It's important to tell her how much you like her just because, not just when you're trying to convince her to go to a basketball game with you or to give you a kiss. You should tell her that you like her just because it's true and you want her to know how much she means to you.

Give him thoughtful gifts.,
Write him thoughtful notes.,
Go on meaningful dates.,
Do him favors that count.,
Take the time to understand his interests.",How to Be Romantic with Your Boyfriend2," Don't just give your boyfriend a six pack of his favorite beer and take him out to Pizza Hut. Put in an effort to figuring out what he really likes and cares about, and what gift would actually mean something to him, and what would surprise him and make him see that you've put an effort into the gift. When it comes to gifts, one size does not fit all, so try to get your boyfriend something personalized, special, and something he wouldn't think to get on his own. Remember that the best gifts are often given ""just because,"" not for a birthday or another special occasion. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Does he love hiking or camping? Get him the latest camping or hiking gear, something he's been wanting for a while.
Does he love fine ales or wines? Get him a subscription to a beer or wine of the month club.
Is he a video game junkie? Get him a new game that's all the rage, or update his gaming equipment.
Is he a concert fanatic? Find out when his favorite band is coming to town before he does and get him some tickets.

, Not every not-in-person communication has to come through a computer or a phone. If you're going to be apart for a day or two, or even for a few hours, write him a sweet note telling him how much he means to you or how much you'll miss him while you're apart. Just telling him to have a nice day and to let him know that you're thinking of him can make all the difference.


You can write your note on a post-it and put it on his mirror, put the note it in his lunch bag, school bag, or work bag, or leave the note on his windshield. Part of the romance will come from the surprise.

, Though you and your boyfriend can probably have fun no matter where you go, you should make an effort to plan some dates that are special and feel really romantic. This depends on what you and your boyfriend like and the kinds of things that make you happy together. If you suggest a date that would be perfect for your boyfriend, then he'll be impressed by how much thought and effort you're putting into the relationship. Here are some ideas:


Does your boyfriend love baseball? Take a trip to the batting cages together.
Is it snowing just a little bit? You're never too old to go ice skating.
If you both want to hang out but don't feel like going anywhere, cook your favorite meal together.
Spend a day out on the beach or near a lake. Being near or in a body of water will make you feel more romantic.
Think of the thing your boyfriend has always talked about doing. Make it happen.

, You may not think that doing your boyfriend's laundry on the week when he has a big exam coming up is very romantic, but he'll appreciate the gesture. Romance isn't all about the grand gestures, but about the little things that show your boyfriend that you really care about him and want to make him happy. Ideally, of course, you should both be doing each other favors; you should not turn in to his errand girl to win him over.


If he's having a really busy day, make him lunch or pick it up for him.
Step out in the morning to bring him back some coffee and muffins if you know he doesn't have anything to eat for breakfast.
If you're going to the store anyway, pick him up the few items he needs so you can save him the trip.
If he tends to be forgetful and has a big deadline coming up, remind him when it is to show him that you're paying attention.

, This doesn't mean you have to tag along with him and his buddies to watch Monday night football. But it does mean that you should make an effort to see why he cares about football or whatever other interests mean nothing to you. See what's behind his love for soccer, fishing, historical non-fiction, comics, or whatever else makes him tick.


Ask him questions about these things, and see if you can come along as he explores his interests if they intrigue you. Now that's romantic.

Squeeze his hand at the movies; run your hand through his hair when you're waking up; give him a playful shove when you're teasing each other. You shouldn't be all over him all the time or he may get weary; just pick the right moments to touch him, at least a few times a day.


Making that physical connection whenever it feels right is very romantic.

, Don't just say, ""You're so hot"" or ""I really like you."" Let him know what it is that makes him feel so special to you. Tell him he has a great smile, that you love his sense of humor, that you admire his work ethic, or that you think he's so good at knowing exactly how you're feeling. Make a point of finding something new you like about him every so often and let him know how you really feel.


Compliments are best delivered in person, but you can also always tell him how you feel in a love note, email, or phone call.

, If you're spending some time apart, whether it's a week or an entire summer, you should let him know you still care. This doesn't mean that you should call him twenty times a day to see what he's doing or to make sure he's not talking to other girls; it does mean that you should check in to let him know that you care and that you're thinking about him, at least once a day.


You don't have to talk on the phone every single day, if you're both busy and feel like you're just doing it to check an item off your list. But you should check in at least once a day when you're apart, whether it's by calling, texting, or emailing him.
Text him to let him know you're thinking of him.
If you both have video phones or Skype, make a video date or two each week, so you can still see each other and remember how much you love being together.

, Even if you're both tired, busy, or just not feeling affectionate, you should kiss each other at least once a day. Make the effort to give him just one six-second long kiss each day, and you'll be upping the romance factor in your relationship, and strengthening your bond as a couple. Don't just give him a routine peck on the lips or cheek before you have to leave, but pick an unexpected time to kiss him.


Kissing is the most basic way to let your boyfriend know how much you care.

, Don't forget to let him know exactly how much he means to you. Often, words are the best way to show affection. You can tell him in a monthly letter, or tell him casually over dinner. Make a list of at least five things that make him an amazing boyfriend, and let him know exactly what these things are, so he really sees how much he means to you.


You can be even more spontaneous than that. If he does something that strikes you as amazing, just tell him what it is.

, Giving your boyfriend a massage will not only kick up the sexiness factor in your relationship, but it will also be a great way of showing him affection and letting him see that you really care. If he comes back home after a long day or work or school, make him sit down and give him a good shoulder massage. You can move to his neck, his biceps, and his lower back. Help him relax and get all of those pesky knots out of his back, and he'll be feeling your lovin' for a long time.


For a longer and more intimate massage, have him lie on his stomach for you.

Never stop the courtship.,
Tend to your looks.,
Keep your bedroom in a sexy state.,
Maintain your independence.,
Do activities that raise your adrenalin together.",How to Be Romantic with Your Boyfriend4," Even if you and your boyfriend have been together for years, you shouldn't look at the relationship as a perfect union that should stay exactly the same until the end of time. You should both be working to impress each other, to keep chasing each other, and to remind each other why your relationship is so great. Don't just fall into the same old dull routine because it's ""pretty good"" and has been working thus far; take your relationship to the next level by always trying new things and keeping it interesting.


Don't stop telling each other how much you mean to each other.
Keep up your weekly ""date nights,"" and make sure you leave the house for most of them.
Make sure you try something new together at least once a month, whether it's a new restaurant or a new sport.
Be spontaneous. Go on a random weekend trip you planned the night before; sign up for a salsa class at the last minute.

, If you want to hold on to your boyfriend, then you can't let yourself go. Both of you should make sure you shower regularly, get your hair in good shape, and dress nicely when you're hanging out together. You can wear sweatpants on Sundays, maybe, or on another designated ""vegging out"" day, but on the whole, you should dress up when you're together like you could appear in public, even if you're not leaving the house.


Caring for your appearance will keep you from getting complacent in your relationship and will make you and your boyfriend feel more romantic.
You can even make a point of dressing up extra nicely for your date nights, even if you're not going anywhere that fancy.

, Whether you and your boyfriend are sleeping together or just hooking up, make sure you get together in a place that makes you feel romantic, not a dirty car or cluttered basement. If you can hook up in your bedroom, make sure that it's neat, clean, and that it feels like it's made just for you two to kiss each other; don't hook up near textbooks or the piles of folders you brought home from work. When you're getting intimate in the bedroom, intimacy should be the only thing on your minds.


If you and your boyfriend live together, this is especially important. If the room is only used for sleep and sex, you will both feel more romantic.

, If you want to keep your relationship feeling fresh, then you and your boyfriend have to spend some time apart. If you're always together, then you won't have as much to talk about, and you won't be able to miss each other or appreciate each other when you're apart. No matter how close you are, it's important to pursue your own interests and to hang out with your friends and families apart from each other from time to time.


Just going out with your girlfriends without your boyfriend every week or two will give you a new appreciation of how much you love him.
Don't be clingy or needy. Let your boyfriend go out and do his own thing now and again and he'll love you -- and feel romantic -- even more.

, If you and your boyfriend do something romantic together that gets your blood pumping and makes you feel good, you will be guaranteed to feel more sexy and romantic. This can take the form of any kind of exercise such as long walks, hiking, biking, running, yoga, ballroom dancing, or just going to the gym together.


A couple that works out together stays together. And stays in shape.
Raising your adrenalin will also put you in a better mood, and will make you more fond of the person you're with.

, If she asks for some more time to think about it, then don't rush her. If you know you won't see each other for a few days, then tell her your phone number and tell her that if she wants to call even just to talk it over again go ahead.

, Women don't like it when the person they are talking to zones out in the middle of a conversation, especially if you were the one that wanted to know what they thought about what ever you're asking about.

If the girl likes you, then she'll stand closer to you, and will generally show that she enjoys your company. Is she making eye contact? Is she smiling, laughing and having a good time? If so, you're on the right track. Here are a few other ways to see if she wants you to touch her:


If she likes you, she will either hold your gaze for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these signs could mean that she likes you. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. If she pulls away quickly, it could mean she is nervous but still likes you.
Assess her personality. If she's outgoing and friendly, there is less of a chance she will be upset or taken aback if you try to touch her. If she's shy or more reserved, you may want be more certain she is into you before you touch her.;
, Brush your arm up against hers, place your hand on the small of her back, or just pass her a pen or a notebook and let your hands linger near each other's. Does she jump back, like she's just placed her hand on a hot burner, or does she let your bodies linger together for a second and give you a smile? If she returns your affection, then she is welcoming your plan to break the touch barrier.


Keep the first touch casual and friendly to see how she responds. There's no need for a romantic gesture yet.

, If the casual approach worked, then try touching her for a little bit longer next time. Place your hand on the small of her back for a few seconds, not just to lead her through a door. Keep your hand over hers for an extra second or two when you hand her a stick of gum. If your knees or legs brush under the table, let them rest there for a little while longer before moving away.


This will warm the girl up to more intimate and longer lasting touches, and it will give you a better sense of how much she likes the contact.

, This will give you an excuse to touch her under the guise of just being a gentleman and looking out for her. Make sure she's the kind of girl who is okay with all this gentlemanly stuff and doesn't find you too old-fashioned, though. Be her knight in shining armor. Once you're on a date, or hanging out in a date-like setting where you're alone and liking each other, you should look for chances to be a real gentleman so you can touch her.

, If you're both about to leave and she needs to put on a jacket or coat, hold it out for her like a gentleman so that she can slip her arms into the sleeves. The knuckles of your fingers will probably gently brush up against her as you're doing this. If she responds positively and you notice that her hair is between her jacket and her back, carefully pull it out for her.


You can also help her take her jacket off at the beginning of the night, whether you've invited her over your place or have stepped out to a restaurant.

, This is especially helpful when she might need to keep her balance, such as when she's getting into or out of a car, or when she's stepping over a puddle or any other uneven surface. Girls love this because it shows that you are thinking of her and not just yourself. This is more likely to be appropriate if she's dressed nicely or wearing heels.


Again, make sure she's not the kind of girl who thinks it's demeaning of you to suggest that she needs to hold your hand to get stuff done.

, This will serve as an invitation for her to hook her arm around yours, especially if you're about to walk together. This is a classically romantic way to walk as a couple without being too touchy-feely. You should do this after you've already had a nice date and had a nice time with each other. After dinner or the movie or whatever you did on the date, stepping out for a stroll is a great way to show your affection for each other.


If it's your first time trying this maneuver or making this kind of physical contact, then don't step out onto a crowded street where you're both likely to run in to people you know. Find a more intimate setting.

, Open the door for her and allow her to go first through doors, corridors or small crowds. A nice, firm gesture would be to press with your hand just above her waist (you can set your hand anywhere on her back to guide her through the door, if you two are really comfortable around each other, you might be able to place it lower than the hip). Walk towards the door (or corridor), while saying ""after you."" Other spots to press would be the back of the arm, just above the elbow (especially recommended if she is wearing short sleeves), or very softly and cautiously on the shoulder.


Though it's nice to let the girl go first, don't make a big production of touching her every time you do this, or she'll start to think you're only being a gentleman so you can touch her, which shouldn't be the case.

, If you're about to go through a large crowd, hold out your hand so you can walk through the crowd without losing each other. This not only shows that you care about her, but it also shows that you can take the lead. Once you're out of the crowd, you can continue holding her hand if she seems interested.


Holding hands is a big step for a lot of girls. If she's not into that right away, don't be too discouraged. She might be waiting to be your girlfriend before you really hold hands, especially in public.

, It's not uncommon to see a loose eyelash on someone's face. If you see one, tell her, ""Hold still. You have an eyelash on your face. Let me get it off."" Pull it off her face very gently. Don't apply too much pressure, especially if she's wearing make-up. Do the same thing if you see something in her hair like a piece of lint or a ball of dust.


Obviously, don't stare at her face all night until you finally see an eyelash there. But if you do see one, great.
You can also lie. Say that she has something in her hair, even if she doesn't actually have anything there, and break the touch barrier this way.
Don't brush any food off her face. Saying ""Wait, you have a little chunk of bacon on your chin"" is just not hot.

, Does she have a different ring, a new haircut or a different nail color? Acknowledge it verbally (""That's a pretty ring"" or ""Did you get a new nail color?""). Hold out your hand, palm up, and ask if you can look closer. Inspect whatever is different, and ask a question or make a positive comment. If she has a nice earring, hold it up in your hand and say how pretty it is. But you should only try this move if you've already touched her -- reaching for the face is pretty intimate.


While you're doing all of this, get a feel for how she responds to having her hand in yours. After she has responded to your comment or question, briefly rub her hand with your thumb gently and let it go. Smile and quickly move on, but be careful not to appear creepy.

, If it's chilly outside and you notice that she's cold or shivering, offer her your coat. Put it around her. Depending on how comfortable she feels around you, you might take your hands and brush them briskly on her upper arms to generate a little heat. If you notice that her hands are cold, tell her to give you her hands and put them together (palm to palm). Put your hands around hers and rub them softly, but quickly to warm her hands up.


If you're feeling daring, bring her hands up to your mouth and blow a little warm air on them. However, make sure your breath doesn't stink.

, If you're teasing each other, it's okay to give each other gentle shoves, pats on the arm, or playful touches on the shoulder. If you're flirting with each other, then it's natural for you to touch each other, as long as you're both doing the touching. She may even end up touching you more than you touch her. If you're both in a fun-loving and flirtatious mood, then it's okay to touch her this way.


Being playful is perfect if you're both doing it. But if you notice that you're the one touching her and she doesn't reciprocate, back off.

, If she responded positively to all of the above, make your next move (or risk forever being trapped in the ""friend"" zone). That could be putting your arm around her shoulder or waist, or holding her hand. The back of the neck and the small of the back are two sensitive areas too.

, If she isn't responding positively to these actions, simply back away. It doesn't necessarily mean she's not interested. She could just be in a bad mood or feeling tired. However, if you've tried this more than once and get the same response, she likely isn't interested in being touched by you.

, Any kind of partner dancing, such as salsa, tango or swing can be a good way to break the touch barrier. Keep in mind, however, that just because she seems to be having a good time dancing with you doesn't necessarily mean she likes you off the dance floor. It's certainly a start though.

, Ice skating is a great activity for casual physical contact. You can hold her hand to help keep her from falling if she isn't quite getting the hang of it, or to help each other skate backwards. In the cold environment, you may also have the opportunity to help her keep warm with a hug or encircling her with your jacket.

, Have her as your doubles partner. There will be plenty of opportunities to high-five and playfully touch her after a good shot. At the end, you can also touch her back or shoulders and say it was a great game. Just remember that she'll be conscious of sweating a little bit and may not want to be touched so much during or after the game.

, For example, riding tandem on a motorcycle, sitting on an inner tube or sled going down a snow hill, parachute jumping in tandem, etc. Go mini-golfing together if you know how to hold a golf club. There are plenty of sporting opportunities for this closeness to be imposed on both of you!

, Don't approach a girl and give her a shoulder massage for no reason. If she tells you she's sore, rubs her own shoulders, or even asks for a massage, then that's one thing. But if you just come up to her in the middle of the day or try to give her a massage the second you're alone together, that will quickly send the wrong message.


If she tenses up instead of relaxing as soon as you give her a massage, then you've already gone too far.

, Avoid grabbing any part of her arm with your hand and pulling her to come somewhere with you. At best, this can be interpreted as annoying. At worst, it can come off as an attempt to yank her around. Generally, any kind of pulling or tugging might be interpreted as immature or pushy.


There's a difference between playfully pulling each other in the direction you want to go and actually grabbing the girl in a way that feels violent and inappropriate.

React appropriately.",How to Get a Boyfriend in Middle School," Before you can be ready to catch your guy's attention, you need to make sure that you feel great about yourself. This doesn't mean you should give yourself a complete makeover or change who you are. It just means you should pay more attention to your feelings first to be sure that you are ready to date. Here's what you should do:


If you've started wearing makeup, just some subtle eye shadow, mascara, and pink lip gloss will do the trick. Many girls in middle school don't wear makeup and if you're not comfortable with it, don't do it until you're ready. If you don't use makeup, great! There is no reason to be pressured into wearing it. You always need to be comfortable in your own skin before trying to impress others.
Wear nice clothes that compliment your figure. Wear clean, well-matching, and colorful clothes to catch his attention. For example, you could wear skinny jeans, a colorful tank top, a cardigan, and a pair of black boots. If you want to wear sweat pants though and be sporty that is fine as well. Some guys in middle school prefer the sporty girls over the ones with makeup caked on their face. Never change who you are for someone else.
Practice good hygiene. Try to shower every day and to wash your hair at least a few times a week. Keep fresh breath by sucking on a breath mint once in a while, especially after you eat your lunch. Remember that most schools prohibit gum, though if your school allows it, mint flavored gum is an excellent choice. Mint gum freshens your breath and excels the thought process.
Smell nice. Wearing slightly scented body lotion or a very light, girly perfume will do the trick. Don't go through your mom's perfume or you will end up smelling too much like an adult. And it won't hurt to put on a little bit of scented lotion or perfume after gym class.;
, Once you have impressed yourself, you can begin to charm your guy. If you're lucky enough to share a class with your crush, then there are a few things you can do to make him notice you while not being too obvious about it. Here's where you can start:


Let him see that you're a fun person to be around. He should see you laughing and chatting with your friends before and after class so he knows people love laughing and hanging out with you. If he comes in while you're laughing with your friends, try to include him in conversation just by waving him over and saying hi. If the conversation leads somewhere great! Friendship acquired.
Show your smarts. He won't want to be your boyfriend if he doesn't think you're smart or won't have anything to talk about. Be a good student by doing your work and answering your teacher's questions correctly. Just don't answer every question or you will look like a know-it all. If you aren't all that smart though, you could ask him to tutor you after school or during lunch. It might lead to hanging out more or even a study date.
Make eye contact. Catch his eyes a few times in class. Don't be too obvious or he'll know you're staring at him. Just look at him, smile, and look away. And if you catch him staring at you, it may mean that he has a crush on you too. Don't automatically jump to conclusions though. If he catches you looking at him look away quickly and pretend you didn't see him catch you.
Chat with him before and after class. Joke around with him, or talk about your teacher or the homework. You can even use the homework as an excuse to start a conversation. If his science project is due the next week, you can ask him how it's going and if he's done yet. You can move on from the safe topic of class to other topics.
If you talk to him after your class, see if he keeps walking with you. Maybe he wants to start a habit of walking you to your next class, which is a sign that he may want to be more than friends.
Don't chat too much during class or be rude to your teacher. He won't want to be with you if he thinks you're obnoxious or have bad manners.

, If you want to flirt with your crush during school hours but don't have a class together, there are other ways to catch his eye during the day. Without stalking him, you can get a sense of his schedule and run into him once in a while. When you do see him, make your time together count. Here are some things to do:


Talk to him at his locker. Stop by casually to say hello and ask what class he has next. If he has cool posters in his locker, you can comment on them. If you have a friend who has a locker near his, you can talk to your friend and just smile at him or say hi.
Talk to him in the cafeteria. If you're in the lunch line together or if you pass his table, just wave, say hi, and ask how his day is going. Let him see you laughing and having a great time with your friends so he knows that you can have a good time with or without him.
Talk to him in the halls. If you pass him in the halls and end up walking together, make casual conversation about what he did in gym class, something funny your history teacher said, or about what you're doing that weekend. Be friendly, light, and fun.
If you catch him outside after school, you can ask who is picking him up, or what he's doing that afternoon. If it's a big TV night, you can ask him if he's going to watch your favorite show and strike up a conversation about that. Find subtle ways to let him know you share his interests.

, Sometimes, it can be hard to flirt during school because you're too busy or nervous, or because your schedules just don't match up. Luckily, there are plenty of chances for you to flirt with him after school, and the mall is a great place to start. If you meet up when you're both hanging out with your friends at the mall, you'll both be more relaxed and in a good mood if you're not worrying about taking your Spanish quiz or getting to your next class on time. Here's what you can do:


Strike up a casual conversation about what he's been up to. Ask if he went to any stores, and if he has a shopping bag, ask what he got.
Ask him if he's had anything to eat. The mall has endless food options for all tastes, and maybe you can get a snack together if you're both hungry. Or if he and his friends are going out to eat later, he can ask you to come along.
Talk about the movies you've seen or want to see. The movies are a common end-up at the mall, and if it sounds like you want to see the same movie, you could end up going together. Or if he says he really wants to see a movie that you're iffy about, just tell him you want to see it too in case he asks you. A little white lie will only help your chances of hanging out more.

, Middle school parties are an incredibly fun place to let loose with your friends, be silly, dance around, play games, and eat pizza and cupcakes. But hanging out with people you're used to seeing mostly in school can seem intimidating, especially if you see your crush at a party and don't know how to react. Here's how to catch his interest at a party:


Let him see you talking to other guys. Without being obvious about it, show him that guys love talking to you, and that you're approachable. When you do talk to him, act more interested in him than you do with other guys so he knows you don't just flirt with everyone.
Find a way to casually touch him. If you're both laughing, touch his shoulder or knee, or if he teases you, you can push him flirtatiously.
Maintain eye contact when you talk to him. Don't be distracted by your friends or what else is going on.
Don't talk to him for too long. He should see that you have other interests, and that plenty of people want to talk to you. This will make you look more desirable.

Do not consume alcohol at a party. You are way too young to be drinking, and if you succumb to peer pressure, you will put yourself in a dangerous situation and will look weak.

, Everyone spends months looking forward to the school dance. Even if guys complain about it, they always show up looking nice, so they obviously want to be there. But flirting with your guy at the dance can be scary, especially if you're worried that you don't know how to dance. Here's what to do:


Dance with a big group of your girlfriends. Have a loud and fun time and don't even look over at the boys. If he thinks you're a wallflower, he won't think you're any fun, so stay active and engaged. But don't spend too much time dancing with your friends or he'll be too scared to approach you in front of your friends.
Even if you can't dance, be confident. The secret is that most people in middle school have absolutely no idea how to dance, but if you smile, move to the music, and don't take yourself too seriously, people will want to dance with you.
Talk to your guy. You can tease him about not dancing, ask what kind of music he likes, and even wait for him to ask you to dance. If he asks you to slow dance, you can maintain light conversation instead of staring into his eyes, which may get too intense.

, Texting and Facebook are incredibly common ways to communicate, so don't be afraid to talk to him that way when you get home from school. This will show him that you're interested and capable of keeping up a conversation.


If you chat with him on Facebook, show him that you're interesting. Without trying too hard, tell him about your interests or something cool you heard that day. If it works, you can even send him a link.
Talk about your common interests. Chatting online can be a great way to find out that you like the same band or both love Mexican food.
If you're texting, be fun and casual. Wish him luck at his baseball game or on his Algebra test. Make sure you're texting each other equally. If you're meeting up at the same place with friends, tell him you can't wait to hang out.

, Once you're sure about your feelings and feel confident about letting your guy know how you feel, it's time to take the situation into your own hands and tell him how you feel. Guys in middle school can be really shy, while girls tend to be more confident and assertive, so he may be asking you to make the first move. You may be nervous about revealing your true feelings, but you'll be able to impress him with your confidence and courage if you do it the right way. Here's what to do:


Tell him when you're alone. This is extremely important. In middle school, guys are often easily influenced by their male friends, and spend too much time caring about what their friends think. If you tell him while you're surrounded by a group of people, or even if his friends are just nearby, they will heckle you guys, make annoying noises, and will just generally discourage your guy from telling you how he feels.
Pick the right time to tell him. Not only should you pick a time when you aren't surrounded by his friends, but you should also pick a time when he's in a good mood or open to conversation. If you both got to school pretty early, tell him before so he can think about it in class. If you catch him at the end of the day while he's waiting for a ride, you can reveal your feelings then. Just make sure he isn't about to be picked up by his mom---that's just plain awkward.
Pick the right place to tell him. If you're too shy to tell him that you like him in school, tell him that you like him when you're hanging out with friends at the mall, or at a party. Just make sure to isolate him when you're giving him the news.
Keep things simple. Just say something like, ""I have a big crush on you"" or ""I really like talking to you."" You don't have to tell him you want him to be your boyfriend. If he likes you, he will figure it out.

, If you want to tell him that you like him yourself, but are too scared to do it in person, you can text him or message him online to let him know. This will take some of the pressure off both of you and will let you have a conversation without feeling too uncomfortable. Here's how you do it:


Send him a text message saying that you like him and want to hang out. Remember that you should already have his phone number and know him well enough to text him, or he will just feel awkward and like you're stalking him a little bit. If you do know him pretty well but don't have his number, you should say something like, ""Hi, this is Sarah from school. I got your number from so-and-so..."" so he knows how you got his digits.
When you're chatting with him on Facebook, just say, ""There's something I want to tell you"" and let him know how you feel. Make sure he's alone when you deliver the news, or his friends might think it's funny and will start chatting with you.
Send him a Facebook message to let him know how you feel. This may give you more time to gather your thoughts and to tell him why he's special to you. Just make sure he's the kind of person who actually checks his Facebook messages so you're not nervously waiting around for an answer for no reason.

, Having a friend deliver the news is a common way to tell a boy you like him in middle school. There's no shame in it, and as long as you trust your friend, she should say the right thing and improve your chances of connecting with your crush. Here's how you do it:


Pick a friend who knows how to talk to guys. Not only should you ask a friend that you trust, but make sure it's someone who knows how to talk to guys without making them uneasy. Ideally, your friend will already know the guy and won't catch him off guard by approaching him.
Have your friend ask him by herself. If she's surrounded by a gaggle of girls, he will feel overwhelmed and might blush and not want to answer.
Have your friend ask him in a relatively private place. Your friend shouldn't approach him in the middle of the cafeteria or a kickball game in gym class, when he's surrounded by other people. She should find the right time to pull him aside.

, Whether the guy says he likes you and wants to be your boyfriend, or if he doesn't share your feelings, you should have the right reaction so you can move forward after you've taken this big step. Here's what you can do:


If he does want to be your boyfriend, be happy about it. Good work — you made it happen! You can start being his girlfriend, which means holding hands in the hall, talking at his locker, and going to the mall and movies together. To keep him around, you should not be too clingy, maintain your other friendships, and keep busy so he doesn't think your life revolves around him. After all, it shouldn't, it's middle school.
Once you're his girlfriend, do not feel pressure to do anything you're uncomfortable with. If you're not ready to kiss or take the relationship further, don't do it. He'll respect you for sticking with your decision, and if he's the kind of guy who only wants to be with you because he wants to hook up, then he's not right for you anyway.
If he doesn't share your feelings, don't be disappointed. Try to remain calm instead of being overly emotional or upset, and he will respect you more for it. And remember that it's only middle school, where the average relationship lasts just a few weeks. You've been brave by trying and telling him how you feel, and you'll find someone even better next time!

Do not be too clingy.,

Save her a seat next to you.,
Bring her a gift for a birthday or holiday.",How to Act Around Your Girlfriend at School," It is important to believe that you are cool, fun, and whatever else you want to be. Thinking poorly of yourself will reflect in your behavior around your girlfriend. Believing in yourself will build confidence, which will help when you’re around your girlfriend and with life in general.Don’t give into thoughts that tell you that you’re acting weird or uncool. Remember that she agreed to be your girlfriend for a reason.;
, Trying too hard means acting like you wouldn’t normally act around friends, thinking about conversations before they happen, and simply not acting like yourself. You should make an effort to treat your girlfriend with kindness and respect, but that doesn’t mean acting unlike you normally would. Be in the moment with your girlfriend. Don’t plan ahead how you’re going to act, look, or what compliments you’re going to give her.If you’re a very nervous person, you can plan a few conversation topics, but don’t plan out the entire conversation.

, Feeling nervous is totally normal, but don’t let that feeling control your behavior. Take a few deep breaths and remember how great the situation is. You have a girlfriend at a wonderful time in your life. Remember how great that is so you can enjoy your time with her without the worry.If you’re very nervous, think of things that make you happy to help you calm down. For example, think of a favorite song or movie.

, Awkward moments will happen during a relationship. You or her may say something that doesn’t come out as intended. Or, one of you may simply be in a bad mood one day. Don’t take it wrong if she seems quieter than usual, doesn’t hug you at the beginning of the day, or compliments another guy or girl. Simply ask if something is bothering her if you feel the need to do so.Don’t get angry with her or act upset over a small situation—like her forgetting to say bye after class.

, Expecting a certain outcome can take a toll on your confidence. It can affect your confidence if the outcome you imagine doesn’t happen. For example, your behavior can change if you expect your girlfriend to let you kiss her after you compliment her. Or, expecting a certain outcome can make you overbearing or approval seeking. Accept whatever happens., Immature people may make fun of you for being very nice to your girlfriend, but don’t let that change your behavior. Show her that you respect her and treat her with kindness. You can do this by talking to her in a courteous way, which means not making cruel comments or saying inappropriate things. Showing her respect also means giving her your full attention when you’re with her, not flirting with other girls, and trusting her.What is inappropriate largely depends on the type of relationship you have with your girlfriend. It would usually be inappropriate to make sexual comments about your girlfriend during school.

, Compliment her on anything you like about her. Tell her how beautiful you think she is, especially when it’s obvious she put effort into her outfit that day. You should also compliment her on her strengths and accomplishments. For example, tell her how awesome you think it is that she does well in school. Or, congratulate her when she makes it onto a team.It’s great to compliment her, but don’t overdo it. Complimenting her on anything and everything will make your compliments seem less sincere.

, Having a close relationship is great, but being overly attached can have a negative effect on your relationship. Being clingy could mean following them around constantly, overanalyzing their interactions with others, checking in on your girlfriend when you know she’s busy. You can avoid being clingy by being confident in yourself and trusting your girlfriend.Listen to your girlfriend and respect her wishes if she says she needs some space.

, It’s okay and encouraged to brag about how wonderful your girlfriend is. It’s not okay to brag about what happens between you and your girlfriend. For example, if your girlfriend lets you kiss her for the first time between classes, don’t tell all of your friends about it. Things get around quickly at school, and she may not be happy about everyone knowing about her personal matters.


You should also avoid bragging on social media. That can carry over into your school environment.

, First, it is important to know what type of affection she is okay with. Her limit could be holding hands or kissing. Then, keep in mind that you are at school. It usually isn’t acceptable to show a lot of affection during school hours. If you do show affection, be private about it. Hug her when no one is around, or kiss her quickly in an empty area.To know what she is okay with, you could ask her to tell you what she is and isn’t okay with directly or ask her “Is it okay if I kiss you right now?”

, If you have a locker, write a short and sweet note and slip it in between the cracks of the door. If you don’t have a locker, you can put the note into her notebook. Write something like “You look pretty today,” or “Great job on the presentation today.” Try to do this once a day or at least a few times a week., You don’t have to do this all the time, but it’s nice to do every once in a while. Offer to carry her books when it seems like she is carrying more than usual or when she appears stressed out. If she says no, offer once more in case she is being shy and then respect her answer., You can do this in class if you don’t have assigned seats, or you can save her a seat at the lunch table. This will make her feel special and let her know that you think of her. You could even find a special place for just the two of you to have lunch—like a bench outside if it’s allowed., The gift doesn’t have to be expensive or cost anything at all. A simple gesture, like baking cookies, will let her know that you were thinking of her on a special occasion. For Valentine’s Day, write her a note and bring her a flower. For her birthday, consider what she would like. If she likes a certain band, draw her a picture of one of their album covers.If you have a creative hobby, like knitting, utilize that hobby for her gift. Knit her a hat or scarf.

Figure out what bothers you about his friends.,
Tell your boyfriend how you feel.,
Empathize with his friends.,
Don't be jealous of his friends.,
Deal with friends who do things you disapprove of.",How to Accept Your Boyfriend's Friends1," Sometimes, it’s impossible to know why you don’t like a person. However, sometimes, there are specific reasons for why you and another person don't get along. Figure out what your problems are with his friend or group of friends. If you don’t drink and they drink copious amounts, then it may be that your lifestyles don’t match. Or, maybe one of them behaves quite rudely towards you. These don’t have to be massive character faults. Perhaps you simply don’t share similar interests. This is fine. Knowing this will help you figure out how to improve this situation.;
, Communicate to your boyfriend that it’s hard to deal with some of his friends. Sit with him and have a conversation about what you feel your problems are. By doing this, you are showing that you do want his friends to be part of your life. Be honest.Your boyfriend will value this because it shows that you are willing to be up front about how you feel.


You might start the discussion with a phrase like, “I don’t seem to be fitting in with your friends.” Or, perhaps, you can say “I want to know more about your friends.” Using gentle language like this will make it easy to start conversing.

, You may think that you are getting bad signals from your boyfriend’s friends. Yet, if you think about this from their side, you might possibly find that they are not reacting badly towards you out of malice. For example, they may just be protective of their friend. They don’t necessarily dislike you, but they feel they need to put up a strong front in order to keep you from hurting their friend. If you explain to them that you aren’t, then you might find they will be more receptive to you, and less likely to irritate you on purpose.


This is hard but doable. By thinking about their perspectives, you will be able to find a way to communicate with them.

, It’s natural to want to be with your partner when you first meet. It is also completely natural to become envious of anyone who also has claims on his time. However, you should not lash out at him or his friends because you feel this way. Take this as a good sign. It means that you have found a person that everyone wants to spend time with.


For example, you might become jealous of his best friend. Though this is a natural reaction, you shouldn’t become too possessive of your boyfriend. He and his best friend have probably known each other for a while, so you should respect that they need to have their time together.

, You may not understand why his friends behave in a certain way. They may act in ways that annoy and irritate you. You might try ignoring them. However, sometimes, this may be impossible to do. In that case, you need to find a way to confront them in a non-threatening manner.


For example, perhaps one of his friends always tags along with you and your boyfriend. You don’t know why this is. Perhaps, he simply does not have much to do or he just really likes your boyfriend. Either way, this is getting on your nerves. The next time he wants to hang out with you both, ask your boyfriend to tell him that you want to have couple time. If your boyfriend tells him this, then he will probably get the message.

Try an app.",How to Create a Fake Boyfriend or Girlfriend," A good place to start is by picking a name and age for your boyfriend. When creating a boyfriend, you need to get the details straight ahead of time. Try to stick to names not too out of the ordinary but not too plain either.A good way to choose a name is to pick a either a last name or a first name that is fairly common, while having the other name be a little less common. For instance, Joe Smith might be too plain, while Alberto Merryweather may be too much. You can mix them the other way with better results: Joe Merryweather or Alberto Smith.As far as an age, that's up to you. Use the age to back up whatever story or background you create for the person. For instance, you may want an older guy who's ""out of town on business"" often.;
, You need at least some information for your boyfriend. He needs a profession, for instance. A hometown and a college or high school might not hurt. However, keep it fairly simple. You don't want a complicated story that sounds too fake.You can base it lightly off of someone you knew in the past, so that it seems more believable.
Just be sure to change some details. With social media, you'll be called out if you use someone's exact background.

, When creating a fake boyfriend, you need to decide what kind of personality this person is going to have, as you're going to need to write some messages or texts in this person's name. For instance, is he outgoing and flirtatious or a bit more reserved and nerdy?One way to create a personality is to think about your ideal boyfriend. What traits would he have?
Another way to flesh out a personality is to think about one of your favorite characters, whether from a book, movie, or television series. Think about the traits that person has, and use that to create a personality for your boyfriend.
Don't forget to come up with some likes and dislikes, such as favorite foods and books or least favorite movie. That way, you can add some details to his profiles.
Make sure you memorize these details, so you can rattle them of as needed.

, You need a picture for your fake boyfriend, especially in the time of social media.A picture really seals the deal for creating a fake boyfriend.


Finding a picture could prove difficult. You want something that doesn't look canned, but you also don't have the option of using one of your friends, since they'll likely be your friend on Facebook, unless, of course, they agree to play the part.
You can just do an internet search for copyright-free pictures, but if someone else finds that image, you could be called out on your deception. In addition, you'll likely want more than one picture to make the fake person's accounts look real.
If you're really ambitious, you could hire a model in the city to take pictures with you. Try using sites where you can post public job listings. Just be sure to meet in a public place and take a friend with you, both for safety and to snap the photos.

, Everyone has a few flaws. If you pick a supermodel photo with an amazing personality, that's not believable. Pick an average or moderately good-looking person, and don't forget to include some character flaws or cheesy likes and dislikes, as well., Most social media platforms require you to have an email first. Therefore, pick a free email system, and set up an account for your boyfriend.


You'll need to enter the person's name, as well as some basic information like a birthday, a email name, and a password.If you can't think up a email name, try using the fake name as a basis, such as ""Albertoforpresident"" or ""Merryweather333."", To create profiles, you'll need to enter basic information like an email address, an name, and a birthday. You can also enter information in the ""About Me"" section in line with what you've created for this person.


Flesh out the profile with likes and dislikes, photos, and biographical information.
Try to pick one or two platforms and stick with those. If you do too many, you won't be able to keep up.
Be aware that it's against some social media platform's policies to create fake accounts. Unless you're doing something illegal, like trying to scam someone for money, you probably won't get in trouble with the law. However, the platform can delete the account if the company decides it is fake., You'll need to make posts on this person's wall on a regular basis. These posts need to be in line with his personality, while still maintaining an average-person mentality. That is, on social media, people are likely to have a range of posts, from bragging about a new job to giving news about a loved one's death to making mundane posts about food, television, and movies.For instance, you may post something like ""Got a new job today! So excited to start working at ..."" alongside posts like ""Check out this new restaurant in town. I ate there yesterday. So good!""
If you've hired a model, it can help if you make regular photo posts. Try hiring the same model again in a few months, and pick various locations to take pictures around town.If you're using your own photos, you may need to brush up on your photo-altering skills.
Also, you can try friending people with that account, as it will look suspicious if that account has no friends.

, Only let users who are friends with the person see posts and most pictures. That way, any casual person who goes looking for information will just see a locked down account and won't be able to note anything suspicious.On most social media platforms, you can choose who sees what on the platform. However, some platforms require you to let everyone see the posts.
To change how people see the account, look for the account settings. Under account settings, look for ""privacy,"" which you can use to change what other people see on the account.

, Now that you've created the account, you can use it to set up your fake relationship. Basically, you're creating the basis of your relationship on social media.


Change both profiles to ""In a relationship"" with the other person.
Comment on his page from your page. Log on to his page to reply.
Post cute memes and gifs on each other's walls.

, One of the main ways of creating a boyfriend is to talk about him like he's real. You could casually mention dates you've gone recently, for instance, or talk about the fact that he's away on a business trip.For instance, you could say, ""My boyfriend and I had the best time this weekend. We decided to go see that new movie. Have you seen it yet?""
Another way you could bring him up is to say, ""My boyfriend's out of town this weekend. He's out of town a lot on business.""
Don't forget the ups and downs. For instance, one day you might be elated that your boyfriend bought you flowers, while the next week you might be in a fight.
Show him off. Don't be afraid to break out his ""picture"" to make him seem more real.

, If you mention a boyfriend, most people will dive in with enthusiastic questions. Make sure you are ready to answer them.For instance, you'll likely need to answer questions such as ""How long have you been dating?"" and ""What's he look like?""
If you come to a question you can't answer off the top of your head, change the subject. You could say, ""Oh that's enough about my guy, what about yours?""

, If you want to seem like you're texting a boyfriend in a particular situation, try asking your friend to send you texts. You can change their name to your boyfriend's name in your phone and have the friend text you as needed as that person.


You could also have pretend conversations to help sell it. Just make sure you use a male friend in case the person you're with can overhear you.
These conversations don't need to be elaborate. For instance, you could have a 5 minute conversation to set up plans for later or decide who's picking up the milk for dinner.

, You can use online or mobile services to help you out. For instance, one service will send texts to your phone, as well as leave voicemail messages and even send you a postcard. Of course, you must pay for this service, but it can make the relationship more believable.You can also use options that allow you to set up texts that come to your phone at random times. When it beeps, you can say something like, ""Oh, it's just my boyfriend texting. Sorry, I need to reply really quick!""
These apps are on both Android and iPhones.

Invite them over.,
Get to know them one at a time.",How to Accept Your Boyfriend's Friends2," To understand your boyfriend’s friends, you should know what your boyfriend thinks about them. Whenever he tells stories about him and his friends, try to listen and maybe ask some questions. These stories will show crucial elements about how he feels about his friends.


You don’t need to take notes or anything. However, you should try to remember the details of some of the stories. This is part of his friends’ shared history. Later, if you bring up one of these stories to his friends, then they will be pleasantly surprised that you know about these moments.

, Sure, the first few times won’t be super informative because they will be adjusting to you. However, after a while, they will begin to act the way that they normally do. You might use this time to identify what you like and dislike about them. Either way, you will be showing that you care about maintaining a relationship with the entire group.Don’t force your way in! Just be interested in joining in an activity that they were going to do together as a group. For example, if they were all going to watch a movie together, ask if you can tag along.

, This is an easy way of showing interest. Ask a few of his friends to come to your place to hang out. You might try ordering in some food or asking everyone to cook together. This is a great way for everyone in the group to bond. If you don’t want them to come to your place, then you can ask them all over to your boyfriend’s place. Just make sure that you both agree on this first!


You can ask your boyfriend to co-host. Having dinner with friends is enjoyable and informative. You will be able to talk to his friends in a social setting.

, Perhaps tackling an entire group of friends seems overwhelming. That’s understandable. You might try finding one friend that you think is easy to spend time with and try to focus your efforts on getting to know them. This will make it less difficult to spend time with his friends because you now have a friend in the group.

Give him time to hang out with his friends.,
Hang out with your friends.,
Spend some time alone.",How to Accept Your Boyfriend's Friends3," In the first throes of a new relationship, you may want to spend as much time together as possible. Try not to monopolize your boyfriend’s time. Instead, try suggesting that he tell you when he wants to be with his friends. If you tell him this, then he will know that you want him to spend time with his friends and that you don’t resent him for wanting to do so.


This is also a good way to avoid activities that do not interest you. For example, if you are not interested in going to a concert with his friends, you can tell him that you want him to have time with his buddies.

, When your boyfriend is with his friends, you don’t need to just sit at home alone. You can go and spend time with the people in your life that you enjoy. You and your boyfriend don’t need to be together all the time. In fact, spending time with your own friends will make you feel better as well!, Sure, you might want to be with your boyfriend when he is with his friends, but sometimes it’s better that he spend time with just them. Or, maybe you want to have time alone after you hang out with your boyfriend and his friends. Either way, don’t be afraid to take the initiative. Read that book that you have lying on your nightstand or take the walk you’ve been longing for. You know that you are in a good relationship if you can take alone time!This time is necessary for self-reflection. However, it is possible to use this as a tactic to make your partner more receptive to you. Try not to do this. You don’t use this as an excuse to avoid spending time with your boyfriend.
Some ways for asking for alone time are better than others, you don’t want to simply shout “I need alone time!” If you do this, you run the risk of giving the impression that you are feeling smothered by your partner. Instead, you should gently say in a calm voice, “Hey, I think I need to spend a few hours alone today.”

Talk to your parents.,
Mention your girlfriend from time to time.,
Talk to your girlfriend.",How to Act in Front of Your Parents with Your First Girlfriend1," Even if your parents have already met your girlfriend, it's a good idea to reference your girlfriend every now and then and to tell them a little bit about her. Your parents probably are curious about her and they may have questions about your relationship. It's best to clear these up before you all spend time together because that way your parents will feel more familiar with her., If something comes up that relates to your girlfriend's interests or skills, mention her in conversation. Slipping your girlfriend into your everyday conversation will show your parents that she is someone special in your life.


For example, if your girlfriend does ballet and you see an ad in the paper about a dance performance, say something like ""Sarah would love that; she is a really talented ballerina."" Your parents want to know that you are serious about your girlfriend.
If you only talk about your girlfriend when she is around, your parents may not think you are very serious about her and they may not put as much effort into talking with her or getting to know her, which will make interacting with them when she is around less easy.

, It also is a good idea to talk with your girlfriend about your parents. Even if you've already spent time together, she probably has some questions about them. Everyone's parents are different. Tell your girlfriend about your parents and the way that you were brought up. If, for instance, your family is very religious and she is not, it might be best to tell her to avoid certain topics. "

Don't try to be ""more British"".,
Keep in mind his sense of humour.,
Try to learn his mysterious ways.,
Try to get interested in his culture.,
It's perfectly natural to clash a little.",How to Date a British Boy," He fell in love with you despite your Yankee ways, so don't try to change for him. In addition to the ""be your true self"" issue this presents, most Americans just really suck at being British and look ridiculous when they try.;
, Many Brits have a different sense of humour than Americans, so don't feel hurt or offended if he doesn't laugh at your jokes, and don't get confused if you don't understand his. Brits are often dry and sarcastic, and part of the national humour involves making fun of Americans, but don't take it personally. Keep in mind that he loves you and it's just the way he is. American jokes are funny anyway, because most of it is true.

, ""Mysterious ways"" meaning ""strange British slang"". A lot of words are different across the pond, and you may want to invest in a handy-dandy British-to-American dictionary to decode your boy. For example, a good one to know is ""pants"". In England, ""pants"" are your underwear, and ""trousers"" or ""jeans"" are what we call the things you wear around your legs. So if your Brit gets a new wallet or something and he doesn't know where do put it, you should not under any circumstances suggest that he clip it to his pants. This will only generate awkward silences and funny looks. Also, if he invites you to a ""fancy dress party"", you should not wear your little black dress or a prom gown. Go for something more like some bunny ears, or possibly a clown suit, because a ""fancy dress party"" is a costume party.

, For some reason, the British still have a queen and princes and they drink tea and spell ""favorite"" like ""favourite"" and call cookies ""biscuits"". This may seem to you like some totally strange and bonkers things to do, but remember that were it not for England, you would definitely not be American, so try to get interested in it. You may find some cool bits of culture that you wouldn't expect.

, Hey, you're from two different worlds. It's gonna be hard. But remember that despite your differences, something brought you two together and you love each other.

Make her comfortable.It’s really important that you create a comfortable and safe atmosphere when you ask her out.,
Accept her response.It’s unfortunate, but these things happen.",How to Ask a Girl out if You're in the Friend Zone," Will you still be able to friends if she says no? How will your relationship change once you make your romantic feelings clear? Did you become friends with her in the first place because of a romantic interest? Think the scenario through to the end and make sure that you're okay with both possibilities (her saying yes and her saying no).
, As her friend, you have the advantage of knowing what’s going on in her personal life. If she’s going through something difficult or if she’s just broken up with her long-term boyfriend/girlfriend, it’s not the right time to ask her out. If she’s specifically mentioned recently that she doesn’t want a boyfriend/girlfriend, respect her feelings.If it's not the right time for her, you are much more likely to get rejected. Instead, be a good friend to her – that’s what she needs right now. She’ll appreciate and remember it.
Catch her in a good mood. When a person is happy, they tend to react more positively to new things.

, If you’ve never shown any romantic interest in her before, it’s best to send a few hints before you ask her out.Flirt with her and see how she reacts. You don’t have to be over the top with your flirting. It can be as simple as telling her she looks pretty in a new dress, or touching her lightly on the arm when you’re talking to her.


How does she react to the flirting? What’s her body language? Is she facing you directly and looking into your eyes? Is she smiling at you? Does she look comfortable and happy?
Look for positive body language like uncrossed arms, facing you directly, leaning in closer to you, smiling, laughing and meeting your gaze.

, Before you make the leap, you want things to feel pleasant and low pressure for her. If you begin by acting strangely or in an unusually shy manner, she’s going to pick up on that immediately. Awkwardness might set in. To avoid this, start with a fun conversation, make her laugh, and let your personality shine.Once she’s smiling and engaged, then escalate the romance.
Flirt with her in a very obvious way, get a little closer to her, and get ready to make your move.

, However, it’s better to do it face to face so that everything is interpreted the way you want it to be. She will see your facial expression, hear the tone of your voice, and understand clearly what your intentions are.


If you send her a casual text asking if she wants to hang out that night, the implication will be that you’re just friends.
This ends up keeping you in the Friend Zone, which is precisely where you don’t want to be.
Have the conversation somewhere you both feel comfortable, like one of your usual hang out spots or during a lunch break.

, If you are at ease, it will make her feel that way, too. These situations can get awkward very quickly – try to avoid that by continuing the easygoing vibe you already share as friends.


Keep everything positive and speak to her in a warm, genuine way.
She will take her cues from you, so remember to stay calm and keep it positive.

, You don’t have to make a big production out of it, but it’s important that she knows that you want to go out with her, not hang out with her. Being completely passive when you have feelings for someone is one of the major reasons why people end up permanently in the Friend Zone.Say something like, “I really love hanging out with you and I’m starting to have feelings for you as more than a friend. I’m hoping that maybe you’re starting to feel that way, too. I think it would be awesome to take you out on a proper date.”
By keeping your feelings to yourself, you might miss your chance with her completely.

, Instead of saying, “So, would you like to go out some time?” ask her out for a specific day and activity. Your first date doesn’t have to be anything super formal. Even something as simple as, “Would you like to see the new exhibit at the Contemporary Art Museum with me this Saturday?” will work.


Try to pick something that you two have never done together before, so that it has a completely different vibe from one of your regular hang out sessions.
If you choose an activity that you already regularly do together, she might not completely realize your intentions., Tell her something like, “I don’t want to put a strain on our friendship, because I really do love being your friend. If you aren’t into me in a romantic way, I just want you to know that nothing about our friendship will change.""


Add something like, ""We’re still the same people we were before I started this conversation. I want to continue having fun with you, and if you want that to be on a completely platonic level, I will respect that.”

, Don’t be pushy or needy – just be you. Say something like, ""I have feelings for you, but I don't want that to make you feel anxious or uncomfortable. Your friendship is important to me. Please tell me if this conversation makes you feel awkward at all.""


Make sure she knows that whatever her answer is, you’re going to be ok with it.
Things may be a bit awkward at first but eventually the friendship will go back to normal.

, However, how you choose to handle the rejection makes all the difference. When you handle a rejection with grace and maturity, it shows others that you are confident in yourself. Grace, maturity and confidence are all highly attractive qualities.


Just because she doesn’t feel romantically about you now doesn’t mean she’ll always feel that way, so keep a positive attitude.
However, if she does say that she might have feelings for you in the future, don't put your love life on hold. Her saying this is essentially a ""no."" You should pursue other people if you want to and should not count on her feeling differently in the future.
At the very least, she will appreciate this as your friend, because it enables you both to continue your friendship.

Don't overdo the PDA.,
Act respectfully towards your girlfriend.,
Don't talk about personal things with your parents around.",How to Act in Front of Your Parents with Your First Girlfriend2," This is your first girlfriend, and you want your parents to understand how much she means to you. However, this doesn't mean acting the same way you do around your girlfriend when you're both alone together. Overdone PDA can cause the interaction to be a lot more uncomfortable for your parents, and it could affect their view of the relationship.


If you want to show your girlfriend your support and affection, put your arm around her or give her hand a squeeze. This is a mature level of physical interaction between a couple and will not make your parents uncomfortable.
Avoid prolonged kissing or touching. Although this might be normal for the two of you around others, this is not a good way to act around your parents. They will appreciate your maturity if you abstain from this kind of behavior around them. , It's important to show your parents that you respect your girlfriend. Do not tease, yell or swear around her in any way. You may be feeling vulnerable or even confused about how to act in this interaction. It's important to remember that your girlfriend is probably feeling the same way! Make sure that you treat her with support and respect and make her proud to be dating you.

, Although you and your girlfriend may talk together about every topic under the sun, there are just certain things that your parents don't want to hear. Keep everything G-rated when they are around. Talk to your girlfriend in the same way your would talk to a close friend and keep the conversation family friendly.

"
Don't ignore your parents.,
Don't be rude to your parents.,
Stay positive.,
Talk about your girlfriend.,
Talk about things you've done together.,
Ask questions.",How to Act in Front of Your Parents with Your First Girlfriend3," If your girlfriend is coming over to your house, don't immediately invite her upstairs without talking to your parents first. Even though it may be awkward to chat with your parents with your girlfriend there, having your girlfriend and your parents talk is actually a way to make it more comfortable in the future. The more they get to know each other the less strange it will feel every time she comes over.

, Even if you are feeling weird or awkward, be respectful of your parents. Your girlfriend will appreciate that you have a good relationship with your parents and that you are acting mature. It will also make the situation a lot more comfortable because it will make your parents want to put forth effort into talking to you and your girlfriend. It could also save you the embarrassment or your parents calling you out in front of her!

, A good way to ensuring a good interaction is to stick to positive subject matters. No one wants to feel depressed, and sometimes when depressing subjects come up they cause a lull in the conversation. Plus, your parents want to know that you and your girlfriend make each other happy. Instead of talking about heavy or upsetting topics, talk about more happy subject matters.


One good thing you can talk about is a funny story that involves both of you. This puts your relationship in a positive light and will put a smile on everyone's face!
Smile when you're talking. You may feel really awkward but smiling is a way to put everyone at ease. Studies even show that smiling can improve your mood and makes you feel more relaxed!, Your parents are curious about your girlfriend! They want to know more about her and are excited to be meeting her. When you are all talking together, mention something positive about her, whether it be a talent or an interest of hers. This will give you all something to talk about, and will let you parents interact with your girlfriend. It can also help to take some of the pressure off of you if are still feeling nervous!

, This is a great topic if you are looking for things to talk about. Because it involves your girlfriend, she will be able to contribute to the conversation so the burden won't just be on you. Aside from having something to talk about, studies show that talking about shared experiences is a great way for couples to strengthen their relationship. , This is a tried and true way of getting any conversation off the ground. If you feel like you don't know what to talk about with your parents and your girlfriend, ask your parents a question! This keeps the ball rolling in the conversation and takes the focus from you. Even asking your parents about how their day went or what's for dinner will lead the conversation in a direction, and will allow your girlfriend to jump in to the conversation. "

Get input about what everyone wants to do.,
Decide on something to do.,
Pay attention to your parents and your girlfriend.,
Check in with everyone.,
Express your gratitude.",How to Act in Front of Your Parents with Your First Girlfriend4," Rather than picking out an activity by yourself, it's a good idea to check with the group and see what everyone wants to do. Make sure to do something that everyone is comfortable with. If your dad hates heights, don't suggest something that would put him in an uncomfortable position. Make sure that everyone is on board and excited about the activity.

, Try to reach a consensus about what would be the best activity for all of you. Although it might seem daunting to go do something with your girlfriend and your parents, it has the potential of being a great bonding experience. Doing things together creates memories between all of you and can make everyone feel closer to each other and more comfortable in the future. Just because you are choosing to do an activity, it does not need to be something incredibly exciting or time-consuming. Even having dinner could be a good thing to do all together. Other options could be talking a walk around the neighborhood or seeing a play or movie together. An activity that involves physical exertion is always a good option, as studies show that exercise increases your mood. Pick an activity that you feel suits you all best. Go for something casual over something fancy. You want to feel at ease when you are all doing something together. A casual setting can help you to relax, while a formal one might make you feel nervous or stiff.

, Although some activities can be engaging or exciting, make sure that you don't get too wrapped up! After all, this is supposed to be a time when your girlfriend and parents are getting to know each other. You are the common denominator between them, so don't forget about your role as a bridge between them Make sure that you are not paying attention only to your girlfriend or only to your parents. If you are at dinner, make sure everyone is included in the conversation. If you and your girlfriend are on the same ping-pong team, for example, make sure to talk to your parents as well.
Try to keep up conversation between your parents and your girlfriend. Just because you are all doing an activity, that doesn't mean you can't talk! If you are playing a game, talk about how its going, it doesn't have to be anything deep!
Don't be too competitive. Maybe you're a naturally competitive person. Or maybe your mom always beats you at bowling and you're finally winning for once. It's important not to be competitive when you are doing activities with your parents and your girlfriend. The point of doing something together is to bond, not to win. Try to remember that even if you have a competitive urge.

, Make sure that they are all enjoying the activity that you are doing. If one of them looks like they aren't having fun, go over to them and check up with them. If they aren't enjoying themselves, ask them what they would like to do after the activity is over. If they don't have a preference, ask everyone or suggest an activity and see how everyone feels about it. Remember that this is about everyone having a good time.

, After the activity is over, tell your parents and girlfriend how much fun you had. You can even say something like, ""Thanks for doing that with me, I had a lot of fun."" Even if you didn't have a fantastic time, it is a nice way of letting your parents and your girlfriend know that you appreciate them and that you want them all to get along together. This gratitude could go a long way in making interactions between everyone easier! "

Look for a crush.,
Make sure he's available.,
Get friendly with him.,
Find an event you can both be at.,
Be confident.,
Make the situation comfortable.,
Handle yourself calmly.,
Be happy if he agrees.,
Be friendly to his friends and introduce him to your friends.",How to Get a Boyfriend in Primary School," Don't just look for a boyfriend just because all your friends have got them! Crushes are the first place to look for boyfriend potential. After all, crushes are all about thinking they're date-worthy. And don't think of a celebrity as your boyfriend, because odds are you'll probably never date them (so get off the idea of dating Aston Merrygold or Taylor Lautner or whoever it is you dream about). Go for boys you're fairly familiar with, like your next door neighbor's son or a boy in your class.;
, If he's dating someone else that means he's off limits. He may tell his friends that it's casual, but girls are much more sensitive and think things like love are always serious. So ask the people closest to him first if he's with somebody to avoid a huge fight

, Get to know this guy first before you ask him out. Find out about what he likes, dislikes, wants to be when he's older, even his favorite TV show! Maybe you'll find that you have things in common.


Volunteer to do projects with him if you're in the same class. Be casual about it. You may learn that you like or dislike the same things, and projects are a great way to get close to someone.

, Special things like the school disco or the Halloween party are great events to float the idea of dating. This means both you and that special boy will be familiar with the surroundings. Plus, you have some friends there to turn to if the date doesn't go so well (fingers crossed it won't, though).

, Before you pluck up the courage to ask this boy out, relax your arms, clear your face, speak up and smile. This will indicate that you're approachable and bubbly when you come to meet this boy. Boys don't really fancy girls who hide behind their hair and are too shy. They like girls who stand out. Make yourself known.


Make sure you're clean and look pretty if/when you ask him out. In fact, make sure you're clean and pretty whenever you see him. You never know when he might pop up, so be prepared.
Remind yourself, if you're nervous, that it's only a boy. You may have a big, fat crush on him — and he's probably adorable — but it's not a big deal if you mess up or he says ""no,"" for whatever reason. You're special, and other boys would be lucky to have you.
Ask him yourself. Don't get a friend to do it. You'll make a bigger impression on him if you ask him yourself. Decide whether you want to ask him in person or over IM or Facebook or the like. In person is probably best, but if you're super nervous, you can do IM in a pinch.

, One of the biggest mistakes a girl can make is to pass the boy a note during class. This boy will almost definitely tell all his friends about it, and we all know what boys are like — they'll hound you about it! If he's alone, tell him you want to ask him something and go for it, head on! (Hesitation tells him that you might not be able to hold a conversation.)


However, if he's with his friends, ask him to talk to you in private and ignore his friends if they start to snigger. You don't care, right? You only care about the boy, not his friends.

, If the boy rejects you, try not to worry about it. You're going to face rejection a lot in life, so if he says no, it's not the end of the world. Tell him you can go on being friends. Most girls have more than one crush, so there's still hope.


If he says no then just be cool and carry on being his friend. Its not the end of the world. There are plenty more fish in the sea. You never know, he might like you in the future

, If he says yes, keep your cool and smile. But don't get too laid-back, he'll think someone dared you to do it and it'll hurt his feelings; boys aren't as confident you think! Even a little ""Really? Cool!"" or ""Great!"" will make this boy think you're even more committed and cute, both personality- and appearance-wise. And before you go off squealing to your friends, ask him if you can tell people about it so he has some say in this new relationship. Make him think he wears the pants, even if he doesn't!

, If you're now dating, then get to know his friends and tell your friends the news.

Ask friends to set you up.,
Get involved in extracurricular activities.,
Have realistic expectations.,
Socialize.,
Attend high school events.,
Ask someone out.,
Go into a date with a positive attitude.,
Date regularly.,
Be yourself.,
Wear something that makes you feel attractive on dates.,
Transition into a relationship.,
Use social media wisely.,
Compromise.,
Keep up with other obligations.,
Do not stay with someone who does not respect you.",How to Get a Boyfriend in High School," One of the easiest ways to meet a romantic partner is to ask friends to set you up. If you have friends who are particularly social, tell them you'd like to try dating. Ask if they know any single guys who may be a good match for someone like you.The main advantage of asking your friends to set you up is that your friends know you. They're familiar with your interests and personality. They'll be able to find someone who's a good match for you.
Being set up by a friend also helps to make sure you're finding a quality guy. You do not want to end up in a relationship only to find out, down the road, your new boyfriend has a reputation for being kind of a jerk. Your friends can verify that a guy is a decent person deserving of your time.;
, If you want to find a boyfriend, you need to get out and meet new people. Try getting involved in some extracurricular activities. This can help you find a potential boyfriend.


Choose extracurricular activities relevant to your interests. You're more likely to find a potential match if the two of you have shared interests. If you're fascinated by journalism, join the newspaper.Try going to an event by yourself. It can be stressful to go to a school club solo, but you may come off as more approachable if you're not surrounded by friends. If you look like you came alone, a potential boyfriend may be inclined to introduce himself as he'll sense you're new.If you know a certain club tends to have a lot of male members, consider joining this group. With more men to chose from, you'll have a better chance of finding a single guy who you're interested in dating.

, In high school, it's easy to get lost in romanticized daydreams. If you're imagining meeting a Prince Charming-type on your first day of drama club, cut the daydreaming. You may close yourself off to perfectly acceptable young men by setting your expectations sky high. Try to think in loose terms. Instead of having a laundry list of attributes you want in a potential match, instead think to yourself that you're looking for a nice, reasonably attractive guy who has some of the same interests as you., If you want to meet someone, you need to put yourself out there. Even if you're naturally shy by nature, you need to be social if you want to find a boyfriend.


Try to strike up a conversation with a guy you don't know. Sit down at a new lunch table. Talk to the guy sitting across from you in Spanish class.
Starting a conversation with someone you don't know well can be stressful. You can try to make conversation based on what's happening around you, which is easy to do when you're both in school. For example, you could say something like, ""Wow! Last week's exam was intense, right?""

, With permission of your parents, try to start attending school events regularly. Things like dances, sports games, bake sales, and pep rallies are all great ways to branch out and connect with potential boyfriends.Sports games may be particularly fun, as there will be students from other schools in attendance. If you're not interested in any guys in your own school, you can meet someone from another school.
For safety reasons, it may be a good idea to go with friends. Unlike extracurricular activities, many school events may take place late at night away from school. It's a good idea to go in a group, just to be on the safe side.

, It can be stressful to ask someone out. However, putting yourself out there and being brave is part of the process of finding a boyfriend. Even if it's outside your comfort zone, ask a guy you're interested in out on a date.


It's okay if it takes you a few days to get up the nerve to ask someone out. This is normal, especially if you're new to dating. You can spend a few days talking to friends. If you have a friend who has a boyfriend or a girlfriend, ask this person for advice.
You can ask someone out by bringing up mutual interests. For example, maybe you've both talked about a love of horror films. You could ask the guy if he'd be interested in seeing the new horror film coming to your local theater on Friday.
You can ask someone out in a fairly casual manner. Try saying something like, ""Would you be interested in getting coffee with me after school some time?"" If you want to make sure the guy knows it's a date, you can add something like, ""Just the two of us."" If you feel comfortable, you can flat out saying, ""Would you like to go on a coffee date with me this weekend?"" A guy may appreciate this frankness.

, Once you've met a few potential boyfriends, you can begin going on dates. When going into a date, set out with a positive attitude.


Stay calm going into a date. Do not worry about something going wrong. Instead, go in with the expectation that you're going to have fun. If it helps, you can make a mental list of conversation topics. This may ease your worry about running out of things to talk about, making the date easier.
If you're nervous, you may inadvertently engage in behavior that can put off your date. For example, you may rip up a piece of bread from the bread basket instead of eating it. Trying to be positive can help you put out your best self, allowing the date to run smoothly., It can take awhile to find someone you click with. Therefore, make dating a priority. Try to go out on dates regularly. You may have a lot of bad dates, or so-so dates, before you find a guy that's right for you.


Be prepared to meet someone everywhere you go. Dress in a flattering fashion when you go out. Introduce yourself to guys who seem interesting. However, make sure to be safe. If you're outside of school, be careful who you converse with and be sure to travel with friends.If you get asked out, take a chance. Even if you feel lukewarm with someone, your feelings may change on a date. You should also be brave and ask a guy out if you're interested. He may say ""No,"" but you'll never know if you don't make the effort.

, Many people want the companionship of a romance in high school. However, keep in mind you should be yourself. Do not give up aspects of your personality in order to win male affection. For example, if you worry a guy won't be interested in a nerdy girl, don't quit the science team. Pursuing your interest in science is more important for your longterm goals and you do not want to date someone who does not like you for you.

, A lot of attraction comes down to confidence. On a date, wear something that makes you feel attractive. If you feel confident and beautiful going into a date, you're more likely to come off that way. This can help the date go smoothly.


Chose your favorite outfit for a date, even if it doesn't feel like a date outfit. If you feel comfortable and relaxed, you're more likely to have a good time.
While you should primarily dress in a way that makes you feel good, if you know some of your date's preferences, it's okay to dress towards those preferences in a way that makes you feel comfortable. If your date is interested in the athletic type, consider wearing a pair of jeans and sneakers that you feel are flattering on you.

, After a certain point in casual dating, you may want to transition into a relationship. If you've been seeing someone regularly for a few weeks, it's appropriate to ask about the status of your relationship.


Make sure you have the conversation face-to-face. Text can obscure meaning. It can be a little stressful to ask. However, if you've been seeing a guy regularly, he probably won't be surprised by the boyfriend talk. Try to introduce the subject directly. Don't say, ""We need to talk,"" as this can indicate something is wrong. Just pose the question.Review what's been happening in the relationship. Say something like, ""So, we've been hanging out almost every weekend, and we talk every day. I really enjoy spending time with you."" Then, say something like, ""I just wanted to know if it's okay to call you my boyfriend or not.""There is a chance the guy may not be interested in an official relationship at this time. If a relationship is something you want, and he doesn't, it may be best to cut your losses and move on. While rejection can hurt, you should not settle for a relationship that does not meet your basic expectations.

, When you're in high school, it can be very hard to stay away from social media. You and your friends likely engage in a lot of socialization through outlets like Twitter and Facebook. However, use discretion when posting about your relationship.


Your boyfriend may not like having details about himself posted online. He may get annoyed or embarrassed if you post about your relationship all the time. Before posting something, make sure it's okay with him.You should not post any rude or aggressive statuses directed at your boyfriend when the two of you are fighting. This will only serve to escalate the argument.
Remember, if you put something on the internet, it's there forever. You should use discretion when posting about aspects of your relationship. Do not post anything you would not want a future college or employer to see.

, Compromise is the key to any relationship. It can be hard to compromise when you're young, however, which is why many high school relationships are short-lived. Take turns selecting movies for movie nights or choosing events for Friday nights. If your boyfriend is not interested in hanging out with your friends on a particular night, try to let this go. Compromising on occasion can help you avoid arguments., It can be easy to get caught up in a high school romance. However, keep in mind you have many more important obligations than your boyfriend. Make sure you keep up with school work, extracurricular activities, and your relationships with your other friends.


While you may not like to think about the fact, the vast majority of high school relationships end. While your boyfriend may seem like the biggest deal in the world right now, you will likely not think of him much in a few years. Prioritize your homework and grades over your boyfriend, as they will matter more longterm.

, When you are dating in high school, make sure to respect yourself. You should not stay with anyone that does not respect your boundaries, physical and otherwise.


Many high school students start experimenting with sex and intimacy for the first time. You should not engage in sexual activity before you feel you are completely ready. You should always use condoms to prevent pregnancy and STDs. If your boyfriend pushes you to get more physical than you want, seriously reevaluate the relationship. You deserve to be with someone who respects your boundaries.
You should also watch out for anyone who is overly possessive or jealous. If your boyfriend expects you to spend less time with your friends, you should be wary of the relationship. Your boyfriend should also want you to succeed. He should not discourage you from getting your homework and other obligations done on time.

Occasionally touch his arm during your conversation to grab his attention and show that you’re warm, outgoing, and physically comfortable with him.

, Don't worry, this isn’t going to get you stuck in the dreaded “friend zone.” Rather, it’s an important first step especially if you just met him; it shows initiative and indicates that you’re interested in the guy while establishing a portal for further communication.

, The more you two happen to bump into each other, the more face-time you’ll have, and the more chances for you to win him over.


Frequent the places he likes to hang around at school, work, restaurants, or around town. Obviously, you don’t want to be stalker-ish and be waiting for him around every corner, but strategically plan to cross paths once a day during the next 7 days.
Get involved in the clubs and activities that your love-target is interested in. You’ll show that you share common interests, but you’ll also end up seeing a lot more of each other if you're involved in the same activities., Don’t wait for him to do it!

If she says yes, success! You've got yourself a date and (likely) a boyfriend.
If he declines, don’t sweat it. If he isn’t into you it wouldn’t be fun trying to date him anyway. Move on to someone else ---- there are plenty of other boys out there, and at least one who will dig you for you.

Keep things casual.",How to Ask a Girl out in High School if You Are Shy and She Does Not Know You," If she’s cramming for a test before the bell rings or having an intense conversation with a friend, it’s probably best to wait. Find a time when she’s alone and doesn’t look like she’s in a rush to get anywhere, such as in the cafeteria or after school lets out.If she’s constantly surrounded by friends, don’t be afraid to say, “Can I talk to you for a second?”
See if you have any common interests. Is she apart of the debate team? You could try it out too as a built-in way to meet her. If there are breaks or club outings, you could try to strike up a conversation during those times.;
, Don’t spout off a cheesy pick-up line the second you’re face-to-face, but have a general idea about what you’re going to say. This can be as general as a question about her day, or you can cut right to the chase and tell her you’re interested. Either way, it’s great to have an idea going into the conversation so that you aren’t faced with awkward silence.You could say something like, ""Hi ! Happy it's almost Friday?"" If you see her holding a specific textbook or going into a classroom, you could ask her about that. ""Hey , you have history with Mr. Smith? I heard he's great, do you like him?""
A general rule of thumb is to talk to her as if you already know her. This doesn’t mean you should act like you’re best friends, but don’t act like you’re talking to your teacher or principal. Say something like, ""Hey , how's your week going so far?"" rather than, ""Hello , how are you today?""

, Even if you've planned out a perfect opener and have a great idea about what you want to talk to her about, you need to also convey confidence with your body language. Keep your head up, and make eye contact with her. Make sure you're standing up straight, and take a wide stance so that you look secure in your space.Take care not to wring your hands or nervously fiddle with your clothes or backpack.


If you feel nervous, that's perfectly normal. The trick is simply not letting it show. It sounds silly, but practice your stance in the mirror before you approach her. Make sure you notice your nervous habits, and work on correcting them.
You could also try making a practice video with your phone to hear how you will sound when speaking to her. Take note of any times you looked or sounded nervous & practice again until you are comfortable. Delete the videos when you’re done if you want to.

, If you thought she was free when you grabbed her to talk but you see her checking her watch or angling her body to the closest exit, she probably has somewhere to be.That’s OK, though, because you don’t need to talk to her for hours to ask her out. Try saying something like, “I’m sure you have somewhere you need to be and I won’t hold you up, but I wanted to see if you’re free this weekend to grab dinner.”


This is short, sweet, and straight to the point. You asked her out while at the same time showing her that you respect her time.
If she seems uncomfortable or in a rush, respect that. Don’t ruin your chances with her by forcing a conversation when she can’t talk.

, If you don’t know her well (or at all), be brave and tell her why you approached her. If you think she is really well spoken in English class, tell her that. If you think she’s really beautiful and you’d love to get to know her personality, tell her that. “Playing it cool” can work sometimes, but if you don’t know her at all, you should lay your cards on the table.A good, respectful compliment is almost always appreciated. This will help her see you in a positive light right off the bat.
Be genuine with your compliments. Don't just give her the compliments you think most girls would want to hear. What do you truly, genuinely like about her? If it's welcoming smile, tell her that. If it's her confidence, tell her that. If she can tell that your compliment is coming from your heart, it will mean much more.

, Whether it’s one class you share, the neighborhood you live in, or a mutual friend, use it to strike up a conversation. If you can’t think of anything specific that you have in conversation, you can even comment on the weather! Any shared experiences are helpful to get the conversation rolling, and to help make her feel more relaxed.If you truly cannot think of some similarity, that’s fine. You can always ask her a question about something she is interested in that you’re not familiar with.

, The overused cliché to “be yourself” is so important in this situation. If the girl can tell you are being genuine and putting yourself out there, she will be much more likely to reciprocate. If she thinks you’re trying to play a part or act like a person you aren’t, she will have her guard up too.Not only does this make you look endearing, but it also saves you time! What’s the point of going out with a girl who doesn’t like your true personality? You can’t act like someone you are not for very long.

, If you don't have much in common or any overlap with your social activities or circles, create common ground. Try talking about an upcoming school event, like school play, a party, a sporting event, or anything you think she might be interested in. You could also talk about something in the news. The important thing is to find something, anything, to connect on, so that she can walk away from the conversation with a specific memory.


Asking her how she is and saying you're looking forward to the weekend is fine, but connecting on a specific topic will add much more substance to the conversation.

, “Do you want to hang out sometime?” is much different than, “Would you like to see a movie on Friday night?” If you are vague with your invitation, she can be vague with her answer. Instead, give her a specific event that you’d like to take her to, and she can give you a concrete answer.Not only will this help “set things in stone,” but it will also show her that you took the time to plan ahead and decide on a great date for her.

, If you give her a specific time and she is already busy, ask her if another time works for her. This will show her that you’re flexible, and also that you’re very enthusiastic about the idea of taking her out. Don’t give up if your original plan doesn’t work with her schedule– let her pick a time that works for her.If she says she needs to check her schedule or get back to you, let her do just that. You can simply end the conversation by saying, “I’d really love to take you out, so please let me know when you’re available!” You’ve done everything you can do, and the ball is in her court.

, You are not proposing marriage, and your life doesn’t hang in the balance. You are simply asking her if she would like to get to know you better. If she says no, that is okay. You can always leave it open and get to know her better as friend. If you two become friends first, she may be more comfortable going on a date with you. Or you could move on, and find another lucky lady to ask out. If she says yes, fantastic! Take her on a date and see if you connect. Just remember, you will survive no matter what happens.If you are nervous, sweating bullets, and acting like this is the most serious thing you’ve ever done, she will probably be a little intimidated. Keep the mood light and cheery, and she will feel much more at ease around you.

Remember that the worst thing that can happen is that he or she says ""no.""",How to Ask a Stranger Out," Think about all the couples you've known in your life. How did each of them meet? The answer is probably dozens of different ways. Many of them were probably complete strangers before one person asked the other on a date. Remember that you may meet your future partner anywhere and at any time. You may run into someone one early morning at the gym or late one night at a show.;
, Don't keep your eyes glued to your phone as you go about your day. Instead, look up and be aware of your surroundings as you go for a walk or stand in line at the post office. Be friendly and smile often. For all you know, a stranger could have been trying to ask you out while you were busy texting., In addition to finding someone physically attractive, you will also want someone who is fun to be around. A simple way to connect is through shared tastes and interests.


Go to local meetups geared towards your hobbies. Many people who take part in such groups are single and may also be looking for someone.
Take note of what the person is wearing or doing. Is he or she reading a book by your favorite author? Wearing a shirt of your favorite lesser-known band? He or she may be the perfect candidate to ask out.

, While bars and clubs are the most popular place to find a date, there are plenty of other locales to hang out. Coffee shops are one great option. Parks, parties, and even libraries are some other great ideas.If you live in a small town or rural area without many other people around, checking online dating websites may be a better option than hoping to meet someone in real life.

, This is especially important to remember if you are a man and the stranger is a woman. Don't approach anyone walking alone on a deserted street at night. A good way to make him or her feel safe is to talk when other people nearby and visible.


It's generally a bad idea to ask someone out if he or she is somehow ""trapped"" with you in a location, such as on elevator or when seated next to each other on an airplane. If you don't have any other chance, simply offer your phone number as you part ways (not at the beginning of the ride or flight).

, Look for a gold band and/or a more ornate ring on his or her left ring finger (the one next to the pinky finger). If you see one, respect his or her current relationship and back off.In some countries, such as India, Russia, Norway, Germany, and Chile, engagement rings are traditionally worn on the right hand rather than the left. Keep this in mind if you are currently living in one of these countries. If you think the stranger may be from one of these countries, you may need to ask directly about the engagement to be sure.
In traditional Hindu cultures, married women wear a matching ring on each of their second toes., There are a few circumstances where it's perfectly fine to chat up a potential partner but generally a bad idea to ask them on a date right then.


If you meet at a funeral, the etiquette is very tricky. Absolutely do not exchange numbers during the funeral or the viewing. As long as he or she wasn't particularly close to the deceased (and especially not his or her partner), it may be ok to exchange numbers during the reception or right after. However, the best thing to do in this situation is to ask a mutual friend about him or her a few days later. Just keep in mind that many people will still consider this a turn-off.Business conferences are a bad place to find a date. You never know when that potential partner may end up working at your company, with a competitor, or for a business you contract with. Dating within the corporate world is tricky, and many companies strictly forbid it. Instead of asking for a date immediately, get to know him or her and then ask for a business card. By taking it slowly, you won't risk coming off as unprofessional., Try making eye contact before greeting him or her. State your name and give the stranger a non-vulgar compliment. If he or she responds in kind with a name and a compliment or expression of gratitude, he or she may be interested in you, too. Mention wanting to get to know him or her better.


If he or she ignores your greeting, it's best to back off.
If he or she seems receptive and neither of you are in a hurry, feel free to have a longer conversation.
What you could say: ""Hi! My name is . Do you have time to chat?""

, You should make some small talk before asking a stranger out. However, in a first conversation with someone you're attracted to, it's important to steer clear of two main things: sex and long-term commitment. Knowing what topics are sexual is simple, but avoiding the latter topic may be trickier. Don't plan out more than one date or talk about a future with him or her. Don't bring up family or wanting to get married or have children.


Don't ask for information that may put him or her in a vulnerable position, such as work schedule or where he or she lives.
If you're explicitly looking to ""hook up,"" then feel free to bring up sex. However, just know that many people consider this inappropriate and will be more likely to turn you down.
Unlike most casual conversations, politics and religion shouldn't be totally off limits. If you're looking for a serious relationship and these things are important to you, it's a good idea to discover incompatibilities early on.
Appropriate things to say to express attraction: ""I think you're beautiful "" or ""You have gorgeous eyes.""
Some things you should definitely avoid saying: ""Do you plan on having kids?"" or ""My parents would love you!""

, When someone feels pressured, he or she may panic and agree to a date with no intention of showing up. Trying to pressure someone into a date is also a good way to ruin his or her day.


Always take ""no"" for an answer.
Don't demand information about his or her significant other.
Don't initiate any physical contact. A quick way to come off too strong is to invade someone's personal space.
Be sure to tell him or her that: ""It's totally ok if you're not interested"" or ""If you're too busy to talk, it's no big deal"" or ""Just let me know if I'm bothering you.""

, While some people think that a guy is always ""supposed"" to ask a girl for her phone number, it's best to offer yours first regardless of either of your genders. This takes a lot of pressure off of the other person and may make him or her more open-minded about your offer.Write it down on a scrap of paper instead of insisting the person record it in his or her phone. This can be seen as creepy and manipulative.
If the stranger is interested, he or she will likely volunteer a phone number or email address without you needing to ask.
Something you can say when offering your number: ""Hey, it was really nice meeting you, and I'd like to see you again. Here's my number if you want to hang out.""

, If a person has given you his or her contact information, don't play mind games or expect him or her to make the first move. Ask your prospective date to dinner at a specific restaurant with an idea of day and time. Have a few backup options in case he or she is genuinely busy or averse to a certain food.


If he or she doesn't return that first call or shoots down multiple offers without suggesting alternatives, he or she may not be interested in dating. Even if the person seemed into you before, people can always change their minds. Respect his or her decision and move on.
Tell him or her: ""Hey, it's from yesterday. Are you still interested in getting together? If so, how does this at work for you?""

, That may sound like a cliché, but it's an important fact to keep in mind when asking out someone you don't know. Striking out with a person you have an established relationship with can inject some awkward into your life for some time. An advantage of asking out that cute stranger you just met at a coffee shop is the lack of outside social pressure. Keep this in mind to boost your confidence.

, Before you ask her out, you want to know what your first date will be like. It doesn’t have to be fancy or expensive. If she likes games, ask her out to the arcade. Sports events and movies are also good choices.


Make sure that you’ll have something to do together so that you have something to talk about. Just hanging out at the mall one-on-one could be a lot of pressure for a first date!

, It can be really embarrassing to ask a girl out, especially if you don’t know whether she’ll say “yes” or “no.” But it’s super important that you ask her in person, because otherwise, it could seem like you’re not really into her.

, If she says “yes,” great! But there are reasons why a girl might say “no” to a date. She might not want a relationship with any boy, or she may not feel like she knows you well enough. Or -- and it’s hard to hear, but it’s sometimes the truth -- you just may not be her type. If she says “no,” don’t take it personally!

Approach him in person.,
Make plans like he already has your number.,
Use an excuse.,
Trick your crush into calling you.,
Play it cool.",How to Get Your Crush's Number1," This technique works better if you are face to face with your crush. This tactic requires you to trick your crush into calling or texting you to find out some sort of information. The key is to express interest in an activity but tell him you are in a rush.


Start small and say, “hey James”. Then follow up with a question about an event he’s interested in or even what he’s doing over the weekend. Express an interest in the plans.
Try something like: “let me know if you end up going” or “maybe we can go together”
As a result, your crush will be backed into a corner and may have no choice but to ask for your number. Once he calls or texts you, you can save his contact information to your phone.;
, Invite your crush to an event with a larger group of friends. Tell him that you can text the details later, and try to walk away. Your crush should realize that the two of you have never exchanged numbers and mention it right then and there.It is essential that the event you invite your crush to is a group event. Group events are non-committal and less nerve-wracking. Your crush is more likely to respond favorably in this set of circumstances than he might if you invite him on a date.
Try to make the group consist of people your crush knows casually but not too well. If the group consists of your crush's close friends, odds are, he will know someone else's phone number and just text that person for the details instead of you.
Start walking away as soon as you make the invitation. If you hang around too long, your crush might ask you for the details then and there.
Your crush will likely respond in one of three ways. With any luck, he will call or text you right then to store his number in your phone. If this does not happen and the event passes, he might ask you for your number afterward, so he doesn’t miss out next time. Of course, there is also a chance that your crush will not ask at all, in which case, he probably isn't interested in exchanging digits.

, Instead of making plans, you can offer your phone number to your crush on a “just in case” basis. Think of a specific circumstance that you and your crush share and develop an excuse around that. If you can do this skillfully, your crush may even ask for your number without you offering it.If the two of you share a class, use that as a starting place. Consider your options. If you are great at math and your crush struggles with it, you could offer tutoring whenever he gets stuck on a homework problem. Similarly, if your crush knows in advance that he will be absent, tell him that you are just a phone call away if he needs an update on what was missed.For a crush that shares an extracurricular activity with you: offer your phone number and tell him to use it if he needs a ride to or from school.
When you and your crush root for the same sports team, use that as an opportunity to hand over your number. Say that you will miss the big game this weekend and ask your crush to text you with an update on the score.

, When hanging out with your crush, mention that the ringer on your phone has been acting up and ask your crush to call it. This should prompt him to ask for your number. Once your crush calls you, you’ll get his number without even asking for it.


You and your crush need to be talking alone so that no one else offers to call your phone instead.
Once your crush calls you, act relieved about the fact that your phone went off. Make it convincing, but try not to get too carried away.

, Once you and your crush have exchanged phone numbers, stay calm about it. Do not call or text that night. Give it some time to prevent yourself from seeming too intrigued.It’s okay if he figures out your plan and knows you like him. If he likes you back, he’ll have even more of a reason to ask you out.

Spend time thinking about your own feelings.,
Take some time to get to know her.,
Prepare what you want to say.,
Don't rely too much on canned lines.",How to Tell a Girl Your Feelings if You're Shy1," What about this girl attracts you? Why do you feel the way you do? What are your feelings for this girl -- romantic, friendly, confused? Take some time to think about what you want out of your relationship so you can have a clearer idea of what to so.


It can help to write down your feelings, potentially as a letter to her. You don't have to send it, but writing down your feelings can help you get a handle on them.;
, Find out some things you have in common, and things you don't. Things you agree about, and things you don't. You and her could end up liking the same thing, and not even have had the slightest clue because she's been hiding it so well.


If you don't talk often, try and get her to initiate conversation. Hang out with her and her friends, sit next to her at class, and put yourself in a place to chat.

, Think about your feelings and find a way to say them. You might write down a few lines, get together a quick ""practice line,"" or rehearse the conversation in the mirror.


""I think you're great, and would love a chance to get to know you more.""
""I really enjoy our friendship, and I was hoping we could go on a date or two to see where things go.""
""Let's go out on a date sometime.""

, Preparation aside, you have to be ready to improvise when the actual conversation starts. This can be difficult if you are naturally shy, so don't try and overdo it. Say what you want to say quickly, then let her talk from there. Your response doesn't have to be planned, and it will come off more naturally if it is not.

Remain calm.,
Give him a straight answer.,
Suggest somewhere you can focus on each other.,
Confirm your plans.",How to React When a Boy Asks You Out1," If you've been waiting a long time for this particular guy to ask you out, it’s easy to get flustered or overly excited. Instead, remain calm while letting him know that you’re excited about the date. Smile and tell him you’d love to go on a date.;
, It can be tempting to play hard-to-get when a guy asks you on a date, but you should try not to. If he had the courage to ask you out, you should give him a straight answer as soon as possible, instead of playing hard to get.For example, you should say something like “I’d love to go out with you!” instead of “Well, let me check my calendar and get back to you.”
It is okay to agree to the date but tell him you have to check to see when you’re available, particularly since you might be busy. Say something like “I’d love to go out – I think I’m free next Friday but let me check my calendar.”

, If he doesn’t ask you to go on a date to a specific location, you can respond to his date request by making a suggestion yourself. This has the double benefit of letting him know you’re excited about the date and making sure you go somewhere where you feel comfortable.Examples of good first date places are quiet coffee shops or bars. Try to avoid going to the movies on a first date, or going out to eat. You can’t talk in a movie so you won’t know anymore about him after the date than you did before. Trying to eat a meal and talk at the same time is also difficult., It’s a good idea to confirm the plans you’ve made for your date the night before or the afternoon of the date. It lets him know you’re looking forward to the date. It also prevents you from showing up at the wrong place or at the wrong time."
"
Ask in person or online.,
Think of a good excuse.,
Be direct about seeing her.,
Give it time.",How to Get Your Crush's Number2," If you know your crush well enough and communicate via email or social media, you can ask for her number while talking online. Asking in person works just as well, but requires a bit more self confidence.


Bring it up during conversation. Being direct is a good thing, but time your directness to be more effective. Try to let the question appear organic in the conversation.
Ask her out. If she is interested on going on a date, then ask for her phone number.

, If you have a good reason to ask for her number, she is more likely to comply. Use the circumstances in your life to figure out an appropriate excuse. Focus on circumstances the two of you share to make the act more organic.


A shared class is a great starting point. If the two of you are in the same group for a project, ask for her number so that you can arrange a meet-up for a project outside of class. Likewise, if you have trouble with a particular topic that your crush excels at, ask your crush if she might be willing to help you with your homework over the phone.
Work is another great place to get a phone number organically. Ask for her number if you need someone to check the schedule for you. Alternatively, ask for her number in case she needs a ride to work in the rain.

, If you feel bold and confident about the possibility that your crush might have similar feelings, you could offer your phone number directly without an excuse.Nothing beats being straight to the point on matters of romance.


Stay cool and confident. Make a simple statement: give your phone number and tell your crush to text you if he or she feels like it. If your feelings are mutual, your crush will probably give you her number in exchange.If you and your crush are already flirtatious with each other, you can ask for your crush's number in the midst of flirting. Say something simple like, ""I'll give you my number if you give me yours."" Keep the mood lighthearted to avoid putting too much pressure or tension on the situation.

, As before, you should avoid using your crush's number that same night you get it. If you are too zealous about sending the first text or placing the first phone call, you might scare the apple of your eye away.


If you used a specific excuse to get your crush's number, your first call or text should be made with that excuse in mind.
If you did not have an excuse when you asked, however, you can call or text whenever you have something to say.

"
"
Use a business card.,
Find out from a friend.,
Use social media.,
Look it up.,
Have a good reason to call or text.Since she doesn’t know you have her number, she might find it a little creepy if you call or text suddenly without a decent reason.",How to Get Your Crush's Number3," If you and your crush are both adults and part of the professional world, you can indirectly ask for a phone number by asking for a business card.


The downside of this option is that you may end up getting a business phone number instead of a private phone number. Make sure that one of the phone number on the card is marked as a cell phone before calling for personal reasons.

, Asking another person to interfere works well if the third person is a mutual friend with both of you. Ideally, this mutual friend will already have your crush's number. If not, he may be more comfortable asking for it than you are.Your mutual friend may catch onto your motives, so choose who you ask carefully. If you are not ready to have word get back to your crush about how you feel, make sure that the friend you ask can keep a secret.

, Nowadays, you can find out a lot about a person just by snooping online for a bit. The easiest way to find someone's phone number online is to check that person's Facebook page. If the two of you are friends, there is a decent chance that your crush's phone number will be visible to you.

, While there are no free, reliable services that allow you to find anyone's cell phone number, you can simply check the phone book for a home phone number. This might be better than nothing.


This tactic will only work if your crush has a landline and if that number is publicly listed.
Note that if your crush is underage or otherwise lives with her parents you will need to know the names of your crush's parents.

, When you do call, make sure that your reason for doing so sounds justifiably urgent. Acknowledge that you got the number from a third party and explain why you needed it.


For instance, you could call to ask a question about a shared assignment and explain that you got the number from a friend in another class. You could also text an invitation to a group event and mention who passed the number along to you.
You could also just tell her that you wanted to call her to ask her out. Sometimes playing games is not the way to go.

Keep the date simple.",How to Get a Girl in One School Week," If you have been friends, you’ll recognize that the rules and expectations that govern how you communicate with her should be different. If you want to change her mind and get her to view you romantically, do not continue to act like friends. , Never, under any circumstances, do this in a threatening way or in a way that would make her feel uncomfortable. However, little nudges or letting your knees touch when you’re sitting next to each other could help plant the seed that you like her romantically.

, Is a romantic relationship what you actually want? Then tell her that. Understand that this might risk losing her friendship. Do not be friends with a girl in hopes that you can change her mind about you. This is unfair to her as friendships should be based on trust and respect.

, Be honest with her and tell her that you want to be more than friends. If she says she just wants to stay friends, ask yourself if you are able to do that or if it's best just to move on.For example, say something like ""I really have a lot of fun with you and always look forward to seeing you. I was wondering if you felt anything more than friendship between us because I definitely do.""
Your emotions may be too raw after you have been rejected to maintain a friendship. A friendship is based on mutual support and respect. Ask yourself if you can truly give that to her after you have clearly expressed that you see her as more than a friend. Don’t try to force the friendship. Give yourself time to recover.

, Learn more about her. The more you know, the better you’ll be able to flirt and talk with her. Respectfully approach her friends and family and tell them that you’d like to learn more about her. Be open and honest with your intentions and they will better understand how to help you.


Do not present yourself as someone who you are not. This will certainly make things worse if she finds out that you have manipulated those close to her to get your way.
Be polite when meeting her parents. Respectful behavior is important to provide an example of how you will treat their daughter.

, If she says she is unsure or not allowed to date in school, it's not the end of the world. As much as you want to go out with her, it's much more important that you establish respect early on.


Do not suggest that she lies to her parents or goes behind their back. That will only get her into trouble and make you seem selfish for disregarding what her parents want.

, You may get frustrated if things don't go your way. You may not feel like you're being a bully to her but how are you treating her friends? You may not think you're doing anything wrong but if you don't know her friends, your constant questions may seem intimidating. Don’t be a bully!


Research has shown that if you come across as a bully or intimidating that the girl may agree to give you what you want just to get you to stop.Just because you get the response you’re looking for doesn’t mean that she is being sincere. You don't want to build a relationship on these terms.

, Make sure to make a good impression on them as they are her first line of defense. If she is much more popular than you, or in a different social circle, more effort will be required. Try and talk to that group to get closer to her, and be seen in a different light.

, Avoid playing games. You don’t need to immediately tell her that you like her and freak her out, but don’t assume that she thinks one way about you. Always respectfully ask and thank her for letting you know her opinion. Open communication is the easiest way to get to know her.If you find it difficult to get her to share anything about herself or to even have a conversation with her, use open-ended questions to get the conversation flowing like ""What is your favourite class and why?"" or ""Tell me something about yourself that most people wouldn't know by looking at you.""

, Are you listening to respond or are you truly hearing what she is saying? Actively listen to her and ask questions to make sure that you understand what you’ve heard. Don’t be distracted by outside factors. Look for a quiet place or ask to schedule a meeting to ensure that both of you are mentally and emotionally present., If you are maturing fast or very active and notice yourself sweating or smelling bad, start to shower and use deodorant every day. Brush your teeth and comb your hair. Maintaining good personal hygiene is essential.


Keep yourself clean and smelling fresh even when you're not around her because if a rumor picks up that you smell, you may lose your chance before even getting to talk with her.

, Beauty is in the eye of the beholder but what all girls want is a well put together guy. Dressing well shows that you take pride in your appearance. Know your strengths and weaknesses when it comes to your outfits.

, You should be able to talk with her often, your conversations should last, and you should be able to talk with her about multiple topics that are interesting to the both of you. Awkward conversations won't cut it. If something feels forced, changed topics.

, Ask her if she plays video games because there are surprisingly a lot of girls who enjoy video games as much as boys.Ask her if she likes to draw if you like to draw. If you both like the local sports team you can say, ""Hey, did you see yesterday's game?""

, Don't pretend to love something just because you think she does. Know what you like and what you don't so that you have something to talk about. Don't worry about whether or not she likes what you like or admires what you admire. Confidence means stating things which are bold truths and expecting other to respect you for it, whether they agree or not.


Do not be a jerk. Having an opinion doesn't mean other opinions are wrong, just that you may not agree.

, Stand out from the rest of her relationships and treat her in a special way. She will never know that you want to be more than friends unless you make your intentions clear. Create romantic tension to get her excited about the possibility of your relationship moving past friendship and turning into a romance.Give her compliments like ""you look really beautiful in that dress” or ""it's cute how your nose scrunches up when you laugh, I've never noticed that before"".
Don’t speak to every girl you meet the same way. If you are constantly flirting with every girl you meet, none of them will feel special. You may also develop an unsavory reputation for being a “player”, someone who is desperate or someone who just uses women.Don't be creepy or awkward by lingering at her location without saying something. If you have nothing to say, don’t force it. Just greet her and move along.

, You want her to be attracted to you for who you are and not a fake persona that you’ve manufactured. Don’t be fake and put on pretense. It will not only be emotionally draining but it won’t build a lasting relationship.Don’t change your sense of humor or pretend to share the same interests if you don’t actually enjoy the same things. Make sure your compliments are sincere and you genuinely have an interest her.

, Spending time together alone allows you both to get to know each other on a deeper level. Eliminate distractions including cell phones, unwanted visitors, or blaring music. Choose somewhere where you can get some privacy but also is comfortable. She may not be comfortable coming over or you may not be comfortable kissing in public so make an informed choice.Choose an activity that you can both do together like studying, hiking, or grabbing a bite to eat. Make sure you make it clear that it will just be the two of you so you can manage any expectations.

, Some of us are naturally more accustomed to initiating physical touch. If you haven’t already established a pattern of physical contact, communicate your intentions by how you touch her. Touching her means that you not only have to physically get close to her but that you also want to get close to her on an emotional level. Touching her is a great way to flirt and should be done casually.Touch her as a reaction to a joke or get close to her without touching her by complimenting her perfume or her hair.Read over her shoulder or place your hand on her lower back when escorting her somewhere. Although this may seem harmless, subconsciously she will know that you want to get closer to her.

, Ask her out on a high note. You can do this by coming up to her in person where there are few other people, then wait till she is laughing, telling you something about herself, or staring at you intently.You can say something like, ""I've been thinking a lot about you lately and would like to ask if you'd go out with me, just the two of us. I think we could have a great time.""


Asking her out to an activity is better than asking her out to immediately be your girlfriend because it doesn’t put pressure on her. Letting her know that it will just be the two of you and that you’ve been thinking about her sets it up as more than a friendly outing.

, Slip a note in her locker that says something like ""Do you like me? Because I like you."" and at the bottom of the note it could say, ""Return your answer to locker 695.""


This can be taken as a fun cute way to have no commitment or pressure; however, it could also be taken as you being too shy to ask her in person.

, It's not a good idea to ask her when she's with her friends or in a big group because she could become self-conscious if they call attention to any awkwardness by saying ""He totally likes you"". Her friends could also embarrass you or her if they think you aren’t a good match.Never get someone else to ask a girl out on your behalf because she may think that she is being pranked. Keep it casual so you don’t scare her off. The best way to ask her out is to do it in person or call/video chat her.Don't text her asking if she wants to go out because it may be misinterpreted.

, Ask a few friends to go skating, to a movie, or to just hang out at your house. If you are close to her, invite her directly. You can also get a mutual friend who is closer to her to invite her.While everyone hangs out in the group, try not to overwhelm her by singling her out but still interact with her enough so that she's thinking of you.

, Ask her if she has a boyfriend or let her know that you don’t plan on making this uncomfortable or awkward by saying something like, ""Wanna go out sometime? We don't have to kiss or tell anyone”


If she is apprehensive but still says yes, make sure you follow her rules. If she asked you not to tell then don’t tell anyone. If she asked not to kiss in the relationship then don’t pressure her.

, Movies in the afternoons are often acceptable because it's public and gives you something to talk about afterwards. You can also invite her to a shared interest like a sporting event or simply walking around her favorite place to shop.


Offer to meet her there and make sure you let her know that parents are welcome.

Pick a time and place you are comfortable in.,
Find some humor in the situation.,
Go ahead and say it.,
Be honest.,
Prepare yourself for rejection.",How to Tell a Girl Your Feelings if You're Shy2," Make this as easy on yourself as possible by making yourself feel good. Pick a spot that you know well to ease any nervousness or talkative. Good spots generally have few people, are quiet, and are easy to get to naturally. Don't make a big spectacle by asking her to follow you to a romantic spot. A quiet hallway or corner after school is just as good a spot to talk about your feelings as any other.

, If you still feel shy around her, use a bit of humor to lighten the mood. Say something like, ""Things were a lot less awkward between us before I inserted a size 12 foot in my mouth."" Show that you don't take yourself too seriously and she will feel relaxed as well.


If you aren't naturally funny, that is okay too. Finding humor in a situation is more about finding the best side of yourself, even when things get awkward.

, The great secret to getting over shyness is just coming out and saying what you feel. It is not easy, but it is the only way to do it. Keep it short and to the point. ""I really like you, and I'd love to go out on a date sometime,"" is all you need to say. Some tricks to get it all out include:


Count to 3 in your head-- when you get to zero, you have to say it.
Avoid chit-chatting beforehand. Say hello, ask how she is doing, then launch right in.

, If she is going to ditch you because of a little initial awkwardness, is she really that worth being with? Quickly admitting that you feel nervous may be the best way to break the ice, and she will appreciate your honesty. What you are telling her is that you like her so much you feel shy saying it -- that kind of honesty and vulnerability is going to go a long way. Lines to try include:


""I'm a bit nervous to say this, but...""
""I know I seem kind of awkward, but I want you to know how I feel.""

, If she says she doesn't like you back, it's no big deal. Just ask if you can still be friends, and act cool. And don't be mean to her just because she rejects you. It's her choice, after all. And you may have just been chasing after the wrong girl.

Be yourself, even if you are shy.,
Ask a mutual friend for advice.,
Note her body language around you.",How to Tell a Girl Your Feelings if You're Shy3," This is usually a good way to gauge your relationship without the pressure of an intimate date. If you're having a get together with friends or going out to a club, ask her along or have a friend invite her. This way you can see each other in a social setting.


Does she spend time with you? Do you have fun together?

, Trying to fake someone into liking you is a sure-fire way to start a failing relationship. You have to have confidence in who you are. If she doesn't like that, then you would not have made a very happy couple anyway. Feel more confident by focusing less on yourself and more on her.

, Someone on the outside can give you valuable perspective on her feelings for you, and give some advice on how to proceed. Find a friend you trust and confide in them to see how they see things. Do they think you would make a good couple? Do they think the feelings are mutual? How would they talk to her about your feelings?


This can be a ""practice round,"" helping you sort out your feelings.

, Does she make eye contact, hug or touch you, lean in when you talk, or sit next to you whenever possible? These are all good signs that she may have similar feelings.


Closing her body off by folding her arms, avoiding eye-contact, or making excuses not to talk are often signs that she is not interested.

Respond in a timely manner.,
Meet quickly.,
Avoid having extended online conversations.,
Meet in a public place.",How to React When a Boy Asks You Out2," If you’re on an online dating site, you know that people you might be interested in can become unavailable really quickly. So if a guy you’re interested in asks you out, respond as quickly as possible.


You can say something like in your message back like “Thanks so much for messaging me. I’d love to go out!”

, For the same reason that you don’t want to wait too long to respond to the date request, you don’t want to wait too long to go out, either – he might get snapped up by someone else. When you message him to accept the date, make a suggestion for a date and time for it.For example, you can say something like “Thanks for asking me out – I’d love to go out! How’s Friday night at 8?”

, The whole point of a date is to get to know someone better. It can be tempting, once you’ve been asked out, to ask him a bunch of questions. Save it for the date – where it’s easier to read body language and get a sense of what kind of guy he is.Unless you've established that you both love phone conversations, refrain from calling him before the first date except to discuss meeting logistics. You can do this through the dating app or website where you met., Because accepting an online dating request means going out with someone you’ve never actually met, choose a public place to meet.

Don’t just ignore him.",How to React When a Boy Asks You Out3," If you get a date request – online or in person – from someone you’re not interested in dating, you should start by acknowledging his effort. It can be really scary to ask someone out, and he went out on a limb by doing so.For example, you can say something like “Thank you so much for asking/messaging me! I know how hard it is to take that first step.”

, Once you’ve acknowledged his effort, you need to clearly say no if you’re not interested in going out with him. Don’t say maybe and don’t say you have to think about it if you don’t.For example, you can say, “I really appreciate you asking me, but I’m just not interested.”

, You might be tempted to make an excuse when you turn him down to ease your rejection. However, doing this can leave your “no” open to interpretation, so try to be as honest as possible.


For example, don’t say ""I'm seeing someone"" if you’re not or ""I'm not looking for a relationship"" if you are. The fact that you have an online dating profile suggests you are looking to date and makes these responses sound hollow.You might also be turning him down because you’re just not interested in men. Be honest about it if that’s the case., If you get a date request online or in person, don’t just ignore him. Make sure you that you give him a response, even if it’s short and sweet.You can ignore this rule if you get a date request from a total stranger or if the request itself is overly aggressive or sexually explicit.

He may brush his fingers on your forearm. You may also catch him looking at you during odd times.
He may also ask you questions to gauge whether you're interested. He may, for example, ask about your weekend plans. He may also ask if you have dates for certain events, and even offer to escort you as a friend.

, If you want to show you're interested, start getting a little more physical with the guy. Touch his forearm while talking. Sit closer to him than you usually would on the couch. Offer a hug when first seeing him at social events. A little physical contact can show you're interested in something more than friendship.

, Flirtation is also key to showing a guy your'e interested. This can help pave the way to asking him out. Aim for subtle flirting at first, as not to make the relationship too awkward.Brief eye contact can convey romantic interest. Catch the guy's gaze for a few seconds and then look away. You should also smile and act happy in general when around him.
Try to mimic his body language. Do not be too obvious about this, but try to imitate his hand gestures and the way he's positioning his body. For example, if he's crossing his legs, cross your legs as well.

, If you're really interested in someone, especially someone who's also a friend, you may be inclined to clear your schedule to make room for a potential date. Refrain from doing so, however. If you make yourself completely available, while the other person remains occupied with his or her life, you risk creating an one-sided dynamic. You'll be left waiting for a text or call, while the guy carries on with his life.Keep up with existing social obligations and plans until you've made solid plans for a date. Do not, for example, clear you're weekend because you're planning to ask the guy out.
Staying busy can also convey confidence, which can be attractive to many. Having your own life and obligations makes you look more desirable in the eye of the guy.

, Uncertainty is a big setback when it comes to transitioning from friends to more than friends. Many people let the uncertainty of how a potential relationship will unfold hold them back. Accept there will be a lot of uncertainty when you try to push a relationship from friendship to something more.Understand you cannot predict another person's behavior. Try not to get too hung up on how the guy may react. Go into the situation with no expectations.
It's okay to have some plan of what you're going to say. In fact, it can be helpful to have some small speech planned out to help yourself stay calm. However, avoid playing out scenarios in your mind regarding how the conversation may unfold, and how the guy may respond.

, If you're feeling nervous, you may stumble over your words when asking someone out. Do not try to rush the question. Instead, go slowly and make sure you say exactly what you want to say.Take a few deep breaths before going into the conversation if you're feeling nervous.
Try to talk slowly. People have a tendency to rush if they're feeling nervous, so make a point of saying one word at a time.

, When it comes to asking someone out, you're not doing anyone a favor by being subtle. If you're starting out as just friends, asking to get coffee or see a movie may not be enough to let the guy know it's a date. Make sure what you're asking is clear.Try to say what you want outright. Ask the guy on something that is clearly a date and, if necessary, outright say it's a date.
You can let the guy know you have feelings for him. Say something like, ""I feel like we have a lot in common and there's some mutual attraction here. Would you like to go out and see a movie sometime?""

, When asking anyone out, there's always a risk of rejection. No matter how sure you are the feeling is mutual, you can't know for sure. Understand, going into the situation there's a chance the guy will say, ""No."" While you should not assume the worst, it's a good idea to prepare for the fact things may not go as well as you expected.


Try to stay positive in the event you're rejected. Remember, the two of you are friends. Even if things will not work out romantically, try to value the fact you still have a solid friendship.

, In the event you and your guy friend do end up as more than friends, you'll have to work to establish extra intimacy. In order to make it clear you're now more than friends, work to show you care.Leave your guy friend surprises. Write him a special note telling him how much you care. Buy him a small present now and then.
Be more physically affectionate. Seek to hold hands and cuddle when you're together.

, Sometimes, the transition between friends and more than friends can be confusing. It's a good idea to take measures to make sure your guy friend knows you want the relationship as much as he does.It may be easier to communicate openly when you started out as friends. You can have open, honest discussions with your partner about what you want out of the relationship, and what expectations you have regarding a romantic relationship.
At first, you may have to reassure your partner a lot that you want the relationship. Let your partner know about once a week for the first few months you're happy to be more than friends.

, Another way to solidify the transition is altering how you socialize. Try to stay together at parties. Interact with mutual friends as a couple instead of one-on-one. At parties, stay in the same conversations rather than talking to people individually. You'll feel more like a couple than friends if you start doing things as a ""we"" instead of a ""you"" and a ""me."", It can take time for a friendship to feel like a romance. Try not to have high expectations in regards to what your relationship will look like. It will take awhile to feel like more than friends, and there may be awkward or confusing interactions along the way. If you're committed to being more than friends, allow the transition to happen gradually. Stay patient and remember, if you really care about this person, the relationship will be worth it in the long run."

Depending on the guy or girl, you might want to be a bit more vague, especially if there are others around.,
If your crush says yes, be happy.,
If your crush says that he or she isn't interested, say thanks for considering your request.",How to Ask Your Crush out in Five Minutes," Grab a mirror and look into your own eyes and say something passionate. Say it as if you were saying it to your crush.;
, This isn't just to impress your crush; it's also about giving yourself the confidence to stand tall because you know you look your best. Iron your clothes, choose ones that you like the most and wear them well.

, It's a good idea to locate your crush when he or she is either alone or not with many people. Asking someone out in front of a group of people not only places added pressure on you but it's likely to embarrass your crush and he or she might respond in a way opposite to the one they really wish. You don't want to pressure your crush into saying yes even if he or she might have doubts or to cause him or her to say no just to seem cool in front of people.

, Go up to your crush and say something sweet and funny. For example: ""Hey! I haven't seen you in a while. I was just about to put your face on a milk carton."" Let your crush respond.

, Look into your crush's eyes and say these exact words, ""Wondering if you have a girl/guy. 'Cause I'm always free. And I would like to have you as a boyfriend/girlfriend.""

, There is no point in publicly embarrassing both of you if he or she says no.

, Say that you're really pleased and ask if it's a good time to arrange a date.

, Avoid throwing a tantrum, storming off or crying. Look strong, be strong and make it seem that you're okay with that response. Inside you might be crushed by your crush but show a good side. After all, he or she might be assessing your reaction and could actually need time to think about your request. If you show that you're courageous and have a sense of self worth, it may just be enough to change that person's mind later.

Find out more about your potential date's relationship status and interests.,
Start an online conversation.,
E-mail your potential date only if they've personally given you their address.,
Keep the conversation light and upbeat.,

Keep online exchanges brief.,
Ask for their phone number.,
Ask them out on a date.,
Give them time to respond.,
Be prepared for rejection.",How to Ask Someone out Online," Even if the internet is your chosen method of contact, you may know this person from real life. They might be someone from your school or office, a neighbor, a friend of a friend. Whoever they are, getting to know them in real life can give you a rough idea of whether they are your type and what they like to do.


Take advantage of your common acquaintances. For example, if you know some of their friends, hang out with them more often when they're in their company. Getting to know their friends will help you realize what kind of people your potential date likes having around.
If you barely know your date or any of their friends, even the most casual approach would do. For example, you can exchange a couple of jokes with your neighbor as you pass by their house to get a sense of what they're like.;
, Once you've established even a very shallow level of connection, you can take a step forward and request their friendship on a social network you both use, like Facebook. Because you've already made acquaintance with this person in real life, you won't look like a weirdo invading their private life. Social-network users tend to accept any request as long as they have a loose connection with the person.


You can use Skype or other instant messaging services instead. However, remember that social networks are by far the best way to go, because they are designed to help people socialize. Instead, messaging applications are meant to help people communicate: this will give away your long-term goal, which is approaching this person with a specific request.
You can go ahead and friend someone on a messaging application if you feel confident enough. As you add them to your contact list, they'll probably understand what your intentions are, so make sure you're okay with it.
If you've met your potential date on a dating website, it's better to ask their permission before sending a friend request. For example, you can message them on the dating website and ask ""Are you on Facebook""? If they say they are, take it as a ""go ahead, you can friend me"".

, Once your friendship request has been accepted, you have access to a huge amount of useful information. Is this person already in a relationship? What do they enjoy doing in their spare time? What music do they listen to? What is their family like? Do you have common friends you didn't know of? This information will help you come up with a strategy to approach your potential date. Begin thinking of stuff you can do together. Or, you can start a conversation by mentioning a common friend.
Picture yourself as a detective piecing up clues that can help you find a solution to the problem.
Doing some background research will also help you not waste time with someone who might be too different from you. If you see that the cute guy in your French class only likes football when you hate sports and want to spend the rest of your life on the couch, you should ask yourself whether it's not even worth bothering.
This is especially useful if your potential date lives in another town and you don't have a chance to hang out with them in person. Checking the conversation and posts on their Facebook page will be like spending time with them and their friends in the virtual world.

, Do it shortly after your friend request has been accepted. If you wait too long, your potential date might think you've stalked them online. They will expect to have a casual chat with you once you've become friends on a social network.


Don't overthink how to start this. Just write ""Hi! What's up? I'm glad I found you online!"", or ""Hi! Remember we met last week at Dave's party?""
If you think they can't place you, remind them of how they know you (for example, which office you work in).

, Unlike social networks, which work as a public space where friends and strangers exchange ideas, an e-mail address is considered private information, like a house address. You wouldn't want anyone knocking at your door if you haven't told them where you live, so don't write an e-mail unless you've asked this person their address beforehand.You shouldn't use the e-mail even if you have a way to retrieve this person's address (for example, through a common friend or website). Getting their address though a third source will also be perceived as an invasion of their privacy and highly decrease your chance to succeed.

, As you do your best to build an exchange based on what you have in common, no matter how little, make sure you come off as a positive person who is just looking for a casual chat.


Don't overwhelm your potential date with emoticons or excessive internet slang (like LOL): this can be read as a sign of insecurity. There's no need to underline the fact you've said something funny with a hundred laughing faces.
If the conversation ends up being about something bleak, like the tons of washing you have to do, cheer it up with some humor and jokes. For example, ""You won't believe how much washing I have to do over the weekend. I wish my butler wasn't on leave.""
Don't overburden the person with too much information. You don't want to do all the talking at this stage.

, Whatever you say, make sure you're not performing someone else's role. You want your potential date to get a sense of who you are and understand whether they'd like to know you better. If you're not a funny person, don't try to be; if you're the life of the party, acting serious may not be in your nature.


Keep in mind that sounding ""at your best"" shouldn't turn into ""sounding phony"". Convey the sides of your personality you want the other person to know about without overdoing it, and don't fake any you don't have.
For example, if you're funny, make a light joke. If you're insightful, make a deep but quick remark about something.
Overacting can happen especially for online dating. This can make dating feel like a job interview where you have to advertise your skills. However, remember that online dating is about matching people: the more you're yourself, the more you'll be matched with someone who is like you and you have a better chance with.

, It's easy to idealize someone when they're little more than a picture and profile page. However, this person exists in real life, and they're probably way more complex than what the screen gives away.


As the conversation goes on, try to think of what this person is really like, rather than the image they're giving of themselves.
Compare the idea you had of this person before the conversation (for example, ""she's so cool"") with what you can sense from your virtual chat (for example, ""she's trying very hard to look cool, so she probably isn't"", or ""she's actually as cool as I expected"").Pay extra attention to this aspect when talking to someone you met through an online dating website. They might pretend to be someone they're not just to make an impression; it happens more than you think.

, There's no point in turning the casual chat into a two-hour online date. Your goal is to ask your potential date out to do most of the talking and get to know them in person. This conversation is only an introduction to that special request.


If you make yourself too available in the virtual world, the other person might lose an interest in meeting you in real life.

, Once you've warmed up and feel it's not an awkward thing to do, drop a casual request. If you feel it's still too early to ask for a date but you've spent longer than expected on the chat, or had several online conversations, a phone number is the safe next step to take to get closer to this person.For example, you can use an excuse. Say ""I have to go back to work now, but I really enjoyed talking to you. Do you have a phone number so that we can continue our chat later?""

, Use the research you've done before the conversation to suggest an activity you might enjoy doing together. For example, if you both like foreign films, find one playing next to you and invite them. Present your suggestion as a way to continue the very interesting chat you're having elsewhere.For example, you can say ""I really like talking to you. Why don't we continue our chat at the Mexican restaurant near school next weekend?""
Although this is the hardest part, think of your request as a step that will relieve the tension in the conversation. It will give both the chance to do something together where you can actually get to know each other for what you really are., If your request was not within the conversation, but a message on Skype or WhatsApp following a few previous conversations, don't expect this person to reply straight away. They may want to take their time to think this through, which doesn't mean they don't like you.


Making pressure to get a reply won't work to your advantage. Unlike real-life conversations, online chats and messages give a person more time to plan a response or strategy. This is why you probably chose them for your approach, and you should give this person the same level of liberty you've taken for yourself.
If it's taking too long for someone to reply (for example, a few days), or they're putting you off on a regular basis, they're probably not interested. Accept this without becoming insistent or expecting them to say ""no"" loud and clear., If the answer is ""no"", whatever form it takes, life goes on as before. No need to despair or get pushy. There are many other people you'll meet in the future who will take a real interest in you!Most importantly, remember to not take it personally or think you should have sounded different. You are supposed to be yourself online, not play a role. And if this person wasn't into you, it wouldn't have lasted anyway."
"
Think of an idea for a date.,
Strike up a conversation.,
Ask the person out.,
Make the necessary arrangements.",How to Ask Someone Out Using a Text Message," If you are planning on asking somebody out, you should present the person with a clear invitation on a particular day for a particular activity. Avoid making vague invitations like ""Want to hang out sometime?"" or ""Want to do something on Saturday?"" These types of questions should be used to segue into asking the person out, but are not concrete enough, and plans may fall through if the date and time have not been agreed upon.


Take the person's interests into consideration when coming up with date ideas. If you share similar tastes in music, then invite the person to a concert. If the person loves film, then invite them to the movie theater, and so on.
If you don't know the person very well, you should make a highly interactive, low-commitment plan like meeting for coffee or lunch. These types of activities allow you to talk to the person and get to know them (as opposed to going to the movie theater and sitting in silence), and also don't require as much of a time commitment, in case things don't work out.;
, Before you jump into asking the question, start out by greeting the person with a casual ""Hey, how's it going?"" Ask them how their day has been, what they have been up to lately, etc. These types of conversations give you an opportunity to determine whether or not the person is interested before you ask them out. If they respond quickly and ask you questions in return, then they are probably interested, whereas short, delayed answers are signs that the person is uninterested.


If you are not sure whether the other person has your number saved in their phone, be sure to let them know who you are at the beginning of the conversation. If you have just met this person, remind them when and where you met in order to jog their memory.

, Once you have gotten a conversation going, let the person know that you'd like to spend time with them. Try something like ""We should hang out sometime"" or ""Would you want to get together sometime?"" If they say yes, then follow up the question by asking whether they are free on such and such date to do such and such activity.


One good way to gauge whether or not the person is interested in you is to determine whether or not they come up with alternative plans if they turn down your initial invitation. For example, if the person says they are busy on a particular day, see if they tell you which days they are free. If the person turns down your invitation for whatever reason without proposing alternative plans, then they probably aren't interested.

, If the person says yes, then be sure to make the necessary plans. Set up a time and place to meet, and make driving arrangements if applicable. Let the person know that you are looking forward to spending time with them, and end the conversation with a closing statement like ""See you this weekend,"" or ""Talk to you soon.""


If the person says no, don't continue to pressure them to hang out or ask them why they don't want to see you. Let them know that there are no hard feelings, and end the conversation.

If you're in class together, ask about the homework assignment or ask your crush for help understanding the material. If you are in a club together, strike up a conversation about the theme of the club.
Ask your crush about him or herself. Ask how his/her day is going. Ask if he/she is excited about anything this weekend. It's easy!;
, You don't need to be best friends, and you don't need to tell each other everything. However, friendship involves a certain amount of trust, and it will make you more of a known quantity in your crush's eyes. Try walking to class with your crush, or hanging out in a group setting. If you are a good fit for each other, he/she might even develop a crush on you!, Don't try to make your crush think that you are someone you're not. Misleading this person is neither the best nor the most sustainable way to get him/her to go out with you. If you lie, it will come out eventually. If you try to act ""cool"" or imitate someone that you think is ""cool,"" you might just make your crush uncomfortable. Don't bother with illusions.


If you are being true to yourself and doing the things that you really want to do, you will put more passion into those things. Many people find passion attractive.

, If you want your crush's number, ask for his/her number – don't look it up elsewhere or ask someone else.

They may even know your crush well and can help you with ideas to ask them out- but always make sure you're happy about the decision., While it's natural to want other people to share our outlook, it's not realistic because people are diverse and hold different perspectives about all things in life.

And even with your crush, don't worry too much because either this person is going to be the right one for you or they're not, and if they're not, then who cares what they think?

Another way to look at this is to think how much you'd regret not asking out your crush. This can help you to realize how much this matters to you and how important it is to at least try.

It can be much easier to communicate with people over text or instant messaging, especially people you like, but you may find that asking out a crush face-to-face is much more romantic. If casual and noncommittal is what you're looking for, then feel free to go the text route – but don't expect your crush to be impressed., Find a time when neither you nor your crush have anywhere else to be. He/she shouldn't be stressed or in a rush. If possible, pick a place where you're both comfortable, and where you would normally hang out or run into each other. Try to create as smooth and easy a moment as possible.

, This conversation will probably be much easier for both of you if you don't ask him/her out in front of a bunch of people. Many people have trouble talking about their feelings one-on-one, let alone when the spotlight is on them. If you don't normally find yourself alone with your crush, you'll need to create that space. It is much easier to get someone alone if you're friends, or at least on casual speaking terms.Ask him/her to take a walk with you: home from school, or between classes, or around the block. Ask your crush to step outside with you for a second. You can say ""Can I talk to you alone for a minute?"" or ""Want to walk to class with me?""
Especially don't ask someone out in front of his/her friends! Your crush might be embarrassed, or he/she might not want to talk about this in front of a bunch of people. You might be rejected just because your crush feels uncomfortable.

, Better yet, ask your crush out while you're already hanging out one-on-one. You don't have to jump straight into the big question. It might help you set the mood if you ask your crush about his/her day, crack some jokes, and listen to what he/she has to say. You should both feel comfortable and at ease.

, Even the best-laid plans run into obstacles. Perhaps you tried to walk your crush home after school, but another couple of mutual friends decided to tag along. Be patient.

You might be nervously sweating, shaking, terrified – but you will probably feel much better once you get it over with. Ask yourself whether you will regret it if you never ask this person out. If you'll regret it, do it.


Think of it like jumping into cold water. You can spend all day staring at the water, feeling it with your toes, and thinking about how cold it will be. On the other hand, you can push your mind aside and jump in – at which point all you have to worry about is swimming, adjusting, or getting out.
If you can't bring yourself to do it, set yourself an incentive. Say, ""I need to ask out before Friday, or else I can't go to the party on Friday night."" Give yourself a reason to cut through your hesitation and get it over with.

, Try to cut through the games and just tell your crush how you feel. This might be scary, but you also may find that this makes your task a lot simpler. Say, ""Hey, I want to be clear. I like you a lot, and I want to spend more time with you. What do you think?"" , Don't ask him/her vaguely ""out."" Don't ask him/her to be your boyfriend or girlfriend if you haven't even been on a date. Suggest something fun and cheap that you'll both enjoy: a movie, a hike, a show, or a school event. If you ask this person to go somewhere with you alone, they will probably assume that it's a date – but you don't need to try to ask them to be your ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" yet.


If there is a school dance coming up, ask your crush to go as your date. This can be a great opportunity to show someone how you feel. Keep in mind that unless you explicitly agree upon it, one date to date a dance does not necessarily mean that the two of you are ""going out.""

, Ask your crush out on one date, and let that date be exactly what it is. If you have already been going on dates with this person, and you want to ask him/her to date you exclusively, then you're looking at a different conversation. If the person is just a crush, you may want to keep the pressure off and take it slow.

, If you ask out your crush, and he/she turns you down, you need to let that answer stand. It is one thing to be persistent because you really like someone; it is another thing to stalk someone, to pester them, and to make them uncomfortable. There are other fish in the sea.

Don't ask her out as a dare or as a joke.,
This is the most important rule.",How to Ask Out a Girl at School," But don't overdo it, stay calm, cool, and collective. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you're in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. Also, you don't want to rush it. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you.;
, Use your brain. You can compliment her on something you truly like about her. Don't just say something, just for the sake of saying it. Make her feel good about herself.

, No, not literally! Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go.

, Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. But don't talk too much or about anything weird.

, Look into her eyes, look lost in her world for a second. Make her get the idea that you like her. Then proceed to look dreamily into her pretty eyes and tell her what you love about her.

, When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. It's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. All you have to do is walk up, and ask her to go out with you in a confident manner. You get points for trying.


Ask her out directly, in person. Do not send someone else to do it, email/text her, or even do it over the phone. Asking someone on a date should be personal, you should do it yourself, in person. Doing it any other way will show that you lack confidence, and while she may still say yes, she'll be a lot less impressed.

, The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. Sometimes girls like boys who are kind of shy but be sure you don't act shy because girls also want you to  be honest and pretending to be somebody else isn't honest.

, If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, ""it's okay if you say no.""

, Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up hope completely. Some girls like it if you try again.

, Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no.

, This can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk.

, Always remember to make a good impression on her when you ask her out. It's a major bonus point! Never stare at the ground either. Look her in the eye! If you're shy, whisper it in her ear–but never be too shy.

Do some research!,
Calm down.,
Expect the worst!,
Don't blurt it out!,
Make your crush think twice.,
Stay happy.,
Be honest, but don't feel like you're in court.,
Know your crush's reaction.,
Don't apologize.,
Remember that the words for now come out of their mouth, it doesn't mean a definite later.,
If the answer is yes, go on with everyday life the exact same way it is.",How to Ask Out Your Crush at School," Far too often people think that by just being themselves, everything will be all right. If you're around someone that you actually want to date, you won't be yourself when the time comes. You'll be a paranoid stutterer with no confidence.;
, It isn't the end of the world if your crush says no, nor is it if he/she says yes. Take a deep breath, and relax.

, If you think your crush will say yes in an instant and he/she says no, you will be crushed. It will take a lot longer to get over them. If you expect him/her to say no, it won't be a shock.

, If you do this, your crush might be caught off guard and not know how to react. Ease into it. Start off giving them a compliment of some sort.

, Don't make it seem like you're pouring your soul out to them, that just disconcerts them. Say something like ""you know, I really like you"" in an almost jovial manner. It has a double meaning that you can go back to later.

, If you start getting really serious, your crush might think that's all the relationship will be. If you're happy and make him/her smile, it's a much more promising start.

, You don't need to tell the exact truth, some things are best left for silence or if necessary, a later time. Starting out with a confession is worrying.

, If he/she says no, say ""I just thought you ought to know that I like you"" or something along those lines. Don't make a big deal out of it and you'll remain friends.

, If you keep on going on about how sorry you are for making things awkward, your crush will be. If you start apologizing, stop! Don't apologize for apologizing either.

, It also isn't just a shrug off. Don't lose hope or get delusional.

, Your crush will like the familiarity. In the evenings or sometime, go and do something as boyfriend and girlfriend.

Determine whether this person is already in a relationship.,
Be confident, but prepared for rejection.,
Find out what he or she likes, if possible.,
Determine how you want to ask the person out.,
Strike up a conversation.,
Ask them if they would like to go on a date.,
Let them know that there are no hard feelings if they say no.,
Make eye contact and smile at the person.,
Approach the person and introduce yourself, if you haven't already.,
Strike up a casual conversation.,
Ask the person out.,
Be diplomatic if they say no.",How to Ask Someone Out," This will save you a great deal of embarrassment and unnecessary effort.


Don't ask somebody out if they are in a relationship. Not only is it essentially guaranteed that they'll say no, but it is inappropriate, unfair to the person's boyfriend/girlfriend, and reflects poorly on your moral character.;
, Decide beforehand what you will do or say if the person says no. This is especially important if you plan on asking out a friend, as it will reduce the likelihood of damaging the friendship.


Being prepared for rejection will help you avoid appearing physically defeated in front of the other person if the answer is no.
While you want to prepare yourself for the possibility of rejection, don't let it get in the way of your confidence. Rather, let it build on your confidence by accepting the fact that being rejected isn't the end of the world.

, This will help you think of a good idea for a date. If this person loves music, find out what kind and invite them to a concert. If they enjoy movies, then invite them to the theater, and so on.

, If you are too shy to do the asking in person, then consider sending a text, Facebook message, or email.


Text messages are a good option if you are too afraid to do the asking in person. This way, you will at least be able to hide your disappointment from the other person.
If you have just met the person and don't have their number, you will have to do the asking in person, but don't fret! Doing the asking in person is romantic and can be very rewarding if the person says yes.

, Starting a casual conversation first will help you ease your way into asking the question and reduce some of the nervousness you might feel.


Send a friendly text saying ""Hey, how's it going?"" If you are doing the asking in person, approach the person and say hello. Make sure to smile and make eye contact, as this will show that you are interested.
Instead of asking them out right away, first ask them what they are doing tomorrow, this coming weekend, and so on. This will serve as a segue to asking the person out and will make the conversation flow more naturally.

, Suggest an activity that you think they will be interested in, based on what you know about the person. If you can't think of anything, here are a few ideas:


Ask them to meet for coffee or a drink.
Ask them out on a dinner or lunch date.
Ask them if they'd like to come to a party/dance with you.
Ask them out for ice cream or frozen yogurt.

, This will help eliminate any awkwardness in the future, especially if you have just asked out a close friend that you plan on continuing to see on a regular basis. More importantly, it will show the person that you are confident and mature enough to handle a little rejection.

, This shows the person that you are interested in them, and gives them the opportunity to return the gesture, showing that they too are interested.


If the person looks away or doesn't smile back, they might not be interested. However, it might also mean that they are too shy to reciprocate, so don't give up quite yet.

, Be sure to act confident, even if you are shaking inside. First impressions are very important, and confidence is an attractive characteristic in both men and women.

, This can range from complimenting the person, to talking about what's going on in the room around you, or asking them a question. If you can't think of a reason to talk to the person, try these things:


Ask the person what time it is.
Ask the person where they are from.
Ask the person what they are reading.
Compliment what the person is wearing.
Talk about the music that is playing, or anything else that is going on around you.

, Once the conversation has started, let the person know that you think they are interesting, and would like to get to know them.


Suggest meeting for coffee, lunch, dinner, etc. These are all very basic dates that are low-commitment, in case you don't hit it off.
Avoid asking them out to a movie on the first date, because it will not give you a chance to get to know one another.

, If the person says no, smile and say something like: ""Well, it was worth a try. Nice to meet you anyway!"" and then leave them be. Don't continue to bother the person once they have said no, and definitely don't continue trying to convince them to go out with you. This will make you appear desperate, and make the other person feel uncomfortable.

Talk to them more often.,
Just tell the person how you feel about them.Ask them if she/he has any feelings for you.

,
Ask his/her friends.,
Wait a while.,

Don't be a timid soul.",How to Ask Out One of Your Friends You Have Known For a While," If you do, then you will form a connection and they might start thinking differently about you. Every now and then drop hints about who they like.;
,, Find out if they like you and then you won't be so scared of rejection.

, Don't move things too fast, or they will think you're pushy.

, This is always a good thing because if you don't, you will lose a good friend and the other person will feel uncomfortable. Also they may change their mind and want to go out with you, so it's good to stay in touch.

, If you read this, and you got some ideas, but you don't know if the person likes you, don't be afraid to ask. Just make sure to do it in private with no other friends around.

Listen to what they have to say.,
If you are not friends with his/her friends it might be best to rethink who you ask out.",How to Ask Out a Cute Girl or Boy in Middle School," This is definitely an important step because you do not want to go up to that cute boy or girl wearing something you would go jogging in, or that was worn already twice this week.  Look through your closet and find something not flashy or dressy, but something you would wear on picture day. Try experimenting on outfits. For example, try a cute patterned top with colored jeans.;
, This may sound astoundingly obvious, but after you find that perfect outfit, stand in front of your mirror at home and rehearse what you are going to say to them and how you are going to approach them. Something like ""Hey (boy/girl's name) I was thinking..."" Is not acceptable.  Think of something that was not done before, but avoid things like, ""Pick you up at 7"" because you are only in middle school.

, Talk to maybe your mom or dad about this special someone you like; it makes you feel terrible when you hide things.

, Don't ask them out if you are not ready. Remember that they don't know that this is going to happen, so you are in no rush. Give yourself enough time to work it out.

, Take an extra long shower and if you are a girl, put nice flesh toned makeup on. No guy wants to walk into a girl that looks like lady gaga with their make-up. And for guys, do your hair nice and combed. No girl wants to see  a guy with messy wet hair. You should try being casual though, (again, don't go for fancy.)

, Now that you have built up the courage to ask them out, and you have practiced, do it! Don't try to do it in front of a lot of people because of the slight chance that they will say ""not now sorry"" or something like that.

, Make sure you understood their answer. No one likes a person that walks away too early especially if they said yes!

, If you really want to, don't do it around their friends."

, More often than not, a person will call another without knowing what to say.If you are unprepared, then you could create an awkward silence. Avoid this by writing out what you're going to say and rehearsing. (See Tips.) Still act natural though!

, Asking a person out without knowing where to go will hurt you when the day comes and make you less confident. If it is a movie or a concert then mention the time as well.

, Start up a conversation first. Once you feel comfortable talking to the person, go ahead and start with your rehearsed conversation.

, If there is a silence longer than fifteen seconds *Don't count, of course*, then say ""It's OK if you don't want to..."" or ""You don't have to tell me now.""

, If the person on the other side says no, but does want to go out with you some other time, try again! Tell the person that you understand. Don't get angry, rude or sullen.

, Congratulations! You have just asked a person out over the phone.

That way, you won't have to worry about what the right words should be; you only need to worry about the act of saying them.


On the other hand, you do not want to sound as though you are reading from a script. Get a general idea of what to say and how to say it, but ad-lib as needed and prepare yourself for unexpected questions or responses.;
, Asking loudly in the middle of lunch with all of his friends and the entire cafeteria watching might not be the best idea, especially if you're not sure about his response. The best time to ask him is toward the end of the school day, during a moment in which you can pull him off to the side and ask him discreetly.


Avoid asking him at the beginning of a shared class or school day. If he turns your invitation down, the rest of the time you spend around him that day can feel awkward.

, Keep in mind that there might be another girl who has already asked him to the dance, or that he might have other plans that day that would prevent him from going. Asking about whether he plans to go or not can save you some embarrassment.


If he says that he's going with someone else, that should give you your answer without you needing to ask the question.
If he says that he's not going, find out why. He might be busy and unable to go, which rules him out as an option. If he just hasn't been asked, though, you have your chance.

, If you get the green light, directly ask him, “Would you go to the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me?”


Look him in the eye and smile as you ask. Your body language should be confident and friendly.

, If his answer is yes, you can show your excitement, but try not to get too crazy about it. If his answer is no, smile, stay calm, and walk away with your head held high—after all, at least you were brave enough to ask.


If you do get rejected and feel like you might get teary-eyed, excuse yourself politely before that happens and find friends who can console you. Avoid crying in front of your crush.

, While you should not have a friend ask the guy to the dance for you, if you and he do share a mutual friend, you can ask that person to find out if your crush already has a date or if he would be open to the possibility of going with you.


Ask a mutual friend who is reliable and trustworthy. You do not want a friend who will use the knowledge of your feelings against you or someone who will fail to live up to the promise.

, The simplest way to ask your crush is to slip him a note. Keep the tone lighthearted and the message brief, and leave it in a place that he is guaranteed to spot it in.


You can slip a note into his locker or bookbag, for instance.
Try to be fun and casual. Instead of confessing your undying love and scaring him off, just casually say that “it's lady's choice” and you choose him.
You could also use the classic “check 'yes' or 'no'” format. Write “Will you go to the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me?” and create separate checkboxes for “No” and “Yes.”

, If you are on close enough terms with your crush to have his phone number, send him a quick text asking him if he would be interested in going to Sadie's with you.


This is only an option if he gave you his phone number directly. If you got it from a third party, texting him without warning can be a little startling.
To the same end, you can also use email to ask him to the dance.

, Send a private message or create a Facebook event that only he can see. Request a response of “yes” or “no,” rather than a “maybe” response.


It is generally best if you create a private event or use a private message rather than asking for the entire social media world to see. Keeping things private can save you some embarrassment if his answer ends up being no.

, If the two of you share similar tastes in music, you can create a CD of your favorite songs and pass it along to him. Write your invitation on the CD case or use the track titles to ask him out.


You could include songs on the CD with lyrics about a girl asking a guy out, especially if the song talks specifically about the Sadie Hawkins Dance. For example, Reliant K has a song actually called “Sadie Hawkins Dance.”
You could also create a track list that asks the question in acronym form. The first letter of each track title could spell out the word D-A-N-C-E.

, A cute way to drop your crush a written invitation is to slip it into a glass or plastic bottle. You can even fill the bottle with candy or other treats, treating him to something sweet while piquing his interest.


If you do fill the bottle with candy or other treats, make sure the guy you have your eye on knows that there is a hidden message inside he needs to get to. Otherwise, he might not touch the jar of candy or be suspicious about it.

, Another cute and creative way to leave your crush a written invitation is to roll it up tightly and slip it into a balloon. He will need to pop the balloon in order to read the letter.


Consider giving him something to pop the balloon with along with the balloon itself. Tie a thumbtack, pen, or other object with a sharp point to the other end of the balloon's string.

, This question should ask, in specific terms, whether or not he will go to the dance with you.


The question should be direct. Try something like, “Matt, will you go to the Sadie Hawkins Dance with Amanda?”
The answers should be in multiple choice format. Most of the answers should be in the affirmative, but you should still include a negative reply, just in case. Consider an answer key like:

A) Definitely yes!
B) I was hoping you would ask!
C) Both A and B
D) Amanda is a wonderful girl, but unfortunately, I can't



, As the old saying goes, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Write your invitation using candy, pizza, or a favorite treat of his.


Write the question “Dance?” in pepperoni on a pizza.
Bake him a cake and write “Dance?” in icing or chocolate candies on top.
Arrange cupcakes, cookies, or candy in a box. Tape them to the box so that they form the word “Dance?”
Make sure that you include a note so that the guy in question knows you left him such a sweet surprise.

, One good way to get a guy curious about you is to make him wonder about your identity for a bit. Ask him out anonymously, but along with the note asking him out, give him a secret message to “decode” that will reveal your name to him.


On a t-shirt, write “Will you go to the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me?” in permanent marker on the front. On the back, write your own name in permanent marker. Write the names of other girls in washable marker, and slip the shirt into his locker along with a note instructing him to wash the shirt. When he does, the other names will fade and yours will be revealed.
By a blank puzzle from a craft store. Write the invitation on one side of the puzzle and sign your name on the back. Leave the puzzle for him in pieces so that he needs to put it together to receive your invitation.

, If you are on good terms with the guy and know both his address and his parents, ask his parents if you can write a huge invitation to the Sadie Hawkins Dance using sidewalk chalk. Write it directly on his driveway, and make it big enough for him to see from a window.


This should only be done if the guy in question is already aware of the fact that you know where he lives. If you found out his address through less-than-honest means, he might be more creeped out than impressed.

, If you have some extra time, form the question “Dance?” using sticky notes. Place the sticky notes on his car, locker, or desk, and make sure he knows that you're the one behind them.


You can sign your name to each sticky note so that he can tell you were the one behind it, but just to make sure that no other girl tries to steal the credit for your hard work, a better idea is to stand next to your message and wait for him to read it and see you at the same time.

, If the guy you have your eye on is an athlete, make a banner or sign asking him to the dance and hang it in the locker room or hold it up at a game. Even if your guy isn't an athlete, you can still hang a sign in a hallway or other spot you know he will visit.


Make sure that you have the school's permission before hanging signs up in the halls. Usually, you can at least get away with hanging a sign the size of a standard piece of printer paper on the guy's locker, but you should always check school regulations to avoid getting into trouble.

, Along the trail, ask him in writing if he would want to go to the dance, but do not reveal your name yet. Wait for him at the end of the trail so that he can see who the girl behind the invitation is, and hopefully give you his response.


The arrows can spell out part of the question. For instance, on each arrow, you can write one word of the message, “Will you go to the Sadie Hawkins Dance...” At the end of the line, hold a sign that completes the question, reading, “with me?”

, Write your question on the windows of his car using washable car paint. Make sure to sign your name to the question so he knows who did the asking.


Make sure that the paint you use is easy to wash off. Otherwise, your crush may not appreciate your invitation later on.
As an added gesture of good will, you might even want to consider offering to wash the invitation off after he sees it and responds.

, If you feel really brave, get permission to make a special announcement over the P.A. system in the morning, along with the usual school-wide announcements.


In the announcement, you need to clearly state his name and your name along with the actual question. Repeat the question a couple of times so that you can be extra sure he heard it.

Look for guys who are one or two years younger or older than you. If guys from other schools are there, then check for guys who are out of your community. If you've already chosen your guy, then spot him and continue on to the next step.;
, Let him catch you looking at him. When he sees you, flash him your winning smile, and try to hold his eye contact for over a second. If he does hold eye contact with you for over a second, then there is a greater chance that he's interested in you. If he doesn't, don't worry as he may be shy, or simply uncomfortable with holding eye contact for too long. Whether your attempt at holding his eye contact was successful or not, try to catch his eye again. When you do, smile again, and then try throwing in a cute wink, blushing and looking down, or simply waving a little.

, Keep calm when you do and try to look confident. Make sure that you make this move long before a slow song so that you have plenty of time to do the next few steps.

, Greet him by saying, ""Hey."" or ""What's up?"" to add a bit of flirty flare to your conversation. After you've greeted him, simply say, ""I'm (your name here). Who are you?""

, This is a crucial step. Smile at him, play with your hair, giggle when he tells a funny joke, and make eye contact with him while talking. If you want to, give him a wink after you tease him, blush randomly during the conversation or when he says something cute, and try to break the touch barrier by lightly touching his hand, shoulder, or upper arm. Also, if you're walking next to him, pretend to trip into him. Then blush, get of him, and apologize sweetly. If you're feeling daring, you could even try to hold his hand or leaning in slightly and whispering when you say something.

, Keep flirting with him until a slow song plays.

, If he accepts then put your hands on his shoulders and wait for him to put his hands on your hips. If you want to be extra flirty/romantic, then wrap your arms around his neck and look into his eyes for a second or two.

After you know about scene girls, decide if you want to still be with her.

,
If she is in your class, and sits next to you, say things like, ""I don't get what the homework is about,"" or if you didn't do your home work (and if you know she won't mind about this) say ""Did you do your homework?,
If she is in your class, but not sitting next to you, walk up to her (at an appropriate time) and ask for a pencil to borrow, or an eraser.,
If she is not in any of your classes, then maybe find a friend of hers, and become friends with her.,
After you two have talked a little bit, begin to talk about normal things.,
If she sits away from you, then go up to her, ask for the eraser (or pencil) again, and then be like ""Oh wait, I know this is random, but what's your favorite band?,

Asking them via phone or email.,
Practice in the mirror.,
Listen to some confidence boosting music.",How to Ask a Guy Out When You're Scared1," If you are too afraid to ask your crush out in person, then you can do so electronically. If you have their number, call or text them and see if they’d like to go out. You can even DM or email them if you have his email address or social media information.


You can say something like “Hey Trevor, how are you? I was wondering if you would like to go out with me on Saturday night?”
If you are nervous about his response, go and do something else like watch a show for 30 minutes or so to calm down, and then check your phone.;
, If you prefer not to ask via text, practice asking him out in the mirror to build your confidence up. When you do so, think about how you look and what your gestures or facial expressions are conveying. If they express nervousness, then keep practicing until they don’t., Put together an empowering playlist of your favorite songs. Listen to them that morning while you’re getting dressed, in your car on the way to work or school, and whenever you have some free time during the day before you see him. This will also put you in a good mood, which will make the ask easier and more enjoyable.

Prepare what you want to say ahead of time.,
Exude confidence.,
Get your point across.,
Do it at the right time.,
Give him the option to say no.",How to Ask a Guy Friend Out1," If you are nervous about asking him out, try preparing what you want to say ahead of time. This will help you get your thoughts in order before you are in front of him. This will make it easier to know what to say to him in the moment.


If you think he likes you, then you might find preparing yourself a bit easier. For example, you could just say something like, ""It seems like you like me and I like you. Wanna go out sometime?""
If you are unsure about whether or not he likes you, then you might plan on saying something like, ""I'm not sure how you feel about me, but I like spending time with you. Would you like to go out sometime?"";
, When you are asking out your guy friend, you want to seem confident about your request. Confidence is an attractive quality and will show that you truly mean that you want to go out with him. Confidence will also make you feel less nervous and shy, which will help the process overall. Try using confident body language, such as:Standing tall and straight with your hands at your sides.
Making direct eye contact and smiling when you are talking to him.
Using your hands and arms to gesture when you talk.

, When you ask him out, you need to be direct about your intentions. Asking him to go out may be misconstrued as just hanging out since you both have done so in the past. When you ask him, make sure you specifically mention you want it to be a date.


This way, it won’t be awkward if he misunderstands your intentions in the moment.Try already having a type of date planned before you ask him out. Say something like, “Would you like to go on a date with me tomorrow to play bowling?” This will take some of the pressure off of him and you to decide what to do later.However, don’t go overboard. You want it to sound casual and romantic, not already too involved and crazy about dating him.

, There is no right time to ask someone out. However, make sure you aren’t in a public place with a bunch of your other friends. This would make it awkward for him and you, which is the opposite effect you want.


Instead, ask him when you are both alone. You can do it after you’ve been joking around a little bit. You can also ask him for a serious moment for your question.

Increase your time together.,
Notice his body language around you.,
Listen to how he talks to you.",How to Ask a Guy Friend Out2," Before you decide to ask him out, you can try and test the waters between you two. Hang out with him one on one if possible to see what it is like when the two of you are alone. You want to make sure you have the chemistry needed to sustain a romantic relationship.


If you are bold, try joking around about dating to gauge his reaction.

This will prime your relationship for the transition to dating if that is where it goes. This will also give you time to test how comfortable you are with him.

Analyze where you are in your life.,
Make sure you are willing to take the risk.",How to Ask a Guy Friend Out3," Take time to assess the way you feel about your guy friend.

Make sure she doesn't already have a date.,
Know that you should still ask a girl to prom even if you're dating.,
Keep your intentions clear.,
Consider the girl's personality.,
Know that it's okay if you just want to ask normally.",How to Ask a Girl to Prom1," This may be a no-brainer, but you'd be surprised by how many guys spend so much time trying to plan their special promposal that they don't even consider that the girl in question already has a date. So, either just find a clever way of asking her if she has a date herself, or ask her friends. If her friends say no, then who knows, maybe one of them can even help you stage the perfect prom proposal.;
, Sure, you've been with your high school girlfriend for over a year, and it's pretty obvious that you'll be going to prom together. Still, your girlfriend will like you even more if you make the special effort to ask her to prom in a romantic, funny, or just a creative way. This will make her more excited to go to prom with you and will keep your relationship fresh.

, If you're asking a girl to prom as a way of declaring that you have special feelings for her, then you can make her feel special by promposing in a romantic way, or letting her see that you like her as more than a friend after you prompose in a funny or creative way. But if you're asking a girl to go just as a friend, don't do anything too romantic or she may think that you're also asking her out.

, Not every girl wants a crazy, over-the-top prom proposal. On the other hand, some girls are dying for one. Before you make your prom game plan, you should consider the personality of the girl you're asking. Is she shy, not fond of public displays, and does she generally like to keep her feelings to herself? Or is she more outgoing, dramatic, and public with her emotions? Make sure you tailor your proposal plan to the girl you're asking -- not to the crowd that may be watching.

, Don't overthink it -- if you just want to ask the girl casually, do it. Don't do something that doesn't feel like you and that makes you feel nervous. Remember that you're promposing, not proposing, and that it won't be the end of the world if she says no. Just tell the girl that you have something you want to ask her and arrange a quick meet-up.


If you want to just ask the girl casually, find a time when the two of you can be alone, make eye contact, and say, ""I think you'd be a really great prom date and that it would a lot of fun to go to prom together. Would you like to go with me?""






Don't worry so much about looking incredibly creative, romantic, or funny. The girl will appreciate your honesty and may even prefer the privacy of being asked when you're alone.

Browse their Facebook profile.,
If you both have cell phones, start texting each other throughout the day.,
Talk to the person and get to know them well, see if he or she is the right person for you.

,
One of the most important thing to do is flirt.,
Flirting is fun, but also be aware what or how much you post on a Facebook wall of the person you are interested in.,
Use MSN or Skype to connect with your crush and have a live video conversation.,
After a while and once you have been talking and getting to know each other for a while, start giving hints in your messages.,
Be sure this relationship will go somewhere.

,
If the person lives far from you or in another country, discuss between the two of you how willing the both of you are to meet up and see if there is a connection.,
When your ready and you made your final choice, connect to your partner on a service like MSN or Skype because it would make it more open and you can see his/her reactions.,
Arrange sometime in the future when you could meet him/her in person.",How to Ask a Guy out Through Facebook (Long Distance)," For health and safety reasons don't give out any personal information unless you 100% sure. Don't send pictures of yourself unless you TRULY know the person. Call them to see if their voice is right, because it could be an impersonation.;
, There are some people who will use fake pictures and even create a whole identity pretending to be that person. One of the easy ways to spot this is if the person has very few pictures of themselves. The more difficult fake profiles to spot are the people who will actually use pictures of friends they know or pictures they find off the internet. Don't assume that just because the person has pictures of a night out with their friends or family that it is 100 percent that person. Until you see them on webcam at the very least, there is always that chance you could be misled.

, Let them know that you're thinking of them at random times. Be wary of giving out any information to the person that they can use to find you before you both decide to meet up in person. Texting allows you to keep communication open with the person while at the same time you're letting them know that you're not just sitting at home waiting for them to go on Facebook or MSN during your every spare minute. Have fun with the texting, send each other pictures of yourselves.

,, Even if its online you will be able to flirt but not to the full capacity as you would in real life.

, People use Facebook for different reasons. Ask the person if they mind if you write flirty messages on their wall. Some people have co-workers or family members that may not be so understanding to read about how much you love hearing how their voice gets 'breathless' when you chat on the telephone for example.

, This could make it easier to help make your decision and get to know the him features like laugh, smile and voice.

, For example make your messages be more emotional, or show him/her that your interested in them.

,, You don't want to waste your time getting romantic feelings for someone who never plans on meeting you in person at a later date because you both live too far apart.

, If you're not able to use something like Skype or MSN and you want to do it on Facebook, try inbox a message that will show that you really care and love for him/her. Or you can do this on the chat but you will need to build the conversation up before asking them out because this can be make you look weird and it can possibly make it awkward.

, Remember, you don't want to feel like you're dating someone you've never even met.

You can do the dance after school, in the hallways, or even the cafeteria -- though you'll be likely to get detention. When the dance is over, stand in a line with your friends, all the way on the right side. Then, everyone will remove their shirts from left to right, until they spell out ""P-R-O-M-?"" Your shirt will have the question mark on it.


This silly dance will show the girl that you're comfortable enough with yourself to be completely goofy, and that you'll be the perfect prom date.

, If you want to make the girl laugh, you can spell out ""P-R-O-M?"" with a variety of foods. Try writing it with sushi, pretzel sticks, french fries, pepperoni, tiny cookies, hash browns, or any food that you happen to be eating or whatever is available in your cafeteria. She'll get a good chuckle out of this and will be very likely to say yes.

However, there are a few signs you can look for that might indicate that your friend feels the same way. Some signs of romantic interest might include that she:Finds reasons to run into you when you don’t have plans to hang out
Likes to bring up inside jokes or memories you two share
Follows and likes a lot of what you do and say on social media;
, Body language can say a lot about how people feel, including whether your friend is interested in you the same way you are in her. Body language to watch for that suggests romantic interest includes:She might expose her wrists. It's a sign of submission females use to attract males. If she is not wearing long sleeves, it may just be exposing the underside of her wrists by turning one upwards, possibly while holding a wine glass or smoking a cigarette.
She might try to close distances between you, such as by sitting beside or across from you, passing you things often, or even edging her drink closer toward you
Touching her neck and looking at you
Playing with the rim of her glass when you're having dinner or drinks
Making frequent eye contact with you, even if she looks away after locking eyes

, Asking a friend on a date can be risky, and you want to make sure the timing is right before you commit. You should be sure she isn't already seeing someone else, otherwise you might put yourself, her, and your friendship in an awkward position.


To find out if she's dating anyone, try to bring it up casually. Try saying something like, “Have you met anyone interesting on Tinder lately,” or, “So did things ever work out with that guy you were seeing a while back.”
If you're not comfortable asking her yourself, you can always ask mutual friends if she's seeing anyone.

, One of the simplest and most effective ways to find out if your friend feels the same way that you do is to ask her. It may seem forward, but you will end up with a much more accurate answer than if you try to figure it out on your own. If you're not sure what to say, try:


“Have you ever thought about us as more than friends?”
“If we were to go on a date, where would you take me?”
“Do you think about us when we aren't together?”
“Do you have feelings for me beyond friendship?”

, When you’ve been friends with a girl for a long time, you'll likely have a good idea of the qualities and characteristics she typically finds attractive in a person. If you have any of these qualities, emphasize them when you spend time with her.For example, if your friend finds humor to be an attractive quality and thinks you're funny, tell even more jokes when she's around.
Similarly, if there are particular physical characteristics that your friend likes, wear clothes that emphasize that part of your body when you're together.
While it’s good to accentuate qualities that you already have, it’s important that you don’t pretend to have certain qualities just to impress your friend. She will likely see through your ruse, and if she doesn’t, you'll be stuck pretending to be someone you aren't.

, Flirting is a great and subtle way to suggest that you're interested and to arouse new feelings in your friend. This is important because you have to get her to see you as a possible love interest, rather than just a friend. There are a number of ways you can flirt with her, including:Orient your body to face her when you two are talking, and lean in slightly when you're engaged in conversation.
Sit closer to her than you normally do when you're together.
Make frequent eye contact with her, and allow your gaze to linger.
Laugh often around her and smile at her frequently

, One major thing that will have to change in order for your friend to see you as a love interest is that you'll have to start treating her like one. This includes:


Complimenting and flattering her
Paying for meals and drinks now and then
Giving her your undivided attention
Not talking about other women that you're attracted to
Picking her up and driving her home sometimes

, One of the biggest things that may change between you and your friend if you start dating is the amount of physical contact you share. You can start by:Touching her arm or hand more often
Touching her back or shoulders
Grazing her foot with yours
Resting your hand on her leg briefly, This means engaging in activities that you would normally reserve for someone you were dating. You can do this without actually asking your friend out yet. Instead, when you're planning time together, suggest date-type outings and events.This could include:


Having dinner at a romantic restaurant
Going dancing
Seeing a movie together
Cooking for her at your house

, Friendships can be delicate, and unrequited romantic feelings can cause awkwardness. Asking out a friend can change the friendship, change group dynamics with mutual friends, and can even end the friendship.


Be aware that asking your friend out might strain the relationship, and you may not see each other for a while.
Once you ask your friend out, she may not feel comfortable being friends with you anymore.
Even if you want to keep it private, your mutual friends might find out as well, and relationships with them could also become strained., While you might ask a stranger out on a date in front of other friends, the dynamic is different when it’s someone you're already friends with. When you're planning to ask her, make sure that:She’s in a place where she's comfortable
You can both leave separately if necessary
You're alone or not around other friends

, Avoid approaching the subject like you have a secret you want to tell her, and don’t start by saying you’ve had feelings for her for a while.


Instead, ask your friend out just like you would if she were any other crush., No matter how nervous you are, on the outside you should try to act like this is any other meeting between you two. Act as though you know she's going to say yes, and when you ask her out:Be direct
Look her in the eyes when you ask, not at the ground
Try not to be too nervous, and avoid fidgeting
Stand or sit up straight
Keep your chin up

, While you should broach the topic of the date with your friend like you would anyone else, you might want to make the proposition a little more special. Since you know her and know what she likes, customize the date for her.Be sure to include a specific time and date. To ask her out, say something like:


“I know you’ve been dying to try that new restaurant, and I want to take you there at 8 p.m. this Saturday, just you and me. What do you say, is it a date?”
“You keep talking about that adventure. Let’s go on a date this Sunday at noon and I’ll take you.”

, When you’ve been friends with someone for a long time, asking her to hang out with you could seem like any other platonic get-together.Make sure you say that you want to go on a date with her, and be clear that the date is romantic.


Do not use the term “hang out,” or she may think you mean any old get-together.
Make sure you use the word “date” when you ask her out.
Be sure to mention it will just be the two of you.
If she asks you something like, “You mean you want to go on a date,” answer with a confident “yes.”

, Often times, people don’t want to date friends because they cherish the friendship and worry about how a date or break-up could change things. Reassure your friend that the friendship is important to you too, and that you don’t want to lose her, but want to take the relationship to a deeper level.You can say something like:


“Your friendship means more to me than a romantic relationship, and I don’t want to risk that, but still want to ask you out”
“I want to be friends with you no matter what, even if you aren't interested”
“I still want to be friends, but am also curious about what we’d be like on a date together.”

, The situation will only be awkward if you allow it to be, so you must go in to this prepared for her to say no. Continue on with your friendship as you normally would.Be patient as well. It’s entirely possible that she said no because your question caught her off guard. After having some time to think about it, she may realize she actually does have feelings for you.

Observe the way he talks to you.,
Keep track of his topic choices.,
Listen to his comments concerning other girls.,
Keep an eye on how he acts when you're apart.,

Notice what he does for you.,
Notice how he acts around other girls.,
See if he goes out of his way to be with you.,

Note how often you hang out.,
Note where you're hanging out.,
When you hang out can be just as important as where.,
Ask around.,
Don't stalk or snoop.,
Be brave and tell him how you feel!,
Don't be disappointed if he doesn't reciprocate your feelings.",How to Tell if a Guy Likes You As More Than a Friend," His body language can reveal how he feels about you. Here are some things to consider:


Listen to his tone. While it may not appear important, it can show how much effort he has put into his words. If he sounds careful in his speech and hesitant, he may have placed some thought into what he is saying. Also, pay attention if he laughs at your awful jokes.
Take notice of his eye contact. Does he look you in the eye when he talks to you, or does he look around the room distractedly? If he maintains direct eye contact, it shows that you're his main focus and that he is interested in the conversation. However, keep in mind that he may avoid looking at you out of shyness.
Note if he gets easily distracted. If someone else approaches him while you're talking to him, does he instantly abandon your conversation? If this does occur more than once, he may not consider your words as important.;
, The subject of your conversation may indicate how he views you. Several signs to watch out for are:



Teasing. Playful teasing may hint that he wishes for you to tease back. If you're brave enough, add subtle flirting to spice up the mood.







Personal Information. Talking about his problems shows that he trusts you. Deeper subjects, such as his fears or family issues, may mean that he wants to take your relationship with him to a deeper level.

Compliments. Comments on your intelligence, appearance, etc. may be a sign that he admires who you are. If he seems to be complimenting you more than often, he might be interested in you.

His Manners. He may soften the edges of his rough personality when he is around you. For example, he might have vulgar behavior around his friends, but he makes an effort to be more refined with you. This is a sign that he is paying attention to you and what you say.

Discussions About Past Relationships. Your conversations with him may take a dip into your past relationships. This indicates that he is making a subtle attempt to see if you're single or interested in other boys.

If he makes constant attempts to set you up with another boy, he may be keeping you in the friend zone.



, It can tell you if he just wants your dating advice or if you're the girl he is after. Constant requests for advice indicate that he may be only interested in your opinion since you're a girl. However, he may also be asking for tips so that he can collect information on your dream guy.


Keep an eye on his past relationships. Short, frequent ones may indicate that he is either a true player or he is attempting to make you jealous.

, Some shy boys make their feelings clearer online or over the phone. Identify the ways he communicates with you, using the following methods:



Phone Calls. His voice will reveal how he feels. A nervous tone, stuttering, and hesitancy may hint that he has feelings for you. Long conversations also push towards the possibility that you interest him. But if he doesn't return your calls or tries to cut you off as soon as possible, he may not want to pursue a serious relationship with you.

Email. Witty emails with good grammar point towards attempts to show off his cleverness and intelligence. This means he spends some time crafting his messages for your benefit.

Text Messaging. Maintaining contact outside of school or work means that he wants to include you in his life. Rather than reserving texting for formal means, he may use it to send you a joke or start conversations. If he puts extra effort into texting you, he may want to put extra effort into your relationship.

Facebook. Does he ""like"" a lot of your photos and post on your wall often? This may be a sign that he is keeping tabs on you.
Take all of this with a grain of salt. Some guys are not interested in phones, emails, or Facebook. He may prefer to see you in person, and there is nothing wrong with that!

, Body language can go a long way in showing you if he'd rather be cuddling with you than just hanging out. Notice the following:



Accidental touches. Attempts to break the touch barrier show that he wants to touch you more. Subtle brushes and hand contact may increase as your friendship progresses.

Staring. His admiration of you may come in the form of staring. If you catch his eye and he smiles before turning away, he knows that he has been caught looking at you.

Body Angles. See if his body is engaged while you're talking to him. If his entire body is turned toward you, he is open to what you have to say. He might also lean closer to you. However, realize that this method does not apply to every boy. Some may have a habit of sitting a certain way.

, Does he go out of his way to be a good friend? This may be an attempt to catch your attention and win your heart. Look out for these signs to know when his actions cross the friendship barrier:



He is always doing favors for you. These favors come in the form of free car rides, fixing you a meal, picking up your laundry, etc. He may be angling for the boyfriend role.

He shows his thoughtfulness. If he brings back your favorite dessert from a bakery or buys you that book you've been meaning to read, he is paying attention to your needs.

He offers you comfort. Not many boys want to comfort an upset girl. But if he cares for you, he will be there to listen to your problems and offer a shoulder for you to cry on.

, Seeing how he treats them can tell you how he feels about you. Here are some ways to get a better sense of his true feelings:



He treats you differently than other girls. While he may be kind to others, you may be the only one he wants to be around in big groups. You also could be the only girl he teases or hugs. If you stick out differently from the other girls, this is a sign that he has his eyes set on you.

However, if you notice him teasing and touching every girl in a five-mile radius, he may just be a flirt.



He flaunts his relationships in front of you. If he is open to letting you hang out with him and his new date, he may see you as a friend.

However, if he has you there to see what you really think, this may be a sign that he knows you're the one for him. If he is hesitant about hanging with other girls, he might already see you as his girlfriend and feels like he is being disloyal.



, This is a sure-fire sign that he wants to take things to the next level. Here are some ways to know how he really feels:



He constantly asks you to hang out. This is an obvious indicator that he wants you to be with him more often. It also gives him the chance to ask you out or get closer with you.

He tries to sidle up to you while you're in groups. If he wants to be your partner during class or in a game, chances are, he can't get enough of you.

He constantly claims that he is ""in your area"" and asks if he can stop by. If he's making excuses for why he wants to hang out, he might be embarrassed about how much he wants to be with you.

, Are you engaging in more date-like activities, or are you on the buddy system? Taking a long hard look at how you hang out can help you understand his real intentions. Here are some things to consider:


Are you doing couple-y things together without being a couple? Do you find yourself grocery shopping, cooking dinner together, or even going to the Farmer's Market with one grocery bag? These may be signs that he sees you as a girlfriend already.
When you hang out, are you hanging solo or with a big group of people? This may indicate if he wants to see you a more than a friend.

If he invites his ten best friends or entire fraternity to join you when you hang out, he may not see you as more than a friend. But pay attention--if he only invites other couples to join you, he probably wants to pair off with you.
But if he invites his siblings, best friends, or if (yikes!) you somehow end up meeting his parents, this is a sure-fire sign that he wants you to be a serious part of his life.



, You can tell a lot about what he really thinks by considering how often and for how long you hang out.


Note the frequency of your hang-outs. If you hardly go a day without seeing him, he may want to spend his nights with you as well as the days. However, if you only see him once a month or so and he lives in your neighborhood, then he may not want to see you more often.
Note how long you hang out for when you see him. Does your coffee date turn into a three-hours philosophical discussion, or is he gone in the time it takes you to ask for the check? If he can't stop talking to you, this is a sign that he wants something more from you.

, One of the easiest ways to see if he sees you as more than a friend is to note the places where you're hanging out. Here are some ways to see if he's trying to kick your relationship up a notch:


If you go out to eat, note the type of restaurant. If you're at a fun, loud, tapas bar, he may see you as more than a friend, but if you're at a quiet, candle-lit restaurant with fine wine, he may be trying to tell you something. However, if he sits down next you at the school cafeteria, that may not mean he's in the market for romance.

Look around at the other people at the restaurant. Are they couples ogling each other, or friends laughing and chatting it up? This may say something about what he has in mind for you.
Don't overthink it. He may really like you--but he might also really like Korean BBQ. The location can be a good indicator, but it can't tell you everything.


If he invites you to the movies, what kind of a movie is it? Are you watching a romantic comedy or tear-jerker, or are you watching a bloody war film or a documentary? His choice of flick may tell you if he wants to put his arm around you or if he just wants a buddy.
If you go to see a show, is it a low-lit jazz show or a female crooner, or a loud death metal concert that makes you go partially deaf? Is it the kind of place where you stand up and rock out, or sit down to romantically enjoy the show?

, This can be a clue to whether he sees you as a casual friend or if he's trying to take things to the next level. Pay attention to two things in particular:


Do you meet during the day, or in the evenings? There's a big difference between a lunch date and a dinner date, or morning coffee and an evening drink. If you tend to hang out more during the day, then you're currently hanging out in the friend zone--but that doesn't mean he doesn't want more.
Do you hang out during the week or weekends? If you're meeting up on Monday instead of Friday, you may find yourself in friend territory once more.

, An easy way to find out how he feels is simply to ask other people. Of course, you should do this with caution because you don't want him to find out what you really think about him. Here are some ways to find out:


Casually ask his friends. Ask his friends if he's seeing anyone or if he has feelings for anyone. Pick a friend you really trust, though--it will be hard to find a guy who breaks bro-code and doesn't report to him immediately.
Ask your girlfriends what they think. Your friends have seen the two of you together and can be honest about their assessment of the situation.
Have your friends ask him. Again, proceed with caution. If it's not too obvious, have one of your girlfriends ask him if he has his eye on someone special. She can pretend that she wants to set him up with someone else, for example.

, There's no way to turn off a guy faster than to be the obsessive girl who tries to learn every detail of his life. Here are some things to avoid at all costs:



Looking through his phone. If he leaves his phone out, do not look through it to see if he's texting other girls. If he catches you, he will see that as a big red flag.

Looking through his email or Facebook messages. If he walks away from his computer for a minute, avoid the temptation to be a snoop.

Following him around to see who he's hanging out with. This may put him more in the mood for a restraining order than romance.

, In the end, things may not move forward if you don't take the initiative. If you're pretty sure he likes you or are just feeling brave and like you have nothing to lose, then go ahead and tell him how you feel.


Be lighthearted. Don't take it too seriously. Don't arrange a time and place to meet up and say, ""I have something important to tell you."" Just find the right moment to tell him you have a crush on him and are wondering if he feels it too. Don't make it a big deal--you don't want him to feel bad if he doesn't feel the same way.
Be creative. Find a fun way to tell him how you feel. You can send him a note, a Valentine, or ask him to solve a riddle. Don't overdo it, but if you think outside the box, he may be impressed.

, In the end, it may just not be meant to be. If you want to continue the friendship, here are some things to keep in mind:


Don't be too disappointed if he doesn't share your feelings. This will just make everyone feel bad in the end. It's better to play it off.
Remind yourself what a great friend he is and how lucky you are to have him. You may have missed out on a chance at romance, but you have a great friend for life.
Know when you need to take a break. If your crush has blossomed into full-blown love, it may be time to take a break from the friendship because it will hurt too much. If you stop crushing on him, you can return to hanging out, but there's nothing worse than torturing yourself by hanging out with someone who doesn't share your feelings.

Have an idea of where and when you want your date to be.,
Ask her in person.,
Go to a mutual friend for help.",How to Ask a Girl out on a Date1," Don't just tell her you'd like to ""hang out sometime."" Ask her directly and include specifics. Have backup ideas in case she doesn't like a certain type of food or is too busy on a certain date.


If she shoots down multiple invitations without suggesting alternatives, she is probably not interested. Many women have a hard time directly saying ""no"" to a date or may be trying to spare your feelings.Dinner at a not-too-fancy restaurant is a good choice for a first date.;
, While it may be tempting to ask her out via phone, text, or the Internet, doing so will block vital nonverbal communication. These indirect approaches can lead to miscommunication that may ruin your chances at a romantic relationship. Instead, simply ask her the next time you see her.

#*When you get a private moment, ask her by saying something like this: ""I was wondering if you were free this Friday night? I'd like to get together just the two of us and check out . Are you interested?""

If you rarely see her, then asking her out through a call or message may be necessary. A sample message you can send would be: ""Hey! This is from . You seem like a really cool person, and I'd like to get to know you better. I was wondering if you'd like to go to this Friday at around 6:00 pm?""

, If you're still struggling to ask her, try asking a mutual friend of yours for some help. Your friend may have some tips or insights about what she likes. Your friend may also be willing to help ""set you up"" or in some other way help you to ask her out.Even though a mutual friend may make things easier, do not expect your friend to ask her for you.


To broach the subject, try saying something like this to your friend: ""Hey, you know ? I kind of want to ask her out. Has she said anything about me? Do you think she'd be interested?""
Make your intentions clear. You don't have to explicitly tell her ""this is a date,"" but don't disguise your feelings. If she asks about it being a ""date-date"" or your attraction to her, be honest. Trying to ""play it cool"" by pretending to not be romantically interested in her will probably backfire.

Find a good opening sentence during your conversation.,
Exchange a handful of messages about the topic and observe her answers.,
Ask her out when you find a good place to tell her about your feelings.,
Let the girl reply before you say anything else.,
Take it calmly if the girl says no or friend-zones you.,
Don't reply with something cheesy if the girl says yes like: 'Great, I knew you would say yes!'.,

, If she sounds unsure, try to make the topic a bit lighter, but not too chatty. If she starts to show signs of relaxing, pick the topic up again.


If your crush sounds like the topic is really making her nervous, carefully change the topic and revisit it at a later time.
If she doesn't sound nervous at all, continue conversing with her about dating and boyfriends.

, Try not to (unless you naturally chat this way) use an abundance of exclamations points. This might make her nervous again.

, Understand that there may be many reasons for her answer such as nervousness, her parents not wanting her to date, her thinking of you in a brotherly way, etc. Be polite and understanding in your reply.


Make sure you don't stay silent for too long, as she may feel like she really hurt your feelings. Don't make the girl feel guilty, no matter how sad or hurt you may be. This is an easy way to make things awkward between the two of you, or to ruin a friendship that could have sparked into something at a later point.

, If she isn't the fluffy romantic type, you should still give her some love. Don't be too cliché (e.g. chocolate, moonlit dates, a lot of candlelight, flowers) and be personalized and individual with whatever you do with her.

, Try to stay friends with the girl and accept that things don't always go the way that they are planned. The world keeps spinning, and there are many paths out there for you to choose from.

, Trust in her and don't act too protective and jealous. Best of luck to you both and congratulations!

If they don't know you very well and you ask them out, they're probably more likely to say no. You don’t have to be best friends – and it’s probably better if you’re not, because you want to steer clear of The Friend Zone – but it does help if you know each other a bit, so that you’re on her radar and so that she thinks you’re a nice guy. If she has no idea who you are or if all she has to go by is gossip or guesses, then she’ll have a less likely chance of saying yes when you ask her out.


Be friendly. Say hi to her and use her name to show that you’re thinking about her.
Make an effort in a group setting. Ask how her day is going or give her a light compliment.
Pay just a little bit of attention to her. Wave to her if she walks past you in the halls or sits behind you in class.
Remember that you don’t have to come on too strong to get her attention. In fact, playing hard to get a little bit will catch her eye even more.;
, If you want her to go out with you, then you have to build up a bit of chemistry first. You have to be a little bit flirtatious to see if you two can manage to have some light banter, laugh together, and to have a real connection. You can compliment a new outfit she’s wearing, tease her a bit (if she’s not too sensitive) or just joke around in a way that makes her see that you like her.


If you’re in a group setting, pay attention to her, but don’t monopolize her time. Make her want to flirt with you, too, instead of just having her wait for you to come her way.

, Though there’s no way to know if she really likes you until you ask her out, you can look out for some signs that you've caught her eye. Knowing that she may have a thing for you can up your confidence when it’s time to pop the question. Here are some signs that she may like you:


She may completely ignore you or pay a lot of attention to you in a group setting
She may smile or blush when you catch her eye
Her friends may whisper or giggle as they walk by you
You just get a good, flirtatious feeling whenever the two of you talk
Other people have teased you two about liking each other
She always seems to be looking for excuses to talk to you
Check how often she touches you and see if she makes a stupid excuse for it. This doesn't mean that if she touches you once or twice that she likes you.

, If you want to ask her out, then you don’t have to pick the perfect place and time, but it does help if you pick a good opportunity to improve on your chances. If she wants to go out with you, then she’ll probably say yes under most circumstances, but you can improve your chances of getting the answer you want by picking a place that is pretty private without making the girl uncomfortable, and by picking a time when she’s in a good mood and not likely to be distracted or stressed out.


You don’t have to wait around too long for the perfect opportunity to present itself. Girls in middle school can be pretty fickle, so if you feel like you have a pretty good opportunity to ask her out, go for it instead of waiting for the perfect one.

, When you ask her out, you will probably have to think of something to do together! This may seem fairly obvious to you, but you may be so concerned about whether or not she’ll say yes or how you’ll ask her that you haven’t really thought about what will happen after you ask the big question. Though, in middle school, some guys just mean that they want to be girlfriend/boyfriend when they ask girls out, it’s nice to actually think of something to do together, so when she says yes, you can say, “Awesome! How about we…” Instead of just saying, “Awesome! Um…uh…I guess I’ll see you around then.” Here are some things you can ask her to do:


Go to a school dance that’s coming up
Go to see a movie that’s coming out
Go to a concert
Go to the mall together
Let you walk her home after school
Go to a birthday party together

, Make sure you get her alone enough that her friends aren't around giggling and teasing you guys, but that she’s not so isolated that she feels scared or unsafe. Pick a time and place like after school, by your lockers, during a small party, or even after a school dance. Try not to ask her before school because she’ll probably be thinking about what she has to get done that day and may be distracted. Also, don’t ask her before a big test or anything.


Pick a time when she’s not likely to be stressed out or sad and check that she seems like she’s in a good mood when you approach her.

, Confidence is half the battle in any game, but also act a little nervous, show her that you like her. Though being Mr. Confident won’t help you much if she’s just not interested, it will help you ask your question as well as you can if she is interested. You just have to keep your head high, put a smile on your face, and remember to breathe and to let your body relax. Even if you’re sweating bullets or feel your stomach clenching, you have to act like you’re totally cool with talking to her – and pretty soon, you’ll see that you’ve tricked yourself into feeling confident!


You don’t have to act arrogant. Just act like you know you’re a cool guy and that any girl would have a great time dating you. Make sure that you don’t end up acting a little bit too different from your everyday self.

, You probably don’t want to say, “Hey! Do you want to go out with me?” That will be just a bit too abrupt, even for the most direct girls out there. While you don’t want to dilly dally too long, give it a minute or two so both of you are feeling comfortable so that you feel ready to ask her out and that she feels ready to answer your questions. Just say hi, ask her how she is, and maybe think of one or two things to mention before you go in for the kill.


If it’s really obvious that you’re going to ask her out and you’re just kind of looking at the floor and kicking imaginary dust balls, then it’s time to spit it out.

, You don’t have to be elaborate about it. Just say, “I really like hanging out with you. Will you go out with me?” Or, “Would you like to be my girlfriend?” Keep it short and sweet and watch her face to see how she feels about it. You don’t need to list the twenty reasons why you love her or to convince her that you’d be Boyfriend of the Year. Just come up with a one or two sentence phrase that will let you easily ask her out. After that, all you can do is sit back and wait for an answer.


Make eye contact when you ask her instead of looking away or at the floor. She’ll be impressed with your confidence.

, After you ask her out, she’ll have few options other than saying yes or no. So, if she says yes, give her a hug, smile big, and let her know that you’re excited to be going out with her without doing a happy dance. Make her see that you’re pumped to be going out with her and that you think she’s a cool girl. Now go ahead and suggest whatever plan you had up your sleeve – and the rest is history!


If she doesn't want to go out with you, don’t despair. Thank her for talking to you and make a graceful exit. Don’t be mean to her, kick your locker, or come off looking like a wimp. Remember that you want her to think highly of you even if she doesn't want to be your girlfriend. And don’t ever forget that there are plenty of fish in the sea – especially in middle school!

, The school dance is a great place to ask the girl out. Just wait for a slow song, ask her to dance, and ask her if she wants to be your girlfriend at the end of the song. You’ll know from looking into her eyes while you’re dancing whether or not you have a chance. You can also use the dance as an excuse to ask her out, beforehand. Though this is more bold and puts the pressure on a bit, it gives you a great excuse to ask the girl out!


The vibe at the dance is guaranteed to be a bit more romantic, say, than the vibe in your school cafeteria during lunch, so if you ask her out at the dance, there’s a better chance she’ll have romance on her mind. The downside: it may be next to impossible to get her away from her friends.

, If you think you’re a Casanova when it comes to the written word, then write her a cute, short note that tells her that you like her and that you want her to be your girlfriend. This is a pleasant way to surprise her and to take off some of the pressure of having a real conversation; just make sure you know that she’ll get the note, whether you’re giving it to her during class or sticking it in her textbook or locker.


Tell her to get back to you via note. Whatever happens, there’s nothing to be nervous about because she won’t have to be there to see your reaction!

, This should be more of a last resort. If you really feel shy but want to ask the girl out and have a brave friend or two who have enough charisma to talk to the girl (without charming her too much, of course), then you can have one of your buddies go up to the girl and ask her if she wants to go out with you. Just make sure they know exactly what to say and that they don’t end up making you look like a wimp or misrepresent your intentions.


If you really want a trusted friend to ask her out for you, then you may want to rehearse what he’s going to say. Yeah, this will feel ridiculous, but you’ll be grateful that you’ve prepped your friend for the big move!

, You can also ask the girl over the phone if you’re more of a phone guy. Call her up (hopefully you have her number already) and ask her if she wants to go out with you. For this move, it’s especially important to think of something that you can do together so you don’t just ask her out and then struggle to awkwardly get off the phone. You can also get her number from a friend of hers if she’s willing to give it out – after that, she’ll probably know what to expect when you call.

, If you’re already friends or know each other fairly well and you have an idea of what she might like, you can give her a nice but inexpensive piece of jewelry, a CD, a book, a nice notebook, or something that you think she’ll like without overwhelming her or making her uncomfortable by how nice it is. You can ask her out while giving her the gift, or even prepare a note asking her out within the gift so you can take some of the pressure off.

, This maneuver is not for the faint of heart. If you really like her, write, “Will you go out with me, (her name here)?” outside in chalk and take her for a walk to show it to her. Yeah, it’ll be a little embarrassing if she says no, but imagine how cute it would be if she said yes to your chalk message!

, Get her her favorite type of cookie or dessert and have someone write, “Will you go out with me?” on it in icing. This may sound cheesy, but if you’re able to pull it off, she’ll be impressed by your thoughtfulness and your creativity and won’t be able to resist you. Make sure you have a steady hand when you write your message and the rest will follow!

Avoid doing anything that makes her feel pressured or unsafe.,
Call, text, or email her the next day to set up a date.,
Remember that the worst thing that can happen is that she says ""no.""",How to Ask a Girl out on a Date2," Don't approach a girl walking alone on a deserted street at night. Likewise, don't ask a girl out if she is somehow ""trapped"" with you in a location, such as elevator or cornered in a room. A good way to make her feel safe is to talk to her with other people nearby and visible.


Don't make any kind of physical contact unless she does so first. A quick way to make her feel threatened is to invade her personal space.
Introduce yourself politely. Try making eye contact before greeting her. Tell her your name and give her a non-vulgar compliment. If she responds in kind with her name and a reciprocal compliment or expression of gratitude, mention wanting to get to know her.






Something you could start with would be: ""Hey, I really like your shirt. is great!"" Then wait for her response. Follow up with: ""My name is , by the way.""
If she ignores your greeting, it's best to back off.
If she seems receptive and neither of you are in a hurry, feel free to have a longer conversation.
Give her your contact information. While most guys think they're ""supposed"" to ask a girl for her phone number, it's best to offer yours first. This takes a lot of pressure off of her and may make her more open minded about your offer.Write it down on a scrap of paper instead of insisting she record it in her phone. which can be seen as creepy and manipulative.






If she's interested, she will likely volunteer her phone number or email without you needing to ask.
An example of something to say when offering her your contact information would be: ""So it was great meeting you, but I need to get going. I really enjoyed talking to you and would like to get to know you better. If you feel the same, here's my number.""

, If she's given you her contact information, don't play mind games or expect her to make the first move. Ask her to dinner at a specific restaurant with an idea of the day and time. Have a few backup options in case she is genuinely busy or averse to a certain food choice.


An example of what to write or say would be: ""Hey this is from yesterday at . I was wondering if you'd be free Friday night around 7:00? There's this restaurant called I've been meaning to try, and I was hoping you might be interested in joining me? If you'd rather go somewhere else or you're busy, let me know what would work better for you. Thanks! I look forward to seeing you again soon.""
If she doesn't return that first call or shoots down multiple offers without suggesting alternatives, she may not be interested in dating. Even if she seemed into you before, people can always change their minds. Respect her decision and move on.

, That may sound like a cliché, but it's an important fact to keep in mind when asking out a girl you don't know. Striking out with someone you have an established relationship with can inject some awkward moments into your life for some time. An advantage of asking out that cute girl you just met at a coffee shop is the lack of outside social pressure. Keep this in mind to boost your confidence.

Pay at least as much attention to what she's doing as what she's saying.,
Look at her eyes.,
Check her posture.",How to Ask a Girl out on a Date3," Properly reading body language is vital to asking a girl out, whether she's a stranger or a friend. This will help you to gauge whether she's interested before you even start talking.


While researchers disagree about exactly how much body language plays a role in human communication, most agree that it is significant., Keep your eyes on her face and see if she returns her gaze. If she won't look you in the eye for very long or is constantly looking elsewhere, there is a good chance that she is not interested in a date.


Remember that there are a few reasons why she may not keep eye contact even if she's romantically interested in you. She may have vision problems, social anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, or some other condition that may make nonverbal communication difficult.

, If she is interested in you, she will likely face in your direction while keeping her arms open and unfolded.


Signs that she's disinterested include crossed arms and a hunched posture.Keep context in mind. If it's a cold day, don't assume that a girl crossing her arms is communicating disinterest.Likewise, if you're standing in the only exit of a room, don't mistake her facing in that direction as a sign of interest in you.

If not, no need to worry, these tips will have the guy you like looking at you constantly, and if you are, you still might want to look at the tips below. Remember, guys are visual creatures and you've got to fine tune that great look you have to grab their attention. Of course, you may end up with lots of other attention from all the other boys while you're at it.;
, You could be the most over weight or super skinny girl in the world, but as long as you know you are beautiful, others will know you are beautiful too. Here's the trick! Look at yourself everyday before going to school and tell yourself you are gorgeous. Actually believe it.


Style - you don't have to be skinny to look good in your clothes. Wear clothing that brings out your best features. If you like your butt wear tight pants with a pocket design to draw attention to that area. Also black clothes make you look slimmer. Love your body and flaunt it. Don't hide beneath baggy potato sacks. Show off your beauty and make that boy look at what he's missing. But don't forget to be yourself, don't wear things for the sake of him, wear them for you.

, If your hair is short, you may want to consider cutting more off for a more refined look, or growing it out and/or straightening it. Invest in high quality shampoos and conditioner.


Whether your hair is long or short it should look stylish. Long straight hair is in but it depends on your look. Some forms of short hair can be cute, sexy, and sporty, but it's up to you.
Pay a little extra and go to the best stylist you can afford in town. This is about making changes for the best and your old standby hairdresser may not cut it. Go to someone great. They know hair and they can find a great look for your face shape.
Go wild with colors! Do something a little different with your hair everyday - guys like that. Sometimes the best way to get their attention is visually.

, If you have acne, then try to invest in good products as much as you can. Wash your face regularly and wash after a workout or if you get sweaty. Take care of your skin.


Drink lots of water! This will flush impurities out of your pores and lessen your chance of blemishes and dry skin.
Visit a dermatologist for skin problem.
If you're clueless about makeup ask your parents to take you to a makeup counter for a consultation. Take notes. If you can't afford to buy all the makeup there, get the foundations and look for the colors elsewhere. Or buy a little at a time.

, Start wearing more if you haven't before. It's not about wearing a lot or wearing trends, it's about wearing what makes you look better. You should never wear too much makeup and always wear colors that complement your skin tone and eye color. Mascara is almost always a safe bet, as long as you know how to apply it properly. If not, ask a friend who does.

, You may want to look at girls who the popular guy seems to like, see how they dress. Even if you are already close friends with him, you should still try to do this. If you ever hear him say ""Hey, she's hot"", scan the girl immediately to see what is she wearing and how she wears it. At the same time, make sure to stay true to your own style instead of just turning into a clone.


Beware: guys may think someone is hot and have no interest in dating them. Risque' may get their attention but being a lady is more likely to win their heart. Keep a mental note of what attracts him. Just maybe integrate some of that type of style into your own personal style. Like art, they might think they are pretty like a painting or sculpture.
If you don't get new clothes very often, then try to at least get a few stylish staples (jeans, skirts, shoes, bag) and mix and match it with other things you have. Make sure they're great fitting and you can wear it with multiple outfits. (You'll have more things to wear a great black bag with than a hot pink one.) Shop stores like New look,Topshop or River Island!

, Never ever do something you aren't comfortable with, you will look awkward. Even if it's just swearing, you will look uncomfortable if you don't normally swear.


Try to have a fun-loving, confident personality, with a soft heart but lots of character and humor. Everyone is more fun when they have a sense of humor, and guys also like when girls are soft-hearted because they can comfort them and it makes them feel like a man which they love.

, Don't totally change yourself for this guy. It's just not worth it. Just incorporate some new things into your style, but make sure you're comfortable with them. It's more likely that he will like you more when you're genuine. People can sense fakers.

, Get involved in activities that interest you. Be an independent, motivated and friendly person. Guys really are attracted to smart and successful more than dumb and fake. Truly get people to like you, and like them. If he knows a lot of people like you, maybe he will try to get to know you.

, Don't make an approach until you're absolutely sure that you've succeeded all the steps above. You want your first impression to be a big one, so you want to look attractive. When your sure you have done these steps, which, of course, may take a bit of time, then you might want to try to talk to him.


Keep it simple but not to simple. Say hi and ask how his day is going, but don't make it boring with the same old 'Hi! How are you?' Ask him questions about his weekend, but don't invade his privacy.

, He may already be interested but afraid to ask you out. Being nice may make you less intimidating. Even if he isn't interested now he will remember you for being nice when he is available.

, Don't go crying and begging at your knees for him to take you. The guy will get annoyed. Give him a space for a couple of weeks. Then try again. Don't do this every so often, the guy will start to ignore you. Maybe try to find someone new! You never know if another cute guy out there is attracted to you!

What does he value? What does he like? What does he do in his free time? If you know such a guy, great! If you do not know any such guy, you'll have to go looking.


Once you determine the kind of guy you're looking for, think about where he'd be. Would he be the type you would meet at a party? That you would run into at sports practice after school? At a music event?;
, Some people might tell you that you should join a club your kind of boy might be in, but that won't last. You need to join a club you enjoy so A) you're happy in it and B) so that you can meet boys that have something in common with you. What'll it be? A drama club? An environmental club? A sport? How about volunteering at the homeless animal shelter? Even if you don't end up meeting that perfect boy, you'll meet some great friends, stay busy, and likely develop a skill.


Needless to say, the only place you aren't going to meet boys is if you sit at home all day and watch TV with your cats. Put yourself out there and you'll have to meet one eventually. There's 3.5 billion of them out there after all.

, This could be your favorite book store if you are an avid reader or a coffee shop if you like coffee. It could even be some place you normally go with your friends. Popular places work too, like skating rinks or ice cream shops – places where people your own age tend to frequent.


You can go in a group or alone, but it's important to spend some time on your own in these places so that the boys that do not feel comfortable in crowds (most boys in this context, really) will be more comfortable approaching you or being approached by you.

, If you work on expanding your horizons, putting yourself out there, going to social events, meetings, gatherings, joining a gym or art class, and pursue your dreams, you will meet that boy. It'll happen. Trust. What's more, you'll likely be happy and be the best version of yourself because you're doing what you love – what could he not fall in love with?


You know the saying, ""It happens when you least expect it?"" Well, it's a saying for a reason. If you go about your life, you'll meet someone who is also going about his life, and you two may be able to combine your greatness together. A boy shouldn't stop you from living whether you have one or not.

, It is possible to find compatible people online in chat rooms, on Facebook, or on message boards about a topic you both enjoy. That being said, be very careful. There are plenty of scammers out there that you shouldn't trust. If you do meet someone, try to find someone who knows them and can vouch that they're the real deal.


For the record, never give out your personal information online. Your name and phone number are okay, but never give your home address or your identity information – why would a boy need it, anyway?

, It is important that you do not search for a generic companion – this usually leads to disastrous, unfulfilling relationships. Instead, if you find yourself ""in need"" of a partner, take it slow. Keep an eye out for individuals with similar interests or attractive personalities. It is important that your core beliefs systems be in sync. Otherwise it just won't last anyway, and someone will end up with their heart broken.


Don't find an ""okay"" guy and think you can change them to make them more desirable. This can do emotional damage and ruin any prospect of love or friendship. If the spark isn't there initially, don't force it. You'll find someone who lights your fire and who feels the same way in return without changing.

, You've looked around, and now you think you've found the right guy. Is he the sort of guy who'd want to spend time with you without the expectation of something more? Is he the sort of person you want to be around long term? Can he take good care of himself? Does he show everyone respect? Do you enjoy his company? If your answers are all ""yes,"" then you're on the right track! Now it's time to take action.


A general rule of thumb for men is this: if you think they know you like them, they don't. If you're certain they know you like them, they might. If you have told them you like them to their face, some of them will still not know you meant it. In these next few steps, we'll have to take it slow and then be pretty clear. You ready?

, If you talk to no one in the group of people around you, it's gonna be pretty hard to open yourself up to this boy. Start by befriending the other people around you. This is good for a few reasons:


He'll see you talking to those around you. This makes you look friendly, fun, and sociable. It'll also make you seem more approachable.
He may be friends with the people you're talking to. This is a natural bridge to get you two talking to each other.
When you talk to everyone, it's only natural that you would start talking to him, too. This makes it look as if you don't have any secret intentions, masking any potential feelings you may not want to slip out.

, The more you get out in to the world and socialize and talk to people, the easier it will become with anyone and everyone. If you only string two words together biannually, you're probably going to be pretty rusty and awkward. And that's normal – no one was born a Casanova – we all learn it.


We are all social animals and tend to pick up this stuff pretty quickly one we get out there and try – and the same goes for you! It'll be hard at first, but with each time it'll get easier and easier. This is why you start with the people around you you aren't interested in – to warm you and your skills up for that special boy.

, If you are smiling and look willing and eager to talk to people, then you are inevitably going to meet them. If you are standoffish or don't add to the conversation at all (like being obsessed with your phone), others will likely move past you, thinking you don't want to talk. Keep your head up and your mind involved and interested in your surroundings. If you're in the same place, you'll be sharing similar experiences, and it'll give you something to talk about.


Imagine this scenario: you're at your after-school club and a whole bunch of you are around a table snacking. A mutual friend cracks a joke and you all laugh and laugh. Later, you two are leaving the parking lot together, and you reference that joke. You share a laugh and it breaks the ice – and you're in.


, Have your hair combed and styled, clothes clean, and have a pleasant scent, too. You probably wouldn't be too crazy about this boy if he looked like he dug himself out of the garbage, right? The same goes for him. To be approachable physically, you've got to look your best. Wear an outfit that makes you feel confident, put on your favorite gloss and a smile, and you'll be ready.


The initial way to get boy's attention will be physically. That's just how it works. Always put your best foot forward – put some effort into your look and you may catch his eye. But that being said, don't go overboard – trying too hard is also a turn-off. It'll be obvious if you're pretending you're something you're not, so always stick to your instincts.

, Don't dismiss yourself or other people – everyone has value, including you. With this attitude, it'll be clear you're friendly and interested in everyone. Why wouldn't he want to get to know you a little better? With your eye contact skills and that beautiful smile, he'd surely want to at least have a conversation or two. A positive attitude will help good things happen; a negative attitude will keep them from happening.


Even if it turns out he's not interested in you, it'll be okay. What if he says no? This is a painful lesson that takes many of us way too many years to learn. If he says no, be happy. You have no idea how many years wondering what might have been he has just saved you. He has now completely freed you up to approach your second favorite man in the whole world. Score.

, Many guys will be nervous about talking to a girl, and keep that in the mind when you're working up your own confidence. He's the one that needs the push, so just add a bit of eye contact or a friendly smile as an invitation for the guy to start a conversation or to see that a conversation with you isn't scary.


This is a good way to give yourself that little nudge to talk to him. When you realize that he's nervous and insecure and probably thinks you're not interested in him even as a friend, it'll help urge you on to making that nice gesture of friendship.

, Say you're in a school hallway and you see that really attractive football jock. He's looking at a poster about sending in a picture for the school yearbook. You walk up to him and ask him if he's going to send one in. Introduce yourself, be open-minded about everything, and just be friendly. And you've done it – the ice is officially broken. It might happen slowly from here, but the hardest part is now over.


You could also ask about whatever he is doing or what he appears to be looking at. If it's something you like, mention that. If it's something you don't know anything about, ask questions and try to learn more about it from the boy. If he's looking at a tour schedule for a band you've never heard of before, say something like, ""Hey, what do they sing? They sound familiar."" Anything to just get the conversation going. Then you can start talking about other bands and hit it off from there.

, You've broken the ice, but now what? Have a deep conversation about each others' philosophy on life? Hmm. Not so fast. To get started, you might want some background information on his interests, like seeing if he's involved in a sport, just so you have something to talk about. Then when you're in the hallway together, you can slip in, ""Hey, you're on the football team, right? Gonna win this week's game?""


This also shows that you're paying attention to him, which will make him feel good. Hopefully, he will begin asking about you and your interests, too. If he does, this may indicate you can comfortably spend more time talking or hanging out.

, The absolute hardest part of talking to anyone is saying that very first thing. And that's over! ...But now you have to keep the conversation going. Here are a few tips for making that initial conversation last:


Gather ideas from your surroundings. If you're at a sports game, make a comment about what just happened (""Aww, did you see that fumble?!"") Then, tell him about a funny or engaging personal story occurring at a past game you went to. He may have a funny story, too.
If you're in a generic location, try looking at the objects around you for clues. Did you have a mirror similar to that one as a child? Tell him about it in an interesting and engaging tone.
The initial conversation doesn't have to be feel-y or deep. It can be as simple as ""I used to have a chair just like that in my childhood home. Man, that reminds me of the good old days, haha!"" Think along the lines of something incredible or funny. Ask him if he has a similar story, too.

, Act like it's just a casual meeting, because it is. Don't jump the gun just yet; it's still a simple conversation. If you feel the conversation winding down, respect that and let it end. You'll have another one another day. If the conversation is great, let it go where it takes you. If he asks for your number or your Facebook information, great! If he doesn't, that's fine, too.


If you're feeling confident and brave and it's going well, you could ask for his number yourself. Some people like the direct attitude. However, don't do this out of the blue. Preface this with some friendly conversation or questions such as, ""You having fun?"" or ""I've never seen an like that. It suits you!"" Be sure to look lively, friendly, and approachable. Laugh where it suits the conversation. Confidence is key. The ultimate goal should be to either get his number or other contact info (Facebook, email, etc.).

, The only way to know if you two get along and if you have chemistry is to start out as friends. Spend some time in groups together, make chitchat, see each other at parties, and get a feel for each other. If it's growing, let it grow. You can then take action when you're feeling confident.


Don't be desperate. It will likely scare him off if you say something like, ""You are the most amazing person I have ever seen. I know you don't know me at all, but I'd really love you to."" For some men, being desperate can attract them initially, but it doesn't keep them. It's far better to take it slow and start out as a friend.

, Sure, you see this guy around at parties and you talk a bit, you're in English class together, and maybe you run into each other at football games, but it's not enough. You may have to take matters into your own hands – start by asking him to join you and a couple of friends one night this week for whatever you're doing. If a test is coming up at school, that's a great excuse for a ""study"" night.


And once you get comfortable hanging out in a smaller group, that's when you can level up to hanging out alone. It's all about baby steps – not taking leaps.

, You've put all this work in and now what? Well, in time you can make it clear you like him or maybe he'll make it clear that he likes you. Either way, it's a step in the right direction. Ask a mutual friend or two about your chances – he may be asking them the same thing.


It's best to do this in private and when the mood is right. If you two are alone, you've had a good afternoon together, and he seems to be in a good mood, that's it. You may have to spit it out before you get nervous, but hopefully it comes out as something like, ""You know, I really like you. I think we'd be really great together. Do you want to go out sometime?"" If he says yes, fantastic. If he says no, keep your cool. ""I understand; I just wanted to be honest,"" is a safe response. You handling it well may surprise and impress him, potentially changing his mind.

Assess how much you could actually afford.,
Think of the possible places to take her that is considered affordable if money is an issue.,
Make a good impression.,
Always prepare something to say.,
Let her talk more often, listen and try to show interests.,
Never lie.,
Do more than being a nice guy.,
Consider meeting her somewhere.,
Show a sense of humor.,
Make them comfortable.,
Don't immediately take them to your place.",How to Ask a Girl out on an Affordable Date Without Looking Cheap," It's a really bad idea to go out on a date and ended up noticing halfway that you couldn't afford it.


It's common to assume that guys usually pay on the first date. Guys generally pay first because it shows that they are willing to pick up the tab and doesn't always require them to pay.;
, It's a good idea to have some sort of idea of places that you could take her. Don't rule anything out either. Places that can allow more social interactions is best. Such as:


Park for a walk
Consider going for a hike if you two are pretty athletic
A coffee date is a good way to have an opportunity to get to know her better as a person.
Consider taking her to one place, then try to improvise afterwards
Consider taking them out to a movie before a coffee date if you need to have something to talk about later.

, Girls like it when you actually try to show that you are trying to be a good guy instead of being such a rude jerk and a slob.

, Silence always creates awkward moments and will make her uncomfortable so prepare some conversation starters. But make sure to make them realistic and something you both can relate to.


Topics like the weather or shared interests

, Girls generally prefer guys who listen and show interests in what they are showing.

, Lying is generally a complete turn off and girls can usually tell if someone is lying and can be offended by it. When you do have to tell a difficult truth that will most likely hurt their feelings, then try to show them that you're just trying to be honest and wasn't trying to be rude. Girls appreciate it when guys try to tell the truth even if it's hard.

, Girls really do like nice guys but they want more than politeness and niceness from them. They want guys to show initiative and stand up for themselves and for them too.

, It's usually pretty common for people to meet up somewhere if distance and/or schedules is an issue. Also it gives you an opportunity to not use up the gas money picking her up.

, Girls like it when you make them laugh. Consider not making random jokes that don't make sense at all since that will sometimes cause awkwardness.

, They generally tend to relax more and be themselves if you avoid doing anything to make them uncomfortable.

, Girls usually don't want you to rush things, especially if it's on the first or second date.

Always make time for your friends.,
Find new things to do together.",How to Get an 11 Year Old Boy to Like You," A lot of girls your age may not have a ton of experience talking to boys yet, so you can make yourself stand out by simply taking the time to talk to the boy you like. You don’t have to come up to him and start an intense conversation, especially if you’ve never spoken before, but just making the move to say “hi,” give him a small wave, or ask a question about class can give you the opening to start talking. He’ll be impressed that you’re so confident and will want to talk to you more.


At first, you can just say “hi” to him in a group setting or even introduce yourself. You can build your way up to talking to him the next time.
If you’re shy, you can think of something to say to him in advance, like asking how he likes the class you have together or how his baseball game went.;
, You don’t have to hide under your desk or ignore him every time he passes you by. Just smiling at him will lead him to wonder who you are and will make him want to know more about you. Guys also like girls who are friendly because they put them at ease and make them feel more comfortable. You may think that they really like girls who are cool and quiet, but that’s just a myth; just the act of smiling at the guy will get him to notice you and to want to get to know you more.


Smile at him when you make eye contact. You don’t have to seek the guy out just to smile at him.

, Another way to get the guy to notice you is to make sure that he sees you having fun. Whether you’re talking to your friends, playing in the street with your neighbors, or standing in the cafeteria line, he should see that you’re a positive person who generally enjoys herself no matter where she goes. Seeing that you’re a fun, pretty happy person who likes what she’s doing will attract the guy and will make him want to get to know you. If he always sees you scowling or staring at your phone, then he may not think you’re a very fun person to spend time with.


This doesn’t mean that you should fake it. If you’re having a terrible day, you don’t have to laugh loudly to get the guy’s attention. But in general, you should make a point of being a person who is happy and easy to be around. If he sees you smiling and laughing, he’ll want to spend more time with you to soak up your positive energy.

, If you carry yourself in a confident manner, then the boy will think that you’re confident in who you are. You should keep up good posture whether you’re standing or sitting and make sure not to slouch. Avoid folding your arms across your chest or you’ll look unfriendly or insecure. Instead, keep your arms out at your sides and sometimes use them to gesture when you speak. When you’re walking or talking to people, look straight ahead instead of down at the floor.


Another way to have confident body language is to turn your body towards the person you’re talking to. If you’re talking to the boy you like, turn toward him, to show that you’re comfortable talking to him.

, Guys like girls who are confident and who are happy with who they are and how they look. Though many eleven-year-olds can be insecure, as their bodies and ideas of the world change, you can work on being confident in the person you are and the changes you are going through. Talk loudly enough to be heard without being obnoxious and avoid putting yourself down in conversation. You don’t have to seem like you think you’re the greatest thing since sliced bread, but you should generally give off the impression that you like who you are if you want to get the guy to like you.


To be confident, don’t say anything bad about yourself, unless you’re playfully poking fun at yourself and make it clear you’re only joking.
Talk about the things you really care about or are good at. This will show that you’re happy with who you are.
You don’t have to be perfect to be confident. However, you should be aware of your flaws and should want to work on them.

, Don’t go thinking that a guy will only like you if you’re popular and mean to a lot of people. If you pick on people who you think are “less cool” than you just to make yourself look good, any nice guy won’t like that. You can work on building a positive image by being friendly and nice to everyone who deserves it, instead of being selectively mean or nice. If you’re friendly with pretty much everyone in school, then the guy will want to get to know you because he’ll see that you must be cool if you click with so many people.


Boys tend to hate drama. It’s much easier for them to like girls who are friends with everyone than girls who are constantly feuding with people.
If there’s a new girl in school, take it upon yourself to take her under your wing.
If you throw a party, try to be inclusive and invite everyone you like instead of leaving people out just to be mean.

, If you want to get the guy to notice you, then you have to find a way to stand out to him. This doesn’t mean you have to dye your hair pink or play the banjo to catch his eye. It does, however, mean that something about you has to seem different to him. It could be your quirky sense of humor. It could be your awesome fashion sense. It could be the way you can start a conversation with literally anyone. Find your thing and make sure he notices it.


It can be anything from your love for singing and dancing to the jewelry that you make for your friends. It’s important that you’re passionate about something, but it doesn’t matter what it is.
Of course, you should stand out for something positive, not for being mean to your teachers or starting drama.

, Don’t be afraid to show off your sense of humor, even if you think it’s a little quirky or offbeat for his taste. Girls are sometimes afraid to show boys their sense of humor because they think it’s not “cute”; the truth is, many guys love nothing more than a girl who can make them laugh. You can playfully tease him, even go out on a limb and tell him a corny joke, or just make funny observations about your teachers, TV shows, or your mutual friends. He’ll be even more interested in you once he sees you can crack him up.


Really, talking to a boy you like isn’t different from talking to one of your girlfriends. Don’t try to censor yourself in the humor department and just be your same old funny self.

, Another way to get a guy’s attention is to give him a little compliment. This can mean telling him you like his shirt, or compliment a hat with his favorite sports team’s logo on it while saying you’re a fan of the team, or going to his basketball game with a few of your friends and telling him he did a great job afterwards. You don’t have to mention anything that may be too forward, like telling him he has nice eyes, or that may make him blush a little too much. But mentioning something he’s good at or something he’s wearing may make him notice you.


Don’t go overboard. Just say something like, “Nice job in the game today” or “I like your new shoes” to get his attention.

, Another way to keep the boy interested is to show that you don’t take yourself super seriously at all and that you’re able to take a joke. You can lightly make fun of yourself without sounding insecure, or just talk about how much fun you’re having on your soccer team without worrying about how good you are. There’s no need to be super stressed about school, your friendships, or your outside activities, and you should show that you can roll with the punches. Guys like it when girls are motivated but also when they don’t worry too much, because it’s more fun to loosen up and have a good time.


Try to avoid talking worrying about how you come off all the time and focus on enjoying the moment. It’s much more important to enjoy yourself than to have a perfect image.
Focus on talking about all the good things you’re looking forward to doing, instead of worrying about everything that can go wrong for you.

, If you want to keep the guy interested, then you have to show him that you’re interested in who he is as a person. You don’t need to interrogate him, but you should make an effort to get to know him, from talking about his siblings to his favorite bands or TV shows. Make sure that there’s a balance between talking about yourself and asking the guy a few questions, and give him time to open up. Here are some great things you can ask him questions about:


His favorite TV shows, bands, or movies
His favorite sports teams
His hobbies or interests
His pets
His weekend or summer plans

, If you want the guy to really like you and even to see you as a potential girlfriend, then you shouldn’t get your friends to talk to him for you or to text him or give him notes. Though it may be less scary to communicate with him this way, he’ll be much more impressed if you’re mature enough to talk to him yourself. If you have something important to say to him, then take a deep breath and muster up the courage to say it yourself.


Your friends may even offer to talk to him for you. It may be tempting, but you should gently turn them down, explaining that you’d rather talk to him yourself.

, If you want to keep the boy’s interest, then you should let him know what makes him special. This doesn’t mean you have to give him a list of all of your favorite things about him, but it can help if you show him that you really notice what makes him stand out. You can mention how much you like his sense of humor, how easy it is to talk to him, or just a reason why he’s not like the other boys he knows. Once you get to know each other and it’s pretty clear you like each other, then letting him know how you feel can make him see that you really get him.


You can say something like, “It’s so easy for you to talk to almost anyone. How do you do that?” You can also say, “You never fail to crack me up.”
You can also say, “I feel like you really understand me. It’s easy to tell you anything.”

, Though wowing a guy with your charm and confidence can go a long way, if you want to keep him interested, then you have to find common ground so you can find something to talk about. You don’t have to have everything in common, but it would be nice if you liked some of the same bands, TV shows, sports teams, celebrities, or even outdoor activities. Work to find something that you like and find a way to explore that interest together, like going to a baseball game, watching a movie together, or even reading the same book and then talking about it. Here are some things you can have in common:


Favorite bands
Favorite TV shows
Favorite movies
Similar upbringing
Having siblings
Favorite foods or restaurants
Shared sense of humor

, It can be a little tricky to make friends with boys when you’re only eleven, but it’s important to try to be nice to the boy’s friends if you want to make his affection last. You don’t have to be best friends with his friends, but you should at least be friendly and kind, so that they have nice things to say to him about you. If you come off as standoffish or mean, then they’ll try to tell the boy not to hang out with you, and some boys tend to listen to their friends at that age.


When you see his friends, say “hi” and ask how they’re doing. Get to know them a little bit to show that you really care about their friend.
If you don’t like one of his friends, don’t tell him that. It’ll only cause a rift between you.

, Since you’re only eleven, you don’t need to think about getting too intimate with the boy. Still, some light affection can help your relationship stay strong. You can hold hands, whether you’re walking together or watching a movie. You can give him a hug when you see him, or even have him put his arm around you if you’re hanging out together. Just a little bit of affection can go a long way in keeping your relationship strong.


Just remember that a lot of eleven-year-old boys aren’t into publicly showing affection, even if they like somebody a lot. Start slow with showing affection publicly and see what he’s comfortable with.

, You may see hearts, rainbows, and butterflies whenever you lay eyes on the boy, but you may want to keep that to yourself. You should let him know you like him without saying that you think you want to marry him and that you’re totally in love with him, or you’ll be scaring him off a bit. Remember that, when you’re eleven, it’s important to keep the relationship light and fun instead of getting intense too soon. This is good advice, in fact, for the beginning of any relationship at any age!


You can write him notes to say hi and to tell him that you’re thinking of him. However, you don’t have to feel compelled to tell him the fifty things you like the most about him.

, You should enjoy spending time with the boy and living in the moment instead of thinking about the future too much. Just enjoy it for what it is instead of worrying about what will happen next year, over the summer, or when Valentine’s Day rolls around. Instead, focus on getting to know the boy and having a good time together, and you’ll see that you’ll be able to have a great time without overthinking it.


At first, avoid asking the boy what he thinks about you in the long term, or what will happen to you over the summer or as you transition to middle school, if that’s coming up soon. You’ll cross that bridge when you get there.

, If you want the relationship to truly last, then you have to make sure you find a balance between spending time with your new boy and your old friends. Your friends will always be there for you, and you don’t want to kick them to the curb just because there’s a new love interest in your life. Finding a healthy balance between your boy and your other friends will keep your relationship strong and meaningful.


If you spend time with your friends in addition to the boy, then you’ll have more time to miss each other.
Balancing your relationship with your friendships is a skill that it may take years to master, so why not start early? Having time for all the people you care about is important to your happiness.

, To make your relationship last, you should avoid falling into the same old routine. Though there are some limits to things you can do together when you’re eleven, you can try to keep things interesting by trying new restaurants, going to school dances together, or even watching sports together. It can be nice to find a routine that you both like while also keeping the relationship fresh with new and exciting activities.


Go to the pool, a lake, or a beach together with the boy and a bunch of your friends.
Check out an old comic book store together.
Have a retro day and hang out on the playground.
Play kickball with a bunch of your friends.
Invite some friends over for a pizza and movie night.
Sometimes, you can have the most fun just by taking a walk together and talking about life.

Smile.,

Be specific with an idea for a date, if possible.,
Exchange contact information.,
Call the person within a day or two of getting their number.,

Notice the difference between a “real” and a “fake” smile by noticing if the skin at the outer corners of their eyes creases when they smile.These creases indicate that the person is genuinely happy. If you do not see these creases, they may just be smiling to be polite. Their smile may also lack eye creases if they have suffered nerve damage or have had Botox treatments.;
, Start by making an observation about something you both have in common or something you are both seeing or experiencing at that moment. Then reveal something about yourself related to that, and follow up immediately with a question about them.

If you are at a music concert, you could make an observation about the band, like, “The guitarist played a great solo during that last song. This is my first time seeing this band. Have you seen them perform before?”
You could make a comment about the weather by saying, “The weather this afternoon is perfect. I’ve been waiting for it to warm up enough to go kayaking down the river. Have you ever kayaked the river?”
If the person you’re trying to talk to is wearing an interesting accessory or piece of clothing, you could begin with an observation about it, such as, “That’s a very interesting necklace you have on. It reminds me of a hand-carved figurine I saw at a market in Marrakesh. Did you make it yourself?”

, Pickup lines may be funny to joke about with friends, but using them in earnest while trying to ask out a stranger can make you seem like you’re not smart or charming enough to think up something original on your own.Additionally, many pickup lines are insulting and belittling, and could make the person you approach feel objectified or just turn them off of you completely., Once you’ve begun a conversation and you’ve determined that this is a person you’d like to spend more time with, take a moment to introduce yourself and ask them to introduce themselves in return.


You might say, “My name is Casey, by the way. What’s yours?”

, This is a great time to initiate physical contact. If the person’s body language is showing you that they are interested in and attracted to you, you may want to hold their hand longer than a typical handshake. Consider placing your other hand on top of theirs, so you are holding their hand in both of yours. Another very flirtatious option is to bring their hand to your lips and kiss it just above or below the knuckles.


If the person is reluctant to give you their name or pulls their hand away quickly after a handshake, then the person may not be attracted to you and is just talking to you to be polite.

, Asking if the person is in a relationship will signal that you are romantically interested in them. If the person is already in a committed relationship, they will probably not be interested in going on a date with you. If they are not in a relationship but not interested in you, asking them about a significant other gives them the opportunity to say they are not interested in dating at this time.


You can ask directly if they have a significant other by saying, “So do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?” or “Are you seeing anyone right now?”
You may also ask in a more passive way by saying, “Where is your boyfriend tonight?” or “That’s a nice watch. Did your girlfriend buy it for you?”, This approach paves the way for you to ask them on a date. For example, if they are planning to go to a concert with friends on Friday night, you can ask them to go out with you on Saturday.


You may use this approach instead of asking about a significant other directly. Asking them what they're doing over the weekend gives them the opportunity to mention a significant other if they have one by saying, “My girlfriend and I are going bowling on Saturday.”

, Tell the person why you find them attractive and that you would like to get to know them better. Ask if they would be interested in spending more time with you on a date.


For example, you could say, “I’m really enjoying this conversation with you. You know so much about kayaking, and you are very beautiful, too. I would love to see you again and get to know you better. Would you like to go out on a date with me?”

,

If you can’t think of a date idea on the spot, tell them that you will call them to set up the specifics for your date. If you’ve gotten to know the person through conversation, you might have an idea already of what would make a good date.

For example, if you think they’ll like a particular band that is playing on Friday night, ask if they’d like to go to the concert with you by saying, “Have you seen the Essentials play yet? They’re doing a show Friday night at Joy Theater. Would you like to go with me?”

, If the person agrees to go out on a date with you, make sure you get their contact information. Ask for their phone number so you can contact them. Be direct by simply asking, “Can I get your phone number?”


If you sense that they would prefer to be in control on contacting you, offer to give them your number by saying, “Here’s my phone number. Call me this week so we can set something up for the weekend.”

, Calling them promptly shows that you are interested in them and that you take them seriously.


If you haven’t already set a specific time and place for your date, have a specific idea in mind to invite them to when you call. Being indecisive can be a turn-off for some people and if you call without a specific idea in mind, it may seem like you don’t respect them enough to plan ahead., Even if all their body language indicates they are attracted to you, there is still a possibility the person could turn you down for a date. Tell them that you really enjoyed talking to them and that you wish them the best before parting ways with them.


There are many different reasons that a person might turn you down for a date. They may be attracted to you, but have something going on in their life that makes it difficult for them to date, such as if they have a demanding job or have to travel a lot. They may also have just gotten out of a serious relationship and may not be ready to date again. Or maybe they just don’t find you as attractive as you thought they did. Rejection does not mean that you did anything wrong; it’s just not the right fit with this person at this moment in time.Appreciate that it can be difficult to be honest with someone when they are asking you out on a date. If this person tells you upfront that they do not want to date you, they are being more courageous than giving you their phone number and then never answering your calls., Sustained eye contact for 2-3 seconds is a sign that a person is attracted to you.A person who is being shy or flirtatious may look at your, look away and then look back several times. On the other hand, if the person looks away and does not look back or turns their head or body away from you, this is a sign they are not interested in you.Some women may tuck their chin down then look up at you and bat their eyes quickly.A man may be more likely to raise his eyebrows briefly to show he’s interested., Signs of availability include smiling, uncrossed arms and legs, and looking up or straight ahead.Unavailable or defensive postures include folding their arms across their chests, crossing their legs tightly, and looking down at their feet or even a cell phone.

How a woman holds her purse is a great indication of availability. If she is holding her purse in front of her body or clutching it tightly against her side, she may subconsciously be trying to “hide” from you or place an obstacle between you and her. Holding her purse at her side or pushed towards her back are good signs that she’s open to you. If you are in a busy, crowded area, she may just be clutching her purse because she is afraid of getting it stolen or being pickpocketed, so pay attention to other signs of attraction as well.
A woman who is wearing a skirt may keep her legs crossed out of propriety while she is sitting and still be open to you. Turning her torso towards you is a good indication that she is open to being approached. She may also change her position from crossing her legs at the knees to crossing them at the ankles, which is another indication she may be attracted to you.
A man may stand with his hands on his hips or, if sitting, spread his legs further apart to widen his stance. Both of these gestures are indications he is attracted to you., A person who is attracted to you may start running their fingers through their hair. A woman with longer hair may flip her hair off her shoulder to expose her neck.

A man may either smooth out or mess up his hair to make his hairstyle more flattering and attractive., People instinctually point their feet towards someone they are attracted to. If the person has turned their feet to point at you, it’s a good indication that they are attracted to you, or at least very interested in you., It is possible that a married person may be attracted to you and show signs of being interested in meeting you. However, if they are legally attached to someone else, they may not be interested in dating you or may be looking for someone to cheat on their spouse with. Only proceed in asking this person out if you are comfortable with this potential complication or are prepared for being turned down.

Stop trying to get your ex back if the relationship was toxic or abusive.",How to Get Your Ex Boyfriend Back," The first thing you need to do is take a long, hard look at what factors led up to the breakup. Consider whether these same difficulties are likely to cause more relationship problems if you try to get back together, or if you might be able to get past them.It's important to think about what you might have done to cause the breakup. Blaming your ex for everything is not a great way to get him back!;
, Breakups are never easy, even when the relationship was not a good fit. For this reason, it's crucial to think about your motives for wanting to get your boyfriend back. If you want to get back together because you are sad or lonely or don't like being single, you should probably reconsider. Just because you miss your ex does not mean you should be with him. These feelings will go away eventually, although it may take some time. If you want to get back together because you genuinely care for your ex and you can see yourself having a future with him, then go ahead and try to get him back!If your boyfriend was physically, emotionally, or verbally abusive in any way, you should not try to get back together with him. It's perfectly normal for you to miss him even if it was an unhealthy relationship, but it's important to remind yourself that you can do better.

, Because the end of a relationship is often tumultuous, it's best to give both yourself and your ex some time away from each other before you try to patch things up. You both need to be able to get over the initial pain of the breakup and think about what you really want.This doesn't mean you need to completely shun him if you go to school together or have mutual friends, but avoid calling him or hanging out with him for a little while so that you both have the chance to heal and gather your thoughts.
If your ex contacts you a lot, let him know that you're going to give him some time so he doesn't think you don't want anything to do with him. This is especially important if the guy you love is a bit shy or insecure.
He may need some time to realize how much he misses you too!

, When attempting to get an ex-boyfriend back, you need to realize that it may work out, but it may not. Even if you successfully get your ex back, there's no telling that your relationship will end up lasting. Prepare yourself for this beforehand to avoid being blindsided by heartbreak a second time.

, Take this opportunity to really invest in yourself and work on loving yourself. The better your self-esteem, the better prepared you will be to have a healthy, long-lasting relationship.If you suffer from depression or anxiety, see a mental health professional for help. You may be surprised what an impact treatment will have on your self-esteem.
Remind yourself of your strengths and talents every day. Celebrate every accomplishment you make, no matter how small.
If you have a hard time recognizing your own strengths, talk to your friends and loved ones. Ask them to share with you what they think your most positive traits are.
Try to be thankful for all that you have.
Meditation can help you reduce stress and live more soundly in the moment.

, If you have mutual friends or if his friends would be willing to talk to you without telling your ex about it, consider asking them what they think the chances are that your ex would want to get back together with you. They are more likely than you to know if he has a new girlfriend or if he's dying to get back together with you.This is not fool-proof by any means. He might still want to get back together with you even if he hasn't expressed that to his friends.

, When you're ready to start spending time with your ex-boyfriend again, casually ask if he'd like to do something as friends, like having a drink, attending a sporting event, playing a game you both like, seeing a movie, or hanging out at the mall. Act like a friend, not a girlfriend.Don't use this as an opportunity to start begging him to take you back. Instead, try to have a good time with him and make sure he has a great time with you.
Don't talk about your relationship the first time you see him, unless he brings it up first. Otherwise, wait until you've spent time together a few times and have had the chance to make a good impression on him as a friend.

, While spending time with your ex as friends, give him reasons to remember all of the things he loves about you. Accentuate the traits you know he loves, like your sense of humor or your empathy.Always be positive and happy when you're around him. You can drop subtle hints along the way that you're still interested in him. For example, you could say, ""It's great to hang out with you. I really missed spending time with you.""
Even if you don't bring up your past relationship directly, you can remind him of the good times you shared together in subtle ways. If he complimented a particular outfit, wear it again. You could also share a light-hearted memory with him. If you have a chance to meet him, do it in a familiar place where you used to enjoy good times together.

, Take advantage of your time together as friends to show him how you've been working on improving yourself. For example, if it used to drive him crazy that you were always late, make a point of showing up for your outing a few minutes early., Unfortunately, there's no surefire way to know if your ex-boyfriend wants to get back together with you without asking him. When you feel you've had enough time to show him the new and improved you, have an honest conversation with him, letting him know that you still have feelings for him.


Be sure to ask your ex if he still has feelings for you too before you start gushing about wanting to get back together. If he doesn't, there's not much you can do about it.
Don't cry or beg.
Don't let this conversation become an argument about why you broke up. It's important to show him that you've moved past that.
Have the conversation in a quiet place where you won't be interrupted.

, If your ex-boyfriend takes you back, you both need to take steps to make sure that the same problems that caused your last breakup will not interfere with your relationship again. Talk to each other about what kinds of conflicts you have had in the past and how you could deal with them more appropriately going forward.Depending on how serious you and your boyfriend are, you might want to go to couples counseling to improve your relationship skills.

, Now is the time to scrutinize your behaviors that led to the breakup and to try to self-improve. For example, if you feel that you and your ex broke up because you are too jealous or argumentative, try being more conscious of these behaviors and stopping them in their tracks.Depending on what bad habits you are trying to rid yourself of, you might benefit from the help of a mental health professional.
Keep in mind that this does not mean you should change who you are. If your personalities are incompatible, it's probably best to look for a new boyfriend who appreciates you for you. If, however, you have some bad habits that you can address, go ahead and work on them.
You don't need to change for anyone else! Any changes that you make should be made because they ultimately benefit you.

, If you did anything at all to hurt your ex-boyfriend, whether you said something that offended him or you weren't there for him in a time of need, it's time to apologize. It takes great strength to offer a sincere apology, but it will go a long way in helping you repair your relationship.Be specific about what you are sorry for. Instead of saying, ""I'm sorry for hurting you,"" say, ""I'm sorry for not returning your calls."" This will help convince him that you have genuinely put some thought into the things you have to be sorry for.
Tell your ex why you did what you did and let him know what you have learned from the experience.

, If you and your ex broke up because you were unfaithful, you face the daunting task of convincing him that you will not cheat again. The exact way that you confront the issue should depend on why you cheated in the first place, but regardless of the reason, it's important to be open and honest with him.If you cheated because you were unhappy in the relationship or felt that something was missing, be honest about what happened and what you would like to do to make sure it doesn't happen again.
If you cheated because you thought you had genuine feelings for the other person but you really didn't, let your ex-boyfriend know how wrong you were and tell him what you've learned.
If you are a compulsive cheater and are unsure of what motivates you, show your commitment by seeking professional psychiatric counseling.
If you cheated to get revenge or teach your ex-boyfriend a lesson, tell him that you realize how immature that was and that you've learned how important it is to deal with conflicts like an adult.

, If you and your boyfriend broke up because you weren't able to make your long distance relationship work, don't give up hope! Long distance relationships are hard, but it is possible to make them work if you stay strong and give your partner the attention he needs.


Commit to regular conversations, and make sure you are open and honest with your partner at all times. If you can't be physically close to him, it's even more important to work on communication.Fill your partner in on even the most mundane aspects of your daily life, and encourage him to do the same. This will help you feel like you are a part of the other's world.Try your hardest not to let the distance cause you to become insecure about your relationship, as these doubts can cause the relationship to fail., Are you really still in love with him? If so, it might be worth trying to get him back, by showing him you still care and that you believe things will be better this time. Sometimes breaking up provides time for both people to realize that, more than anything, they just want to be together again. However, if you have any other reason for wanting your ex back, reexamine whether it's a good idea to try to rekindle the relationship.


For example, if you want him back because you feel lonely without him, that's not a good enough reason to get back together. The lonely feeling will pass with time.
Or if you want him back because you feel jealous thinking of him with someone else, think again before you decide to try to get back together. Post-breakup jealousy is normal, and this, too, will pass.

, If your ex boyfriend has started dating someone else, consider him off-limits. Don't become that person who won't leave her ex alone after he has moved on. If he's happy with someone else, you could end up hurting him, his new partner, and yourself by trying to interfere.

, It might feel temporarily lonely or even boring to be on your own after the end of a tumultuous relationship, but try to ride that feeling out instead of going back to your ex. On again, off again relationships tend to be based on unhealthy patterns that won't go away. Resist the temptation to jump right back in when you know you're better off without him.

Have a really good, honest, guy friend to consult.,
Casually ask the guy what he thinks of pretty girls and what's so pretty about them.,
Take those tips from that guy, and get one of your GIRL friends to ask him about you.,
If the guy says basically the same things about the pretty girls about you, then you have nothing to worry about.,
If in the last step, you were known as pretty, then skip this step.,
Look at your weight.,
Take in your face.,
Consider wearing more revealing clothes.,
Decide what you want to do with your hair.,
Even though your body is a big factor, so is your personality!,
Hanging out with the right people helps as well.",How to Get Guys," This always comes in handy, because now you have an actual guy to help you know what's so pretty about other girls.;
, Don't make it look like you think that the girl's are ugly, and you feel prettier. Just act curious, as if you're casually asking him who he likes.

, Normally, you'd think that you'd be able to ask him yourself, but if he's a nice guy friend, he will say that you're perfect the way you are, and you shouldn't change. When that friend asks him, tell her to take note of what he says about you that's different to the pretty girls.

, You're prettier than you think, and you will see in the following steps how to make yourself more appealing. If the guy says stuff like, ""She's nice, but not my type"", that means that he's trying to hide the fact that you're unappealing to him.

, In the last step, if you weren't known as pretty, read on. There may be many reasons why that guy friend found you unappealing. You may be fat, you may be ugly, you may have acne, braces may be a factor, maybe it's your hair, you never know! That's why EVERYTHING has to be taken care of, just in case.

, Check online what the average weight is for girls your age/height, and then compare it to your weight. If you are equal to, just above (meaning 2-3lbs more), or below, that means you're okay. If you're far more than it, then you should be hitting the gym, or running around the neighborhood every evening. But take note: there is a difference between fat, and curvy. Let's say your chest and your backside are big, but your stomach and your legs are average, that means that guys will really like you. Guys are usually pervs/horny little things, so the more skin you show, the more guys will come running.

, See if you have any blemishes, black spots, unwanted facial hair, etc. If you have blackheads and/or blemishes, your first step would be to use facial cleansers and makeup. Clean and Clear, Pro-Activ, Neutrogena, etc. are all really good brands of facial cleansers/exfoliators and blemish removers. Really good foundation can be found at Shoppers Drug Mart, Sephora, and other makeup stores. DO NOT GO CHEAP, OR YOU WILL LOOK TRASHY. If you have unwanted facial hair, the worst thing to do is shave it. It grows back longer, thicker and hairier. Go to your nearest beauty salon, and wax or thread it off. Waxing hurts less because it takes out the hair in one go, while threading takes out hairs one by one. Also, shaping your eyebrows would be a good choice as well. Try looking at your body for other unwanted hairs and wax them off.

, There are some that say it makes your body more compelling to the guys. They like a girl with a face and a personality, but a body boosts your image up much higher. If you have that huge chest, or huge backside, work it! Wear tight tops/pants (preferably tights), and your shirts should have a V-shaped neckline. Also, a good sense in style helps.

, Ask opinions on which people think look better, curly or straight or wavy. Try a different hairdo/haircut that may be more appealing. A stylist helps. Guys usually don't like it when your hair is tied up, so try keeping it down. Conditioner helps keep your hair luscious and silky. Herbal Essences are a really good brand of shampoo and conditioner.

, Just because you're all pampered and pretty, doesn't mean you have to be stuck up and snobby! Keep yourself real, guys love a girl who's true to herself.

, If you go to study hall every lunch, or eat in the library, guys will NEVER notice you. Get outside, play some ball with the guys, or just chill with people you don't really know. That way, people will start to know you, and you'll be the buzz.

If nothing else works... do the bend and snap!",How to Get the Boy You Like to Like You Back," If the boy you like is just someone in your class and you don't know anything about him, the best thing to do is get to know him. Try to find out as much as you can! If the boy you like is a friend, then great! but still, you could try to find out more about his family and interests.;
, Talking to him is not one of the easiest things to do, even if you're his friend, but it's a must! If you're in his form/homeroom and you sit next to him or at his same table, then just start by saying ""Hi"". Talk about things as simple as something that happened earlier in class, or the latest dramas school has caused.

,, The friends zone is not a good place to be for too long, because if you're in there for a while, you could be stuck there.

, Emphasis on a little. No guy likes a girl who's too nice, or who's too mean for that matter. Playfully make fun of him once on the date/outing. Pretend to be upset with him for a minute if he apologizes for something stupid, then laugh at him and say you were kidding.

, Make sure you touch him in cute ways, like fixing his hair or feeling the material on his clothes. If he leans back or steps away, then stop. Be sure not touch him in inappropriate ways, this could definitely send the wrong message, and it possibly will get you in deep trouble. Once you get closer and start holding hands, be sure to use a firm grip. Stroke the side of his hand with your thumb.

, If you don't already have his MSN, then get it! A great way to flirt on MSN is by playing 20 Questions! Ask him things like what he thinks you like, or who he thinks is cute. Just don't go too overboard! You should just use questions like that occasionally, or he may feel like he's been put on the spot.

, Guys like girls who are happy.

, Show interest by ""liking"" or commenting on his picture every once in a while If you're feeling particularly strategic, post a picture of you and him and make a few of your friends comment saying you two look good together.

, The most important thing about flirting is to not overdo it, or you may come across as way too desperate. Wink or nudge at him, and make subtle physical contact. Suggestions include as stepping on his feet (nicely, most guys are bigger than girls, anyway), poking him, and squeezing his arm. 75% of the time, guys are too shy to physically flirt because they don't know how you feel about it, so make the move first.

, If you don't wear makeup in school, (or even at all) do not come in one day with your face full of makeup. It will make it look like you're trying too hard. If you want to wear makeup, do it gradually, and don't do it just for him. There are plenty of guys that prefer the natural look, anyway. The hair is very important, also. You can wear it curled, straightened, etc., but it's more important to just keep it clean and tangle-free!

, But only rarely. It will keep him on his toes, and make it more special. Only compliment him if you can think of something specific. Tell him he's really good at reading your emotions, or that you love how his sweater matches his eyes and you can't stop staring.

, If he doesn't want to talk about something, don't pry too much, but tell him you're there for him. When he does talk to you, don't interrupt, and be understanding. It's pretty difficult for guys to open up, you have to make it easy on them.

, There are many ways to get his number - if you know he is not so good in a lesson, give him your number and tell him to text or call you if he needs help. If you know he wants to join a club, ask him for it and say you'll text with the details. You could even ask him out on a movie date, and then ask for his number!

, Don't text him first more than a couple times a week, or you could risk looking desperate. Also, once in a blue moon, when you're texting him and he texts back, don't text back for a few hours to a day then text him back saying sorry and give a flirty or vague reason.

, This is a big one! You don't want to go to school every day smelling like B.O. It's pretty simple: just shower once a day, make sure to soap up really well, put on deodorant, maybe wear a little perfume, keep your teeth clean, etc.

, If he feels he can't keep up with you, he might get too nervous and think that you're out of his league. If you are very socially active, invite him to come along one day with you and some of your friends. This will give him a chance to be around you outside of school and in your natural state.

, Make sure your hanging out with his friends when he is with them. But if you don't like his friends or don't know them well, at least try to make the effort to befriend them.

, When the friend is talking a lot, make eye contact with your crush. This will make you seem interested, but hard to get.

, Timing is everything. Mention how his shoe laces are untied, ask what band is playing, or even comment on the weather (that may sound boring, but it's a good conversation starter that is commonly used, and most people don't mind talking about the weather). Be confident and avoid stuttering and spitting out random words. Just talk to him like one of your friends.

, If you know the girl, chat her up nicely and get her interests. Learning more about her can help you find if she likes him.

, No one wants to be around a downer, or someone who is constantly grouchy. Even if you are not in too happy of a mood, try not to sound sad or annoyed.

, He might think you like them and not himself.

, If you're out in public or something, like a dance, and he seems too shy to ask anybody, just go up to him and ask him for a dance! Never be afraid to ask. He might want to dance and not have people care.

, That makes him feel that you don't want to be around him. If he has a phone, ask him for his number. Asking a guy out on the phone is easier than in person and not as embarrassing if he says no.

, It totally worked for Elle Woods in Legally Blonde.

Ask yourself: What's the worst thing that can happen?,
Find the right place and time to ask him out.,
Have a date in mind.,
Have an exit strategy.,
Use the ""extra ticket"" trick.,
Ask him out on a group date.,
Ask him out to a guy-friendly activity.,
Ask him out to a movie or concert.,
Ask him out through a note.,
Ask him out over the phone.,
Let him know face to face how you really feel.",How to Ask a Guy Out," The worst thing that can happen would be that he will respectfully say ""no"" if he is a decent person. Keep this in mind and then prepare yourself to ask him out. Remember this will help you endure the pain in case this happens.;
, Make the opportunity to ask him in a casual, low-pressure setting. It might be in the hallway, at the water fountain, on a sports field after practice, or wherever else you usually see him. Pick an isolated place, as well as a time when he is likely to be relaxed. Here are some things to keep in mind when you choose the right time and place:


Get a little privacy. You do not have to be completely alone, but you will both probably be more comfortable if you can do the actual asking in a semi-private space. People may not respond honestly when their friends are hanging around and they feel pressured, so some privacy can help you get a real answer.
Do not make a big deal about pouncing on the first available second of alone time. If you're both together in a group, lower your voice to half volume and say, ""Hey, could I talk to you alone for a second?"" and walk a few paces away.
Do not give off creepy vibes. Things like silently standing in front of his locker every morning, calling him then hanging up over and over, or constantly asking other people about him may come off as creepy--and something a stalker may do.
Give your crush some space. Do not follow him around in real life or on-line. A little recon is fine, but following his every move gets into an unhealthy obsession.
Pick a time and place that makes sense. Asking him out after drama rehearsal may be perfect, a 1:30 a.m. text may not be.

, If it's your first time asking this guy out, you'll be a lot more confident if you invite him to a specific activity. It spares you the stress of coming up with something to do while you're on the actual date, and won't leave you saying ""Uhhh... I don't know"" when he asks what the plan is. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Don't think too hard about negative thoughts like 'he will laugh at me', 'he will reject me', 'he will friend-zone me' etc. Remember that guys feel and think the same way when they approach a girl which is the main reason why so many guys exist in the so called 'friend-zone'. The truth is you will find out only after asking, muster up some courage, ask him out. You can do it! You may be surprised to find how they would react as most guys are quite easy to talk to as compared to girls.
Plan a classic date. Or, if you already know this guy pretty well and more alone time is the point, ask him to a traditional night out. Plan on dinner, at a restaurant, or at home with takeout or something you made, and an activity such as seeing a movie, going to a concert or show, visiting a museum, or another interest you two have in common.
Pick something that specifically appeals to the guy. If he loves biking, going to jazz concerts, or eating sushi, ask him to do one of these activities. This will make him feel more at ease and more likely to say yes.

, Though you should focus on the best case scenario (a resounding yes!) instead of the worst, you do need to be aware that there's a teeny-tiny chance that the guy won't say yes. Maybe he likes someone else, or maybe he was startled and only thought of you as a friend -- either way, you'll get through it. But if you want to make the most of the situation and not lose your cool, you should come up with a Plan B in case things don't go as planned.


Come up with a reason to leave in advance. Whether it's saying that you have to study for a test, get to your next class, or that you're late to meet up with a friend, it'll sound better if you've prepared it.
Come up with something else to ask in case you can tell he's not feeling it. If you approach him and he's clearly not in the mood to get asked out, think of something else you can ask him so it doesn't look weird that you came up to him -- ask for the math homework or if he knows when the home baseball team is playing that day.

, Buy two tickets to see a movie, a concert, a stand-up comedian, or anything that you think will interest the guy. Then, when you start talking to the guy, casually mention the event and add, ""Ugh, my friend completely bailed on me..."" if the guy doesn't take the bait and ask to come, just say, ""Is there any chance you'd like to go? I've been dying to see this show, and I think it'll be fun."" Make it sound very casual, like you thought of it on the spot.


This is a perfect low-pressure way to ask a guy out.
However, be careful. If you are too vague on your intentions, your guy might think he is going as a friend, not as a date.

, Going on a group date is another low-pressure way to see some sparks fly. If you and your guy are hanging out with a group of couples, or even just a group of friends, then it'll feel less like a date and more like hanging out. Just tell the guy that you and a bunch of friends are going bowling, to the movies, to dinner, or whatever, and ask if he'd like to come along.


A group date can help him know that you'll be asking him out but neither of you will feel the same pressure you'd feel if you were going at it alone.
If the group date goes well, then hopefully that will lead to a regular date.
Try not to be too vague on your intentions. A group date may be indistinguishable from a group of mixed-gender friends hanging out. Your date may not know he is on a date and leads to awkward situations.

, Pick something that the guy you have in mind and his friends like to do, as long as it sounds fun to you, and ask the guy to join you. This could be hitting the batting cages, going to a baseball game or watching one at your local bar or restaurant, or even going for a hike. Asking him out to do something more man-centric will be more appealing and will sound more fun and casual than asking him to go out to a candle-lit dinner.


Find out what he likes to do first. Although there are activities that typically appeal to men more than women, you might be surprised.
If going to the movies, try to pick a movie that has broad appeal. An action blockbuster movie might be a fun one for you both.
Be sure you enjoy the activity, too. You do not want to end up always going to the local go-cart place because your guy thinks you like go-carts, but really you do not.

, This is a slight variation on the ""extra ticket"" strategy. With this strategy, you should first strike up a casual conversation with the guy. Then, mention a new movie that's playing or a concert that's coming to town, trying to make sure that it appeals to him. Wait for him to say how much he likes this concert or band, and if he really doesn't get the message, then say, ""I've really wanted to see that movie too. Want to go check it out over the weekend?""


If you really want to act casual about it, you can add, ""I can't think of anyone else who wants to go with me"" or ""none of my friends like that band...""

, Put a note in the guy's locker, textbook, bag, or even sneak a note into his guitar case or another item that is important to him. Simply say, ""Want to go out sometime?"" and leave him your phone number. This works great with guys that you don't know very well, and it takes the pressure off. Not only is this an effective method, but it'll make the guy think that you're cute and a little bit creative.


If you really want to be romantic about it, you can even ask him out through a letter, as long as it doesn't freak him out.

, If you really want to ask the guy out but are afraid to do it in person, just call him up and ask if he wants to go out that weekend. You can even call him with a close girlfriend or two standing by for moral support -- as long as they don't shriek or ruin the call, having them there will help you relax and gain confidence. And if he says no, all you have to do is say goodbye and hang up.

,


Don't be nervous -- just make a bit of small talk first and then transition into your question.
When you go up to talk to him make sure your friends are in sight so that they can help you.
Tell him all the reasons why you like him and then tell him you like him because it gives him a confidence boost and your chances of getting rejected are a little slimmer. Then tell him you like him.
Its best if you ask him if he's free on a specific day and tell him your plans and if he likes them there's a chance he'll say yes.
Let him know that if the date doesn't work out you'll still be willing to be his friend and if it does then you can go on a second date. He wants to know you won't be so mad. Say something like ""hey you know you're smart, kind, funny, etc. and you know I like you. Maybe if you're free on Friday night we could go out to dinner and watch a movie. We could go alone or with some friends and if it doesn't work out I won't be mad we could stay friends."" Something like that so that he is willing to say yes or just say everything and change the friends part. Like if he says yes say "" okay well is it alright if some friends come or just you and me"" that way he knows you care about his opinion.
Another way to do it is say "" hey look me and my friend were supposed to go out to dinner and she invited her boyfriend. Maybe you could come with me and be my date because I like you and you're smart, funny, super nice. What do you say? You know if you're free on Friday night?"" And then wait for his answer.

Show him you are friendly and open to talking to him.,
Use non-verbal signals to get his attention, even if he is a crush from afar.,
Don’t talk about yourself too much!,
Be interested in what he says.,
Ask him him follow-up questions about his interests.,
Joke with him, and genuinely laugh.,
Disagree with him.",How to Get the Boy You Like1," It may seem obvious to you that you want to talk to him, but it may not be obvious to him. There are three easy signals you can use to demonstrate that you want to talk to him. Make sure to use these non-verbals in combination with your glittering personality. The eyebrow flash is a non-verbal signal that says that you are friendly and approachable. Tilting your head to one side is another way to show interest while he is talking.
Finally, smile! When you smile at someone they will usually smile back at you. Smiling will make him feel good, because it releases endorphins! ;
, If you are at a club or bar and like a guy, you can send them signals that you are interested in interacting. Look his way and make eye contact with him then flash your eyebrows, tilt your head or smile. This will communicate to him that you would like to talk.


At first he may not be sure that you were making eye contact with him, and you can make eye contact with him one or two more times to communicate that you were looking at him.
If he is giving you signals that he is interested in you, approach him and ask to buy him a drink. And if you are really bold you can ask him to buy you a drink.

, Dominating the conversation is a common mistake that lots of people make when they are nervous. You can volunteer information when, and if, he asks, but first you should get to know him. When you are in conversation, direct your focus onto what he is saying, and don't worry about showing him how cool you are.

, Be engaged in what he is saying and pay attention to the things he is interested in and what he likes to talk about.


Use your body language to show your interest. Nod your head, and be expressive with your facial expressions so that he can see what you are thinking about what he is saying.
Be empathetic to what he is talking about, if he is expressing anything that is difficult show him concern or sympathy.
Remember what he says so that you can be more specific when you ask him how things are going. Showing him that you remember what is going on in his life isn’t creepy, everyone wants to be listened to and acknowledged.

, Most relationships are founded on common interests. If you have intersecting interests, talk up the things you have in common. You both love Montana and snowboarding? Awesome.


Don’t feel like you have to prove that you have the same interests as him or that you have something great in common. You can always start by enjoying hearing about the things he is interested in and talking about your experiences with those things, even if your experience is limited.

, Having a sense of humor is attractive! Find out what kind of sense of humor he has, and start interacting with him playfully. You could even start a playful argument with him. You can feign being mad at him, before laughing it off.


Humor is great tool to use when you are getting to know someone, because it will help you get through any awkwardness you encounter on your dates.

, Even from even the “getting to know” you stage, you should not be afraid to be honest. Be respectful when you disagree, but tell him if you think differently about something he is saying.


People respect people who stick up for their views. Explain why you disagree, or ask him to explain more about why he thinks the way he thinks about a topic.
Sometimes people become more attracted to people who disagree with them. "

Open the lines of communication.,
Pay attention to her body language.,
Talk to her friends.",How to Ask a Girl out After You Rejected Her1," You may not be sure how she feels about you at this point. If she does not respond, or takes a long time, that is a sign that she is not interested. It might help you to be honest when reaching out to her and acknowledge your previous rejection. You might say something like, ""Hey, sorry for telling you no when you asked to hang out. I'm not sure what was going on with me...""If she responds to your messages, she may still be interested. If she does not respond or takes a day or two to respond, she may not be interested.
Also pay attention to how she responds. If she only responds with one word answers and does not try to keep the conversation going, she may not be interested.;
, Try to spend time around her if you can. Her actions can let you know if she is still into you. Things you can look for include fronting, proximity, touching, and lingering eye contact.Fronting refers to the positioning of her body when she speaks with you. If her body is turned towards you, this is a good sign.
Proximity refers to how close she stands to you when you talk. If she is standing within 18 inches of you, she is likely interested. To test this out, take a step closer to her when you are talking. If she stays in the same spot, she is interested. If she takes a step back, she may not be interested.
Touching refers to if and/or how she touches you when you talk to her. Does she touch your arm or shoulder? The more touching, the more interested she is.
Making direct eye contact with you and staring for two or three seconds is also a good sign., Her friends will know if you have a chance. They probably already know what happened between the two of you. Let her friends know that you really like her and you made a mistake. Ask them if they think you have a chance.


You may say, “Hey, do you think Ashley would give me another chance? I really like her and made a mistake last time.”
You could ask her friends, “Hey, I really like Ashley. Can you put in a good word for me?”
If her friends say that she is not interested, ask them why and get some feedback. Ask them what you could do to change her mind.
Her friends will probably tell her that you asked about her. This may help your case.

Be confident in who you are and enjoy yourself in his company.,
Find opportunities to hang out with him and your friends together.,
Embrace your differences.,
Take him to the places you love to go.",How to Get the Boy You Like2," Write down the things that make you awesome to refresh your memory. Knowing why you are awesome and not being afraid to show it attracts others. Do not be afraid to make mistakes around him. Be authentic to the real you, quirks and all. Relax and make mistakes.
Do not act like someone you think that he would like instead of being yourself. Imagine if someone were acting in a certain way to please you, would you like that? Probably not.

, Invite him to a party that your friends are at, and laugh and enjoy your friends in his company. Check in with him, but also give him some space to interact with your friends. Talk to him later about how he enjoyed himself.


Hanging out with your friends around him will show him that friends are important to you and will help him see what you are in like with other people.
Hanging out with others could make him a little jealous (in a good way) and it might make him eager to talk to you again.

, You are a dynamic individual whose interests and personality will mostly likely not match his in all ways, and that is good.


If you can own the ways that you are different, for example, if he loves Family Guy and you think watching television is lame, don’t pretend that you have suddenly decided that television is really cool. Remember, having your own opinions is attractive.
Continue to pursue the hobbies you have that he has no interest in, and don’t change to be more like him.

, When you are in places that you love the best you will most likely come out.


He will be able to experience more about who you are through seeing the places you love. Explain to him why the place is important to you, and give him a tour of what is awesome about the place that you love.

Make sure to pay attention to how he responds. If he doesn’t respond much- don’t keep texting.
If the texting goes on for a sustained about of time, consider asking him to get together and do something.

, It could be something as simple as going for a walk and getting ice cream.


Generally, it is a good idea to do something light for a first date, and end your date before it gets too late. This lets both of you assess how you feel about each other, and helps either person from getting attached before both people are sure they are interested in pursuing the romantic relationship.

, After waiting a few hours to a day text something little and wait to see how he responds and whether he is still interested in you.

, This positive feedback will make him feel good while also not giving yourself away. You can let him know that you are interested in getting to know him more without directly say ""I like you."" These, more subtle, ways of telling him that you are interested will go a long way in making him feel good about your dates while not make you too vulnerable.


He will probably appreciate hearing that you liked spending time with him, even if he is not interested in pursuing something romantic.

, It is natural to get excited about the way you feel about a guy! However, it is also crucial to remember that you are still getting to know him and need to take it easy.


Time will tell if this guy is great for you, but in the meantime be wise, and make sure you don’t set yourself up for unnecessary heart break.

, It is a serious temptation to spend all of your time with the person you like. Resist the temptations and put limits on your hang outs. Think ahead and plan an engagement that you will need to go to after your date, if you have a hard time leaving him.


After spending a lot of concentrated time together, you will think that you know the person much better than you really do. This assumption will not serve your blossoming relationship, and becoming overly familiar with one another can lead to petty fights.
Keep pursuing the things you like to do outside of this relationship. Make dates to meet up with your friends and attend yoga classes, and do not invite him.

, It doesn’t actually have to be on the weekend, but having something to look forward that are a few days away will keep your relationship exciting, as well as help you focus on the things you need to do in your own life.


The plans do not have to be big, but they should be something that both of you want to do. You could plan on seeing that new Pixar movie you have been talking about or going on the hike you have wanted to check out with your friends.
Plan to do things both one on one and with other people. Changing things up will keep things more interesting and fun.

, Life will come up while you are dating. For example, if he is moving, do not hesitate to help him. Show him you aren’t trying to be his girlfriend but that you want to treat him like a friend while you are getting to know each other.


People like other people more if they have done something good for that other person. It can also be something small like asking him to help you understand a concept in a class you are taking together.
Doing real life together can help you build a bond in a way that just going on dates won't allow, so look for opportunities to help each other in real life.

Make sure she is alone.,
Find a good opening line.,
Ask her to a specific activity.,
Be polite if she declines.",How to Ask a Girl out After You Rejected Her2," Go about your attempts in a quiet and modest way. Don't ask when other people are around. This will make it easier on both of you. You do not have to worry about being rejected in front of anyone, and she will not feel any pressure to say yes.


If you are around other people, you may say, “Hey, can I talk to you for a second? I wanted to ask you something.”
You can also send her a text message and tell her that you wanted to meet up with her.

, Do not try to impress her with a joke or some grand gesture. Just be yourself and be straightforward.Maybe you'll be lucky enough that she still wants to date you; however, given that you already rejected her, she might be very skeptical. The best way to do this is address it openly, acknowledging what happened and assuring her you are really interested.


You might say, ""Hey Ashley, you know when I told you no before, I was pretty nervous and didn't know how to respond. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. I'd really like to get to know you better. Are you free this weekend?""
It’s best to ask her out in person, but you can also ask her over the phone or through a text message.

, Inviting her to a specific activity shows that you are really trying to get to know her and will take some of the pressure off of you.Some good activities are skating, concerts, mini golf, or bowling. If possible, choose an activity that you know she will like.


Tailor your conversation based on how she asked you out. You may say, ""You know how you asked me earlier to go to a movie, and that didn't work out? Would you be free to see the ""Transformers"" movie next Tuesday? Because I'd like to take you.""

, No matter what her answer is, be polite and respectful. She may still be hurt by your rejection or moved on to someone else. You want her to leave this conversation thinking that you are a nice person. She is more likely to reconsider if you end on a good note.


If this happens, you can say, “Ok, I understand. If you change your mind, the offer is always on the table.”

Reflect on past events.,
Assess your motives.,
Determine if you are willing to be honest with her.",How to Ask a Girl out After You Rejected Her3," Before you proceed, make sure you have thought about the past. Why did you turn her down in the first place?How did you respond to her? Were you kind or rude? Does she think of you negatively because of how you responded? If you let her down gently, she may be more open to going out with you. If you were on the harsh side, it will be more difficult.


For example, if she asked you out while you were in the presence of your friends, you looked her up and down, laughed and said ""I don't think so,"" your chances of her accepting a date are pretty slim.
Make a list of the reasons that you did not want to go out with her in the past. Have any of these things changed? Have you changed your perspective on the reasons?

, Do you want to go out with her because you truly like her? Do you want to go out with her just to see if she will say yes?To figure out your true motives, make a list of the pros and cons about the situation.


Your pros and cons should include the things that you like about her and the things that you do not like about her.
If the pros are longer than the cons, you may actually like her. If the cons or longer than the pros, you may just be trying to stroke your ego.

, Whether you let her down easy or not, you probably hurt her feelings. She may have difficulty believing that you really want to go out with or her or she may think that you are playing with her emotions. Be honest with her about the reasons that you turned her down and let her know that you are serious this time around.If you were rude, you may say, “I’m sorry for how I handled things the first time. I thought things over and realized I made a mistake. I would love to take you out.”
Maybe you were uncomfortable with her doing the asking. You may say, “I’m not used to girls asking me out, and it caught me off guard. Please give me another chance and let me take you out.”

Consider how you feel about dating.,

Understand he won't want to be with you all the time.,
Invite him around to your house.,
Kiss him.,
Don't seem too desperate.,
Don't stay with this boy if he doesn't treat you well.",How to Ask a Boy out in Middle School," There is no magic number or time at which a person is ready for dating. It's dependent on who you are, how mature you feel and what your parents think about it too. Indeed, it's a combination of factors. At this point, don't feel bad if you don't actually feel like dating yet––that's okay to, you can have friends instead of dates too and nobody will think any the worse of you for it.


Take a little time to better understand your own motivations for having a boyfriend or going out. How big a factor is each of the following for you: wanting friendship/companionship and someone to hang out with; wanting to have someone else interested in your well-being and listen to your worries and joys; wanting affection (hugs, touch and nonphysical affection, romance, etc.); wanting to be accepted and cool and not seen as a loner by schoolmates? Which of these are your main motivators? The better you understand your own needs and motives, the better your decisions and choices will be about whether to ask a boy out, and if so, who to ask, and how to do it.
Taking the time to introspect and understand yourself better is a lifelong process important for adults as well as for middle school students.;
, If they don't think that dating boys is appropriate right now, they mean it and they have good reasons. Listen to them and just find friends instead. There's plenty of time for love later.


If you're parents are cautious but open to the possibility, explain how responsible you'd be if you went on a date, such as meeting curfew times, letting them know where you are going and being reachable by phone at all times.

, Ask them what they think about dating and how comfortable they feel about it. While you don't need to agree with what they say or think, it can be helpful to gauge their feelings and get ideas to form your own thoughts.

, Once you're happy that you're ready to date, try getting to know this boy better.

, He might not turn out to be the kind of person you first thought. It makes good, common sense to get to know him a little before asking him out. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways you can use to get to know this great person somewhat better.

, Make it a group thing. Get your friends and his friends to mingle at recess, lunch and after school. Make it all seem most casual, and just hang about chatting to everyone, including him.


Make friends with him and his friends. It will make him feel closer to you without realizing just yet what your real intentions are. This gives you the space to study him close up and kindly.

, Have casual conversations with him about school, sport, your uniforms, school rules, anything really that is simple, relevant and easy to chat about.


Find out what interests him and let him know just a little about what interests you.
Here are some conversation starters: ""Want some gum?"" ""Hey, do you have any gum?"" ""Okay, no more projects on cells. Mine looked like it came out of a horror movie!"" or ""Random Question: are you a morning or night person?"". If you are in different years/grades, ask him what he thinks you'd like next year.
Don't chew his head off with ""me, me, me"" talk though. Instead, make the aim to learn as much as you can about him. He'll ask you enough things in time.

, Give him little gifts now and then, such as chocolates. But be sure to give them to his and your friends at the same time. You're trying to prove you're a generous lassie, not someone focused only on him––that comes shortly. For now, show him what a great spirit of generosity you are.

, Send a friend request and bond online. Send casual messages, jokes, funny pictures and nice sayings. Keep it light and friendly and include your other friends initially so that he looks like he's just one among many recipients of your online banter. As time goes on, you may grow to feel comfortable just chatting or messaging him.

, He doesn't want to know what you're doing every five seconds and he certainly doesn't want to have answer to you about what he's doing every five seconds. Instead, just get to know his schedule, work around it with the occasional ""hello"", ""how's it going"" and ""wow, isn't funny how we keep bumping into each other?"" moments.


If you're online, take the chance to now and then send something with a ""when I saw this, it made me think of you, 'coz I know you like the LOL cat/etc. pictures"".

, Do you want him to be your boyfriend? Before you ask him out, be sure he's the one. Before you decide that you're in love, know what your own feelings are. Make a list of the negatives and positives about him, and then decide.

, At least have inkling that this guy has grown fond of you and is somewhat into you. Signs include him breaking the touch barrier, lingering gazes, fond nicknames, making excuses to be near you, texting or messaging you a lot, blowing you kisses and generally being sweet to you. In some cases, he might be a little more brash and teasing toward you, because he feels comfortable around you. If you've gotten the impression that he's keen, it might be time. Ask him when you feel right and comfortable!

, If so, flirt a little, make eye contact more often and pass a few sweet notes to him in class. Make it clear that you're keen on him.

, He's yours for the taking if you've noted the signs correctly and feel you know him well enough by now.


Rehearse asking. If it helps you to gain confidence, practice beforehand. First, write down what you want to say. Then, practice in the mirror. Look at your body language and facial expressions. Practice until you feel confident.

, This is especially important at the middle school and junior school levels. This isn't about determining your love match for life; it's about gaining a fun and carefree romantic friendship and the main thing is that you both feel comfortable with one another.


Say something like, ""Want to go for a slurpee over lunch break?"". This is perfect. Make sure his lunches are free first.
Or, casually ask ""So do you have band/yearbook/practice, etc. today? Mind if I come too"".
Or, ""Hey, would you like to come with me to the movies/park/skate rink, etc. this weekend?""
If asking him out over text message, say something like: ""My friends think we should get married. Spring wedding sound good?"" Expect a ""lol"" as a response. Then after he responds, say something like, ""Yeah, but I really do like you."" Do try to use full words as often as possible; text messages can look really stupid if you use text language (u for you, r for are).

, Realize that he may need time to process your request to get together, hang out or go on a date, and that's fine. Let him know it's fine and that he can get back to you.


If he says no, that's all right. He's probably embarrassed, or he hasn't made up his mind. Be understanding, and don't become defensive or act hurt. Never stall or make excuses. But at least he knows you like him and he might start looking at you in a different way.
If he says yes, say ""great"" and start planning your date, make sure you pay, unless he insists. Some guys love it when the girl pays, it makes them feel loved, others feel guilty and feel like their being given sympathy.

, Bite your head off? No he will either say yes, no or I'll think about it (if the later, don't let him leave you hanging indefinitely; move on). Only ask if you really like him! Don't do it if you're just making it up! If he gives you something, try to give him something back the next day.

, He may be with his friends more often than when he is with you. This is normal, and part of a healthy relationship!

, If he sees that you care and want to see him more often, he may become more committed to the relationship. (Try to have a few activities in mind to do together, like playing video games, baking brownies, watching a favorite show or movie, shooting hoops at the nearest basketball goal, etc.)

, Depending on the sort of guy he is, if he comes around to your house, find a comfy spot and lean in. Boys love kissing! However, if you aren't comfortable, don't force yourself.

, You want to keep in touch with him, but not 24/7! He might think you're a nag, or that you don't trust him. Text him once or twice a day, if he responds, YAY! But you can't expect him to. Also, if you see him in the hallway just say hi. If he stops you to talk, stay there and have a short conversation or tell him you'll talk to him at lunch.

, If he is mean, cruel, or disinterested, just move on. He may be cute or cool, but it's just not worth being mistreated to try to pursue him. Pick someone new to like. Always remember that boys don't control your happiness.

Ask him out in person.,
Be clear that this is a date, not a “hang-out.” Sometimes, it can be hard to tell if a boy likes you as a friend or as a potential girlfriend.,
Set up a group date with friends.Your parents may not even allow you to go on a one-on-one date with a boy, but even if they do, group dates are better!,
Set a clear time and place.",How to Ask a Boy Out," Even if you've known him since kindergarten, it's never too late to make a good impression. The more put-together you look, the more likely he is to notice you and want to get to know you better.


Wake up early to comb and style your hair before school. A few extra minutes in the morning can make a big difference.
Choose your outfit the night before, so you're not scrambling to make a decision while you're sleepy and rushed.
Depending on your parents' and school's rules, you may not be able to wear makeup. A lightly colored lip gloss is a good start, though!
Nicely perfumed lotions are a good way to both keep your skin healthy and draw a boy's attention. Keep a little tube in your backpack so you can reapply it throughout the day.;
, Let yourself get caught looking at him, and do your best not to look away immediately. Eye contact can be very intimate, and will show that you're interested in talking to him.


When you're talking to him, eye contact shows that you're paying attention. Everyone likes it when they feel like you're focusing on them.
Be sure not to hold eye contact for too long, though, as that might get awkward. Strike a good balance.

, Studies have shown that flirting skills are more important than good looks when it comes to getting a boy to like you.One of the most basic flirting techniques is to be free with your smiles when it comes to the boy you like.


Whenever you make eye contact, give him an inviting smile to show that you're friendly, approachable, and interested in talking to him.
Studies also suggest that the physical act of smiling actually tricks your mind into a better mood!The happier you are, the more people (including boys) will want to be around you.

, Have them ask around to see if he likes anybody. Hopefully, he already has a crush on you, but if not, at least you know where you stand.


If he has a crush on a different girl, don't lose hope! Try to imagine what he might see in her, and try to bring more of those traits out in yourself.

, Through observation, you'll be able to bring up his likes and avoid his dislikes without having to draw them out of him in conversation. Some things you might look for include:


His favorite sports teams: does he wear hats or t-shirts for a specific team? Get to know that team so you can talk to him about it.
His favorite bands: t-shirts, stickers, and other merchandise will let you know what kind of music he's into. You might also see if you can overhear what he's listening to through his headphones.
His hobbies: does he bring a skateboard to school with him? Do you see him carrying a tennis bag to practice after school?

, Before you ask him out, pave the way for a relationship with smaller interactions. Small gestures not only prove that you're friendly and social, but they'll also build up to longer conversations once you get comfortable with each other. If you ask him to go out with you without laying this foundation, he might say no. Don’t rush it! Let these small moments grow into conversations. Some examples of low-pressure conversations might include:


""Do you have any gum on you?"" or ""Do you want any gum?""""Can I borrow a pencil?""
""I forgot my textbook. Can I look on with you?""
""I didn't understand what the teacher was talking about at all. Did you get it? Can you explain it to me?""

, As you get more comfortable and start having longer conversations, make sure to note his interests. Does he talk about his favorite books all the time, or he is more of a reality TV junkie? Does he love football, or is he more of an extreme sports guy?


Do some homework. You may not have much to say about his interests at first, if you don't share them, but you can always learn about them!
Learning about his interests will make your conversations more enjoyable for him. It also shows that you care enough to learn more about his passions.

, You don't want a potential relationship to be all about him, so don't let his interests take over your life. Tell him about the things you're passionate about, even if he's not knowledgeable about them. If you're willing to learn about his hobbies, he should do the same for you. If a boy expects you to take an interest in his passions, but doesn't ever want to talk about yours, maybe he's not the boy for you. You can tell a lot about a person's character by seeing how supportive they are of your passions.


“I’m working on a new routine in my dance class that’s really hard to get right. I got really frustrated yesterday, but I enjoy the challenge.”
“The debate team is traveling out of state to compete in a regional tournament this weekend. I’m really nervous!”
“Have you read this book? She’s my favorite author. I think you’d probably like her books, because…”
“Have you listened to this album yet? I know you don’t usually listen to this style of music, but some of these songs are amazing!”

, Girls aren’t the only ones who like compliments! While you don’t want to make him uncomfortable by fawning all over him, a few compliments here and there will send a clear message that you like him.


“Your hair looks great today!”
“I love that shirt! Where’d you get it?”
“Wow, you got an A on that test? I studied so hard, and only got a B minus! Great job!”
“I was at the game this weekend. It’s too bad the team lost, but you were amazing! I cheered so hard when you scored that goal in the second half!”

, Many people, especially younger ones, find it much easier to be charming and natural online than in person. When you’re texting or chatting online, he can’t see you get nervous. It also gives you time to Google whatever he’s talking about, so you can seem more knowledgeable about the subject.


More importantly, you move the relationship out of its original space (school, church, etc.) into your free time. That’s a big step! It’ll make him more likely to say “yes” when you ask him out.

, If he doesn’t get along with them, you may find yourself having to choose between your friends and a boy. Before asking a boy out, make sure that he's a good fit with your social group to avoid painful situations down the road.

, When you’re working up the nerve to ask him out, you’re probably going to be very nervous. That’s perfectly natural, but you don’t want him to see how anxious you are!


Take deep breaths to slow down your heart rate and clear your mind right before you ask him.Clench and relax the muscles in your face to release tension in your muscles.Repeat positive phrases to yourself. Visualize your best-case-scenario: “He’s going to say yes. He’s going to say yes. He’s going to say yes.”, Asking a boy out can be nerve-racking, so psych yourself up for the big moment ahead of time. Take deep, calming breaths to slow down your heart rate. Throw back your shoulders, lift your chin, and speak in a clear, confident voice when you ask him out.


If you look like a nervous wreck when you ask him out, he might think the date will be just as awkward.
By acting confident and natural, you let him know that the date will be comfortable and fun.

, Make sure your body is sending comforting, relaxing messages so he looks forward to going on a date with you. You don't want him to worry about it being awkward!


Relax your shoulders and straighten your back.
Lean in toward him when you're speaking.
Don't cross your arms over your chest. Crossed arms suggest you're closed off, and you want to be open in this moment.

Find a subtle way to compliment him. Let him know he's cute or that he looks nice without being too obvious about it.
Be enticing. Show a little cleavage or wear something that shows off your best assets. Remember, be modest (guys like integrity), but showing off a little is a great way to get a guy to notice you. You can still keep it classy while getting the guy's attention.

Tease him. Playfully make fun of one of his interests or a unique piece of clothing he's wearing.
Remember to keep it light. Flirting is all about subtlety.

, If you want him to know you're interested in going out on a date, then you have to show that you're interested in him as a person. You don't have to arrange a sit-down interview to show that you care about who he is and what he likes to do. Here's what to do:


Ask a few questions about his interests. This is non-invasive and guys like talking about what they love.
Virtually all guys like music. Ask him what is his favorite type of music. Then ask him what his favorite song is. He will love that you are taking an interest in him instead of yourself.
Show that his opinion matters. Ask him what he thought of a new controversial movie or a political issue that's been buzzing in the media. Just don't pick something so controversial that you could end up in an argument.

, If you share some interests, you have even more of a reason to go out on a date. Once you get to know the guy and know that you have a few things in common, you can use them as a reason to take your friendship to the next level.


Music is a great common interest. If you have the same favorite band, you can talk about the band and maybe mention that they'll be playing in town soon, and see if he asks you to go with him. Play up your interests so he has more of a reason to ask you out.
See if you have the same favorite sports team. If you're really into the same baseball team, talk about the team and casually ask if he's been to a game recently.
Use food as a talking point. If you both happen to mention that you love Greek food, you can ask if he's been to the new Greek place in town.

, Your friends can also help you get him to ask you out without coming on too strong. If your friend makes a comment at the right time, it could influence him to ask you to go on a date. Here's how your friends can help you hook your crush:


One of your friends can subtly tease him and ask when he's going to get up the courage to ask you out. Just make sure it doesn't seem like you told your friend to do this.
If you're always around the guy, have a friend say, ""Aw, there goes my favorite couple again."" This will be awkward, but it'll let him know that people see you two together.
Have a friend casually bring you up in conversation, to see how he reacts. If he reacts positively, the friend can say that you two should get to know each other better.

, If you find a way to casually talk about your plans, whether it's a plan to go to a fun concert or party or just to grab coffee in between classes, this will be an easy way for him to join in. If you mention something that sounds appealing to him, it will lead to a low-pressure hangout session that could turn into a date.


If you're going to a fun party that weekend, mention it. He may want to join in, especially if you have mutual friends who are going.
If you happen to run into him, you can tell him you're going for a walk or grabbing a snack, he may want to join in.
If you're walking back from class or an activity together, find a subtle way to say that you're hungry or in need of a caffeine fix, and he may ask you to grab a quick bite or to get a coffee.
Mention if you're doing something fun in a few weeks. If you have big plans to check out a new bar, movie, or concert, he may want to join you when the time comes.

, Letting the guy know what your schedule looks like is different from talking about your plans. If you tell him what your schedule looks like, then he'll be more likely to ask you out if your schedules align or if he knows you have some free time. Try not to sound too busy, or he'll think that you don't have time for a date. On the other hand, don't sound so free that you look desperate.


If you have some classes together, let him know when you have breaks in your schedule. If he knows you have a few hours to kill in between classes, he may ask you to get lunch.
If you're passing by your favorite bar, you can casually say, ""I love that place. I always go there for happy hour on Wednesdays."" This is a subtle way of telling him that he should come along.
If you have a free weekend ahead, let him know. Say, ""My last three weekends have been so busy -- I'm really looking forward to doing something fun and low key this weekend.""
If you have a favorite coffee shop, tell him that's where you go to get work done a few evenings a week. Lure him in by saying it has the best coffee in town or recommend one of its specialties.

, You need to make sure that the guy doesn't have you firmly planted in the friend zone and that he doesn't think he's in your ""friend zone"" either. There are a few things that you can do to draw the distinction between ""just friends"" and ""more than friends"".


If he tries to treat you like another one of the guys, don't let him. Make it clear that you're not just there to be his buddy. If he invites you out with a group of guys, look nice, like you're dressing for a date.
Look at how he asks you for advice. If he's always asking you what he should do about one girl or another, then he may just view you as a friend. Try to change the subject and show him that you're girlfriend material.

, There's a difference between dropping hints that you'd like him to ask you out and being very obvious about how much you want to go on a date. If you're too obvious, you won't leave anything to the imagination, and you won't seem as desirable.


Avoid lavishing him with attention. He will be overwhelmed and it's better to play it cool.
Avoid constantly asking him to hang out. If he's not responding, he may not be feeling it.
Avoid talking about how free your weekends are or how flexible your schedule is. Instead, talk about all the fun plans you have ahead. He should feel like he should try to squeeze into your busy schedule if he wants to see you, not like you're waiting around for something fun to do.

, If you really want the guy to ask you out and feel like you've been dropping hints and letting him know you want to go out forever, then there are two things you can do.


Move on. If you've made it clear that you want him to ask you out and he just won't budge, maybe he's just not that into you and you should find someone more worthy of your affection.

Ask him out. If he's just really shy but you have the sense he wants to get to know you better, just be bold and ask him out. If you're nervous about it, ask him to hang out with you in a big group first.

They probably won't sweep you off your feet and have super-romantic moments with you. If this is what you're expecting, wait a couple years., Don't over-think things and spend hours rehearsing each conversation. If you do this, it will be obvious that you had a list of conversation topics and wouldn't let the conversation naturally flow from one thing to another. Act like you're talking to a friend. You never know what the other person is going to do or say, so don't be surprised by anything. You may think you know what they'll say (if you ask them out, for example) but they could say something completely different. When talking to guys, it's best just to wing it., If you get along with a guy and you can hang out and be friends, don't try to rush to the hand-holding and the kissing. There's time for that much later. Just be content as friends for now., Show of your talents, but just not too much, because that guy can get tire of seeing the same things about everyday. Guys like girls with some talent. If you're a good soccer player, play soccer with your friends at lunchtime. This way, when he walks by, he'll see that you're a soccer star. If you're brave, invite him to play with you. If you're great at creative writing or math, ask him if he needs help with his homework one day. This will not only impress him with your skills, but it will give you two some time together, and he'll be thankful that you're helping him out. Basically, if you can act, dance, sing, play a sport, play an instrument, paint, sculpt, etc., guys will be more drawn to you than if you're boring and have no talent at all., We hate to admit it, but the world is pretty shallow nowadays, so looking nice will give you a better advantage when it comes to getting this guy to like you. This doesn't mean that you have to wear makeup and revealing clothes. Looking nice just means brushing your hair, having good personal hygiene, and smelling good. Don't go overboard; you're not a celebrity about to hit the red carpet!, If you think he likes you, and he hasn't given you a definite 'no', don't give up. Guys are dense. Sometimes they don't get the ""subtle hints"" and flirting that you do, especially in the beginning. Don't get discouraged just because he's not responding the way you think he should. Maybe he just doesn't realize what you want. Maybe he wants that too, but he is afraid you don't! At this point in life they aren't always sure what to do. Try to get them alone and talk so that you won't unintentionally embarrasses him., If you get a clear message like ""Stop calling me"", or ""No, I don't like you,"" then stop trying. You'll look like a total clingy, desperate stalker. Stalkers are not cool, and if you do cling on to him, this may ruin the chance of a relationship between you two in the future. If you respect his wishes, he may thank you for it later by asking you out when he's ready. But if you continue to hound and harass him, you'll only end up making him not like you at all., This is one of the most important things you must carry around when you're with a guy. Always look confident, even if you're alone at lunchtime. Always smile and look like you're having fun and enjoying your life, because being a happy, energetic person will attract a guy more than if you're depressing. Always look up when you're walking, look people in the eye, speak loudly and clearly, and smile to top it all off! Just be careful you aren't too over-confident and come off as conceited and stuck-up."

Consider why you fancy this guy.,
Talk to a trusted friend.,
Dig deep into your own heart.,
Get this guy's friends to like you first.,
Notice his reactions to your friendship with some of his friends over time.,
Try to talk to him when you feel that the ice has started to truly thaw.,
Walk past him, and start a little chat with him.,
Set him straight when you feel the time is right.,
Begin to slowly get closer to him.,
Flirt.,
Wait for him to ask you on a date.,
Date him a few times to work out whether this is the right thing for both of you.,
Enjoy dating your now-friend-former-enemy.",How to Get a Guy to Like You when He's Your Enemy," Is he really your dream guy, the one you'd do anything to get a date with? Be wary of this being about proving something, such as showing this guy that you're irresistible to anyone, no matter who. If you suspect you are only feeling this way to prove a point, back off now. On the other hand, if your feelings are genuine, and you've noticed things about this guy that are calling to you to notice him with affection rather than being mean-spirited toward him, proceed with caution.;
, Find out what he or she thinks of your sudden revelation about this guy. It is useful to get perspective from someone whose opinion you trust and consider worthy. This person may make it clearer for you, either way. Make sure to always talk to a ""trusted"" friend. You don't want word to get around about your crush or even worse end your friendship for that reason!

, What are you truly feeling? If your heart says that this is worth pursuing, then be prepared for rejection but hope for the best. Realize that this probably isn't going to be easy. If you've been strong enemies for some time, it will take a lot of time, effort and strength on your behalf to make him see you any differently. Accept that it may not work but if you're willing to give it a try, then do so with your eyes wide open.

, Just as a friend though! A guy is much less likely to hit on a girl his friends don't approve of, so this aspect is important. A group of guys is like a wolf pack, they work together and understand each other. The best way to get on his friends' side is by complimenting (not flirting with) and respecting them. Do not go for his best friend first, ever. This is too forward and too close. Try outer ring friends first, and work your way in. Realize that this may take some planning, and when it comes time to make friends, you get one shot, so make it count.

, There are two ways this could go, and you have no control over it so don't get caught in it:


Path 1: He hates you so much that he is mad at his friends for hanging out with you that he leaves them, they all get really mad at you, and that's the end of it.
Path 2: He finally gives in, but doesn't look at you as a friend or enemy. Now he secretly watches you. This is your big chance! Now for the next few weeks, be yourself and be friends with those friends you're now closer to but don't hassle him. Make yourself look good, such as dressing nicely, putting on jewelry, possibly make-up etc. This is usually what gets a guy's attention. Just don't overdo it.

, By this stage, it helps to be friends with most of his friends by now (again, not flirting with anyone but him).


Don't bother him when he's with his friends. Since he's your ""enemy"" he'll just act mean to you, and might humiliate you.

, You can try to bring up something from television or something that happened at school. Get his interest, and try to make him have fun. Offer compliments and aim to become a friend.


Approach him casually. Try not to do anything stupid around him! Also, try and start a conversation about schoolwork or something else that you think is suitable.

, Tell him how you feel about the enmity and want it to end. Also, let him know you are sad he still has bad feelings toward you. Next, tell him you would like to make up with him by making a deal or a truce.

, Flirt just a little, not much yet, and only near him; this must not be directed at anyone else. Stay near him more (if he lets you).

, Usually, a teenage guy doesn't stay mad like girls do, but if he is, try to flirt. Don't try too hard, or else he may spread rumors about you and take advantage of you. A flirty argument will do, but don't overdo it, as it's too easy to turn this into a joke.

, Don't ask him.

, If it is, fireworks!

, Well done!

Flirt a little.",How to Get a Guy to Fall Head over Heels for You1," If you want to get a guy to notice you, you'll want to look and feel your best. Make sure that you look and feel healthy. If you do, you'll feel more confident, and confidence is attractive.Consider your diet, exercise habits, sleep schedule, and stress levels. If something is off with your physical health, work on getting well before you try to get a guy to notice you., Research has shown that men may view women as more attractive if they possess admirable personality traits.Do your best to show him your positive traits when you are around him. Show him that you are kind, honest, thoughtful, funny, and positive.

, When you want a guy to notice you, you may be tempted to wear your sexiest outfits, but don’t. It is important to dress in a casual way when you are first getting to know him. Otherwise, he might feel like you are trying to get his attention and feel pressured.Stick to jeans, t-shirts, and sneakers when you are first getting to know him. Wear clothes that flatter you and show your personality, but nothing that is skin tight or too revealing.
If you wear makeup, keep it simple. A little foundation, mascara, and lip gloss is fine.
If you feel comfortable doing so, you can dress in a way that shows off a little bit of your assets, without coming across as over-the-top. You can accomplish this by wearing a top that is a bit short and shows off some of your back when you bend over, wearing shorts now and then, or by wearing a top that shows a bit of cleavage. Most importantly, wear what makes you feel comfortable.

, Try not to let on that you are interested in anything more than friendship when you are first getting to know a guy. Treat him like a friend and don’t flirt too much when you are first getting to know him. If you come on too strong in the beginning, he may feel pressured and avoid being around you., Showing that you are interested in knowing things about him will grab his attention more than only telling him all about yourself. Make sure that your questions are not too personal to start. You can ask him about his hobbies, his family, and his interests. Steer clear of topics that might produce a negative response, such as politics, religion, or former girlfriends., As you work on getting him to notice you, make sure that you do a little flirting along the way. Just make sure that you are not too obvious. Try to keep him wondering if you are into him or just being friendly. For example, you might casually touch him on the arm now and then to get his attention or giggle when he cracks a joke.Some other flirtatious moves you might try include:



Gazing into his eyes. A lingering gaze can let him know you are interested and it may also increase his affection for you. Try gazing into your guy’s eyes for a few minutes and then slowly turn your gaze elsewhere. Or, if a long gaze does not seem appropriate yet, try checking in with your guy with frequent, quick glances.Directing your body towards him. Making sure that your body is facing him and even mirroring the position of his body can send positive signals his way.Make sure that you are facing him when he is talking to you and try adopting the same pose as he does.

Smiling at him. Smiling will let him know you are interested, but to all else it might just seem like you are being friendly.Try to keep your smile as natural and relaxed as possible. Don’t force it or smile in a way that is unusual for you.

,
Get to know his friends.",How to Get a Guy in Your Teenage Years," A few girls say, ""Oh, we're never going meet any boys."" That's such a lie. Look around. There are boys everywhere! All you have to do is take some time, and get to know them. You never know, that weird guy from your math class could be the boy from your dreams! Talk to them, and find out if they're worth spending time on, and if you actually have something in common. If you don't - find someone else! Just don't be one of those people who jump from person to person and leaves the other person hanging in the dark. Be nice, say, ""Well, I'll see you around"". Just to be safe, wait till the conversation is over.;
, Find out his interests and hobbies. You will become better friends as time goes on. Don't be too random, though. He'll think it's weird if you randomly ask if he likes carrots. Also, it is best not to ask a yes or no question. For example, instead of asking if they like dogs, ask them what sort of pets/animals they like.

, If his friends don't like you, he probably won't like you either. Unless his friends are jealous, that is. Make sure that you don't ask his friend if they are jealous though.

, We all know that most guys like girls who are feminine, have curves in the right places, and stuff like that. But what else do the guys want? Here are a few 'requests':


Nice looks.
Confidence.
A girl who is happy.
Intelligence.
A sense of humor.
Patience.
Generosity.
Sophistication.
Attitude (not the sassy kind)
A great smile

, Do you have really pretty eyes? Well, then start wearing eyeliner, or just make them really stand out. Do you have really great hair? Well, try straightening it, curling it, putting it up in a new style, or adding some accessories to it such as headbands! The point is, that if you focus on the things you like about yourself, boys will notice these things too.

, Don't try 'accidentally' tripping in front of him like in the pic, its not romantic its just stupid and it would make you look like a klutz. Instead, find a reason to talk to him. If he's in one of your classes ask him what the homework was like you forgot. If he's the friendly type, just catch him alone and introduce yourself. Just wing it; it's cool. Just avoid seeming too desperate or clingy because guys really hate that. Just be confident, and smile.

, Try telling one of his friends that looked nice today (or a similar compliment). Chances are that they will tell him. Of course, don't be so pushy that it's creepy. Make sure that it doesn't seem that you're telling everyone that you think he looks nice or whatever besides him. Also try complimenting him directly. Another technique is to talk to your friends when you are nearby him and say, ""Don't you think that looked awesome today?""

, Just make sure that you do it casually. Give a nice, small smile that just says, ""Hey, it's nice to see you"" and then sort of smile at the ground and act chill. Guys like it when you are chill.

, If he's looking at you for a really long time, that would most likely mean that he likes you. Also, if he's leaning towards you, that might also mean that he's into you.

, Start by asking him if he could go over to your house and help you study.

, Don't act all weird around him or too flirty., If it's too risky, don't do it. If a guy really likes you, he won't make you dye your hair or get a piercing. Only do this if you are comfortably with picking up on this trait. Don't change yourself for him; it's not worth it.

, If you know he's a big fan of video games and you've never heard of Zelda, don't fake it. He'll eventually find out and you'll look pretty stupid. However, it is a good idea to learn about some of the things that he likes and take up some of his interests as long as taking up one of his hobbies doesn't eliminate all time for your personal interests.

,, If his friends make a good impression of you, they might tell the person you like that you are a good person, but if they don't, don't sweat it. Also, try to make small talk.

Keep yourself busy.,
Engage his nurturing instincts.,
Increase your love of yourself.,
Show him a good time whenever you are around.,
Let him see what makes you special.,
Get all dressed up.",How to Get a Guy to Fall Head over Heels for You2," By going on dates with other guys, you will be demonstrating that you are desirable and that you have a full life of your own, and that he is not your only option. The sense that he may have to compete with other men for your affection should pique his interest and encourage him to pursue you., You don’t want to be available to hang out any time that he asks, so keep yourself busy. Make sure that you have a few nights each week where you make plans with your friends, family, or do things alone. This will show him that you have an active social life and that he will have to keep trying if he wants to be a part of it., Most men have a desire to protect and/or help, so use that to your benefit. You can do something as simple as asking him to help you fix something or ask him to accompany you on an evening jog. Find some way to make him feel like he is helping or protecting you and he may begin to offer to do so more often., It is important to show him that you have lots of different sides to your personality. This will help him understand that you're an interesting, complex person with a lot to offer. You can accomplish this by taking the time to remind yourself why you're wonderful and working on your self confidence.Make a list of your favorite personal qualities. What do you love about yourself? Perhaps you are very proud of your high grades and strong work ethic. Maybe you love how creative you are. Celebrate these strengths.
Think about the diversity of your interests and how you can get better at each one.

, He may be more interested in pursuing your affections if you make him feel happy whenever you are around. Try to maintain an upbeat, positive attitude when you spend time with him. Cheer him up if he’s in a bad mood and find little ways to brighten his day., Another way to get him to pursue you is to show him what is unique about you. What makes you special? Do you have a special talent that might intrigue him? Think about what makes you special and try to find an opportunity to show him.For example, if you are a good cook, invite him and some friends over for a dinner party. Or, if you are an avid runner, ask him to run a 5K with you sometime.

, It is important to give your guy a glimpse of you at your most exciting. After you have gotten to know him pretty well and have established a friendship or dating relationship, give him a glimpse of your sexy side.For example, you can wear a really striking outfit that complements your personality, get your hair and nails done if you like, and wear some sultry makeup if that's what you're into. Just make sure that you have an occasion that will explain your dolled up look.

Make him feel at home when he is with you.,
Touch him gently.,
Disagree with him now and then.,
Let him do nice things for you.,
Be mindful of telling him how you feel.,
Know when to move on.",How to Get a Guy to Fall Head over Heels for You3," Even though you may feel like spending every waking moment with a guy, you need to give him space. Spending time apart is healthy and having some time away from him will give him a chance to think about how great you are and miss you. So if your guy is busy when you ask him to do something, try to think about it as a good thing and be cool about it., Doing things to help make your guy comfortable is another way that you can increase his affection for you. Little things can help you accomplish this, such as keeping your fridge stocked with his favorite munchies or falling asleep with your head resting on his shoulder., A gentle touch may also increase a man’s feelings of affection for you. Try softly placing your hand in his when he reaches out to hold it. Softly stroke his hair when you are lounging around together. Or, give him a delicate kiss at the end of a date.You might also try wearing soft textured clothes, such as silk or microfiber. That way you will always feel soft when he touches you.

, It is great if you have lots of things in common and shared opinions, but there will eventually be something that you disagree on. When he says or does something that you disagree with, let him know. Sticking up for your opinion will show him that you think critically about things and you are not a doormat. This is a good quality and he will probably be impressed.For example, if your guy makes a claim that you disagree with, say something like, “You are entitled to your opinion, but I see the matter a bit differently.” Then explain why you hold the opinion that you do. Be respectful and try not to get too defensive. Just be straightforward and honest about what you think.

, Doing nice things for someone may seem like it will win you their affection, but the opposite is true. The person who does the nice things is the one who feels more affection. So let your guy do nice things for you.For example, you can allow your guy to open doors for you, accept gifts and favors from him, and ask him for favors now and then. Just be sure not to take advantage of your guy’s kindness. It is still okay for you to do nice things for him now and then too.

, Gauge if the time is right and if your feelings are authentic before sharing. You don't necessarily have to wait for him to tell you first, but be sure if you are the one to share how you feel first, that you are making a careful independent choice /.

, If you have been trying your hardest to get a guy to pursue you and he does not seem interested, move on to someone who will appreciate you. It may be that your guy is just not ready for that kind of relationship or that he is not as taken with you as you are with him.

Stay away from toxic relationships.",How to Get a Good Boyfriend1," Think about the things you value most and that you want in a healthy relationship. What are the things you will not compromise on? What are things that are less important to you?For example, if you want to have kids, you will want to find a partner who also wants kids. If you practice religion, you will likely want to find someone who will participate with you.;
, When you head into a new relationship, take time to analyze yourself. Know where you’re coming from, and understand where you’re heading. This is especially important in terms of how you conduct yourself in relationships. If you know yourself to be a jealous person or you are insecure in relationships, then strive to understand why you feel this way. What lessons have you learned from previous relationships that you can apply to the new relationship?, In order to find a partner who is a good fit, you need to be yourself. It is not productive or healthy to constantly pretend to be someone you’re not. As the relationship progresses, this will become more tiring and dishonest. Be yourself with your potential boyfriend. If he likes you the way you are, then the relationship might just succeed., Toxic relationships are those that impact you negatively. This might be someone who is manipulative, physically or verbally abusive, controlling, jealous, chronically angry, or isolating. These types of unhealthy relationships will not allow you to flourish or be happy, and they will erode your self-respect.A good boyfriend should not make you afraid, tense, or stressed. Rather, this person should help alleviate these feelings.

If your eyes are beautiful then wear a little eyeliner, mascara, and eyeshadow. If a strong lip suits you, add a pop of lipstick!






If you are on the pudgy side than wear baby doll shirts (shirts that fit snugly around the breasts but then flow out around the stomach).






Heels are definitely going to get his attention! Make sure you can walk in them though.

Ask your friends if they know anyone.,
Look for a potential boyfriend at places you like.,
Be open to encounters.,
Try online dating.",How to Get a Good Boyfriend2," Many relationships happen between friends of friends. Plus, you have the added benefit of your friend knowing you well and being able to assess the compatibility between you and someone else. Ask your friends if they know anyone who might be a good match for you.


If you think it’s appropriate, ask a few co-workers if they have single friends who are looking for a relationship.

, Do activities that you like to do and go to places you like. This will raise your chances of finding someone with similar interests. Starting with common interests can make for a strong relationship., You never know where you’ll meet someone great, so be open and friendly with people.

, There are a lot of dating websites, such as Match.com, E-Harmony and others, which have good track records for bringing people together. There is less stigma around meeting potential partners online now than in previous years, so take advantage of this option to expand your circle of potential partners.

Take care of yourself.,
Engage in positive body language.,
Talk to each other as friends.,
Don’t rush to judgment.",How to Get a Good Boyfriend3," Show that you feel this relationship is important to you by taking care of your appearance and dressing up for a date. You don’t have to wear something that makes you uncomfortable, but show that you have put in some effort for a first date. If you project confidence in your appearance, your date will likely view you this way too.

, Nonverbal communication can convey just as much as verbal communication. When you’re on a first date, positive body language will signal your interest to your date. Try these steps for conveying positive body language:


For example, maintain eye contact with your date. This demonstrates your interest in his company, and his interest in yours.
Smiling will convey that you feel easygoing, open and relaxed.
Don’t stand too far away. If you’re attracted to the other person, move a little closer in physical proximity., A cornerstone of a long-lasting relationship is friendship. When you get to know each other as friends, you will form a good foundation for a solid relationship. Even when you are first meeting, such as on your first date, talk with each other as friends, sharing interesting stories about yourselves.If your potential boyfriend shows interest in you by asking you questions and giving you time to share, this is a good sign.

, Your date is probably just as nervous as you and may make a few mistakes. Unless they’re deal-breakers, like he made really racist comments all through dinner, think about giving him a second chance.


If you aren’t sure if there is physical chemistry immediately, you might find that it will develop. Consider meeting again to see how things go."

Think back to your first impression of him.,
See how he interacts with his friends.,
See how he interacts with other women.,
See how he interacts with strangers.,
See what your family and friends think of him.",How to Get a Good Boyfriend4," First impressions will often mark the success of a relationship, even if we’re not deliberately thinking of first impressions in this way. When we meet someone new, especially a potential partner, we are evaluating whether this initial interaction is positive or negative. If it is positive, we will likely seek more information about the person. If it is negative, we may find that the relationship will be too much effort.


Similarly, we may be subconsciously looking for similarities between ourselves and this potential partner. We are more likely to pursue a relationship with people who are similar than those who are dissimilar., A guy’s interactions with friends may show you what he’s like when he’s very comfortable. If you’re just getting to know this guy, he might not yet be 100% comfortable with you yet. His friends, on the other hand, may have known him for years, and he may act more relaxed around them. Get a sense of what your potential boyfriend is like with others.


Pay attention to how he treats you in front of his friends. If he is rude or indifferent to you, this is a problem. You are, after all, one of his friends too, and you deserve just as much respect as the others., Your potential boyfriend should treat all people with respect, and if he is respectful to other women, that’s a good sign.


Observe how he interacts with other women when he’s with you. Is he overly flirtatious, or does he only have eyes for you? Does he comment about how attractive other women are? There’s a fine line between innocent behavior and behavior that signals potential cheating. If you’re bothered by his behavior, talk with him calmly about it., How a person conducts himself in public is a good indicator of how he will conduct himself with you. Is he rude to wait staff? Is he helpful when someone is looking for their dog? These interactions will help you understand the kind of person he is.

, When your boyfriend meets your family and friends, they will form certain opinions of him. These can often be valuable because you’ll see how others view him. If you trust your family’s opinions, ask them what they think of your boyfriend. Do they see the positive things you see?

Make sure he treats you with respect.,
See how well he communicates with you.,
Find out his own life goals.",How to Get a Good Boyfriend5," A good boyfriend will give you the respect you deserve. He is considerate of your feelings, he listens to you, he is supportive, and he trusts you.He should also have respect for himself. Having self-respect means that he thinks that he is worthy of your attention, he can accomplish things, and he is comfortable with himself.

, A strong relationship relies on good communication. Your boyfriend should be honest with you, and should be able to talk calmly about problems without yelling or insulting you., Good communication also requires listening. A good boyfriend will pay attention to what you’re saying and take it to heart.

, A good boyfriend has goals of his own, such as certain career goals that he’d like to achieve. His path to achieving these goals will demonstrate how motivated he is. He will be proactive about pursuing these goals, rather than whining about how he can’t do something."

Cultivate some common interests.,
Do each other’s favorite activities.,
Make sure he turns off his phone.,
Get affectionate with each other.",How to Get a Good Boyfriend6," A good relationship will flourish when you have common interests and do things together. You might go snowboarding together or join a language class. Your relationship will last longer when you commit to doing active and interesting things together., Although you and your boyfriend have common interests, you also have your own interests. In a successful relationship, both partners will make an effort to do each other’s favorite activities from time to time.

, A good boyfriend will pay attention to you, not his phone. It’s okay to check messages once in a while, but if he is constantly checking sports scores or social media updates from friends, his attention is wandering away from you. A gentle reminder to put away his phone may be warranted, but if you have to constantly remind him, there might be a larger conversation about why he is choosing to ignore you.


Make sure you also turn off your phone. He needs to feel like you’re paying attention to him too.

, A good boyfriend will be affectionate with you by being physically close and cuddling. Your physical chemistry is important for long-term happiness, so good sex is definitely important. But it’s also important to be affectionate with hand-holding or snuggling while watching a movie.

Spend time on your own.",How to Get a Good Boyfriend7," Don’t ditch your friends in your quest to find a boyfriend. It’s important to have multiple types of friendships in your life. Go out with your friends or spend a night in watching a movie or cooking together.

, Keep developing yourself as a person. Grow your interests, both personally and professionally. If you want to try a new hobby or sport, go for it. If you want to get a new certification to help you at work, do it. It’s important to bring forth your own goals and pursue them.

, Give yourself time to spend by yourself. This will give you an opportunity to understand yourself better, to develop your own voice, to relax, and to think deeply.Take yourself on a reading date. Bring a good book to a café, order some coffee and a croissant, and treat yourself to an hour of uninterrupted reading."

Work out what you're comfortable with.,
Make him notice you.,
Initiate contact with him.,
Use the internet to your advantage.,
Have fun.,
Ask someone out.,
Look on the bright side.",How to Get a Boyfriend if You're Very Shy1," If you're not willing to approach the boy you like, then you need to get close to him in some other way. Are you able to talk to him if you're in a big group of friends, or are you more comfortable being alone with him?


Decide what type of interactions you flourish in. Try out both techniques, and then you should have a better idea of what works for you.;
, Be a bit sneaky, and try to make it so you end up standing next to him in a line, or sitting next to him in class/at work. Use little opportunities to be around him until you get the chance to make a conversation. If you know you’re going to be close to someone you like the day before, plan on wearing something eye catching like a red dress, or a new hair style.


Eye contact is your friend! Once eye contact is initiated, there is an opportunity open for communication. Eye contact can be more powerful than words.

, Smile or say hello when you walk past each other. This will make things more friendly between you without seeming too forward. Try making eye contact every now and again. This doesn't mean you should start staring at him, but just give him a little glance., If you really can't talk to his face, then you may find it easier to add him on Facebook, MSN, Myspace etc, and start up a conversation that way. Just start up a chat asking how he is, what's he been up too, or what you've been doing etc. If you get to know him that way, it won't seem as strange when you try to talk to him in real life.

, When he's around just relax, tell a few funny stories, laugh along with what other people are saying. Don't complain or moan about anything, it'll only make you seem moody, unless that is the way you are. Show off your personality in the way that suits you.


If there is something weird you think about yourself, don’t hide it. Some guy might find you cool for being weird. Attraction works in mysterious ways.

, If you’ve made small eye contact and feel a connection, invite the guy out for a cup of coffee. Don’t feel obliged to wait for him to make the first move. He might be more shy then you are and might find it great that you took the initiative.Try saying something like this:


”Hey Carl, there’s a show at Cafe Apocalypse this Saturday. You wanna go with me?”
”John, would you be into getting a cup of coffee with me?”
”Lamar, I noticed you draw toilets in class, you should check out some of my doodles.”

, What's the worst thing that could happen? So what if you go up to him, freak out and forget what you were going to say? So what if he says no? It doesn't matter because at the end of the day it happens to everyone, even the prettiest, most confident girls. Don't let it get you down or make you even more shy because practice makes perfect, give flirting a try, at first it might feel awkward, but eventually it'll come naturally.

Stick to one guy at a time.",How to Get a Guy at Work to Like You," Eye contact is fundamental to flirting and attraction. The eyes truly are the windows to the soul, so let him see yours. If you can’t look him in the eye, he’ll probably assume that you’re not interested in getting to know him. Though some eye contact is good, don’t hold his gaze for too long. There’s a fine line between looking and staring.
Generally, women show they’re attracted to a guy by lifting their eyebrows, making eye contact, tilting their heads down and to one side, and then looking away. This body language is almost universal.;
, This is possibly the easiest way to let a guy know you like him. When you smile at a guy, you appear open and friendly. That lets him know you’re approachable, and someone he can be himself with.

The best smile is a genuine smile. People can read when a smile is fake, so just be natural!
If you've got great teeth or cute dimples, smiling helps show them off.

, This isn’t always appropriate in the workplace, so be careful with this step. Some types of touch are commonplace in any environment, but some would feel uncomfortable in a workplace. There are three levels of flirtatious touch.Friendly touch can be a handshake, or tapping someone on the shoulder. This kind of touch happens in almost all working environments.
Plausible deniability touch refers to touch that is more personal, and can raise questions about a person’s intentions. This includes putting a hand or arm around someone’s shoulder or giving them a hug. This kind of touch could seem out of place in the kitchen of a fast paced restaurant. However, in an office setting, it could come across as a caring gesture after a difficult meeting.
Touching someone’s face is considered “going nuclear” in terms of touch. There are few work situations in which you’d likely touch a coworker’s face. However, if he has an eyelash on his cheek, that could be a perfect opportunity to gently and flirtatiously remove it for him., Everyone likes a little flattery now an then. Point out something you like or appreciate about him. It’s best not to only focus on his appearance, though. Think of things he did that you thought were cool, or an accomplishment he’s proud of. Let him know you're always happy to see him. His personality makes the long days much more fun.
Compliment something he did well. Maybe he gave a great presentation, or finished a job with great attention to detail. This will show you've been noticing him.

, Studies have shown that women are the most successful at flirting when they’re direct. If you’re not getting any response from your crush, it may be that he simply isn’t getting the message, and you need to be more obvious. Being direct has its limits. If you feel you’re sending all the right cues and not getting anything back, he may be trying to politely let you know he’s not interested.
If you fear this may be the case, just continue to be your usual charming self, and see if he is inspired to make a move himself.
You can be direct without being demanding. Say, ""I'd love to get together sometime,"" instead of, ""Will you get a drink with me?""

, Flirting via phone or social media can be either more discreet or more public, depending on how you do it. If you send a flirty text here or there, chances are no one else will find out. But nosy coworkers will notice if you’ve liked every one of his Facebook pictures.Always be extra careful when flirting digitally. For example, did you click “reply” or “reply all”?
Avoid anything that’s inappropriate for the workplace. It’s perfectly innocent to suggest in an e-mail that you go out for cocktails after the long day your department has had. Sending suggestive pictures is harder to justify.

, There’s no one way to look great. Every woman has a different style, and every man has different tastes. Looking your best isn’t just about what he’ll think, it’s about wearing something that makes you feel confident. When you feel good about yourself, you automatically look more attractive to people.If you have to wear business attire to work, choose outfits that you feel great in. Wear that skirt suit that you know shows off your best features.
If your job requires that you wear a uniform, make sure it fits you well and is clean. And pay extra attention to the aspects of your appearance that you can personalize-- like your hair, nails, makeup, and jewelry.
If your work clothes are necessarily dirty (if, for instance, you work in a garage or in landscaping) you can still choose clothing and hairstyles that make you feel confident and good about yourself.

, People who take good care of themselves seem attractive, because it shows that they take pride in their appearance. And you definitely want to avoid the embarrassment of finally going out for drinks with your crush, but not wanting to make a move because you didn’t bother to shower that day.

, Rest helps us to look and feel our best. If you don’t get enough rest, you’ll be groggy and not on your A-game when it comes to flirting., Smell is the sense that is most closely tied to our memories. It’s also linked to attraction. If your crush begins to associate you with a pleasant scent, you’ll have that extra biological mechanism on your side., This is sometimes called playing ""hard to get."" What it really means is that you show him that you’ve got a lot going on and aren’t dependent on a man to make you feel fulfilled.


Causally let him know about your exciting weekend plans. He’ll get the idea that you know how to have fun and have an interesting life. You could say, ""Have you ever been kayaking before? I'm going this weekend and wondering what I should pack.""
Be comfortable eating lunch by yourself or with one or two friends. This shows that you value time alone and with people you care about. You’re not just trying to surround yourself with people.

, If he only sees you at work, he may not know about the other sides of your personality. Make it clear that you’re not strictly business-- in or out of the workplace.


Do something fun or silly at work. Maybe organize workplace Secret Santas for the holidays, or bring in a goofy wall calendar for the break room.
Invite coworkers (not just him) to do something fun outside the workplace. Maybe signing up to run a local 5K race or have a picnic on the weekend. This will give him a glimpse into your interests outside the workplace.

, This shows that you know how to have a great time, and can provide him with excitement. It’s easy to invite someone out for a drink or dinner, but the most memorable people are the ones who invite us to do something we’ve never done before.If you invite him and he declines, don’t get discouraged. You can simply say, ""Well, if you'd ever like to go in the future, let me know. I'd really enjoy that."" This keeps the door open and puts the ball in his court.
Make it something you’re genuinely excited about. If you’re terribly afraid of heights, you might not want to invite him to go ziplining, just because it sounds cool. But perhaps there’s an interesting hike you could go on together.

, If you’re having lunch or hanging out right after work, you won’t be able to completely change your clothes. But you can make small, flirty changes. If you’re getting together on a day off, be sure to let your personal style shine, since you don’t have to dress for work.If you’re going straight from work, you might want to let your hair down after having it up all day.
If you’re taking your lunch together, you could leave the jacket of your skirt suit at the office to show a less formal side of yourself.
It’s also okay to change your clothes between work and happy hour. If your clothes are dirty after a day of work, it makes sense that you’d want to change before going out.

, If you’ve talked during the day, you can remind him of your connection by sending a short text or e-mail. Try to keep the conversation not focused on work, but instead on something you connected over.If he mentioned a band or movie he’s interested in, maybe send a text that says, ""Hey! I downloaded that album you mentioned. Thanks for the awesome recommendation.""
Keep it brief. Even if he likes you, he may not want to be reminded of his workplace once he’s done for the day. Don’t expect long text or e-mail conversations after a long day of work.

, If he’s friends with some of your coworkers, this one can be easy. Make efforts to be friendly with the people you know he hang out with. You don’t need to let them know your intentions, of course. But if his friends like you, they’re likely to support a budding romance between you, and people tend to value their friends’ opinions when it comes to relationships., No one wants to feel like they’re being sexually harassed at work. You can send plenty of signals that you’re interested without crossing his boundaries.


Give him space. Let him decide if he wants to have lunch near you, rather than always rushing to eat near him. If he works in another department, don’t spend too much time there or he might feel that you’re being intrusive.

, Some workplaces actually prohibit employees from becoming romantically involved. Others have strict policies about the kind of communication that is allowable while on the clock. Don’t do anything to jeopardize either of your jobs. If it has to wait until after work, let it. , This can be the hardest part, but it’s almost bound to happen. No matter how subtle you both are, people are sure to notice what’s going on. Workplace gossip helps relieve the boredom of routine, so expect questions and rumors.


Gossip can sometimes work in your favor. If your crush wasn’t sure of your intentions, hearing a rumor might help him get the full picture.
Decide whether you want to dismiss rumors or be honest about your feelings for your crush. Remember that even things you tell someone in confidence will likely make their way around the office eventually. , It’s very common for people to see workplace flirting as a way to get ahead in the company. First, you need to be honest with yourself that this is not what’s going on. Then let anyone who asks know that you would never engage in flirting simply to advance your career. , With online dating apps, you can easily flirt with (and date) multiple guys at once, and no one has to know. At work, things are quite different. Even if your crush doesn’t realize that you’ve also been flirting with the guy in the mailroom, someone else will. And you can be sure it’ll get back to him."

If you take a hard look and decide that you want to go through with it, continue through to the next steps. If you're having any trouble in really figuring out whether you're ready, try imagining your life with a boyfriend added. It's important to think about how much time a good relationship takes to build. If you're already busy as it is, it's best you don't try to look for it too hard.;
, In the seventh grade, a good fashion sense isn't necessary, but dressing nicely is a good way to get all sorts of positive attention. Dress casually to match whatever setting you'll be in.

, No one should be looking for someone to love if they don't already love themselves! This is as true for girls as it is for boys. If you have issues with self-image and loving yourself, it's really important you take some time to work on those things before inviting someone new into your life. There are lots of wonderful things about you. Part of getting a boyfriend mean acknowledging those things in yourself. Do you suffer from low confidence? Try making up a list of ten things you love about yourself.
Smile in the mirror. Even if it feels odd at first, you'll soon get used to it and it'll help you develop a stronger sense of positive body image.
If you have some close friends, ask some of them what their favourite things are about you. Keep their responses in mind the next time you're feeling down!

, No matter how much you want a boyfriend, it's never a good idea to settle for someone you don't think is great. This includes making sure your potential boyfriend is mature enough to handle a real relationship. Keep your chin up, and don't let yourself get into anything that doesn't feel just right.

, When you're at the seventh grade, your biggest source to meet people will be school. You'll be in classes with a lot of the same people all year round. This gives you plenty of opportunities to make great friendships along the way. Can you think of any boys in your class you might be interested in? If not, are there boy in other classes you've had your eye on for a while? If you're starting a new year of school, you should find out if you're in any classes with a boy you might like.

, Even if you don't go to school, you can see find plenty of way of meeting people. Try checking out some extracurricular activities regardless. Is there a chess club at your school, or maybe an atmospheric black metal appreciation society at your local library? Meeting people in these clubs can be especially good because you already know you have some shared common interests with them. What's more, the fact that it's not technically on school time means everyone will be more relaxed. , It's possible you already have a strong network of friends you can fall back upon when the going gets tough. Likewise, if you're looking for someone special they may be able to help. If you feel like it, you can ask your friends if they know anyone they might introduce you to. It's important you go about that in a positive, confident manner. If you sound timid, it may come off as desperation, which you definitely don't want to show around your friends.

, Events are a perfect, fun way of meeting new people. Whether it's a sporting event or a music concert recital, everyone is at the event because they want to be there. The specific reasons for the event give lots of opportunity for conversation starters. Keep your eye out for someone doing something interesting. If you overhear a neat conversation, chime in and add your fourteen cents.


For instance, if it's a sports game you're at, you could approach someone and ask: ""What team are you rooting for today?"" If you're feeling particularly bold, you might even start the conversation by letting him know what your favourite team is.

, Finding someone interesting can be luck of the draw, but with enough time and putting yourself out there in the world, it will eventually happen. Introducing yourself to someone can be a pretty nerve-wracking experience, although it's nowhere near as bad as some people might fear it to be.


If you're nervous or don't know how to approach someone in a proper way, look around yourself for inspirations. If you're at an event, there are lots of things you could bring up. Ask their thoughts on the event. If you're at school, ask them about their favourite class or their least favourite teacher.
Going up and simply saying ""Hi!"" works too. It's very rare someone won't be flattered by someone giving them attention.

, Once you've properly introduce yourself, it's time to learn more about him. If you're talking to him, ask him questions about his life. What are his favourite bands, books or movies? If he has an online profile, check out what he's written for it. , You don't need to necessarily ask a boy to hang out to spend time with them. At first, it's best if your time together is casual. If you're there at the same place at the same time without calling it 'hanging out', there's less pressure for the two of you. This includes sitting next to each other during class or during lunch, or going to the same event together. The more time you spend together, the more likely feelings will spark.

, In this day and age, one of the best ways to get to know someone is over the internet. Most people have Facebook now, and it's a great way to talk to someone about a lot of different things, even if one of you doesn't have the time available to hang out in person.


Check out their online posts. If there's something that engages you in some way, you should reply with your opinions. Don't be afraid to be opinionated! Boys really like someone who knows how to speak her mind.

, At a certain point, it'll become appropriate to start spending time together one-on-one. For some people, asking to hang out with someone they like might feel nerve-wracking and intense. If you've developed the bond already, it shouldn't be much of a risk. Just ask that you would like to see him sometime. Chances are he'll say yes. If he says he's too busy, don't sweat it. You can always schedule for later on down the road.


Go spend time together somewhere the two of you have never been before. This will give the two of you a chance to see each other in a new light, far removed from the context of school.
Going to the beach or your favourite restaurant are great ideas for a first date.

, Once you've started hanging out, it's a good idea to make it a regular thing. The more times you spend together, the more likely it'll be that you'll develop feelings. While the first time you get together may even feel awkward, you'll feel much more at ease with the boy the more you see him.


Take it slow. At first, it should feel incredibly casual to be spending time together. It doesn't need to get emotionally intense anytime soon. Just enjoy spending time with the person you're with.

, You should never be afraid to demonstrate your talents to the guy you like. It's a big lie that guys aren't attracted to smarts. Showing you have well-developed and passionate interests will make you appear like an even greater catch. , Chances are, if you fee really attracted to his boy, you're already displaying that attraction in subtle, but significant ways. Try to decide if you're doing some or any of the following. If not, you might imply be feeling too nervous:


Making lots of eye contact. This is especially important if you're naturally shy. Eye contact is a great way to show interest in someone, romantically or otherwise. On the other hand, averting your gaze may get the impression across that you're attracted as well, particularly if you're on the shy side.
Twirling your hair is a playful way of showing interest.
Smiling a lot and holding his gaze will let him know you're interested in what he has to say.

, At a certain time, it'll become apparent that the two of you have feelings for one another. Even if you both know it, asking someone out officially can be tough! It's best to find a perfect moment where you won't be interrupted by anything.


For example, once you've gotten somewhere private, you could take his hands in yours and say: ""You know, I've been really enjoying the time we've spent together. I think there could be something special between us. Maybe we could get closer, if you were interested too?""
Going in for a quick kiss can say just as much as an official declaration.
It's well possible that he might ask you out before you even get the chance! If that happens, stay calm and accept his offer graciously. The last thing you want to do is panic and suddenly reject him without thinking!

, Things will feel intense in the relationship at first. This is especially true if it's your first real relationship. Nonetheless, you should take it as slow as you can at first. You don't want to rush into saying ""I love you"" until you know it for a fact. Rushing through the stages of a relationship can lead to problems later on if you don't build a solid foundation first.

, One of the things most people do when they're getting into a relationship is to put on their best face. It's not until the relationship is a few weeks or months in that people start to let their bad habits in. The best thing you can do is to be honest from the start, but keep working hard for as long as you're in the relationship.

, In the seventh grade, your boyfriend may not be as mature as you would like. It's still important to be as honest a you can in the relationship.

, At some point, you'll probably have to meet his family. When you meet them, look them in the eye and greet them politely. It shouldn't be taken personally if his parents are apprehensive about your boyfriend bringing a girl over-- it's possible this is the first time they've ever dealt with something like this.

, Even in the best relationships, arguments will happen. What decides whether an argument will be bad or constructive depends on how it's approached. Shouting matches have never helped anyone, especially when you're in the seventh grade!

, Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes, and its very common for relationships early in life to fall apart, and often quite quickly at that. Soon enough, you'll have moved onto someone new and even better than the last!

Smile.",How to Get a Boyfriend if You Feel Unattractive," Your body image is the way you look at and judge your appearance. When you have a positive body image, you generally have an accurate and comfortable image of yourself that leaves you feeling good about the person you are. This does not mean that you're always positive about your physical self, or that there aren't things, like your weight or complexion, that can't be improved through healthy choices. A positive self-image, instead, empowers you through your own goodness and worth as a human being. You are important, and you do have a significant affect on the lives of your friends and family.



Negative body image can be identified by:1) An unrealistic view of your body shape. There's nothing wrong with being curvy or petite, but there is something wrong with thinking your natural shape isn't good enough.2) Feelings of failure that come from your perceived shape or size. Even if you can improve your diet or exercise more regularly, your body's characteristics are not a reflection of your worth. Worth comes from within.3) Feelings of shame, embarrassment, or strong anxiety about your body. Being a little shy is normal. Having an anxiety attack or some other physical anxiety response is likely a sign of negative body image.4) Feelings of discomfort in your own skin. Being too self-conscious can lead you to over-thinking even simple motions, making these seem unnatural to you.;
, There may be something obvious that has made it difficult for you to love your body, like a birthmark or a scar, or there may be several smaller features that you just can't appreciate in yourself, like your nose or the shape of your ears. In some cases the problem isn't physical, but can be the result of emotional abuse, like someone telling you you're overweight even if you're healthy. It can be difficult confronting these demons, but only through acceptance can you move forward, learn to love yourself, and accept the love of others.


Try to find a feature you dislike in yourself in someone you admire in your personal life. A good place to look for this is your family life. By recognizing a feature you dislike in yourself in a favorite family member, like your aunt, your mother, and so on, you can begin opposing your negative thoughts by telling yourself, ""I think mom looks beautiful, and people compare me to her all the time. I'm a lot more beautiful than I realize.""
Coach yourself to accept whatever physical shortcomings you believe you have as part of being human. Replace your criticisms with kind and reassuring words of encouragement. You aren't responsible for that mole on your cheek, but you are for your feelings and how you treat yourself. You're not a loser, a freak, or hideous. You're unique. That makes you special., The people you see everyday in ads and on TV aren't an accurate representation of real people.More importantly, how someone else looks should have no influence on how you feel about yourself. Looks fade, and ""perfection,"" in many cases, can appear waxen and fake. Idealizing an unrealistic standard could be the source of an image problem. Combat these feelings by reminding yourself regularly that many of the women in media represent a very small percentage of the population -- it's unrealistic to try and be like them!


Whenever you find yourself comparing your features to those in the media, oppose those thoughts! Tell yourself, ""I am beautiful, and these women don't represent a healthy standard that everyone can achieve."" This will reinforce a healthier way of thinking, which can help you with depression and anxiety, both of which can hurt your attractiveness.You could spend thousands of dollars, if not more, on image-related products and treatments. But even with the most radical makeovers, if you're unhappy with who you are on the inside, no change to your appearance will change how you feel., Confidence has long been identified as a key component in dating and attractiveness, and well managed stress will make you appear more attractive.To build your confidence and sustain healthy relationship, you should try to:



Dress yourself lovingly in your favorite styles. Some styles suit some individuals more than others; take some time to explore different styles to find what works best for you!
Put your best face forward in your daily life by looking your best. By accentuating your best features and nourishing your body with healthy alternatives, like a balanced diet, you'll start looking, and feeling, better.

Work to support, and allow yourself to be supported by your friends. Imbalanced relationships can lead to resentment, and this can create what is referred to as a ""toxic relationship."" These kinds of relationship can lower your self esteem and emotionally exhaust you, which can make you feel, and look, less attractive., Although your self-worth shouldn't come from a change in your appearance, by taking steps to improve your health you'll feel a greater sense of connection to your body, a sense of personal accomplishment, a boost to your mood, better skin quality, and a more positive outlook.Though you might want to transform overnight, trying to completely change your diet or the amount of physical activity you do overnight rarely has an effect that lasts. Instead:


Identify unhealthy areas and wean yourself from those areas little by little. High sugar foods and beverages that have little nutritional content, like soft drinks and candy, can be removed from your diet and have a drastic positive impact on your physical health.Consult your doctor or a nutritionist for more ideas about how you can improve your diet.

Hydrate and replenish your skin. Dry or poorly cared for skin can give you an appearance that is tired, making you look less than your best. But there are many techniques you can use to make your skin bright and healthy


Get plenty of sleep. Sleep deprivation can lead to many negative health effects, like poor performance/alertness, poor quality of life, high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, and others.Improve your overall health and appearance by improving your beauty sleep.
Ease into a workout routine. No one ever hopped off a couch to run a marathon without at least a little training first! If one of your specific goals is to be able to run a mile without stopping - walk before you run. For two weeks you might walk a half mile every other day. The following two weeks you might walk/run that distance, stopping whenever necessary. In this way, slowly work your way into an exercise routine., You're certainly not going to find Mr. Right sitting on the couch night after night watching Netflix! Try getting involved in social activities that in some way involve your personal interests or hobbies. This way you'll actually enjoy going out, and you can expect the people you meet at these events to hold similar interests as you. Shared interests are an important part of most strong relationships.Use online resources, like meetup.com or citysocializer.com, to find people in your area with similar interests who want to socialize. These kinds of sites provide a public venue where you can meet guys you otherwise might not have.
Check your city's local event calendar at your community center, or do a general online search for ""local social events near me."" This should give you a general idea of festivals, art exhibitions, and other local events you might enjoy.
You might also look into local clubs, classes offered at your local community college or community center, or sports league. Some clubs, classes, or sports you might find rewarding in your search for the right guy include book clubs, board game groups, choirs, political functions, creative writing classes, art classes, cooking classes, improv classes, beach volleyball, kickball, dodgeball, and more!

, By stepping outside of the familiar, trying something new, and meeting new people, you will give yourself an opportunity to achieve your personal best. When you step a little outside of your comfort zone, you experience a kind of positive anxiety that improves your productivity, helps you deal with change, and encourages you to push your boundaries.And each of these qualities could very well impress and win over potential boyfriends.Try a new approach to an everyday situation. This could be a simple as trying out a new route to your job. The key here is putting yourself in a situation where your perspective is different from the usual.
Make small changes and build your way up to trying things that are significantly new and different. Pushing yourself too hard can create too much anxiety, which can lead to you feeling paralyzed or overwhelmed. Start small and work your way up to bigger changes., Feeling like you are unattractive can lead you to accepting a relationship with someone who doesn't appreciate you for who you are.Being in a relationship is not more important than your emotional and mental health. You are worthy of a boyfriend who respects and loves you for who you are. Don't settle for any less.


If a male friend you're interested in developing a relationship with pressures you to do things he wants to do without regarding your feelings, makes you feel sad or scared about the state of our relationship, or asks you to invest the majority of your time and energy on him, your relationship might be more harmful than healthy.These may be indications that you should not pursue a relationship with him.

, This can be difficult, especially when you have butterflies in your stomach due to nerves! But eye contact is a universal sign that is used to indicate your interest in him, so try not to look away when you and him lock eyes.Eye contact can also make you seem more attractive and likable to him. Looking deeply into his eyes will raise your chances of winning him over.
You might trick him into eye prolonged eye contact with a simple ploy. For example, you could touch his arm and ask him to look at you. Gaze deeply into his eyes. After a few moments, ask him if he wears contact lenses, even if you know he does not. This way, the eye contact is less awkward., Dilated pupils are a subconscious indicator that you are interested in him, and vice versa. Choose a dimly lit location to meet potential guys you are interested in dating, like a coffee shop, planetarium, or movie theatre.Even if you've invited him over for something as innocent as studying for a test, watching a movie as friends, or some similar activity, dim your lights or use the gentle lighting of a lamp instead of bright overhead lights.

, When you touch him, his brain naturally releases a chemical called Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the love hormone. Beyond that, Oxytocin is important for social bonding and building trust.Aim for innocent touches on his arm or shoulder in the beginning, but as you grow closer, allow your touches to linger.


If you're not comfortable with overt touches while you're getting to know him better, you could always sit next to him instead of on the other side of a table. This way your arms and thighs touch, causing Oxytocin to be released and, perhaps, romance to blossom., When you smile at him, you are sending him a signal that you find the time you spend with him enjoyable. This stimulates the reward response in his brain, which could make him want to please you even more!You could practice your comedic skills on him so you both can smile and laugh together. He might want to spend more time around you if he finds you funny, and this could develop into a relationship.
A natural way you both can enjoy a laugh is by suggesting going to a comedy club. If you're not yet sure if you want to pursue him romantically, you could go with several friends, but you might want to sit next to him and engage him whenever you can.

You can try to get into a relationship with a guy you already know if they are decent, or you can go out and meet some new guys. Make sure he's got a great personality, smart and things that you would like to look in a guy. This is easy and fun to do, so don’t be nervous! Make sure when you're meeting new guys you don't come across fake.


Join a club, community class, or activity group. You can play a sport you like, take an art class at your local community center, or join a study group. Find something that appeals to you and you will instantly be meeting people that you have something in common with so you have something to talk about.
Go out to clubs (adult or all-ages clubs, depending on what you prefer) and start talking with new people there. Just be careful and practice common sense.
Find a group on the Internet which appeals to you. This can be a fan forum for a show or activity you like or maybe a multiplayer video game which you find fun. However, make sure you don't share your personal details online to anyone you don't know.;
, Once you initially meet someone, get to know them a little bit before deciding that he is totally your next boyfriend. You can’t judge someone entirely on how he looks. Try to gauge if he meets your minimum requirements for someone to date.


Is he funny? Smart? Nice? Decide what is important to you and gauge these things during your initial conversation. If he seems totally different than what you’re looking for, it’s not worth it just because he’s hot.

, If he already has a girlfriend or boyfriend, it's best to move on because imagine the other girl's/boy's feelings. This is helpful to him, to yourself, and the person he’s dating. You wouldn’t want someone to do that to you so don’t do it to them.

, Ask around about what this guy is like. If his friends seem honestly happy about the idea of him being in a relationship, that is a good sign. Ask mutual friends about what they think about him and try to get to know his friends or coworkers as well.

, Don't rush your new friend, but remember if he doesn't like you for who you are then don't spend time trying to get him. Go find someone else to be your boyfriend. Don't hope he'll be your boyfriend right away- give him time and get to know each other. Hang out and talk every once in a while to begin with, then start hanging out more often. Give each other space. Usually, if you hit it off really well and have a lot of fun together, the friendship will tend to automatically grow into more frequent visits. Try not to be that person who looks too desperate: you don’t need to decide that he is your future husband within the first week of meeting him.

, Just remember to be yourself when you talk to him. This is especially important if he's the kind of guy who's used to having others approach him. It's important that you remain different because you'll stand out more. Don’t just be another person in the crowd. Don’t just be another person pursuing him for his looks. Be individual and fun and fascinating! This means taking things slow and letting him get to know you. However, don't pressure yourself to do things that you don't necessarily enjoy for the sake of being individual or just because he may like them. Always stay in your comfort level and be yourself! A guy worth dating will be okay with someone that has limits. That being said, don't be afraid to try new things. Does he listen to a band you've never heard of, or never bothered to listen to? Give it a try, you might like them! If you put forth the effort, and create a genuine opinion, even if it (Respectfully) differs from his, it can at least give you something to talk about.

, Don’t close yourself off or seem unapproachable. Set aside time where he knows you aren’t too busy to hang out with him, and let him know that he is welcome to hang out with you. Smile and make eye contact. Don’t look scary, unsociable, or angry. This makes it seem like you don’t want to interact with him and it’s intimidating.


Say you’ve got an extra seat if he’d like to join you for lunch.
Smile and wave at him when you see each other across a room or talking with friends.
Be nice to other people too. Show him that you’re the kind of person that anyone can come and talk to. Be nice to people, compliment them, don’t be rude, and generally show that you won’t bite his head off if he tries to talk to you.

, It’s important to interact with him. Talk with him when you run into each other and find reasons to talk to each other more often. The more you talk, the closer you’ll become and this is a great way to build a friendship that can turn into something more.

, As you become friends, be sure to be a good one. Be supportive and fun. Be someone that he can trust and admire. Most guys tend to date people with whom they have more things in common than just the ""relationship"" stuff. Being close friends with him makes it easier for you to interact with him and for him to see what he stands to gain from being around you more often.

, Get to know who he is as a person. This will tell you if he is someone that you really want to get emotionally invested in. You don’t have to like everything about him, but you do have to be accepting and uncritical of your differences. You can’t change people, so it’s important to like him as he is.


Talking about politics, religion, your childhood and family, as well as your experiences in school and your hopes for the future will tell you a lot about who he is as a person. Let him know you're interested in his personal life, but don't invade his privacy.

, It is important that you enjoy some of the same things (so that you have something to connect over) but it is also a good idea to have some differences (So that you challenge each other and broaden your horizons). Talk and figure out what you have in common.

, Try to gauge if he’s open to a relationship in general. Maybe he’s already got his eye on someone. Maybe he’s just had a horrible breakup and he’s not open to dating at the moment. You will need to respect him, his feelings, and the situation he’s in by not being overly pushy if he isn’t in the mood for a relationship.


It can be hard to get information like this without simply asking him. Try the old-fashioned method of asking around. Mutual friends may have more details. His friends may even be willing to help, if they want to see him in a relationship and they think well of you.
Be sure not to get stuck in the friend zone if you were thinking about dating him, but remember guy friends are awesome too!
It is important to flirt with the guys you are interested. Don't flirt with every guy because then you will develop a bad reputation.

, Everybody wants to be with someone who makes them a better person. It makes us feel good about ourselves and reassures us that we can be good people if we try. Make this guy the best version of himself by encouraging him to do the things he loves and giving him the space to do those things.


Remember: don’t be condescending, push unwanted advice and help, or try to change him into what you want him to be. Helping him to be his best self is about helping him make the changes that he wants in his life, not turning him into what you want him to be.

, Don’t criticize him harshly when he does something bad or wrong. This will make him feel horrible and he will begin to feel bad when he is around you. Instead, if he does something you don’t like, lead by example to show him a better way to be. You can certainly tell him when you don’t like something he does, but don’t be mean or controlling about it and help him find a good way to change.


If his grades are low and he struggles in school, set up time to spend together studying and tutor him in subjects where you do better than he does. Don’t do his work for him, but help him to realize that he can do it on his own and develop good study habits.
If he has trouble holding down or finding a job, help him by showing the importance of good work habits or helping him look for a job. Offer to go with him to workshops for writing or building resumes, talk with him about ways that he could learn to enjoy work more, or help him find a job that he would be more interested in going to every day.
It is especially important not to criticize him in public or in front of his friends or family.

, Show him that you excel as a person when you’re around him. Show that he makes you a better person. Just as you look to see that he is better when he is with you, he will be looking for the same. Pursue things you love and make him feel included in that part of your life. Ask him for advice on how to change things about yourself that you don’t like.

, Show him that you are mentally and physically independent. You don’t need him to do everything for you (although he should feel that he can help you sometimes) and that you have a mind of your own. It adds to his vision of you as a fully developed and interesting person with standards. He wants a partner, not a blow-up doll.


Never be afraid of being totally honest about your likes and dislikes. Let him know what you think about issues and don’t just agree to everything he says.

, Don’t make him feel like he needs to spend all of his time with you. Don’t make him your go-to source of weekend or Friday night plans. Encourage him to do things he loves and spend time with his friends by doing things that you love and spending time with yours.


One of the reasons that many guys avoid relationships is because they feel it will trap them or keep them from doing things they like to do. Show him that if he’s with you, this will not be the case.

, If you're not, then how else would you know if he likes you or not for who you are? If you are pretending to be someone you are not, you will feel uncomfortable every time you are around him and that is the last thing you would like to happen. If you are uncomfortable around him, it would probably be hard to talk to him and if you can't talk to him, it will be hard to keep a relationship.

, If you find a guy who you share a lot in common with, don't wait for them to ask you to hang out. If you are scared to ask him because you think he doesn't like you, ask anyway. It’s scary but it won’t hurt you and you only stand to gain in the long run.


He might also be shy, so he might not be the one to approach, either because he thinks you're out of his league or because he thinks you might reject him.

, Flirt with him to let him know that you’re definitely interested. Lean in during conversations, touch him casually and lightly, and compliment him (do so honestly, people can always tell the difference).

, If all else fails and he’s still not asking you out on his own, go right ahead and make your move. You don’t want him to get away! Have a date in mind (something that will appeal to him) and go straight up and ask. Try to be confident, as most people find this attractive.

, Be someone that’s good to date. If you become known as a great person to date, it will be much easier to find a boyfriend in the future. Be fun, active, and supportive. Be someone that’s great to be around.

, Do not become known as someone who is critical, lazy, or possessive in relationships. These qualities will make others not want to date you. Give your boyfriend his space, let him be himself and continue to make yourself a better person by going out and doing things.

, The best way to guarantee that no one in your social circle will ever want to date you is to constantly cheat on your boyfriend or seem like you might be cheating on your boyfriend. Be loyal and keep your attention on him. If you’d rather be flirting and hanging out with someone else, then you need to break up with the guy you’re dating. It isn’t fair to either of you if you’d rather be somewhere else.

Check in when he’s not around.,
Don’t take yourself so seriously.",How to Get a Boy to Like You in Fifth Grade," If you want a boy to like you, then he should see that you’re a fun girl to be around. You don’t want him to think that you’re one of those people who always depends on other people for fun, or who stands around with a frown on her face, worrying or just feeling cranky. Instead, you want him to notice you and to think, “Hey, that girl is always laughing or having fun. I should try to meet her.” This shouldn’t be fake – you should just aim to be the kind of person who is always having a great time, no matter what.


This doesn’t mean you should put a fake smile on your face if you’re really not feeling it. However, you should try to cultivate a positive attitude by focusing on the things that make you happy in conversation, instead of complaining about every little thing that goes wrong.
Even if you’re by yourself or about to take a math test, try to look on the bright side and to keep a smile on your face. Not every moment of your life will be a sheer joy, but you can think about something that you’re looking forward to later when you’re struggling to stay positive.
If you’re just walking to class by yourself, you don’t need to do it with a dopey grin on your face, but you should avoid frowning, looking bored as you search through your cell phone, or generally looking disengaged. If you avoid distractions and stare ahead with a happy, or at least neutral look on your face, then the boy is more likely to notice you.;
, When it comes to showing that you’re confident, body language is half the battle. You should walk with straight posture and avoid slouching, whether you’re sitting down or standing up. Keep your arms at your sides instead of folded over your chest so that you look approachable. Look straight ahead if you’re alone, or make eye contact if you’re talking to people, instead of looking at the floor. Though you may not always feel confident, showing confidence with your body language can go a long way in making you feel more secure.


Another way to have confident body language is to avoid fidgeting as much as you can. Try to avoid biting your nails, playing with the bottom of your shirt or your hair, or anything else that will make you look nervous.
When you’re standing in a group of people, try to stand tall instead of shrinking back so you get noticed and feel comfortable.

, You may be feeling shy when it comes to the boy you like, but a small, sweet smile can go a long way in making the boy notice you. All you have to do is smile at the boy when you make eye contact, and this will instantly make you look more friendly and approachable. You shouldn’t try to catch his eye and smile at him every single time, but you should make an effort to smile at him if you lock eyes and it feels right. You should especially do this if you both pass each other in the halls, just to be friendly.


If you’re feeling shy about this, you can give him a quick smile and then look away. You don’t have to look too eager – the goal is to look friendly and approachable so he notices you and wants to get to know who you are.

, To get a boy to notice you, you should let him see what makes you different. You don’t have to show off or hog all the attention to do this, either. If you love fashion, then let him see your latest homemade necklace or unique dress. If you like soccer, then talk about how much the sport means to you, or even invite him to watch you play. If you’re known for your sense of humor, then crack some jokes in his company. Your goal is to make him see that there’s something special about you, which will make him want to get to know you more.


Avoid bragging about the things you’re good at. Instead, just talk about how much you love to paint, write poetry, do gymnastics, or pursue one of your other hobbies, and he’ll see that you’re passionate about it.
Don’t stand out just for the sake of standing out. Dying your hair pink isn’t a good idea if all you want to do is to get his attention; however, if you really do want pink hair, then go for it! Remember that if you’re doing something just for the sake of attention, he will be able to tell.

, At your school, it can be pretty common for you to ask your friends to talk to the boy you like for you. You may ask them to ask him if he likes you, or just to run up and talk to him for you. However, if you want to impress the boy and get him to really notice you, then you shouldn’t get your friends to do the hard work for you. Show that you’re more mature than a lot of girls your age and that you’re comfortable enough to talk to the boy yourself.


Whether you want to say hi or even feel ready to tell him you like him, you should talk to him on your own. He’ll be impressed by this and will want to get to know you.
Having your friends write notes to the boy, or even writing them yourself, also makes it look like you’re afraid to talk to him yourself. Instead, just take a deep breath and talk to him face to face.

, Boys can be really impressed by girls who know who they are and who are happy with themselves. Though developing true confidence can take a lifetime, you can make an effort to love yourself and your life, so that you can use that energy to make others feel good about themselves, too. If you want to get a boy to notice you, then he should see you smiling, feeling good about yourself, and giving off a positive, satisfied energy. Here are some other ways to impress the boy you like with your confidence:


Don’t put yourself down in front of him. Instead, focus on the good aspects of yourself – without bragging. Being down on yourself just puts the boy in an awkward position, and you want him to feel comfortable, and to not feel like you need him there to feel good about yourself.
It’s okay if you’re feeling a little nervous about talking to him. If you stutter, forget what you were going to say, or find yourself rambling on about nothing, make sure you’re able to laugh at yourself a little and to brush it off. It’s okay if he doesn’t think you’re the smoothest person in the world; what’s important is that he sees that you’re comfortable with yourself.
When you talk about other girls, stick to the things you like about them. Nothing will make you look insecure faster than putting down other girls.

, Don’t think that you should be a Mean Girl or to make other people look stupid just to get the boy’s attention. If he’s a good guy, then he’ll be much more impressed by the fact that you’re a nice person than if you’re putting other people down or giving people the cold shoulder just to look cool. Instead, work on being friendly to any person who is nice to you, or even to someone who is a little shy; give people the benefit of the doubt until they prove that they’re not worth it. If you’re a generally nice person, then the boy will be more likely to know who you are, and to want to get to know you.


Everyone has a reputation to uphold. If you’re known for being a snob, then the boy will hear about it. Instead, be genuinely nice to people so you’re open to more friendships and experiences. You don’t have to be super outgoing to do this, either. Just saying hi to people and asking how their day is going can go a long way in helping you make friends and to come off like a nice person.
If you hang out in circles where girls tend to gossip a lot of to be mean to each other, then ask yourself if it’s time for a friend spring-cleaning. Even if you’re not the one being mean, it’s no fun to be associated with people who are being cruel.

, If you want the boy to like you, then it’s not all about making him think that you’re a fascinating, awesome person. You have to show that you’re interested in him, too. To do this, you have to ask him a few questions about his life to keep him interested and to show that you’re more than just a pretty face. Make sure there’s a balance in the conversation between talking about yourself and asking him questions, and he’ll see that he likes talking to you a lot. Here are some questions you can ask him about:


What he did over the weekend
His plans for the summer or upcoming holidays
His pets
His favorite bands, TV shows, movies, or books
His hobbies and interests

, Another way to keep the boy interested is to not overwhelm him by coming on too strong. You can compliment him and make it pretty clear that you like him if he shares your interests, but you shouldn’t glue yourself to him or constantly spend time with him. Give him time to miss you, to wonder what you’re doing, and to appreciate that you have your own life. If you make your life all about him, then he’ll lose interest pretty soon. You don’t want him to think that you’re too intense. Even if you really, really like him, you should wait for the relationship to deepen before you share your true feelings.


One way to avoid coming on too strong is to avoid texting him or checking in on him all the time. You can check in with him to say hi, but don’t make it seem like all you do is think about him when you’re not together.

, If you want to hold a guy’s interest, then you have to make him feel like he’s special to you – without coming on too strong, of course. If he starts treating you like you’re special to him, then you should do the same, by paying a bit more attention to him in groups, asking him how he’s doing, or even giving him a subtle complement about his clothes or something that isn’t overly personal. If you want to keep the boy around, then he has to know that you care for him. You don’t have to come right out and say it, but you can let your actions show that you care for him.


If you’re in a group, pay more attention to him than the other boys, but don’t stick by his side the whole time. He should take the first step and come to you, sometimes.
Don’t give him the same compliments you might give someone else. Let him see that he really does stand out to you.

, Another way to hold a boy’s interest is to find some common ground. You probably don’t have everything in common, but having just a few things to talk about can help you relate to each other and keep the conversation going. Don’t worry if you feel like you’re really different people and you have nothing to talk about; once you relax a bit and keep the conversation moving forward, you’ll find that you have more in common than you thought. Here are some common bonds you may find, which will give you a lot to talk about:


A favorite sports team
A favorite TV show or movie
A favorite band
Favorite video games
Pets
Friends in common
Favorite hobbies

, Another way you can hold the boy’s interest is to be a good listener. When he talks to you, put away your phone or any other distractions that would keep you from hearing him out. Let him finish what he has to say before interrupting. Don’t tell him that you know exactly how he feels any time he shares an emotion with you. Show that you really care about who he is and what he has to say instead of talking about yourself the whole time. Just make eye contact, turn your body toward the boy, and give him all of your attention to show that you care.


Remember that it should work both ways; you should listen to him just as much as he listens to you.
Pay attention to what he tells you so you can follow up about it later. If he tells you he has a big baseball game this weekend, for example, you can ask him how it went on Monday. This shows that you’re keeping track of the things that he tells you and that it means something to you.

, If you want the boy to continue to be interested in you, then you should avoid gossiping or saying bad things about the people you both know, or you will give off the wrong impression. If you’re always gossiping about other girls, then he’ll think that you’re mean and that you don’t care about other people. He’ll also sense that you’re insecure and may think that you like to put people down just to feel better about yourself. You should avoid being that girl and talk about the things you like, or the things you’re looking forward to instead.


If other people around you are gossiping, just excuse yourself or even offer a different opinion. You don’t want to look like a follower.
Boys tend to hate drama. If you gossip in front of the boy, he’ll think that you’re the kind of girl who likes to bring on the drama, and he most likely will want to back off.

, Though you’re only in the fifth grade, which means that most people haven’t kissed or done anything else yet, some boys will be ready to move further than you want. You should only kiss boys when you’re ready, and you should never do it just because you think it’ll keep a boy interested. If the guy you like is the type of person who will only like you if you kiss him, then he’s not worthy of your time. Make sure that you feel completely comfortable before you do anything with a boy, and that you do it because you want to, not because you feel pressure. The real way to keep a boy interested is to be firm in your convictions and to stick to what you know is right.


If a boy is pressuring you to do something before you’re ready, calmly tell him that you’re just not interested. Hold your head high and don’t let him get to you. You’ll feel much better in the long run.

, Guys in fifth grade don’t tend to take life too seriously; they just want a girl they can have fun with. They’re not quite at the age when they want to spend all of their time alone with a girl, and they’re not really ready for intense relationships. Instead, they want girls who are lighthearted, who have fun friends, and who are spontaneous and up for trying something new. If you like to worry or are more quiet by nature, then that’s fine; you can’t change yourself, but you can work on keeping up more fun, lively conversation, and cutting down on the negativity and complaints, if you do that.


It shouldn’t be hard for you to burst into laughter. Don’t hold back if something is funny and show that you’re really having a great time.
One way to be a fun person is to know how to make people feel at ease. Make eye contact with people, ask them easy questions about themselves, and introduce them to each other if they don’t know each other. Make them feel at home, and they’ll be more relaxed and more likely to have fun.

, If you want the boy to like you for a long time, or even for him to ask you out and date you, then you have to make an effort to be nice to his friends. Though it can be hard to be nice to his group of friends, especially if you really don’t know any of them or if you’re just a naturally shy person, you have to try as hard as you can to make a positive impression on the people that matter to him. If his friends think you’re mean to them, too controlling, or just plain annoying, then they’ll let him know how they feel and may be able to influence him. Unless they’re really mean people, you should stay on their good sides and show them what a great catch you are.


If his friends are jerks, then you don’t have to entertain them just for the sake of impressing him. But if they’re nice guys, then you should try to be nice, too, even if you don’t have all that much in common.
Don’t be frustrated if this takes a bit of work. It's only natural that a lot of girls and guys aren’t super comfortable with talking to each other yet.

, If you want to keep things interesting, then you have to continue to do your thing. Don’t stop talking to your friends, spending time with your family, going to swim meets, or doing the things you love to do just because you’re suddenly spending time with your crush. While you should make time for him so that your relationship can grow, you shouldn’t give up everything you care about for the sake of a boy. He’ll respect you more because he’ll see that you’re okay with doing your own thing while maintaining a relationship.


Your friends will always be there for you, no matter what, while it can be a different story when it comes to guys. Don’t be the girl who drops her friends to hang out with a boy and then has to come crawling back to them when the relationship is over.
Doing the things you love to do, from playing piano to drawing, makes you who you are. If you stop doing those things for a boy, then you’re giving up a part of yourself.
If you and the boy really like spending time together, then you can include him in some of your favorite interests, such as watching a show you like together.

, If you want the relationship to thrive, then you should check in to say hi to the boy from time to time when you’re apart. This could be when you’re apart for a few weeks because of summer vacation, or just when you’re apart for a weekend during school. You shouldn’t contact him every five seconds, or even every day, but just a quick text, Facebook message, or even a phone call will let him know that he’s still on your mind. Make sure that he returns your feelings and also gets in touch with you when you do this, so that there’s a balance in your relationship.


If he told you he has a big basketball tournament this weekend, send him a quick text the next day to see how it went. But don’t try to text him right before the game or he’ll feel a bit overwhelmed.
This is where playing hard to get comes in. You want to check in enough to show that you care, but not so much that he thinks you’re spending a lot of time thinking about him.

, At the end of the day, you have to remember that you’re only in the fifth grade, and that the chances that the boy you like is your soul mate and that you’ll be together forever – or even for a few months – are pretty low, so you shouldn’t bank too much on your relationship. If he’s not interested, then just smile, catch your breath, and prepare for the next boy who will come your way. And if he’s interested but things aren’t working out the way you planned, then you shouldn’t be too disappointed. The important thing is that you enjoy your time at school and your friendships, and that you get something out of the relationship. As far as dating goes, you have a lifetime of boys ahead of you!


The more relaxed you are about getting a boy to like you, the happier you’ll feel because you won’t be putting pressure on yourself. It’s important to enjoy your life instead of fretting over getting boys to like you too much. In the end, the right boy will come along and sweep you off your feet.

Write him a love letter.",How to Get a 12 Year Old Boy to Like You1," Look over at him when you’re in the same room and smile at him to let him know you’re friendly and that looking at him makes you happy. Don’t overdo it, but you can definitely catch his eye several times during a class, game, or party. You can shyly look away once you catch his eye, or keep up the eye contact.;
, Pick out a favorite outfit that makes you feel beautiful and comfortable so that you feel confident the next time you see him. Don’t feel like you need to wear “stylish” clothes that other people are wearing, because he may not even like or notice them, but he will pay attention when you feel comfortable and at ease.

, Experiment with how to wear your hair and makeup, but keep it simple and ultimately go with what you think looks great on you and makes you feel good. Always start by practicing good hygiene: shower and wash your hair, wear deodorant, and brush your teeth every day.


Wear your hair down or up in a ponytail or bun, or however you like to wear it best. Try playing around with curling or straightening it for a new look if you want.
Brush a little mascara on your eyelashes and apply some concealer or foundation to your skin if you want to cover up any redness or acne.

, Stand next to him when you’re in a group, and get close if you’re sitting next to him. You can even lightly touch him on the arm while you’re talking or give him a playful push if he’s teasing or joking with you.But pay attention to the signs he’s giving you. Some people don’t like others in their close personal space or feel uncomfortable with touch; it doesn’t necessarily mean he doesn’t like you.


If you don’t want to get too close or touch him, you can simply mimic his body language. If he crosses his arms, leans his head on his hand, or stands with his hands in his pockets while he’s talking to you, wait at least 20 seconds and do the same or something similar. This is a very subtle way to show you are paying attention and interested in him., Observe him to see what kinds of books he reads, music he listens to, or teams he follows. While he’s around, try reading a book by the same author or wearing a band t-shirt that you think he would like as a way of getting him to initiate a conversation before you do., Write him a sweet or funny note and slip it into his locker. You can leave it anonymous by signing it with a code name or word and tell him he has to figure out who it is through clues you give him in each letter.

Find what you have in common.,
Show your intelligence.,
Be honest.,
Listen to him.,
Be direct.,
Tease and be playful.",How to Get a 12 Year Old Boy to Like You2," Ask him questions about his family, hobbies, school, movies, books, or sports and you will very likely find some things that you have in common with him. Start talking about one of these things to strike up another conversation, and even ask to hang out in order to watch a TV show, play a sport, or just talk about something you’re both into. If you both like basketball, for example, you could say, “Hey, I have a basketball hoop in my driveway, we should play sometime!”

, Let him know that you’re smart by telling him fun facts, helping him while you do homework together, or just sharing something else you know a lot about. Never downplay your intelligence or “play dumb” to get his attention.

, Tell him true things about yourself and answer his questions honestly as you’re getting to know him. Avoid the temptation to tell small white lies or say you like something just because he likes it. The truth will only come out later and it could make him less interested when he finds out you were making something up.


If he says “I really like country music,” you don’t have to say you like it too if you don’t, but you can still keep the conversation going. You could say “That’s cool. I’m more of a rock music person, but I can get into anything! What country artists do you like?”

, Pay close attention when he talks to you and remember things he says that you can bring up in later conversations. Listen well and give him your full attention to show him you really care what he has to say.

, If you’ve already spent some time with him, go ahead and tell him that you like him! You can say, “Hey, I think you’re really cute and funny. Do you want to go out sometime?” or “I like you more than just a friend. I’d love to go on a date with you!”

, Make jokes, lightly tease him about something (without being mean!), or even offer to arm wrestle as a way to hold his hand and either impress him by winning or make him feel good if he wins.

Try chatting with one or more of his friends first and inviting them to the group activity too. That way, when you talk to the guy you like, you can tell him that his friends are going too and he will be more likely to say yes.

, Find him before he leaves the classroom if you have a class with him, or chat with him at his locker between classes.

, Sit next to him or just at the same table as him in the cafeteria at lunch. This is an easy and casual way to spend some time with him during school hours.

, Show up to a sports game that he’s playing in or watching, join a club he’s part of, or hang out at an arcade, bowling alley, or mall where he and his friends like to hang out. Make eye contact and strike up a conversation when you’re there.

, Get close to his friends to show him that you’re the type of person he likes to hang out with. You’ll get the opportunity to spend more time with him and learn more about him through his friends.

, When you’re ready to make your move, ask him out! Choose something as casual as going for a bike ride after school or something more formal and traditional like dinner and a movie. Do whatever makes you comfortable and lets you talk and get to know each other better.


Try a super spontaneous and casual date by saying something like, “Oh man, I’m really craving ice cream right now! Let’s go get some!”"

Determine why you want a boyfriend.,
Determine what qualities you want.,
Find someone who shares something positive with you.,
Try being friends first.,
Talk about it.,
Try discussing depression in the abstract.,
Be faithful to your boyfriend, but committed to being cured.,
Understand that you will see things a little differently than he does, so be patient.,
Continue to be honest with him about your progress.,
Avoid alcohol and drugs during this time.",How to Get a Boyfriend if You Are Depressed,"


Are you lonely?  If so, this is not the answer.  Getting involved in a relationship just because you are lonely may cause you to settle for less than you deserve; or it may lead you to become dependent on him (which is not healthy for you or attractive to him).
Do you want someone to listen?  If so, a boyfriend may not be the best option.  Try to seek counseling.  Not only will you be able to express your emotions, but you will also not run the risk of being rejected by a man, which could exaggerate your depression.
Are you seeking physical contact?  Sex has all kinds of wonderful effects for the mind and body, but it can be equally damaging if rushed into with the wrong person.  The good news is that the same chemicals we release during sex can be stimulated by hugging those we love in a non-sexual way.  Some studies have even indicated that laughing heartily can release these chemicals. It may not be as thrilling as sexual contact, but it could save a lot of heartache to hold out on intimate contact until you are in a healthy state of mind and capable of truly loving another.
If your need for a relationship does not fall into one of the lines of reasoning above, and you feel that you simply want a boyfriend to have a more complete social life, then start simple.;
,  Write them down.  Be realistic (e.g. if you are 120 pounds overweight and think hiking is a Kool-Aid flavor, you probably are not going to snag a bodybuilder).  Think beyond the physical qualities.  If you are depressed, you are going to want someone who is strong enough to minimize your mood swings, but also sensitive enough to be a shoulder to cry on.

,  If you are religious, look for someone who practices the same faith (remember practicing a faith and believing in it are two very different things).  If you are into fitness, switch up your routine and attend a body pump or cycling class to find a man who can become your workout partner.  If you are in school, try to talk to him about a project, class, or sport you find interesting.  Connecting with someone is way more complicated than we make it out to be.  If you have a hobby and he does too - you have an icebreaker.  If you don't have a hobby...try something out!  This may help both with meeting a man and to cure your depression.

,  Invite him to hang out with you and your friends, or invite him to something casual.  You are in a delicate mindset now, and you can't just jump into a relationship until you have eased your depression symptoms.  Don't forget that. Your task is finding a happy relationship, but also finding a happy you.  Don't suffocate your depression for the passing thrill of a man who may or may not be there for the long term.

,  This is not going to be as easy as ""Hi, my name is Becky and I am depressed"" (obviously!), but you need to find some way to discuss the subject to see if it is something that he can handle.  If this relationship is going to be genuine, you cannot hide your emotional struggles from him.

,  Talk about an article, movie, or current event that has to do with depression.  Talk about that, and transition into asking if he has ever suffered from depression or if he knows anyone who has.  This will serve many purposes.  First, it will allow you to understand whether he really sees depression as what it is (a mental illness which is normal and can be cured), or whether he is ignorant on the topic. You will also be able to see if he has encountered it in the past.


If his answer is something to the tune of yes - he is familiar and/or he has experienced it, open up.  You don't need to go into detail, but let him know that you are struggling.  Tell him you are working on eradicating it from your life (and you better be!) and remember to envelope any self-critical statements with positive aspects about yourself.  There is no shame in depression.
If his answer is no, that's ok.  Educate him a little on the topic. Whether or not he ends up as your boyfriend, you can help one more person understand mental illness for what it is rather than the stigma it gets in mainstream culture.
If his answer is ignorant or negative - toss him.  Definitely do NOT cover up your situation because you are scared of some man looking down on you.  The boyfriend you need is the one who actually cares, not the one who judges based on things out of your control.

,  Again, no matter how sweet or supportive he is, if you are genuinely depressed, he is not going to solve it.  Go to therapy. Meditate.   Exercise.  Read self-help books.  Dedicate at least one hour a day to fixing your mind.

,  You may wake up with tears in your eyes while he feels the happiness in a new day.  Being depressed is like living under a dark cloud that no one sees but you. Be open to accept his positivity and love.  If you have to, just fake a smile.  Sometimes that is all it takes to turn your mood around.

,  If he asks questions, don't hide.  Answer.  Talk openly about how you feel, but don't make depression the center stage in your relationship.  Do uplifting things with your man - ride bikes, go jogging, visit zoos or aquariums, anything that is uplifting.

, They will make you horrible to your partner, and they will only hurt you in the long run.  You cannot cure your mind if you constantly adulterate it."

Be happy with yourself and have fun doing your thing.,
Figure out what your standards are and what type of guy makes you happy and don't settle for less.,
Look your best.,
Understand gender paradigms.,
Be approachable!,
Get out there!,
If you know you want a guy with a certain trait, go places where you think you'll find that kind of guy.,
Try to keep in touch with them if they seem interested or hang out somewhere and wait for things to move naturally and see how things go.",How to Find a Boyfriend," This is so important, especially for teenagers. You have to be happy being single and you can never be dependent on having a boyfriend. Basically, be sure having a boyfriend is good for you and be happy with yourself! Personally, I see so many women and girls who feel a boyfriend completes them, and deep down are unhappy with themselves. If you are young, it's a good idea to wait until you are in high school, or preferably can drive before dating. Don't rely on guys to make you feel loved or happy, happiness comes from within.;
, For instance, if you want a guy who can make you laugh, you have things in common with, but is a gentlemen and treats you with respect and you happen to find a guy who is funny and charming but isn't such a gentlemen, don't settle. There's many fish in the water and there will be someone better for you! Set your standards high, but also don't be extremely selective.

, Many people say 'appearance does not matter, it's what's on the inside that counts' but truthfully it does. Let's face it, no one wants the person they're dating to be lazy and sloppy looking. At the same time, you don't have to be a rich perfect-looking supermodel to get the guy you like, but just be happy with yourself and look your best. Dress nicely to flatter your figure without being overly-exposing, and wear subtle makeup to enhance your eyes or maybe try a new hairstyle.

, The idea that girls should be cute and guys should be tough may not be good for society, but because they are based on human instinct, many guys sub-consciously want cute vulnerability in girls, even if they consciously think strong women are admirable. Lying about who you are is bad, but if you have a cute and vulnerable side, let it show.

, Smile, and talk to people, and if you're out on the prowl for a guy, don't bring more than one friend with you. Also, you want to look good, but if your look is especially fashion forward or avant garde, you might look great, but you won't look very approachable. A quiet girl who looks like she just stepped off the runway at a fashion show might catch a guy's interest, but even the most beautiful girls don't get asked out often if they don't seem approachable.

, Go do the things you like and find other guys who like doing the same things. It shows you have things in common. Try to find guys you like and approach them in a friendly way. Don't be overly flirtatious which could lead to rejection or bad first impressions. Don't be too shy, which could lead to never getting a chance though. Be yourself, most importantly, and have them like the real you.

, For example, if you want a smart guy, join a chess club.

, If you both have a good connection, congrats you've found someone to date. If things don't work out, you haven't found the right person and it's nothing against you.

Smile.,
Be confident.,
Be open-minded.,
Don't be timid.,
Stay away from the drama.,
Take care of your body.,
Think about how you dress.,
Take it easy on the makeup.",How to Attract Boys," Smiling is by far the most effective thing you can do to attract men. If you do nothing else, be sure to smile around the man you are interested in romantically. Not only do women look most attractive when they smile, smiling sends the signal to men that you are happy, friendly, and approachable. It also reflects a sense of confidence, which both men and women find extremely rare and attractive.


Get in the habit of forcing a smile on your face if you catch yourself frowning. Some people are naturally predisposed to frowning when they are extremely focused or distracted, so it will take some practice to condition yourself to smile more.
Many women look to models who scowl in photographs and try to imitate them, thinking it will make them mysterious and sultry. Remember that while scowling may be ""fashionable,"" it doesn't translate into being attractive. In fact, many trends in fashion tend to be unflattering and unattractive from the point of view of men.;
, Men are universally attracted to women who feel confident about who they are on both the inside and the outside. This doesn't necessarily mean you should constantly boast or act as if you are superior to other people; in fact, being overly confident can be a turn-off to some men. Instead, focus your efforts on finding a sense of inner peace. This means accepting the things you cannot change about yourself and making an effort to change the things you can.


Even if you have some doubts about yourself, like most do try not to point out your flaws or insecurities around men. Pointing out your flaws will only cause him to focus on them and discover negative qualities that he might not have even noticed on his own.
Avoid constantly fidgeting with your hair or adjusting your clothes while talking to a man you are interested in, as these little acts show that you are self-conscious about your appearance.

, Men like women who are on the one hand educated and well-read, and at the same time open to learning and accepting new information. No matter what age you are, you should approach every new experience as an opportunity to learn something new.


Avoid saying prejudiced, disrespectful, or ignorant things in front of a man you're interested in. While it's great to voice your opinion, you should be careful that what you say isn't offensive in any way.

, While some women are naturally more shy than others, there is a big difference between being shy and being timid. Shy women may not crave the spotlight, but they can still be open to new experiences and having fun. Timid women, on the other hand, tend to be more negative, uptight and conservative. Make a conscious effort to just let loose and have fun. Not only will it instantly attract men, it makes your own life a great deal easier to not take things so seriously.

, Men are attracted to women who are down to earth and are easy to get along with. Avoid being overly dramatic or emotionally sensitive. Don't say negative things about people behind their backs, and don't instigate fights with a man for no reason.


While some conflicts are unavoidable in long-term relationships, try not to be the type of woman who starts drama everywhere she goes. It's important to accept that not everybody will please you all of the time, and that that's okay.

, Most men care more about a woman's body than they do about her face or her hair. While some men like curvy women and others like thinner women, the most important thing is that a woman is healthy and in shape. Regardless of how much you weigh, it is important to get regular exercise and keep your body toned.


If you are overweight and want to lose weight, then make a commitment to getting in shape. Not only will it help you attract men, it will also improve your overall quality of life, giving you more energy and reducing your likelihood for certain diseases.
Be sure to stay properly groomed. You don't have to look completely put together all the time, but it's important to stay on top of your personal hygiene. Pluck, shave, and/or wax as needed, shower every day, and wear deodorant to prevent unpleasant body odor.
There's nothing wrong with going au natural. If that's the choice you've made, though, you've got to commit to it and be proud of your body.

, Again, fashion is a topic on which men and women tend to diverge dramatically. While women usually try to stay up-to-date with what is currently on vogue, men are more concerned with whether a woman's clothes are flattering for her body type. When it comes to attracting men, it's more important to wear figure-flattering clothes than to wear ones that are considered ""fashionable"" or ""edgy"" at the moment. That said, there's no one ""uniform"" for attracting guys. Wear clothing that feels like an honest and comfortable presentation of yourself.

, Makeup should be used to enhance your natural beauty, not to create a false image. The general rule of thumb when it comes to men and makeup is: if he notices it, you're probably wearing too much. Stick to neutral colors that match your natural skin tone, and be sure to properly blend the makeup into your face to avoid flaking or discoloration.


Remember that while men are men, they still know what makeup is. In other words, you're not tricking anybody by piling on loads of mascara or lipstick. Men know what a natural face looks like and they know what an overly done-up face looks like.
Special occasions like weddings, birthday parties, or nights out on the town are an exception to this rule. It's okay to get all dolled up every once in a while, just don't get in the habit of hiding your true face from the world on a regular basis.

",How to Get a Boy to Date You when He's Already Dating," It is possible to steal a boyfriend you are not attracted to, but if the boyfriend stealing is being performed as revenge on a girl you dislike, be warned, it will backfire!;
, It can be for anything, homework/work help, chatting on the phone, advice on something, etc. Make it something where he will be helping you but won't have to go out of his way to do so. If it's a major inconvenience, he may say no.

, Show him how much you enjoy listening.

, Be ready to listen to him moan about all his problems, especially relationship problems.

If he thinks she's too uptight, engage in childlike pranks with him. But don't change yourself too much because he should always like you for who you are and who you're not. If he is going to leave his girlfriend for you then he should be leaving her for a good reason rather than for a false personality. Just engage yourself in his hobbies.

, Ask him for a hug. Watch DVDs you know he likes. Pretend to enjoy them.

, By all means kiss him, but sleeping with him would be counterproductive at this point.

, Do not stick with the natural look. Show a ""little"" cleavage. At this point, his relationship with his girlfriend should be damaged beyond repair. Be honest about your feelings, if he does not share his at this point share them, then walk away. He may even follow if he doesn't don't get all upset and angry with the guy.

, Use caution.

, Try not to be anything like his ex, and whatever you do, don't point out the wrongs in his ex.

If you don't want to date him, then tell him.,
If you do want to date your best friend, then tell him straight away!,

After the first date, one or two more dates is great, but not necessary, and then the group situation has to happen.",How to Date Your Best Friend (Girls)," It could be because he has feelings for you, which you truly don't reciprocate, or it could be because you don't want to impair your friendship. If you have feelings for him, then tell him! He will not feel the same towards you if you reject him, so don't expect things to be exactly the same between the two of you. He may avoid you, or even harbour feelings of hatred, because you two were so close.


Studies have shown that men often mistake signs of friendship as signs of desire, so don't expect your guy to be all happy when you reject him. He honestly thought you two could have something special.





;
, If your friendship up until that point had been extremely fun and witty and open, then expect that to continue. Tell him how you feel, and then arrange the date. This should be easy since you know each other well! Keep things the way they used to be, and try to keep the laughter in your relationship until the big date.

, ""I don't know; where do you wanna go?"" situation. You know each other really well at this point, so you should know where the best situation would be. Classic date-situations are movies, ice-skating, dinners, bowling, entertainment parks, walking around town, and even tutoring. Tutoring may sound kind of lame, but if one of you is smarter than the other in certain areas, then try to play to that aspect. Teach each other something, shared learning will help secures your bond. Bowling is fun because it sparks a friendly competition that will help keep conversation rolling. Ice skating is perfect in this scenario, because then there is an excuse for you to hold hands, and the cold can encourage cuddling .

, If you and your date are already best friends, then you are probably in the same group of friends, and it's best to keep things personal and private for awhile. If things don't work out, then you don't want to have to go through the agony of telling everybody why not...

, Jeans are always fine in a casual date between you and your best friend, as long as you have a little bit more of a dressy top, like a shirt with sequins, or a nice necklace with a sweet tank-top and cardigan.


Try to let your personality shine through, so that your boy knows that you're still who he thinks you are, and that the only thing that has changed is how you're going to act towards each other. A skirt is fine, but don't go all the way with a dress. That says ""Ok, I am trying way to hard, and I am extremely nervous"". Unless you're at prom, or a dinner, or a party. Hopefully, it should be just the two of you for a first date. Anything else isn't private enough. Keep it simple, although less casual than usual.







, When he arrives, and this will probably be the first time you see each other after the date-arrangement, don't be awkward. Show that you're still you, but that your feelings for him, are really there, and so that will eliminate his nervousness.

, Don't be in a hurry to change his status with them until you are more comfortable with the relationship.

, That does not mean, however, old boyfriends, intimate gossip, school, or anything else that you usually talk about. You can bring back old jokes, and relive old memories, and talk about yourselves. You need to get to know each other all over again, but in a different light. Don't talk about your grades, because you probably know a lot about each other already! Talk about new things, and what you think of each other.

, That doesn't mean groping, or else he will definitely think that you're not the person he thought he knew, and the end of your relationship in definite. Touch his arm when you want his attention, or when you're trying to make a point. Keep it above the waist, guys.

, This one is important; if you get this wrong, your relationship may not work out. It has to be sweet and innocent, not a wet fish. No tongues. Go for about a 10 second kiss, at some point during your date.


Keep the lips firm, yet open. Don't let your mouth hang open, but don't be tight-lipped. You don't want your guy to think that you don't like them. If you're going in for a second kiss, go for another 10-20 second one. No tongues on the first date.






You don't want him to think that you're different than who he thinks you are, which is why he likes you! At the end of the date, hopefully you can both say that you've had a lot of fun, like you used to, yet your romance was the key ingredient. You're still best friends, except you're more now, so hugging is great too.

, He will probably be punching the air, except you don't need to know that, in his oh-so-manly opinion. Don't worry; it's a good thing!

, You have to be comfortable with each other in public. Make sure people know that you're a couple, and be happy about it. Don't shut out your other friends, but make sure they know that you two are sort of in the love bubble.

, When you ask him out, make sure you look nice, but not too nice. You don’t want to dress up in clothes you don’t normally wear to ask him out. Wear clothes similar to what you usually wear when you see him, and keep your makeup and hair like you normally do, too. Don’t try to do something different to impress him. Just be your normal, wonderful self!For example, don’t put on a dress, fake eyelashes, and tons of makeup if this isn’t what you normally wear. This may make you seem too intense or desperate.

, When you ask him out on a date, make sure to keep it low stakes and casual. Remember, this is a first date and you are still getting to know this guy, just as he’s getting to know you.

Say, “Would you like to go get coffee?” or “Would you like to grab lunch with me?”

, When asking your guy out on a date, try to have a specific date in mind. Saying something like “We should hang out” or “Let’s do something sometime” is non-committal and may not lead anywhere. Instead, ask him out to a specific activity so it’s clear that you two will be on a date.For example, you may want to say, “Let’s grab a smoothie after the gym” or “Let’s go to trivia at the local pizza place tomorrow.”

, Taking the plunge around others, especially his friends, may result in a rejection, even if he is interested in you.

Ask the guy about his interests or something fun he’s done recently. Then, you can suggest that the two of you go do something like that during the upcoming weekend.For example, if the guy says he likes baseball, you can say, “We should catch the game this weekend!” or “I haven’t been to the batting cages in forever. We should go on Friday!”

, If you are too nervous to ask him out on a solo date, try inviting him to a group outing. Get a bunch of your friends together and do something fun and low-key where you can talk and engage with him.For example, you can ask him out to dinner, for drinks, or to a movie. You can say, “We’re going to grab dinner tomorrow night. You should come with us!”

, If you are out with friends and see a cute guy, tell the bartender to send him a beer (or a soda, if you’re underage!).

This helps you figure out if you two have anything in common and if he is interested in you. Talking to him can show that you are confident and have interesting things to talk about. If he listens and asks questions or responds, odds are he’s interested in you, too.Try starting a conversation about something fun you did this week, like your amazing hike or a tennis game you went to.

Don’t compliment her just to try to get something you want, she will realize and think you're lying to her.,
Avoid insulting compliments.,
Don’t use cookie-cutter compliments.",How to Compliment Girls," The first thing you’ll want to do is think about the girl and what you know she values in herself.Girls are conditioned to shy away from compliments and she’ll be much more open to accepting a compliment she agrees with. Notice what she’s proud of, from your experiences with her and compliment her on those things.


For example, if she’s clearly very eager to share something she’s done with other people, that’s something you could compliment her on.

, Like yourself or anyone else, she probably likes to have her hard work validated. If you know she’s worked very hard on something or that there’s something she feels inadequate or self-conscious about, you can try complimenting her on that. This can be tricky though, so be careful how you do it.


For example, if she complains that she hates her nose, tell her that you think it’s cute.
Another example would be if she clearly tries to work very hard in school, compliment her either on her work ethic, her determination, or her intelligence.
For this type of compliment, whatever you compliment her on has to be honest. Don’t say something you don’t mean just to find something to compliment her on.

, Look back on the conversations you've had with her and find things to compliment her on that you know she values but thinks that she doesn't possess. Maybe you noticed that she told you she likes how hard you fight for the things that you want, but she fights just as hard. Maybe you noticed that she said she wished she had a figure like some other girl, but you think her figure is better.


It is important to consider whether or not she actually possesses the quality you want to compliment her on. Telling her she’s good at something that she’s not will catch her notice and she’ll know you don’t mean it.

, The best thing to compliment a girl on is her personality. This is something that she has a certain amount of control over and it is something that is intrinsically her, rather than something like clothing which usually has very little to do with her and who she is. Think about the things that you like about who she is as a person and what she does, then compliment her on that.

, You can also compliment her accomplishments. This is something she also has control over and that says something about who she is as a person. Think about the things that she worked hard for or things she did that you admired, like helping someone or doing the right thing in a tough situation, and compliment her on that.


Importantly, it is also something that can’t be taken away from her or that can change with time. This means that she won’t have to fear losing this quality, and can be happy when she thinks about this compliment for the rest of her life.

, You don’t have to over think compliments. You can just compliment her naturally, by saying exactly how you feel. Speak from your heart and the perfect compliment should come out. The trick to doing this, though, is that you have to respect and value her first. It’s not respecting her that could lead you to saying something offensive.

, Any compliment you say, you have to absolutely mean. Girls will always be able to tell if you don’t mean it. They may not call you on it, but they’ll know and it will make them feel awful and awkward.

, This is the main key to being able to compliment girls without offending or upsetting them. If you respect them as people, as valuable human beings with worthwhile opinions, feelings, hopes and dreams, who are capable of doing everything that you can do, then any compliment that comes out of your mouth will probably be fine.

, If you’re still worried, think about how the compliment would make you feel. Don’t just look at the surface of the compliment...think about the things that she worries about and the experiences she’s had. Think about what the compliment could mean if taken out of context. Think about how you would feel if someone you didn't know said that to you. If it would make you feel uncomfortable, it’ll probably make her uncomfortable too.

, You need to compliment her at appropriate times, like when you’re on a date, or you’re having a conversation related to what you want to compliment her on. This also means pairing what you want to compliment her on with the situation that you’re in. This is very important, as doing this in the wrong situation can be very demeaning.For example, don’t compliment her on her physical appearance after she’s just given a presentation (unless it’s to say that she looked fierce and was commanding the whole room). Instead compliment her on her hard work, her great way of phrasing the information, or her clear intelligence shown in how she put the presentation together. Complimenting her physical appearance in this situation would be demeaning, but complimenting her work is empowering.

, You don’t always have to say a compliment for it to come across loud and clear. A very effective way to compliment her can be to show your compliment in how you react to something that she’s done or said.


For example, if she’s just worked very hard on something, you can compliment her hard work by treating her to a relaxing back massage.
Another example would be that if she does something really nice for someone, do something really nice for her, like making her dinner.
These actions can also be ways to introduce a spoken compliment, by telling her why you’re doing what you’re doing.

, If she doesn't respond to your compliment in the way that you’d like, don’t be a jerk or think (or tell her!) that she’s stuck up or thinks too highly of herself. This only proves to her that you were complimenting her for your own sake rather than hers. Instead, tell her calmly that she doesn't have to believe you but that you meant it sincerely and you hope she takes it for what it is. Leave her alone after that.


This is most common when complimenting girls you don’t know. Girls you do know will probably modestly reject a compliment because they are frequently conditioned to do so, at which point you can simply emphasize that you really mean it or think it, or just straight-up tell her not to be so modest.

, The thing is, if you build up a girl’s feeling of worth in a particular feature, in most cases that feature is going to go away over time and she’ll end up feeling worthless because it’s gone. So avoid complimenting butt, legs, etc. Eyes and hair, or clothes, are a safer bet.


Complimenting on physical features works even better if you tie the compliment to her personality or actions. For example, tell her that her eyes are beautiful and that you love how her determination shines through her eyes when she’s working so hard.

, This is the biggest no-no when it comes to complimenting girls. You will obviously see girls you don’t know that you’re very attracted to, and you may think that paying them a compliment is just a nice thing to do, but if you don’t know the girl then a sexualized comment is just going to take your chances down into the negatives, while also making you seem creepy.


For example, telling her she fills out that shirt nicely.
Sexualized compliments generally only work with girls you are dating or have another very close relationship with.

, You should compliment her because you mean it and you want to let her know how special she is to you. You should compliment her because you want her to be happy. You should absolutely not compliment her because you want shallow physical contact.

, There are some compliments which you might perceive as being flattering but are actually insults. Before you give yourself a serious case of foot in mouth, consider what you’re wanting to say and how it could be taken out of context.


If there’s anything in your compliment about her losing weight, stop. This can easily be taken the wrong way. Instead, compliment her by telling her how healthy she looks, tell her that she’s just glowing, etc.
Don’t compare her to your sister or mother in any way, unless there is a circumstance where this would be a very good thing. Generally if you want to have a romantic relationship with her, it’s not.
Any comments that end in “today” (ex. “You look so nice today”). She may believe that you're saying she doesn't look good on any other day. Ouch!

, Things like pick-up lines, lists of compliments you find online, and other cookie-cutter compliments won’t work...because they’re all about either another girl or any girl. She’ll notice if you’re complimenting something that could be said to anyone and know you’re just trying to get with her. Compliment her and you’re golden.

On the other hand, if you’ve never spoken to him before, it’s a good idea to introduce yourself. Start with something like, ""Hi! You're John, right? I'm Jane. Nice to meet you!"";
, Immediately follow up your introduction with something both of you can relate to. Being in the same class, at the same concert, in the same aisle at the bookstore, on the same train platform, etc. gives you something in common.Feel free to mix questions with general statements or light opinions. You could ask:


""What do you think of that article Prof. Smith had us read last weekend?""
""I hope they sing “Ruby” next. Which of their songs do you like?""
""I've been a fan of Margaret Atwood for years. Now that Hag-Seed is in print, I must have it! What brings you here?""
""Now that I finally have a day off, I'm going to catch the Rauschenberg exhibition at the Tate Modern. Where are you heading?""

, Finding out what you both like and dislike can lead to possible ideas for a date. Look for clues such as the title of the book he’s thumbing through, a remark about a TV show he watched last night, or his plans for the day. You could consider asking:


“Is that the book about Harry Potter and his friends as adults? I haven’t read that one yet. Would you recommend it based on what you’re skimming?”
“A few of my friends are hooked on ‘Jessica Jones’ and are trying to get me to watch a few episodes. Are you into comic books in general or just Marvel characters?”
“I’ve never been to that neighborhood, but I hear the food’s great! Which restaurants do you recommend?”

, While you don't want to immediately tell him how gorgeous you think he is, a few general compliments are safe bets. You can also use them to follow up with questions or comments as the conversation develops. You could say:


""I really like that point you made about Hamlet in English Lit. What made you think of that?""
""It's so nice that you dedicate your weekends to volunteering at the animal shelter. You set a great example for the rest of us.""
""You really keep your car in great condition! What's your secret?""
“Congratulations on your promotion! I bet you’re excited to be moving up in the world.”

, Just as you would rehearse for a play or a presentation, you should practice what you want to say and how you plan to communicate. Work on your natural tone of voice. Practice in front of a mirror and with your friends, paying attention to your facial expressions and body language as you talk. Watch out for fidgeting, stammering, and too many “ums” or “ers.”

, Communication is seven percent verbal and 93 percent body language. To appear confident, keep your body still, your posture straight, and your stance relaxed. Performing repetitive movements, crossing your arms, or playing with your hair makes you look nervous., Take deep breaths and speak at your normal pace. If you take enough air into your lungs, you can avoid sounding out of breath. Use the same tone of voice you would use when talking to your friends. Don’t make yourself sound overly dramatic or computerized.

, Remind yourself that it’s not a life-or-death situation. Talking to your friends beforehand can calm you down. If things get tense during the conversation, look for a fixed point in the distance. This will allow you to get a sense of the surrounding space and remind you that the walls are not closing in., Check the local newspaper, cultural websites, or your social network for new movies, festivals, parties, or other events happening in your city. Base your ideas on what you learned about your common interests. You could ask:


“The latest X-Men movie opens on Friday night. Would you like to go?”
“Since we’re both into sustainability, how about going to the Green Festival this weekend?”
“I'm going to Susie's Halloween party on Saturday. Do you want to go with me?”
“You mentioned that you’ve never been to a gallery hop. The Main Street hop is this Friday, and almost everything is free of charge. I’ll go if you do!”

, Frowning while talking to your crush can make you look desperate or nervous. Studies show that we react more positively to people who smile.Even if you’re feeling a bit down, a simple smile can brighten the mood and keep him engaged in the conversation.

, It’s true that eye contact conveys confidence. However, too much eye contact could make him feel awkward.Try to talk to him the way you talk to your friends. A few seconds of eye contact throughout the conversation shows your interest in what he’s saying, but it’s perfectly fine to look away every now and then., Everyone, even that A-list celebrity you think is flawless, has been rejected at one point or another. If this happens, give him some space and let things develop naturally. Maybe you can be friends eventually. Most importantly, don’t beat yourself up or dwell on the negative. Seek support from your friends, and focus on what makes you awesome!

Compliment him.",How to Ask a Boy out at School1," It’s best to start talking to your crush when the two of you are relatively alone and no one can interrupt you. Try to find a chance to talk to your crush at the end of the school day, at lunch or in between classes.You can also talk to him during an after-school activity like a sports practice or a play rehearsal if you both are involved in the same extra-curriculars. Talking to him outside the context of school and classes can make the conversation more relaxed and personal.
You can also try to catch him while he’s at his locker or while he’s walking in the halls during breaks.
Avoid talking to him in the middle of class where anyone can overhear!;
, When you go up to him, make sure to smile and make eye contact as you say hello. If you both have been hitting it off, he may be nervous to talk to you too! A smile shows that you’re glad to see him and will help put him at ease.People are naturally drawn to optimism and positivity, which is why a smile can be such a powerful tool.

, Instead of asking your crush out as soon as you say hi, start a conversation with your crush. Ask him something casual, like how his weekend was or what the homework is for the class you share.You can ask him something like, “Hi Cam, did you finish the Latin project yet?”
Continue the conversation by talking about shared classes or interests. Ask him a question about himself if the conversation lulls!
If you haven’t ever spoken very much with your crush, consider having casual conversations like this a few times before making the move to ask him out. This will give you the opportunity to get to know each other better and will make asking him out seem less abrupt.

, Giving your crush a compliment is an innocent way to transition the conversation from casual to more personal. It’s also a subtle way to show your interest while still not being obvious. People naturally respond to flattery, so you can do no wrong by giving him a small compliment!You can say something as simple as, “I like your shirt!” or “By the way, good job with the game on Saturday.”

For example, it’s okay to be a little dorky if that’s part of your personality -- own it with confidence to attract the right guy.Part of being confident is openly enjoying the things that you like without feeling self-conscious. Whether it’s dancing, playing video games, or reading a book, enjoy yourself and don’t worry about looking “cool.”
Remember to keep your confidence in check, though. Don’t be argumentative with others about your opinions, tastes, or ideas, but feel free to state them without shame.;
, If a guy sees you being kind to others, he'll know you're someone he wants to be around. Show compassion and love to those around you, including your friends, family, and even strangers, to increase the chance of a guy liking you.Small gestures can show your kindness. Hold the door open for others, arrive on time when you have plans with others, ask your friends how their day is going, and smile at the people who you pass on the street.
Being patient and understanding when dealing with others can also show your kindness. If your friend snaps at you because they’re having a bad day, accept their apology without making them feel bad.

, You want your guy to feel like he can spend time with you and still do the things that he enjoys. People are usually drawn to others who are more agreeable, so be willing to try new things, such as different types of food or movies that you don’t usually watch.If the things he enjoys are a bit unusual, he may really appreciate someone who shows genuine interest in them. For example, if he keeps odd collections, ask about them rather than raising an eyebrow.

, In general, people are attracted to those who have a positive outlook. Try to focus on the the little things in life that can brighten even the worst day, such as an interesting conversation or your favorite meal. If you make an effort to be positive in your day-to-day life, others will be able to pick up on your positive energy.It can take some work to become a more positive thinker. Try to catch negative thoughts and find a new way to look at the situation. For example, you may think, ""I'm running late for school. I’m going to get in big trouble!"" Instead, tell yourself something like, ""It's a good thing I’m not usually late, so this won’t be that big a deal."", A guy wants to feel like he's free to be himself, which requires some alone time. Respect that space by having your own interests and activities outside of him. Make it clear to him you have your own group of friends, hobbies, and interests. If he sees you're more independent, he’s likely to want you more.For example, if he asks you to go out on a night that you have plans with friends, don’t cancel your original plans too eagerly. Your guy may worry that you’re too focused on him if you drop everything, so try making plans with him for the next night instead.

, Don't let conversations get boring or repetitive. If the conversation seems to be dying down, bow out or change the topic. Avoid awkward small talk as much as possible.


To keep a conversation going, ask good questions. For example, if he's telling you about a book that he's reading, you might say, ""I love that one too! What do you like best about it?""
You can always default to asking about things he likes. For example, if he's a movie buff, ask about his favorite films.

, Find small ways to touch your guy to show him that you’re interested and leave him longing for more physical contact. For example, nudge him a bit with your elbow during a conversation or touch his forearm a bit when you're speaking. If he touches back, it’s usually a sign he's interested in you as well.While you want the guy to know you’re interested in him, don’t do anything that you’re not comfortable with. If touching him feels like too much at first, just try standing close until you feel more comfortable.

, Fit little compliments into the conversation. Make sure that you mean what you say, though, because he’ll probably be able to tell if you’re just giving him a line. Look for moments where you can work what you admire about him into a the conversation naturally.When you first begin flirting, you can use somewhat generic phrases. For example, you might say, ""It was so good seeing you yesterday!""
As you get to know him more, work organic compliments into the conversation. For example, if he mentions that he's wondering what to wear to a sporting event over the weekend, you might something like, ""You always dress really nice so I'm sure you'll find something great.""

, Smiling is a good way to come off as flirtatious. During a conversation, work on keeping a smile throughout. You can also try to laugh lightly at his jokes and smile more when he says something sweet or interesting.Eye contact can also help. Try holding his gaze for a few seconds and then glancing away., It may seem strange, but people are attracted to those who subtly mimic their body language. You don’t have to imitate everything he does, but mimic small, subtle gestures. For example, if you see him cross his legs, cross your legs too.Try mimicking hand gestures. If he tends to wave his hands around as he speaks or to make a point, try doing the same.
If he is leaning in towards you, lean in towards him too.

, You may want to send your guy a physical note, but a flirty text can also work. Don't make it outright flirty if you haven't established that kind of relationship, though. Just show that you're thinking of him.


For example, you might send a quick text that says, ""Just wanted to say hi! ;)""
You can also text or send a note with a quick question. For example, ""How was your day?""

, Wear clothes that accentuate your best features. Certain clothing shapes flatter particular body types, so it’s important to choose the right fit for your wardrobe.If you are circle-shaped, choose slim-cut pants and looser tops, like tunics.
If you are triangle shaped, meaning your shoulders and torso are narrower than your hips, opt for wide-legged pants, tailored jackets, and line skirts.
If you have an hourglass figure, choose high-waisted pants, v-neck tops, and wrap dresses.
If you have a straight or rectangular figure, opt for boot-cut pants and fitted jackets.

, Choose outfits that you are comfortable wearing, but that make you feel attractive at the same time. Depending on your body shape and personality, that may mean a form-fitting outfit, a lower cut top, or a skirt or shorts that show off your legs.


Go for v-neck tops, which will make your body look wider and taller. Scoop neck tops can also be sexy. If you wear skirts and/or shorts, keep them above the knee to highlight your legs.
Fitted jeans and a t-shirt can also be sexy, especially when paired with an accessory like a watch. If you want to look a little fancier, throw a sports coat over this outfit.Opt for clothing made with heavier fabrics, which will drape better on your body and highlight your figure.

, Men tend to be drawn to people dressed in red. Opt for red shades when possible, but make sure to use red in ways that work for you. Pay attention to your hair color, though. You may not want to wear too much red if it's not flattering on you.Redheads usually look good in green or blue, so add some green and blue accessories to a red top.Blondes look good in blue or purple. Try wearing red lipstick or a scarf with a purple shirt.
Darker hair, such as brown or black hair, tends to look good in red. You can go all out with a red top, dress, or suit.

, Opt for a haircut that complements your face shape and you feel comfortable with. It’s also important to brush or comb your hair before seeing your guy so it’s obvious that you’ve made an effort.Some men prefer longer hair, so if your hair is already long, allow it to hang down. However, if you're very petite, wearing your hair down may overwhelm your figure. Try a half up, half down style instead.
If you have shorter hair, keep it combed and clean when you go out. You can also try spiking your hair slightly with gel for a more styled look.

, Use a little eyeliner, mascara, and just enough eye shadow to give your eyes some shape. A small amount of flattering makeup can accentuate your best features and get a guy's attention.


Men tend to be drawn to red lipstick. If you wear lipstick, you may want to opt for a red shade., Guys love it when you smell incredible. A simple clean smell is usually all it takes, so simply showering regularly can help. You can also add a little perfume or cologne.Avoid floral scents, which can be too strong. Instead, go for more nature-based scents, such as orchid or soft wood scents. Vanillas can also be subtle but enticing.
Orange scents are also attention grabbing, so look for citrus-scented colognes and perfumes.

Flirt with your crush.,
Drop a hint.,
Ask him for help.,
Invite your crush to a party or group event.,
Ask your crush to hang out one on one.,
Ask him out in a creative way.",How to Ask a Boy out at School2," If you’re feeling bold, Flirt with your crush. There are many ways that you can flirt, both verbally and non-verbally. Flirting shows your crush that you’re interested and can help set the scene for asking him out. Flirting doesn’t have to be extreme; it can be as simple as smiling and laughing at his jokes.


You can use flirtatious body language like tilting your head to the side while smiling, and leaning your body slightly towards him while he’s talking.
If your crush says something funny, try touching his arm while you’re laughing. A little bit of physical contact goes a long way, just don’t overdo it!Remember to maintain flirty and friendly eye contact.

, If you don’t like the idea of being direct, you can indirectly ask your crush out. Bring up an event that you want to go to or a movie that you want to see. This gives your crush a window to ask if you want to go with him. You can say something like, “There’s this new science fiction movie that’s showing tomorrow. I wish I had someone to go with, none of my friends are sci-fi fans!”
Pause after you tell him about the event. This gives him time to ask you to go.
If he doesn’t take the bait and ask you to go with him, you can use a different approach to ask him out. He may not pick up on this subtle approach!

, Another way of indirectly asking out your crush is to ask for his help outside of the context of school. For instance, you could ask him to help you on a homework project or ask him if he could tutor you. This is a way of asking him to hang out without being obvious that you like him.Only ask for help if you really do need help with something. Don’t pretend to be worse at a subject than you really are just to get your crush as a private tutor; starting things off with a lie never ends well.

, If you want to be more direct about asking out your crush, invite him to come to an event with you, whether it be a house party or a group brunch with your friends. Asking him to hang out in the context of a group puts less pressure on you and makes it more of a casual date.This works especially well if you have mutual friends because then your crush is sure to feel at ease.
If you ask him to hang out in a group instead of hanging out alone, there’s the possibility that he may think you just want to be friends. This isn’t a reason not to ask him this way; you may just have to amp up your flirting when you do hang out!

, If you are feeling bold, simply ask your crush to do something with you, whether that means going to a movie together or going to your favorite restaurant.You can simply say, “I was wondering if you want to go to a movie sometime,” or, “There’s a new restaurant that just opened up in town, do you want to check it out with me?”
You don’t need to use the word “date”. Just ask him if he wants to hang out and he will realize that you are asking him out.

, You don’t always have to go the conventional route when you ask out your crush. Consider making a big gesture, especially if you're asking your crush out to an event like homecoming or prom. Making a big gesture can be nerve-wracking but it can also be extremely memorable and effective!Make your crush a cake and decorate it so it says, “Will you go out with me?” or “Will you go to Prom with me?”
Write a song asking your crush out and perform it or record it for your crush.
Carve a message for your crush in the snow!
Make a scavenger hunt for your crush that leads to a note asking him out.
It's best to make a big gesture like this if you and your crush have already been talking for a while and know each other well.

Give yourself a pep talk.",How to Ask a Boy out at School3," On the day you decide to ask out your crush, spend some extra time getting ready in the morning. Knowing that you look your absolute best will help give you the confidence you need to ask out your crush.


Wear an outfit that you know you look good in, but that still is comfortable.
If you're a girl, spend time doing your hair and your makeup. Aim for a look that will last all day rather than one that needs readjusting.
If you're a guy, comb your hair and make sure to wear clothes that look good on you.

, Asking out your crush is definitely a special occasion, but don’t dress in a way that is too formal or over-the-top for school. Aim to be casual and cute, rather than dressing for the red carpet!Also try not to wear clothes that are tighter or more revealing that what your normally wear!

, Think about how you want to approach your crush and when in the day it would be best to talk to him. If you have a general plan, you’re less likely to get flustered or sidetracked when you see him.


You don’t need to have an exact plan of the conversation that you’ll have with him, since conversations are fluid and you can’t plan for everything! Just know where you’re planning to talk to him and how you’re going to ask him to hang out.

, Before you approach your crush, spend a minute pumping yourself up. Think about everything about yourself that makes you proud and that distinguishes you from the other people at school.


Try to visualize yourself confidently going up to your crush and asking him out. Even simple visualization is a powerful tool that can give you courage!Remember that the worst thing that can happen is that he'll say no, and that everyone gets rejected somewhere along the line.

Think about who you have the most fun with.,

Talk with friends and family to get advice.,
Remember that there is no right or wrong decision.",How to Choose Between Multiple Guys," Having fun is one of the most important parts of choosing a guy to date. You want to enjoy spending time with your significant other. If you have a crush on a guy and find out that he’s not any fun, then you’re free to keep looking for someone who is.


Hang out with different guys in different scenarios. That way you get to see if you like sitting at home watching a movie with one better than going to a concert with another, or vice versa.
Going on dates with different guys is a good way to expand your horizons. You might find new favorite hobbies or places to eat while exploring your dating options.;
, You want a guy to treat you like you’re special. If one buy you like helps you with your problems and surprises you with flowers or your favorite snack when you’re sad, he clearly values you. But if another guy you’re crushing on doesn’t even ask how your day was, then you’ll want to pick the guy who shows that he cares about you.

, Guys will usually act differently around you than they do with other people, especially if they like you. Instead, keep an eye on how they talk to waiters, their parents, their friends, or strangers. If one guy is rude to others but sweet to you and the other treats everyone with the same respect, then the second guy is a better choice.

, A good rule of thumb is that if you give people enough time, they’ll show you who they truly are by their words and actions. As long as you don’t have to make a decision right away, you can sit back and observe the guys you like to see who you want to spend more time with.


As time goes by, you might just find out that you don’t like a certain guy anymore. Or instead, you might find yourself falling head over heels for a different boy entirely., Before you begin comparing different guys, get out a paper and pen and write down all the things you like in a guy. Maybe you like a guy with a good sense of style or the ability to make you laugh. Whatever your preferences, gather them all together so you can compare the guys you’re crushing on to your standards.It's always important to include things like good communication, attractiveness, trust, and respect in your list of standards.
Look at your other friends' relationships to see what you do and don't like that they have. This will help you figure out what you think is important in a relationship as well as what are admirable traits and warning signs.

, Get another separate piece of paper for each guy you’re interested in and on one side and write their positive traits on one side and their negatives on the other. It helps to write down the good and bad parts of a person so you can clearly and accurately compare one guy side-by-side to another guy.


Come up with an equal amount of good and bad things for each guy to fairly compare them.
However, if you’re not able to make equal lists, then you’ll be finding out that perhaps there’s one guy with more positives than negatives and your decision just became a lot easier.
All guys are going to have flaws. What’s important is that you’re able to accept the flaws of the guy who you pick., While you’re making all of your lists, make another one that goes into detail about what you and a certain guy have in common. Compatibility and chemistry are important to consider. Decide which guy has the most in common with you.


Common interests can be similar taste in music, movies, clothes, books or videogames, or even things like favorite restaurants or vacation spots.
If you have similar future plans with a certain guy, then the two of you are heading in the same direction in life and could go far together.
To go even deeper, consider who you share similar beliefs and core principles with.
Whoever you choose will be the guy you do things with all the time. It’s important to like some of the same activities., Out of the guys who you are comparing, there may be some who’s better friend material than a boyfriend. For example, one boy might kid around with you and call you “dude” or treat you like “one of the guys.” Go for the guy who shows you kindness like a friend, but treats you like you’re special.Whoever you choose should still be a good friend to you even if you’re in a dating relationship together. You need both romance as well as dependable, loyal friendship in a partner.
Also, out of the guys you’re considering, think about which one you could see dating one of your own girl friends. If you’re willing to let him go because he would make someone else happy, then you’re better off as friends.

, Be careful not to only think about your feelings to make a decision because your emotions change all the time. You need to also think practically about the consequences of picking one guy over another.Think of picking a guy like buying something expensive. Consider the fact that you’re going to end up spending time, money, and emotional investment on the guy you pick.
For example, you’re most likely going to be buying gifts for each other, spending weekends and evenings together, going on dates, and working through tough times together.
You don’t have to be cold-hearted while thinking practically. Remember, you want to pick the guy who you would actually want to spend time and money on.
Don’t make big decisions when you’re feeling super happy or extremely sad. Let any huge emotions pass before committing to anything so that your head is on straight.

, Sometimes you need to step away from a situation and reevaluate things. If you’re hanging out with one guy and trying to choose between him and another, your opinion will be swayed because you’re with one and not the other.Take a hiatus from any and all guys. It can be hard to make a decision when you’re only spending time around boys. Your mind will just spin its wheels thinking about all the options you have in guys.
It’s good to just have a girls’ night without any boys. Or, have an evening to yourself to collect your thoughts by journaling out your concerns and observations about the guys you like.

, Even if you’re just crushing on multiple guys at once, you probably have a goal in mind. Whether you want to casually date, date exclusively, or work towards being married with or without kids, it helps to know what you want. Once you do, you can find out which guys fits with your desires.If a guy specifically says he never wants to have kids and you do, you can probably back off from him since that could cause fights or a breakup in the future.
If you’re not ready to specifically date one guy, you might not have to choose. You can still date a few guys casually. Just be sure you’re clear that you’re not looking for a serious relationship at the moment.

, If you’re feeling guilty for spending too much time with one guy over the other, you might like one of them more than the other. You may not be committed to any one guy alone, but if spending time with other guys feels like you’re cheating on a certain guy then that’s probably who you like the most.


If one of the guys you’re interested in is jealous of the time you spend with other guys, take note.Jealousy can be a red flag in a guy, but it can also be healthy if he likes you enough that he wants your full attention and feelings.
If you find yourself thinking of one guy when you spend time with others, it may be that you can’t get him off your mind because you like him best.

, Outside opinions from people you trust can help you make a decision. Your friends may hate a certain guy you have a crush on because they see him without the rose-colored glasses you might have for him. For example, maybe a friend of yours once dated a guy you’re seeing and she knows that he has bad manners and never offers to pay for dates.Talking to a guy’s friends will also tell you about him.
Getting insight from other people is helpful because you’re going to be biased in your decision making because your feelings can make it hard to see a guy’s flaws past his positives.

, Don’t let the pressure of making a decision get to you. There will always be other guys to crush on or date. If you like two or more different guys, then you at least have multiple options. You won’t be picking the “right” or “wrong” guy, since all guys have positive traits as well as flaws.


It’s always better to have more options so you don’t feel trapped and stuck with one guy.
You always have the option to choose who you like or want to date.
You are always able to walk away from a situation or relationship that doesn’t seem to be working out. Don’t blame yourself for having made a bad decision, simply learn from it and apply what you’ve learned to your next decision."

, A girl will never like a guy who is a jerk. Girls like guys who are respectful, confident, and make them feel good at all times. They hate when a guy is a jerk and/or selfish so try to make the best impression possible.

, If you wear the same clothes that other people wear, you either do it because you want to be like them, or you like their style. Girls hate wannabes that pretend to be someone they are not. Wear the clothes that you like. Act however way you want.

, If a girl is sad, be there to comfort her even if you don't like her. If a girl is being yelled by her boyfriend, step in and stop him. If a girl is being picked on, defend her. This will not only prove that you are a gentleman, but also that you care for them and that you are a good person.

, Look good, smell good, look confident and smile at all times. This will make a really good impression.

Make eye contact before approaching her.,
Start with a simple hello, not some corny pick-up line.,
Introduce yourself with a smile and handshake.,
Ask her for a small favor.,
Walk and talk with confident, strong posture.,
Don't worry so much about failure.",How to Converse With a Girl1," This is a great way to get her attention and make a connection before walking over. Try to catch her eye from across the room, or even as you're walking up towards her. When she sees you and makes eye contact, don't look away. Give a little smile and hold her eyes for 2-3 seconds.


A warm smile and eye contact are the simplest and most effective form of flirting you have. They will put both of you at ease and make conversation much easier.
This is important even if you already know the girl. A smile and eye contact puts people at ease.;
, The best pick-up line you have is ""hey."" Just be yourself and say hello. Pick-up lines come with all sorts of pressure and memorization, and they are as likely to backfire as work. Unless you're naturally witty and can come up with something clever on the spot, just walk over and say hello.


""Hey, how are you?""
""Hi, can I buy you a drink?""
""Hello. Mind if I sit here?""

, Say who you are and ask her name in return. Keep it calm and casual for now, no matter what you goals are (making a new friend, a date, asking a question, etc.). Girls get hit on all of the time, so don't give off a romantic vibe right off the bat unless you want to be batted away. Keep the conversation friendly and relaxed with a normal introduction.


""It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm ______.""
""Hi, my name is _________. What's yours?""
""I'm ______. What's your name?""

, Known as the ""Ben Franklin Effect,"" it turns out that people like you more when they do a favor for you. This weird little paradox is a great way to break the ice. You could, for example:


Ask her to watch your bag or stuff for a moment.
Ask her to pass the salt, napkins, etc.
Ask her opinion to settle an argument, get directions, etc., Confidence is key, but if you don't have it you can always fake it until you make it. Exuding confidence is all about body positioning and language, so just remember these tips until they come naturally:


Keep your shoulders back and your chin up.
Your spine should be straight and upright at all times.
Make eye contact when talking or listening.
Talk slowly and clearly -- you're in no rush to get the words out.
Sit tall, with your feet firmly planted on the ground.
Resist jittery movements, tics, or constant movement., If you walk up to a girl and say ""hey,"" then get rejected, you've actually lost very little. She goes her way, you go yours, and life moves on. But if she says yes, you've started a potentially lasting and wonderful relationship. Think of conversing with girls as a low-risk, high-reward situation to get over your butterflies."

Ask broad, general questions to get the ball rolling.,
Ask her what she likes.,
Don't be afraid of your own ideas and opinions.,
Pay her an honest compliment.,
Talk about things you care about instead of trying to be someone you're not.,
Know that there is no ""right"" thing to say.",How to Converse With a Girl2," When there is nothing to talk about and you feel lost, the best thing to do is just get a question out there. Let her do the talking, as she'll naturally gravitate towards things and topics she is comfortable with, giving you a chance to see what she is about. Some good entry topics include:


""What do you do for a living?""
""Are you from around here?""
""What do you like to talk about that isn't work?""
""What's your major/what do you want to study?"", There is no reason to be sneaky, trying to figure out her interests on the sly. Just come right out and ask her -- ""what are you interested in?"" You'll open up an entire catalog of possible conversation topics. All girls are different and trying to memorize scripts or perfect lines won't work. Just let things develop organically depending on her, and your, interests.


""What do you enjoy doing?""
""If you could be doing anything with your life, what would it be?""
""What would make you super happy right now?"", Dating is a two-way street. While you want to be a gentleman, you don't need to pander to her and play the ""perfect boy"" role. Be yourself, even if (especially if) you disagree with her. Good conversation requires two unique people, not a girl and a spineless mirror agreeing with her every word. Don't ever feel like you need to lie or temper your own opinion to avoid freaking her out., Compliments will get you far, but only if you really mean them. People can smell you out a mile away if you're just trying to score brownie points, so don't. If you see or hear something that you admire, let her know. True, unique compliments make everyone feel good, opening them up to further conversation. Don't be a pick-up artist, just be a nice person.


""I have never seen eyes like yours. Those are beautiful.""
""That's a great point -- I had never thought about that like that.""
""You actually did that? No way -- that took some serious courage/brains/strength."", Don't pretend to like a subject or be an expert if you're not into something. Talk about the things you love. If you're having fun in the conversation she will have some fun too. If you realize you don't have much to add to her favorite topics, then don't lie or worry that you have nothing in common -- just show some genuine curiosity.


""I've never talked to a physicist before -- what drew you to the subject?""
""I don't actually know much about hiking. Quickly: where are the top three places you've hiked?
""I can't profess to be an expert in opera. Where should I start listening?""

, Honestly, having a random guy approach you and start a conversation isn't easy either. She does not have all the answers, and she is not judging you for your every word. Having a conversation with a stranger is not like in the movies. It may be awkward or stilted at first. But that doesn't mean it is not going well! Keep asking questions, smiling, and chatting -- things will warm up.


You always run out of things to say when you get nervous and self-conscience. Just keep the ball rolling instead of worrying about the perfect words -- anything is better than nothing."

Enjoy the moments of silence; don't worry about the inevitable awkwardness.,
Giver her your phone number instead of asking for hers.",How to Converse With a Girl3," People, girls included, like to hear themselves talk. Most importantly, everyone wants to feel like they are being listened to. If you really want to converse with a girl, you need to be willing to listen well to everything she has to say. Some good tips include:


Keeping eye contact as she speaks.
Nodding along to big points or stories.
Asking short, relevant questions every few minutes., If you can make her laugh, the conversation will last until you're out of words. Laughter brings people together, and the minute one or both of you are laughing you've made a connection worth building upon. Don't feel like you need to come prepared with jokes -- gentle ribbing and observations about the surroundings or the things she says are enough.


A little teasing is a great way to flirt. Just keep it innocent, only teasing small things and stories that don't mean much.
You don't have to be a comedian, and cracking jokes every second can be off-putting. Just try and slide some humor in here and there., The more you talk, the deeper your connection will get. Of course you can take it too far -- there is no need to speak when you wake up and before bed every day -- but, in general, the more you talk the closer you'll get. The conversation will only get easier with practice.


Don't feel like you always need to tell her what is up. Treat her like any other friend you want to catch up and talk to., All conversation hits lulls here and there, but that is fine. Good friends and couples sit in silence all of the time. Sometimes, though is seems off, sharing a quiet moment with someone without commenting on how ""awkward"" it is can bring you much closer to each other., This is a brilliantly subtle move that takes the pressure off of her, and you. If you feel a connection as things are winding down, give her your number. Tell her that you really loved talking and that you'd be happy to do it again if she wanted. If she offers her number back, great. If not, it is in her court to call you again, letting you see how she felt after your conversation."

Find your self-confidence.,
Believe that you are physically attractive.,
Manage your expectations.",How to Be Big and Still Get a Girl1," Most people are attracted to someone who has a healthy self-esteem. If you believe you're the shiz, you'll act like you're the shiz and girls will believe you're the shiz and want to find out why you're the shiz.


Don't try to become confident by getting the attention of girls. Not only will this never truly give you faith in yourself as a person, you're setting yourself up for a fall. Even the most handsome guy will go through dry patches but, if their confidence is founded on something stronger than their attractiveness, the rest of their life won't suffer and they'll come out the other side fighting.;
, Yes, you don't have a six pack but you might have great skin, hair, eyes or height. Never underestimate the power of such details.


Remember that you may not think of yourself as the most handsome man to walk the earth but there will always be several guys who would give their right arm to look like you. They are not always the people you would expect either.
You're pretty unlikely to be the heaviest man around. Guess what? There have been guys and girls much bigger than you that have found flings and true love.

, You have to cut potential girls a little leeway. Go for someone you find attractive, definitely, but accept that they might not always be a 10. Look past the physical and into the character and soul of the person you fancy. Not only will your insistence on finding someone beautiful inside and out make you more attractive to girls, it will make sure that you find someone truly special and worthy of you.


This goes for every guy and girl you'll ever meet and everyone realises it, sooner or later. It has nothing to do with your size or level of attractiveness.

Be funny. Humor is a huge part of love and a trait many girls find very attractive.

Self-deprecating humor is great but make sure not to go overboard and risk losing her respect. If all she ever hears about you is how clumsy/foolish/unintelligent/greedy/awkward you are, she'll believe it.


Be kind and sensitive towards others. Swoon!

, White is fine, tan is better. Visibly it will take fatty pounds off you and highlight your muscles - the very reason so many partygoers and bodybuilders plaster on the stuff.

, If you're reading this article, you clearly feel that your size is holding you back. Your doctor may advise you to change your diet and/or take some light exercise. However, only attempt to lose weight under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Feeling in control of your weight will give you a big confidence boost.


Girls will be attracted to someone who has the guts to tackle such an obstacle. It develops and shows a strength of character that will stand you in good stead in many parts of life, not least the romantic side of it.

Remember all healthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and communication.",How to Be in a Relationship Without Your Parents Knowing1," Decide if it's actually a good idea to keep your relationship from your parents. Do your parents disapprove of your relationship because they are strict, protective or worrisome? Does culture, religion, or an age difference factor into their disapproval?While your parents have the benefit of life experience, only you know what your relationship is worth.


Talk to your friends and support system. Remember that if you keep your relationship a secret, the greater the potential problems will be when it comes to light. You have a support system to help guide you in the right direction.;
, If you want to pursue your relationship despite knowing that your parents will disapprove, let your partner know why you think that this is the right course of action. Your partner may feel less important and bring resentment to your relationship if you don't clarify your stance. The longer you hide, the more difficult it is going to be.Your partner may have a valid argument if she has been through this situation before. For example, just because it is your first interracial relationship, it may not be the first time for your partner. She may have practical advice to help you understand where your parents are coming from and, above all else, having her support can help ease your stress.

, It may be difficult to hear negative opinions about someone you care about but sometimes your parents may have a better perspective on long-term outcomes. Depending on your dynamic with your parents, they may have trouble articulating their disapproval.


Relationships with parents can be complicated. It may be difficult to be open and honest but keep your communication respectful so as not to escalate the situation. For example, while you may think that you are hiding your emotions, you actually may be coming off passive-aggressive or snarky.

, Whether you are trying to strengthen your relationship with your partner or maintain the relationship with your parents, trust and respect have to be present for a lasting relationship. If you plan on hiding your relationship, ask yourself why sacrificing your parent's trust is the only option.Physical and emotional well-being should not be sacrificed for anyone, including your parents or partner.


Will your parents become physically or verbally abusive if they found out about your relationship? Is any aspect of your relationship a conflict to your parents’ beliefs? If your parents’ disapproval is based on prejudice or if their reaction is abusive, seek professional help. Your mental and physical health is your first priority.

, Your guy absolutely loves it when you try to hug or cuddle him. Don't think, 'Well maybe my guy doesn't like it because he's so awkward'. He's probably a really shy guy.

Live in the moment.",How to Be Confident Around Girls if You're Shy," Characteristics of being shy can be manifested in different ways under different circumstances for each individual. Knowing what situations cause your feelings of shyness can help you address the symptoms of shyness when they occur:

Being hesitant to speak up in social situations
Mumbling or talking softly
Avoiding social gatherings
Being overly talkative due to nervousness.;
, Understanding that almost everyone feels shy at some point can help you overcome your own feelings of shyness. It is natural to be nervous under uncertain circumstances. When you can mentally prepare for a situation it is less likely to make you nervous and shy because you know what to expect. Plan ahead and you’ll be ready to take on challenges as they are no longer unknowns.

, If you are constantly saying negative things about yourself in your head, then you will have an extremely hard time ever feeling confident. Even though it isn’t true, telling yourself phrases like “I’m just socially awkward” or “Nobody will ever like me, I’m too weird” will make you believe you are not worthy of attention from a girl. Instead create a mantra that builds you up:

“I’m awesome!”
“I like talking to everyone!”
“I am going to meet new people today.”

, Many times shyness is a result of perceived perceptions. People think that others see them a certain way and make that their reality, when in fact, no one is having the thoughts you believe they are. Take people for their word and don’t worry about what someone might be thinking.

, Instead of centering the conversation around you, talk to and about other people. Avoid starting sentences with “I” and talk about the other person’s interests instead. If you’re not thinking about yourself, it is less likely you will find yourself feeling shy!

, When you are happy and enjoying yourself it is much less likely that you will feel shy. Let yourself have fun and don’t be afraid to relax.

, It is important that you feel good about your clothing and style to present yourself in the best light. It doesn’t matter what you wear as long as it feels good to you. There is no one style that says “I’m confident,” but if you believe that you wear it well, you will!

, Being able to discuss a topic in detail will give you the confidence to begin a conversation with many different people. Learn more than just the headlines of a news story and you can discuss the details with several groups of individuals.

, Communication is about so much more than words. Sometimes what we say is less important that how we say it. Make sure that you are letting the people you talk to know you care about them by connecting with them visually throughout your conversation.

, Start off by making a point to say “Hi” to a girl you want to talk to. Open the door for future conversations by taking small steps. Don’t expect to be the head cheerleader’s best friend if you’ve never talked to her before. You need to build up confidence by introducing yourself to lots of people to get comfortable talking to lots of girls.

, Watch your facial expressions and think about what responses you would have in a particular conversation. Knowing what you might say can help you prepare for a great conversation. Just a simple smile at yourself each day can do wonders for your self esteem!

, When you introduce yourself to a girl, let her know that you are trying to overcome being shy. Many girls find guys who are shy extremely attractive. Let your shyness be a way in and not something that keeps you out. Try one of these opening lines:


""There's so many people here, it's hard to find someone to talk to because I'm kinda shy.""
""Can I sit with you, I'm shy and just need a quiet place to relax.""
""I'm terrible at meeting new people, can we pretend we know each other so it isn't so awkward?""

, When you are having a conversation use the fact that you are shy as a way to poke fun at yourself.

""Being shy always makes me feel small, do I look little to you?
""I would tell you a joke, but I'm too shy and always mess up the punch lines""
""If I weren't shy it would be a lot easier to find out what you like""

, Sometimes having a friend by your side can make it much easier to approach a girl. Ask a friend you trust to help introduce you to new people and start conversations.

, Don't worry about what might happen in the future of your conversation; focus on the here and now. It is easier for the conversation to flow if you are concentrating on the current topic and not planning the future.

Be mature.,
Understand the risks of premarital sex.,
Avoid PDA moments.,
Buy one new cell phone.,
Tell your partner not to post anything on social media sites or send instant messages.,
Have a cover.,
Hide gifts.",How to Be in a Relationship Without Your Parents Knowing2," Your parents will always be protective so show them that you are old enough to handle the responsibilities of a relationship. Firstly, show your parents that you are responsible and can follow all rules. If your parents think you are too young for a relationship, be on time, do your chores, and study. If you can gain your parents trust, then your parents will soon realize that you are mature enough to handle a relationship.

, Parents often forbid relationships for fear of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infection. Ensure that you and your partner truly understand these risks. There is a real possibility that if you are not prepared and you do have an unwanted pregnancy or contract an std, your parents may not be there to support you.You may not agree with your parents rules but communicate with your partner and respect each other's boundaries to ensure you are both prepared and safe.


Know that you should be respected by your significant other and that they should listen to your choices. Compromise is vital in a relationship but this is one area where neither party should have to compromise their beliefs. Know that if you are eager to take the relationship to another level but your partner isn't ready, you have a duty to respect their choice. Never pressure your partner.

, Be discreet about your affection. You never know who is watching. A trusted friend may accidentally tell your parents in passing, not knowing that your relationship is a secret.


Stealing kisses in public and other forms of PDA may seem harmless but remember that if your parents find out they may think that your relationship has already crossed further into the intimacy threshold.

, If it is possible to do so, owning a separate cell phone can help you on concealing information, but please remember that you must hide your new phone properly or you will be in trouble. If you are not able to buy one new phone, put a password in your original cell phone and computer. If your parents know your passwords, change them so that you can message your partner

with impunity. However, if you have been using a family computer with no password, it will be suspicious if you suddenly put one on.


Delete all the messages on your phone when you sleep or leave your phone unattended.
Erase browsing history after you have been online. However, this may look suspicious if the browser history has never been erased on a shared device.
In case your parents check your phone, either don’t put your partner’s number on your phone or use your partner’s nickname or surname instead of his actual first name. It is also possible to use the masculine or feminine form of their name. For example, Brian becomes Brianna and Stephanie becomes Stephen.

, If you have a social media account or use other instant messaging apps, your parents could check up on you or hear from someone else with access to your account.


Create an alternate account that you can use to be romantic with your partner. This is a very useful tool when dealing with long distance relationships.

, You can ask a trustworthy friend to corroborate stories to your parents if you're on a date. Such a friend can also be a great cover-up for phone calls or texts.


If your friend has concerns about your partner or refuses to continue being your alibi, heed her advice. It’s easy to think that one source is wrong but if multiple sources are telling you not to continue your relationship, perhaps it’s best to listen to their logic.

, Hide all the gifts you receive from your partner or keep gifts at her place. You're going to draw attention from your parents if you suddenly lock your closet or room. You can also agree to treat each other to lunches or movies rather than giving physical gifts.

Prevent your friends from commenting about your relationship to anyone.,
Use multiple social media accounts.,
Set up a shell email account.,
Adjust your privacy settings on social media.,
Provide false information when creating shared social media accounts or when together in a public gathering.,
Hide your emotions.,
Keep track of what you are telling everyone.,
Frame your partner as a platonic relationship.,
Change your routine.",How to Be in a Relationship Without Your Parents Knowing3," Whether it's telling people in passing or posting on each other's social media pages, convey how catastrophic it would be if their innocent comment made its way to your parents. Social media can be especially dangerous because you never know who is connected to whom.


Ask your friends politely not to post any incriminating comments or pictures. It may be a wise idea not to let anyone take any pictures when you are in a group setting with your significant other.

, The great thing about social media is that the larger sites are free. Set up as many accounts as you need to cover your tracks. Remember your password and only log on when using a device not shared with your parents., Not would a fake email account be advantageous because your parents won't recognize it, but you should also use it to set up your fake social media account. Remember that your parents can search for you on social media based on your email info., All social media will give you an option to filter what information you share with the public. Go to the Settings Menu and set up your profile so that only you and your partner have access to it. You can also select a few friends to be able to view your profile if you deem them trustworthy.You will have the opportunity to filter your updates and postings so that you can block your parents from seeing. However, the best way to block your parents from seeing is not to post anything incriminating at all.

, Remember that your parents can search social media sites via your date of birth, phone number, last name, school, or job. Don't make the mistake of creating a false account without ensuring every detail won't lead back to you.Change your profile name completely. Don't use your middle name, your name spelled backward, or the name of your dog. Anything remotely close to you may end up giving you away in the long run. It's better to exercise extreme caution.

, If you get into an argument with your partner, try not to show your parents how angry or sad you are. Don't emote in public for it to get back to your parents. Find an outlet to release your emotions. It may be difficult to be unable to share your emotions so research ways to prevent emotional outbursts.


For example, taking up boxing may work to vent frustration while listening to upbeat music in headphones may be enough to cheer you up after an argument with your partner. Only you know how to handle your emotions.

, If you are lying to a lot of people, it will become difficult to keep track of all the details. Keep your stories consistent and try to keep it as simple as possible. The more details you add, the more difficult it will be to remember them all.

, Don't let your parents get suspicious you are hiding a relationship from them by letting them know that you have a platonic relationship with your partner that demands your time. Introduce them openly and talk about them the same as any other platonic relationship in your life.


For example, if you introduce them as your coworker, you can talk about work related issues and meetings and how you and your partner have supported one another through deadlines.

, Meet your partner at places that you would not normally go to and that your parents are not aware of. Change your social calendar so that you leave no chance of getting caught by your parents or someone who could tell your parents. Better yet, find out your parents' schedule. Not only will you be able to have piece-of-mind knowing where your parents are but you will also be able to meet your partner as far away from them as you can.

Ask yourself if you feel like yourself around your partner.,
Keep perspective.,
Understand any power dynamics.",How to Be in a Relationship Without Your Parents Knowing4," Your partner should accept you for who you are and your parents may not be able to see beyond the age difference. Once your parents see that your relationship is healthy and that you are a better person for it, it will be easier for them to see beyond the age gap., It’s easy to get swept up in the allure of dating someone older or younger than you. Look ahead and see if the age difference will affect you in any way. Your parents may be fearful that the age gap may widen as your relationship continues.A difference in age may be more of a big deal if you are younger. Your parents may be fearful that you are growing up too soon or that an older partner is taking advantage of you. Take their perspective into account when continuing your relationship.

, If your partner is your teacher or boss, it’s prudent to know the rules. Your parents may rest easier knowing that everyone is protected from any legal actions."

Your closest friend may find out about it, but try to avoid telling anyone else about your status as a side chick. Do not tag your partner on social media, and do not invite the person to holiday gatherings or vacations.It may be tempting to tell people about your relationship—especially if feelings get involved. Decide if you are willing to maintain a relationship that can’t be celebrated with friends and family.;
, Understand that your partner has a significant other that they have to put first. It is likely that your partner will go to great lengths to keep their partner from finding out about you, so expect plans to change at the spur of the moment. You might have plans for dinner, but your partner may cancel at the last minute if their significant other needs them.It will not help to express frustration over canceled plans. Canceled plans will probably be a common occurrence.

, Your partner has not left their significant other for a reason. There could be many reason for this. For example, your partner may have built a life with their partner that would be difficult to get out of. Or, your partner wants a future with their significant other and just wants to be with you for a fun and relaxing time. Avoid asking about where the relationship is going. You may be disappointed with the answer.If you do want to be in a relationship with a future, consider moving on to someone that can put you first.

, Try not to think about the past or future. Focus on the present. Enjoy the time you have with your partner. When you are apart, don’t think about or ask what is going on with them., It is completely natural to develop feelings for someone that you are having a romantic relationship with. Falling in love, however, will likely end up in heartache. Try to keep your feelings light, even if it seems difficult to do. Feelings can’t be controlled, but make an effort to not fully invest in the relationship.If you do fall in love, bring it up to your partner. If they react negatively, it may be best to move on. You can tell them, “I think I’m starting to develop strong feelings for you. Do you feel the same? If not, how do you feel about what I’ve just said?”

, Don’t always be the first to text or seek them out. The person likely doesn't want to have more than one main significant other. They already have one, and your role is to be something different. You should be a person they come to for a good time. Give your partner breathing room when you are not together.Go out with your friends. Have a good time. Don't worry about checking in with them every five minutes, or they will start to think you want something more.

, When he texts you, keep the conversation interesting. A side chick's main responsibility is to keep things fun and exciting. Giving him short answers and acting uninterested will make him wish he were doing something else, or even just hanging out with his main partner. Tell them funny stories. Ask how they are feeling. Surprise them with plan for something to do.Try to maintain a positive attitude. An escape from reality is likely a large part of why your partner is with you.

, Consider your time together as the only time that your partner is your business. You shouldn’t ask questions like ""Where were you?"" or ""Why didn’t you call me?"" and ""Why are you always so busy?” if you expect to keep the relationship going. These are not your concerns.You got yourself into this situation, and there's no point in acting jealous or surprised when you already knew the score getting into it. Jealousy will only make the situation more difficult for both parties involved.

, If the person cares enough, they might celebrate these events with you the day before or after, but for the most part, don’t expect anything like a gift or acknowledgment. These days are usually saved and reserved for the main partner. It may be safe to text him to wish them a happy New Year/Christmas/birthday, but a phone call should not be made.Do not try to contact them on Valentine’s Day.

, Your partner is likely still having sexual relations with their significant other. They may or may not be using protection with their main partner. If you are having sexual relations with them, make sure to be safe. Use contraceptives that work best for you. Get tested immediately if you fear that your sexual health is at risk.Ask your partner if they have a history with STDs. This may be a sensitive topic to bring up, but it’s an important one. Ask if they have ever been tested for sexually transmitted diseases. If they say no, ask if they would be willing to be tested. You can offer to be tested with them.

, Most cases of cheating get found out eventually. Don’t be surprised if your partner ends their relationship with you suddenly, or if you are contacted by their main partner. Go into the relationship knowing that you will eventually be found out, and it can’t last forever. Decide how you will react if you are caught.Do not react in a disrespectful manner if you are contacted by their main partner. Their significant other is probably feeling hurt and betrayed, and it is not their fault that they have been cheated on.

, It’s very unlikely that all parties will leave the situation without being hurt. You, your partner, and their significant other will probably be very hurt when the situation is revealed. Decide if you are willing to hurt yourself and other people. Understand that you may be playing a role in breaking up a relationship or family., Is this relationship a fling that is not meant to last long, or is it something that you want to maintain for as long as possible? It is important to stay in the present while with your partner, but at some point, you have to consider your future. Think about where you would like to see yourself in the next stage of your life. If it is not as a side chick, then it is best to end the relationship.Keep in mind that if the situation comes out, it could hurt your career (if the person is a coworker) and your relationships with friends and family.

, A secretive relationship will take an emotional toll on you eventually. Do not stay in the situation if you begin to feel unhappy. Your well-being comes first. Express to your partner that you are unhappy and would like a change. If they do not offer a solution, don’t stick around with the hope that things will improve.


Something you can say to your partner is “I’m starting to feel uncomfortable in this situation, and I’m not as happy as I used to be. Is there anything we can do to solve this problem, or is it better that I move on?”

You especially want to wash sweaty areas, like your arm pits, behind your knees, and between your legs., While you are in the shower, use shampoo and conditioner. Check the labels to make sure that alcohol is not a component of your hair care product; this will dry your hair out.

Try to avoid blinking at a rapid pace, so girls can get a good look at them. Push your hair to the side so it doesn't cover your eyes up. Never approach a girl while still wearing sunglasses. If you have them on, take them off slowly, and reveal your cute eyes., You don't have to buy a large, expensive present.

, Singing is the way to a girl's heart. You can sing a song perfectly, and win her over. Or you can purposely sing bad, which is really cute indeed. If you are in a car with her, and she is singing her song, join in. Sing really loudly, and get into it. You can even dance along a little bit, showing her you are willing to open up., Get out on the dance floor and light it up. Most guys these days simply ""grind,"" which gets the job done, but isn't that cute. Feel free to dance badly. Flail your arms, kick your legs, or simply move side to side. Grab her arms and swing them back and forth. Hold her hand up high, and let her twirl around. The possibilities are nearly endless. The added benefit of this step is that the worse you are at dancing, the cuter you are."

Surround yourself with people who are supportive.,

By surrounding yourself with caring and respectful people, you can rise above your parents’ closed-mindedness if they are unwilling to change., Assure your partner that they are cared for and that you don’t agree with your parents but don’t want to lose your relationship with them. Build his confidence that your parents' opinions won’t have a negative impact on your relationship. Let him know that he is more important than your parent’s approval and that the secrecy is temporary.


You don’t need to put a time limit but it can be expected that your partner may give you an ultimatum. No one wants to be in a relationship that their partner is ashamed to be in. Be prepared to choose between telling your parents or losing your partner.

, This isn’t about who is right or wrong, this is about how you define family and your own values. Everyone will have to learn to respect and accept one another if you want to have them in your life. Be strong in your own values and communicate respectfully that you are unwilling to compromise that.


Hiding your relationship should not be permanent. It may take time for your parents to realize that only you know what’s best for you. If it means losing your parents, that is for them to decide. Being true to yourself is what's most important for your mental, emotional and physical health.

Strike up a conversation.,
Ask her open-ended questions.,
Take interest in her interests.,
Take your time.,
Increase the amount of time you spend together.",How to Flirt With a Shy Girl1," Keep this interaction casual - she could be intimidated if you come on too strong. Introduce yourself if this is your first time talking to her. You can point out something you saw her doing that you also like to do or compliment her.


You might say something as simple as “Hi, my name is Michael. I see you at the library every day, what are you studying?” or “You gave a great presentation! What inspired you to research that topic? My name is Sarah, by the way.”;
, This will keep the conversation going and allow her to open up and share things about herself. You can ask her anything from how her day was to the kind of music she listens to what her favorite restaurant is. Figure out which questions to ask depending on the context of the conversation - you don’t want to ask a series of completely unrelated questions in a row, as this could confuse her.


Ask questions that start with “how” or “why” to elicit more detailed responses.
Take note of her interests so that, if you get to the point of dating, you can arrange dates that are exciting for her.

, Figure out what she likes, from bands to movies to hobbies to sports, to draw her out of her shell. You can do this by asking her questions about herself during your conversations and also by sharing with her your likes and dislikes. Figure out areas of common interest and chat her up about them. Recognize that she may give short answers and not open up at first. However, if you give her time and are persistent, she will probably warm up to and even express excitement about talking to you about her interests.


One way to talk to the girl you like about common interests is to say: “I loved Finding Dory too! It was so fun to see all the characters again. What was your favorite part of the movie?”
If you go to the same school, you might even ask her for help with a homework problem. This will give you an opportunity to spend more time together.

, Patience is key when flirting with a shy girl. Stay in her comfort zone by being friendly, asking her questions about herself and sharing details about yourself, and showing just enough interest in her that she doesn’t shy away from you. If at first she is only comfortable saying “hi” to you, spend a week doing just that. The next week, ask her a question about her day. Gradually increase the amount of communication.

, Find excuses to be near her, such as sitting with her at lunch or next to her in class or working with her on a project. If you know she goes to the gym in the morning, go at the same time as her so that you can talk, even if just to say a quick hello. You want her to see you as a regular presence in her life.


Be careful not to overdo it by going wherever she does. All you need to do to create a sense of familiarity is pick a few strategic moments every week to be near her and make your presence known.

Appreciate the other person's friends and loved ones. They are friends and loved for a reason. Find your own reasons to like and support the people who this person finds important.

, Sometimes people just need to be heard. Allow the other person to express their grief or concern and avoid the urge to solve the problem. Just listening comforts and affirms them without making them feel like they are the problem.

Connect via social media.,
Catch up outside of school.,
Be friendly.,

Flirt in passing.,
Start flirting when with him.",How to Flirt With a High School Guy," That means paying attention to your appearance and smile. Put your hair in a style that you know suits you, ensure that your teeth are clean and sparkling and that you've got pleasant breath. Looking lovely will give you a burst of confidence. The best confidence will come with flashing your smile, to show him that you're approachable.;
, Let him see that you're not afraid of anyone bothering you or trying to boss you around. You're in charge of your destiny. He'll like that.

, Don't assume he wants to waltz you off to a wild romance before he even gets to know you. Besides, after spending time with him, he might not be as interesting as you once thought... or he might be. You don't know either way yet, so give yourself the time and space to really find out.


Offer to do homework or study group together. It's a good way of connecting.
Join the same club he's in, provided it's interesting enough to you.

, Sit next to him in class, or at lunch, and make an effort to start a conversation. If you haven’t spoken to him yet, take the opportunity to introduce yourself. Find some things that you have in common, and mention something interesting about yourself so that he remembers you. The next time you see him, even if it’s in the corridors or outside of school, make eye contact, smile and say hello.

, Go up to him, with your confident self projecting forward, and begin a conversation.


Ask to hang out with him. It doesn't need to be a date, just talking in the school yard is cool enough.
Suggest you hang out in the library, common room or classroom if it's cold or raining.

, Let him know you'd like to be friends on Facebook, Instagram, wherever it's cool right now. If you're already making headway with forming a good friendship, he'll be keen.

, Although school can be a lot of fun (at times, when you’re not falling asleep in math), you can’t really get to know someone that well until you’ve spent time with them outside of school. You can play it safe and arrange to see him with a group of mutual friends (for example, going to movies or hanging out at the park), or you can be bold and suggest you do something together as just the two of you. Keep it casual, unless you’re ready to ask him out on a date.


A good way to broach the subject is to ask him to help you with something – homework, sports, or even a hobby of his that you’d like to try. Be creative and find ways to spend a bit of quality alone-time with him.

, Be friendly with him but also to everyone around you. This lets him see that you're interesting to everyone and interested in them as people who matter. This does not mean flirt with other people; it means showing that you connect well, remember people's names and say nice things to other people.

, Show your sense of humor when you talk to him, and feel free to joke around and be playful when you’re with him. He’ll see you as a carefree and fun girl to be around – characteristics of a good girlfriend. However, make sure that you don’t become “one of the guys” – keep your fun side flirty and feminine.


Laugh a lot; it gives the impression you're carefree and open.
Don't be afraid to show him your darker sense of humor. If it's as dark, dirty or macabre as his, good for you, that'll be something to share in common.
Avoid giggling, he-hawing or laughing at things that really aren't funny. The worst you can do is titter at things he says –– if it wasn't funny, just make it politely clear that he needs to up his game in the joke department.

, When you see him in the hall, stop and smile. Flutter your eyes. Check him out. Blow a kiss or two or give him a wink. Then move on.


If he automatically likes you, he will start looking for you. If he backs away or looks nervous, realize that he might not be the approachable type or he might find open displays of affection overwhelming at this stage.

, When it becomes clear that he is really the guy you'd like to get closer to, and he has shown some interest, you can invest some effort in flirting with him.

]

Sit next to him whenever you can. Brush against him often, touching his arm, shoulder and head. Touch his leg with yours; if he doesn't move away, then touch it again harder and this time and leave it there. If he doesn't move, he likes you!
Another way is when talking to him, lightly punch his arm and laugh at his joke, or tap his hand and if he doesn't resist, go so far as to hold his hand!
Smile at him more often, excluding others around you. If he smiles back, look away now and then, so that you don't overdo it.
Gaze into his eyes now and then. If he does the same, smile and let your eyes grow larger big (you can even use eyeliner to create an amazing effect), then look down, then back up at him!
Blow air kisses to him now and then.
Leave little notes for him in his desk. Leave private notes in his social media account. Text him sweet nothings out of the blue.
Compliment him. Say something such as ""your eyes are nice"" or ""you're really smart"". (Try not to just make up stuff though, don't lie. There's something good and amazing in everyone, no point in inventing it.)
Play off his mood. If he tells a joke, laugh as much as it looks like he needs, or just a tad more. If he's sad, leave him alone yet tell him you care.

Approach her alone.,
Compliment her.,
Suggest an activity you can do together.",How to Flirt With a Shy Girl2," One-on-one contact is better for flirting with a shy girl than approaching her when you’re with a group, which might intimidate her. Separate from your group of friends and find some time to talk to the girl you like when you’re both alone.


If you’re in school, this may mean talking to her by her locker or as she’s walking to her car.

, She may be shy, but she’ll likely appreciate your taking notice of her new haircut or her cute shirt. Even better, point out a non-physical attribute about her that you like, such as her kindness, cheerfulness, or her sense of humor. This will build up her confidence and make her feel more secure around you., This will allow you to spend more time with her and to build up your relationship as she gets to know you more. Suggest something simple like grabbing lunch together during recess or going out to a movie with friends, if you see that she’s comfortable in groups.


Don’t aim for date-like situations. All you want to do for now is find opportunities to allow you to get to know each other. Dating, for a shy girl, may be a concept that she needs to warm up to, and warming up includes getting to know the person she might go on a date with.

Break the touch barrier.,
Keep your body language open.,
Hold eye contact.",How to Flirt With a Shy Girl3," Lightly touch her arm, shoulder, or hand as you speak - just a second or two will start to get your message across. Touch her gently when she says something you agree with or says something funny., Face her with your entire body and lean in to listen closer if she speaks softly. This will get her comfortable with less physical distance between the two of you. However, if she pulls away, pull away as well so as not to seem intimidating.


Refrain from crossing your arms. If she’s paying close attention to your movements, she could mistake this as you showing a lack of interest.

, Do this for just a few seconds, just enough that she catches you looking and looks away. Eye contact is a powerful tool to make her intrigued by you. At first you may just exchange quick glances, but over time you can extend the length of your eye contact if she reciprocates.

Notice whether she flirts back.,
Be consistent.,
Give her time.,
Flirt via text message or social media.,
Vary your flirting style.,
Identify whether she likes you or not.",How to Flirt With a Shy Girl4," A shy girl won't just flirt with anyone, so you can be sure she is interested in you if you see that she tries to flirt back. She may flirt back by making more frequent eye contact, liking your statuses on social media, initiating small talk, or displaying flirty body language cues., Somebody who is shy may need reinforcement that you are serious about pursuing them. What you want to do is send her multiple consistent signals so that she is sure that you are flirting with her.


If you said hi to her yesterday, say hi to her today. If you smiled at her when you crossed paths in the cafeteria, smile at her again so that she doesn’t think you were just being polite. Try to make eye contact multiple times. She will get your hints if you repeat them a few times.

, It may take her time, like a few weeks or even a month or two, to warm up to the idea of flirting or being flirted with. She may take longer to recognize and acknowledge your cues.


Set an amount of time you're willing to try to break the ice. For example, tell yourself that if after two months of you flirting with her you are still not spending more time with each other, you will either move on or try a more direct flirting technique.

, If you notice that she’s not responding to your body language cues, try flirting with her via text or social media. She may be less comfortable with or less used to in-person conversations than with replying through Facebook Messenger. Use texting as a way for her to get used to making small talk and having conversations with you. This way, she might open up in person as she becomes more comfortable with you over time.

, See how she reacts to your different flirting methods. She may totally shut down when you try to hold eye contact but be talkative when you ask her a question about her hobbies. The goal is to be flexible and cater your flirting style to her comfort zone. You can then gradually move communication to a more mutual ground.

, If she’s interested and receptive to your body language cues, she will likely respond with open body language. She may also get nervous around you and blush or stammer, both of which could mean that she’s into you. If she is nervous because she likes you, she might tease you or throw a joke into the conversation.


If she doesn’t like you, you will see her become uncomfortable with your gestures. Her body language will be closed, she might not make eye contact, and she might be even quieter than usual.

Make sure you don't get into trouble in class, being yelled at by a teacher makes you easy to tease.

,
Don't constantly try to be funny, girls will think you're trying to get attention.

,
Try to notice the girl's group of friends, because girls are heavily persuaded by their friends.,
Smile and say hi in the corridor if you are friends with her, if you do this and you're not friends she will be surprised and this could make you seem weird.

,
If you're not already friends with her then just smile and make a 3 second eye contact when she walks by, girls like it when they know they're noticed.

,
If you sit next to her in class, be friendly and don't create an awkward silence, but also don't seem like you are in love with her, this will freak her out.

",How to Flirt With a Girl in Class," Take a shower every day wear deodorant and brush your teeth. (But not too much! Some girls love it when you walk by and they can smell a hint of it on you, but if you use as much as the Axe commercials do, she'll think you just stink.);
, If you are sitting next to her, you can simply start talking to her. Compliment her, tell her how good she looks, etc. Just remember not to say anything that might put her off, especially if you've never talked to her. Just pretend she is like one of your ""guy"" friends. Don't treat her exactly like this or she will feel like you don't care that she is a girl and are desperate for a new guy friend.

, Don't stare hard, or she will be a little creeped out. You then can start mouthing a conversation with her. Do not stare at anything below her face. The eyes and the lips have the best effect.

, Be sure to show you are confident, just don't act stupid or insecure

, there is always someone else!

,,,, If her best friend thinks you're weird, she will be less interested in you.

Pick a flattering profile picture.,
Make your thoughts and opinions known.Sculpting an active social media life will give people the impression you have a busy real life as well.,
Like and reshare posts that interest you.",How to Flirt With a Guy Online1," A profile picture says a lot about you, and if you're wanting to flirt online, having a good photo of you to go with your posts goes a long way.If you already have a lot of good photos of yourself online, you should pick one that highlights your face, preferably in a high resolution photo quality. If you don't have many photos, try taking a few and see if there are any that stick. You won't have a physical presence save for this picture while flirting online, so make it count.


If you're torn deciding what photo you should use, get a friend to help. A friend's advice can give insight into how your photos will be perceived by other people.;
, This bodes well if you're trying to get someone interested in you. If there's something on your mind, make a post about it. If you got up to something interesting the other day, let the internet know about it.


Quality is ultimately more important than quantity, and spamming with a large number of shallow or poorly worded posts will actually have the opposite effect you're going for.

, Most social media outlets (like Facebook) have a feature that will quickly allow you to express interest in a post. The 'like button' is incredibly fast to use, and shows someone you're interested in what he has to say. If you're already interested in a guy, you should go out of your way to show his online posts some love and attention. If they're the sort of posts that might benefit from having a wider audience, you can even share them to your own profile."

Smile with your eyes when you talk to him.,
Compliment him with a look.,
Be confident.,
Make sure your eyes look great.,
Get in his line of sight.,
Watch him out of the corner of your eye.,
Let him catch you laughing.",How to Flirt With a Guy With Your Eyes," As you’re keeping tabs on him out of the corner of your eye, look over at him periodically while he’s looking at you and allow your eyes to “brush.” Don’t maintain eye contact for too long yet. Just let your eyes meet for long enough to let him know that you’re looking intentionally, and didn’t just happen to be scanning the room.These first fleeting looks is where the spark of attraction is generated.;
, You’ve noticed him. He’s noticed you noticing him. Now is the time to turn on the charm. After you’ve locked eyes for a moment, lower them like you’re too shy to keep looking. Then, look him in the eye again and smile. This will be a clear signal that you find him attractive and may be enough to convince him to come say hi.The “look and smile” move has been demonstrated time and time again to be one of the most alluring flirting techniques there is.Give him a smile that’s cute and coy, without teeth showing. Don’t make it a humorous grin; a playful smirk will work best.

, Once you've got him looking your way, blink a little more rapidly than usual. While it's become something of a flirting cliche, batting those eyelashes actually does work. Quick blinking and coy eye movement suggest to the person you're flirting with that you feel self-conscious because you find them attractive. It's also been shown in turn to be a behavior that's attractive to males.Quickened eyelash movement is often used by women to signal affection and romantic interest, sometimes even subconsciously.A few quick flutters will do. You don't want to end up looking like you have a nervous condition.

, With the initial contact out of the way, draw his attention with a long, deliberate gaze. Show him that you’re serious by positioning your body to face him directly and maintaining constant eye contact. Don’t smile quite as much. Instead, let your look turn sultry. After only a minute or so of mutual gazing, the attraction between the two of you will solidified to a near-intimate level.
Don’t lock eyes for too long. After a point it will become a little creepy. You don’t want it to look like you’re staring him down.

, By now it should be obvious to him that you’re interested. Take it one step further by looking him over, like you’re check out what he’s working with. Give him a quick sweep from head to toe and back again, then smile again to let him know that you like what you see., As you walk by, turn your head slightly and follow him with your eyes. Make it seem like you can’t take your eyes off of him; he’ll feel like a literal head-turner. This is a small gesture but one that will assure him that he’s still on your mind even after he’s out of sight. It's now or never: he'll know that his only chance to meet you is about to pass him up.This will obviously work best if you’re passing the guy you’re flirting with on foot. If he happens to be in the same room as you, excuse yourself to go to the bathroom or give yourself another reason to walk by.
Try not to appear too wrapped up as you pass. The point is to make your attraction to him evident while maintaining your own mystique. Play it cool and get him to follow your stare right back.

, Lift one eyebrow slightly and use a ""come hither"" motion of your eyes to hint that he should come talk to you. If you’ve been sending the right signals, he’ll most likely want to come over and introduce himself. Be patient and let it happen. Put the impetus of making the first move on him to show that you’re self-assured. Flirting with him from afar will have given him the confidence he needs to talk to you face-to-face.Don't break eye contact when motioning him over. Imagine that you're using your gaze to communicate your will to him, or that your eyes are like magnets, pulling him closer.

, If you’re rather not wait for him to make the first move, go over and break the ice yourself. There’s no rule that says you have to leave it to him when it comes to flirting and attraction. Just be casual and say hi. While you're talking to him, open your eyes a little wider than normal and try to display a warm, enthusiastic expression.Your eyes play a major role in non-verbal communication long after the early stages of flirting.If he’s with other people, you might want to wait until he has a moment alone. It can be awkward flirting directly with a person for the first time in front of their friends.
Other pieces of body language can be used to exhibit attraction, such as nodding enthusiastically when he speaks and lightly fixing your hair with your fingertips., Once you’re finally talking, say something complimentary about his appearance. Don't just say the words: pair each compliment up with expressive eye gestures as though he's wearing each piece of praise you give him like clothing. Tell him that he has nice eyes or a lovely smile, and that it caused you to notice him from across the room. He’ll probably have some pretty flattering things to say to you, as well. After that, you’re in! You’ve successfully drawn a cute guy in, and you did it all without saying a word.Talk with your eyes as well as your mouth. A look can say a lot on its own, and you can say a lot more if you match the right look to the right phrase.
The first traits we tend to notice about the opposite sex are eyes, hair, and smile. These all make great things to compliment., Successful flirting requires you to look and feel good. Exude confidence when you’re around the guy you’re trying to attract to let him see that you’re worth getting to know. The more confident you appear, the more drawn to you he’ll be, which will making hooking him with eye flirting easy.Put some effort into your appearance before going out. Even if you’re not trying to pick up a cute guy, the better you look, the better you’ll feel, and a confident appearance translates to social magnetism., The eyes are the scouts of long-distance flirting, and they’re likely one of the first things he’ll notice about you. Give him something worth looking at by making your eyes unignorable. Use eyeliner to lend your eyes some smoky definition and non-clumping mascara to make your lashes long and lush. When he sees you peering at him from under your perfect, batting eyelashes, he’ll be powerless to look away.You should also be doing the right things with your eyes. Slightly wide eyes will hint at physical admiration, while a raised eyebrow can create a challenging, seductive expression, etc.

, In order to establish a session of playful eye flirting, you need to be somewhere that he can see you. If you’re out somewhere like a bar, restaurant or concert, position yourself across from him so that you’re directly in front of him or just off to one side, right in his line of sight. If you’re trying to flirt with him while walking, be sure to walk slowly and closely so that he’ll see you as he passes.Plant yourself where he can see you, but don’t be so obvious about trying to flirt with him that you become an unwelcome distraction.
You’ll have less time to get your point across if you’re trying to eye flirt with a guy that you’re passing on the street, so make sure you grab his attention quick and make the most of the opportunity.

, Once you’re situated where he’s got you in plain sight, keep an eye on him. Be subtle about it; don’t stare like you’re bird-watching or let him catch you looking too often. You’re just watching to see how he carries himself socially, and taking note of how often you catch him looking back at you.Taking little peeks at him once in a while is a great way to make “first contact” and initiate a game of back-and-forth eye flirting.

, If you know he’s also noticed you, make sure he’s looking while you joke with friends, or tell a captivating story. Chances are he’ll be trying to gauge your personality when he’s looking you over, so in those moments you should display the fun, outgoing side of yourself. You don’t have to ham it up too much—just allow him a glimpse of how sociable and fun to be around you are.Letting him see you having a good time with your friends not only says that you’re well-liked but that not all of your attention is focused on him, effectively allowing you to play hard-to-get.

Make a date.",How to Flirt with a Guy," Eye contact is a key flirting technique which can be implemented anywhere, at any time, as long as your crush is in sight. While you don't want it to look like you're staring deep into his soul, lingering eye contact will show him you're interested.


It will also be a good indicator of his interest—if he holds the eye contact, he's probably into you. If he looks away he might just be shy.
One good trick is to look directly at him until he catches you looking. When he does, hold eye contact for a moment or two before smiling and looking away.
If you're feeling particularly cheeky, you could throw in a wink!;
, Studies have shown that smiling actually makes you more attractive to other people, so work that to your advantage by flashing those pearly whites!


Smiling makes you seem friendlier and more approachable, which might be just the push your crush needs to come over and talk to you!
Smiling will also make you feel happier and more confident two essential ingredients of successful flirting.

, Even if you haven't opened your mouth, you can say a great deal using just your body language. Smiling and eye contact are part of this, but there are a few other things you should be aware of:


Don't cross your arms. Crossing your arms is like the opposite of smiling - it makes you seem closed off and unapproachable, thus scaring your man away. Some people do this unconsciously when they're nervous, so make sure to keep an eye on it.
Flip your hair. Flipping your hair is a very feminine action, as it draws attention to your lustrous locks. It is also a well-recognized flirty action - so if you flip or play with your hair in front of a guy, he'll probably know you're flirting with him.
Play with your jewelry. Playing with jewelry, such as a necklace, draws attention to your neckline, which many guys find attractive in a girl.

, In order to flirt, you need to be around the object of your affection as often as possible. Make a conscious effort to put yourself in his path, without seeming too obvious.


Walk past his desk on your way out the door, or take your dog to the same park he plays soccer at.
Be careful not to overdo this, though, or you'll end up looking like a stalker.

, Give yourself an added boost of confidence by looking your very best whenever your crush is around. This doesn't mean tiny skirts, high heels and lashings of mascara - it just means that you should take some pride in your appearance by being well-groomed and neatly dressed. If you look your best, you'll feel your best - which is essential for successful flirting!


Keep your hair clean and fresh-smelling, brush your teeth, shave where necessary, paint your nails - anything that makes you feel pretty and puts an extra pep in your step.
Wear clean, non-wrinkled clothes that you feel comfortable in - you can't go wrong with a nice fitting pair of jeans!
Try out different hairstyles - curly, straight, in a bun, in a fishtail braid - to create a fresh new look each day. The same goes for make-up - experiment with different colors and trends til you find a look that makes you feel good.

, Sure, you could wait for him to come to you. But there's a lot of expectation on guys to start the pursuit, and it can get tiring. If you approach him, you'll instantly stand out among all the other girls he might consider dating — and you get to pick the perfect moment for you.

, One of the best ways to move the situation along and flirt more openly is to get involved in a conversation with your crush. Find an opportunity to chat him up about something you have in common, whether it's school, work, or a recent event.


Open with a question. This will show you're interested in getting to know him, not just interested in talking about yourself. Ask him what he thought of the latest Fast and Furious installment or whether he did anything fun over the weekend.
Try to avoid asking questions that can be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" - this is a surefire way to end the conversation before it's even begun.
Transition to talking about him. People love to talk about themselves, so try to get him started on something he's passionate about - whether it's music, sport or plans for the future.
Use his name a lot. It's a fact that people love to hear their own name in conversation - especially when it's used by a member of the opposite sex! Calling your crush by his name will send a tingle up his spine and create a sense of intimacy between you.

, Smiling and laughing throughout your conversation shows that you're comfortable around your crush and, more than that, that you enjoy listening to him talk.


It will also make you look more attractive and you will come across as a happy, fun-loving person - which is exactly how you want him to view you.
Laughing at his jokes will make him feel funny, which guys always like. Be careful not to overdo it though - you don't want to sound like a cackling hyena and scare him away!

, Finding small ways to touch your crush is an obvious signal that you're flirting, and shows him that you're willing to make a small level of physical contact. Try doing it in these ways:


Touch his forearm lightly while you're talking. When he makes a funny joke, reach your hand out and touch his arm while you're laughing. Alternatively, you can do this as a form of playful or genuine consolation.
Casually put a hand or elbow on his shoulder. This creates a sense of camaraderie between you and shows him that you feel completely comfortable around him.
""Accidentally"" lean into him if you're walking together. If you're already flirty and you want to move things to the next level, brush your hand against his and see how he reacts.
Straighten his collar. Another sneaky tactic you can use to touch your crush is to tell him that his shirt collar (or tie) is crooked, so you can lean in to fix it. Stand squarely in front of him so you're face to face, then casually brush your fingers against his neck as you adjust his collar. When you're done, look him in the eyes and say ""that's better!"" before taking a step back.

, Guys are visual creatures, so nothing gets them going like a sneaky flash of flesh here and there. Subtly drawing attention to your body every now and then will get his heart racing and help him to realize how much he likes you.


Rub your shoulder. Pretend you have an ache in your shoulder and pull down the neckline of your top, exposing your skin as you massage it. If you're lucky, he'll offer to rub it better for you.
Ask if you should get your belly button pierced. For tummy-confident girls, one good technique is to pull up your top slightly and tell him you were thinking of getting your belly button pierced, then ask for his opinion on the matter. If he stammers out an answer, you'll know your cheeky trick caught his attention.
Lick your lips. Make him think about kissing you by drawing attention to your lips in front of him. Lick your lips, bite them, apply some lip gloss - anything as long as you do it with an air of nonchalance.
Be careful not to overdo things here - drawing attention to your body can work very well, but only if it's used in moderation. Otherwise you can seem desperate and attention-seeking, so avoid prancing around in front of him in a bikini (unless you're at the beach - in which case; go for it!)

, Dancing with a guy is a fun way to show him that you're into him, without being too serious. It could be at a school dance or a nightclub, it doesn't matter as long as you get some one-on-one time together.


Make it very obvious that you're choosing to dance with him. Grab his hands and pull him away from the group. If he goes with you willingly, you'll know that he's into it.
You can try to dance sexily if you like, but avoid grinding on him or being too overtly sexual - it's inappropriate in front of other people and you might just make him feel uncomfortable.
If he's an awkward dancer, you can try to make him feel more at ease by breaking out some wacky dance moves of your own - just be silly and have fun with it - if you can make him laugh, then it's worth it.
Try to work in a slow dance if you can. Put your arms on his shoulders and let him hold you tightly around the waist. Gaze up into his eyes as you gently sway - he'll melt inside.

, Don't expect the compliments to go one-way — guys love to be complimented too! Making your crush feel noticed and appreciated shows him that you're interested in him as a person, and that you're paying attention to what's important. Here's how to make your compliment even more amazing:


Be specific. The more specific you are, the more personal the compliment will be. If you say something generic such as ""I think you're hot,"" chances will be that he's heard it before. If you focus on a specific trait or quality that you love, the compliment will be fresh and you'll stick out in his mind.
If he's on a sports team and you saw him play, praise his performance. If you heard him playing his guitar or drums, compliment his playing. If you're feeling more intimate, tell him that you love the color of his eyes - and use it as an excuse to gaze into them.
When giving the compliment, lean in close and lower your voice slightly. This makes the compliment seem intimate and secret.
Make eye contact while you give the compliment and keep smiling slightly. This will highlight your sincerity and show him that you're genuinely impressed.
Just make sure not to overdo it on the compliments or make them too fake. This will significantly lessen their impact and he might stop taking you seriously. One simple, sincere compliment is better than 100 fake ones.

, Some playful teasing can be a great flirting technique - if used correctly. Teasing can create a sense of intimacy and show the guy that you have a sense of humor. Just be warned - if you give it, you need to be able to take it!


Tease him about small, unimportant things - pretend you think he has a crush on his Math teacher, or joke that he loves his dog more than any human being.
If he's particularly good looking, ask him how his Abercrombie interview went; if he's just been to the gym, make an exaggerated comment about his huge muscles - rather than being offensive, you want your teasing to be more of a veiled compliment!
Never get too personal with your teasing, or he might take it the wrong way - insulting his family, his performance at work or school, or criticizing his appearance should be off-limits - at least until you know him better.

, Don't let the conversation drag on so long that he has time to get bored or distracted. Instead, walk away while he's still interested so that he can't wait to see you again.


Leave an opening for next time. If you say, ""I have to run, but maybe I'll see you around tomorrow?"", you've already planted the idea that you'll see him again.
Lean in like you want a kiss, but at the last minute turn your head and whisper ""I had a great time"" in his ear.

, If you're not sure how to get a text conversation going, one good tactic is to text him pretending you think he's someone else, like you're best friend.


Say something like ""Haha, yeah right! So what are you doing this weekend?:)""
Give it a minute or two, then send a second message saying something like ""Oops, wrong person, sorry! But what are you doing this weekend? ;)""
This will make it seem like you didn't intentionally start a conversation, but you're happy to have one anyway.

, Boring text messages are pointless - texting things like ""what's up?"" or ""what's the weather forecast for tomorrow?"" is deeply uninteresting and won't get you very far with your crush. Try to be unique and interesting - only send a message if you think it's going to bring a smile to your crush's face.


For example, text something like ""Just saw a giant teddy bear in the window of a toy shop - made me think of you."" or ""Quickly - help me choose: doughnut or chocolate muffin?""

, Once you're in a text conversation, try not to be overly enthusiastic, responding to every single thing in his last message. These kinds of text messages can be confusing and make you seem too eager.


Respond to one or two items per message, but try to leave some of his questions hanging. This will give you an air of mystery and make him want to know the answer even more.
On the same note, don't bombard him with questions in every message - this will also make you seem over-eager and he might find responding more hassle than it's worth. Keep your messages short and sweet.

, Once things really get going and you feel more comfortable with your texting, you can start to heat things up a little - dropping not-so-subtle hints that you're interested in being more than friends.


Play it safe at first - there's no need to be too racy, you just need to give him the idea that you want to be with him. Something cute like ""I'm just about to watch a scary movie - wish you were here to stop me from being too scared!""
If he responds in the same flirty tone, you can feel safe to continue. Try paying him a flirty compliment by saying something like ""I can't stop thinking about how great your arms looked in that shirt today.""
If you want to get a little racier, you could try being even more suggestive. For instance, if he texts you but you don't reply for at least half an hour you could say something like ""Sorry, I was in the shower..."" His mind will do the rest.

, The rules of texting dictate that you should receive approximately the same number of texts as you send. This means that if you're sending your crush 20 messages a day and he's only responding to about 5 of them, you're seriously overdoing it.


Try to exercise a little self-control and refrain from texting every time your crush pops into your head. Wait until you have something truly interesting and important to say. And if you send more than two texts without receiving a reply, cut yourself off.
You should also avoid always being the first one to text. Be a little mysterious and aloof and wait for him to text you. If he does, you'll know he's interested.
Never send messages that only contain answers like ""k"" or ""lol"". This can be extremely frustrating and will give your crush nothing to respond to.

, Picture texting can be a fun alternative way to communicate - and also ensures that your crush has a picture of you on his phone.


Text him a picture of you and a group of friends at the back or mall and add ""wanna join?""
Text him a picture of yourself lying on the couch and write ""Bored. Entertain me?""
Text him a picture of a movie poster or concert flyer and just write ""Interested?""

, Texting can be a great way to ask a guy out, particularly if you're nervous about doing it face to face. Try to keep it casual by saying something like:


""Hey! I just watched the trailer for the new Batman movie, I'm dying to see it. Wanna go this weekend?"" or ""Craving a caramel frappuccino! Meet me after school? Coffee's on me. :)""
Even if he says no, you don't need to panic. Over text, it's easy to play it cool. Just say something like ""No problem. Some other time."" Then leave it up to him whether to continue the conversation or not.

Talk to him regularly.,
Ask him questions.,
Touch him.,
Smile at him.,
Give him compliments.,
Be kind to all of his friends.,
Find common interests.,
Make eye contact with him.,
Remember what he tells you.,
Mirror his body language.",How to Flirt With Boys Without Being Obvious," Looking pretty from afar can get his attention for a bit, but you need to start conversing with him if you want to hold his attention. Don’t bombard him with meaningless chatter every time you see him in the hallway, but try to start up casual conversation when you see he's alone and isn’t busy. At the very least, try to say “Hi” and ask him how his day is going every day. As he becomes familiar with you, he's more likely to start liking you.Not only will he remember you and get to know you, he will certainly think you’re a kind, social person to say hello every day.;
, This is a simple flirting technique that is definitely underutilized. Think about how special you feel when someone asks you specific questions about your life. It shows they pay attention, and they care about what is going on with you. Make your crush feel special too! Ask him questions about his classes, his extracurricular activities, or anything else you know he’s interested in.This is an extremely subtle technique. Nonetheless, it will definitely make him feel good to know that you’re fascinated in what he has to say.

, This doesn’t mean all the obvious touchy-feely flirting moves, like hugs and kisses. Instead, casually brush his arm while talking to him. Playfully graze his back or bicep when you’re deep in conversation. Act nonchalant, as if you’ve touched him without even realizing it. No one else will probably notice these subtle moves, but he certainly won’t miss them., Think about the people you want to spend time with– are they people with a constant frown on their face? Probably not! People are attracted to others who seem positive, happy, fun, and upbeat. Even if you aren’t feeling great, try to wear a smile when you’re around your crush, and flash one his way whenever you get the chance., You don’t have to tell him that his lips are luscious and his eyes make you melt– you can keep it subtle. Throw him casual compliments every once in awhile. Tell him that you like his new shoes, his new haircut looks great, or that he did a nice job on a class project. None of these compliments are romantic, but they’ll let him know you notice and admire things about him., If you offer him compliments and sweet smiles but act rude or disinterested in his friends, he may view you as insincere and fake. Instead, be kind to everyone, especially the people he cares about. Keep in mind that you will never be criticized for being caring, but you can look like a brat if you’re only nice to your crush.


This is as subtle as you can get when it comes to flirting. By being kind to his friends, you’re showing him that you care about the people he cares about.
This is also important because if his friends dislike you, he'll be less likely to pursue a relationship with you.

, Try to take notice about what he seems interested in by observing things like his t-shirts, pictures he hangs up in his locker, and what he talks about with his buddies. Even if your only shared interest is a television show, ask him if he caught the latest episode or mention if you recently had a nice binge-watching marathon. Anytime you can connect with him through a similar hobby or a shared interest, you’re doing well.If he’s passionate about something that you know nothing about, you can use this to your advantage as well. For example, if he loves baseball, ask him if he’d like to watch a game with you so he can show you what it’s all about.

, Even if you’re shy, try extra hard to look into his eyes while you’re speaking with him. This will show that you’re engaged and really listening to what he has to say. Listening to him, and showing that you’re interested, is an easy way to flirt without making it extremely obvious., If he tells you that he’s going to his sister’s soccer game after school, ask him if she won the next day. If he mentions a test he’s nervous for, ask him how it went. These are little ways to show him that you not only listen, but you care enough to follow up with him about it. This is a sweet, easy way to flirt with your crush., In other words, observe his body language and facial expressions and imitate them. This has been proven to make people feel comfortable and even feel friendlier toward you. It may seem a bit unnatural at first, it will make him warm up to you quickly, and a flirtatious conversation will flow more easily.If he’s leaning against his locker, lean against one next to it while you talk. If he’s smiling, smile back.

Ask him about his interests.,
Compliment him.,
Act light and playful.Especially when you first start talking to a guy, you don't want to get too heavy with your conversation topics.,
Use emoticons in moderation.Flirting online can be a difficult thing when you don't have body language to get your point across.,
Make public posts on his wall.,
Use voicechat with him.",How to Flirt With a Guy Online2," One really helpful thing about using the internet to flirt is that you can learn so much about the person before going into it. A Facebook profile will have a ton of potential information to start a conversation with. In all likelihood, he'll have his favourite books, films, teams and bands available to peruse on his profile. Any one of these will make for a great conversation starter. Few guys will turn away someone who expresses a genuine interest in them, so don't be shy!


For example, if he made a post about a film you recently saw, you could message him randomly saying: ""I saw that movie too. I was pretty excited for it and it didn't disappoint. Did you have any favourite parts?""

, No matter what you think, there isn't a person alive who won't feel good at some level about a compliment directed at them. Much like scoping out his interests, a full-bodied online profile will lend you plenty of potential reasons to compliment him. Check his recent posts or pictures; has he been up to anything interesting in life lately? Does he have a great profile picture? Send him a private message and let him know what you think.


Adding a smiley face emoticon is a helpful way of adding warmth to your message.

, Flirtation feeds off of light, relaxed interaction. Discussing what's going on in your lives currently, as well as common interests you have are good starting points, but a truly great conversation will take a life of its own. To effectively flirt, you should work humour and compliments into the conversation.


Be patient with it. If you're pure trying to flirt as a means to an end, it won't be enjoyable or even successful!, Emoticons are a cheap substitute, sure, but they come with their own uses. If you're telling a joke that stands a chance of being taken seriously, include a wink or playful emoticon. Take heed not to use them too much however, as they'll quickly lose their effect when overused and even come off as very irritating.

, If you're interacting with your crush via Facebook, wall posting is an effective way of letting someone know you're interested in them. Keeping a post public means it will be light and fun, and it'll make your interactions openly visible to other people. Alluding to an inside joke you have, or posting some of your favourite music on his wall are both great ideas for wall posting.


If it's anything of a serious or personal nature, you should stick with personal messaging.

, Voice chat services like Skype are free and allow you to use your computer like a telephone.Once you have gotten past the initial stages of small talk and messaging back and forth, voicechat is the next recommended step. It may feel awkward at first if you haven't spoken in person before, but you'll be able to see if you have real chemistry this way.


Webcamming can be a fun way to approximate the experience of hanging out in person.

Write properly.,
Be civil with your posting.,
Try to be nice to everyone.,
Keep your public flirting focused on one person.",How to Flirt With a Guy Online3," Unless you're in grade school, relying excessively on shorthand and 'texting' language will get you nowhere when it comes to impressing someone new. Many people's only experience of you will be via your online presence, so you should do your best to appear intelligent and mature. This includes using proper spelling, relatively accurate grammar and keeping use of emoticons in moderation., Each time you make a post online, you should consider how it reflects upon you as a person. While there is a place for offensive humour and wild stories, posting it publicly will rarely get you in the good graces of people. If you're trying to impress one guy in particular, it doesn't hurt to tone down your online personality. Every guy is looking for his own set of traits in a potential girlfriend, but the vast majority would prefer to be with someone who know how to exercise some tact.

, You won't like everyone you meet online, but given that you don't know who will see your posts, it doesn't hurt to exercise kindness and empathy. If a guy goes on your profile and sees a bunch of posts about someone you hate, hes going to feel turned off and otherwise uninterested. If you have really negative thoughts to get off your chest, they're better suited for private messaging.

, Even if you're legitimately interested in someone, he won't feel as invested in you if he see you treating multiple other guys the same way. If you're interested in harmless flirting with numerous individuals, you should take care to keep it largely private. It is alright if hints of it are made public, but you don't want to be perceived as tease. If that happens, it will become more difficult to find someone when you're actually serious about seeking out a partner.

, Just don't make him mad or hurt his feelings. Try giving him a nickname and see how he reacts when you call him it. If he seems to take offense to the nickname you gave him, apologize.

, Be interested in what he has to say. Make eye contact when he talks to you and nod every once in a while to show him that you are listening to every word he says. No matter how much your mind wants to wander away from the conversation, respond to his questions and don't let the conversation stop and/or get boring. Be fun and spontaneous with your words and keep him guessing at what you're going to say next.

, Try commenting on his posts/pictures, liking things that he has liked, poking him and friending him if you haven't already. When you've friended him, try to chat with him on Facebook.

, Scientists have shown that guys are instinctively attracted to red. Of course if he doesn't like the colour red, skip this step.

, You don't want it to be too strong, just a scent that is fun and flirty. Try spritzing some perfume on the back of your neck. Vanilla is a scent most guys are attracted to.

, Paint your nails a flirty color such as pink. You could also try wearing a sparkly nail polish. Just don't paint your nails too dark and/or sparkly.

, Flutter them slightly when you look at him or give him a soft loving look.

, Just make sure that he knows that you are only giving him a hard time as a joke.

However, hopes are that an online connection will lead to a real life one, so search for girls close to where you live. Do this by joining a local or neighborhood group and begin browsing for a potential match. , In the real dating world, many men meet women through mutual friends; Facebook is no different. Browse your friends’ female friends and see if there is a girl that catches your eye. Once you’ve found a girl you are interested in, your friend can give you information on her such as her interests and whether or not she is single. , Facebook profile pictures say a lot about a girl and what she is looking for in a man. According to clinical psychologist Abigail San, a girl with a profile picture with friends wants to project an exciting, interesting life, while a girl posing carefully for her photo is concerned with her appearance, and probably yours as well., Once you've become Facebook friends with a girl, examine the amount of personal information she has posted. A girl that has little information made public is likely a private person in real life. Avoid asking too many questions, or she may become more withdrawn. However, don’t neglect to ask any questions, as this may give her the idea that you are not interested., Some girls, even those in committed relationship catch a thrill from flirting on Facebook. While spotting fakers can be tricky, pay attention to subtle cues that may reveal that the girl is already taken., If a girl updates her status numerous times on a daily basis, it is likely that she prides herself on being socially active and having a lot of friends.

, This shows her that you are thinking about her and interested in her life.

Before sending a message, read it out loud and make a mental note of whether or not it sounds too formal. , Being behind a screen has the potential to make anybody more bold. Just keep in mind that being too forward or sexual with her too early, even on Facebook, can come across as desperate and creepy. Actual time frames vary depending on the girl, but communicating every other day is a good jumping-off point., A smiley or winking face here or there suggests a playful and casual tone, but don’t overdo it.

""How has your week been?""
""Did you hear about ?""
""Did you hear ?""

, Both boys and girls enjoy talking about themselves, in real life and on Facebook. Asking questions about her not only keeps the conversation going, but allows you to learn more about your crush.


If you don't know much about her, ask questions such as

""What did you do this week/weekend?""
""How was your day?""


If you already know what she is into, ask about her hobbies.

""Have you heard any new good bands recently?""
""Have you read any good books lately?""
""Did you see ? What did you think about it?""



, It is possible to learn personal information about a girl, but do it in a way that is casual. Asking personal questions too soon can come off as creepy, so keep it light by asking questions like:


""Do you have any big plans for the weekend?""
""I noticed you have a cute pet, is that who you mostly hang out with?""
""I saw some of your vacation pictures, what kind of fun stuff did you do?""

, This lets her know that you are interested in being more than just friends. If you wait too long to compliment her while you have her attention, it might be too late next time. Good ways to throw in compliments include:


If you've just met her, use a compliment along the lines of ""It's great getting to know someone as interesting as you.""
If you already have information on her, use more in-depth compliments like ""Your job sounds really interesting."" or ""It sounds like you got out of your past relationship at the right time.""
If she makes you laugh, let her know! Something as simple as ""You crack me up"" is enough to let her know that you appreciate her sense of humor.

, Don't simply end the conversation with ""It was nice talking to you"". Rather, show that you are interested in talking again with a statement such as ""It was great talking to you , I hope we can do this again soon"". This shows her that you are interested in maintaining contact and weren't just killing time. "

",How to Flirt With a Boy when You Are 13 or 14," Boys don't like an uptight girl who will adjust her makeup and hair every five seconds. The point is to not be so girly, but don't be one of the guys either. You will not be able to flirt unless you can find the perfect balance between one of the boys and a girly-girl.;
, The mall would be the perfect place for this. Flirtatious behaviour includes winking, blowing kisses, tiling your hair, posing to show off your best features, giggling and blushing.

Get up to get a drink, not anything else, just as a drink, then pass by him on your way to the soda fountain - heading for a vending machine, kettle or other beverage containers will not work. It has to be as soda fountain, this will give him the idea you want to be noticed.

Wink at a guy when you catch him staring at you.
When he walks by, try to stop whatever you are doing. If you do this enough, he will notice. Then he will think that you think he is so stunning.
When you are walking down the hall and notice him alone, quickly say, ""Hi!"" and do a little wave. Make sure you also walk backwards so you can get a big glimpse of him.
Lightly bump into him, and say, ""Oh, I'm so sorry!"" smile big and turn to walk away. After about four steps, look back. If he is still looking that means your tactic has worked!

, If you choose, apply a subtle amount of make up, like a little mascara or a bit of eyeliner to bring attention to your eyes, and maybe just a bit of lip gloss. Generally, lipsticks or heavy eye-shadows are not very attractive on younger girls - just make sure whatever you put on is neat, evenly applied, and UN-smudged. Guys will always notice if you're wearing too much make up, or if it's messy or lopsided. Looking good isn't flirting though. To make your appearance part of your appeal to a boy, you need to make him think you have done it just for him, for example, pat your lips with a tissue before to speak to him. He'll think you just put that lipstick on for him, even if you aren't wearing any!

, Try not to be negative about yourself all the time - and never do it in front of a guy, unless you know how to joke about it. Guys are uncomfortable around girls who go on and on about how fat and ugly they are, and don't like hanging out with them.

,!

, It shows that you're confident and social, and that you're genuinely interested. If you're still just getting his attention and he doesn't really know you so well, simply smile if he looks at you when you pass in the hallway- take steps forward if you want, present yourself and be outgoing. The boy doesn't always have to make the first move.

, This will just complicate things more, and things will be ruined if he ever finds out you're a fake.

, Sometimes guys can be shy and if you start a conversation it will feel good to him knowing that you are interested.  If you always let him do the talking he may think your not interested and he's talking into a brick wall.

, This is middle school, you're not getting married. Flirting isn't a major commitment. And if he asks you out, great! If not, so what?

Talk to a trustworthy friend or family member.,
Find a mentor.,
Seek help from a therapist or school counselor.,
Resist comparing how they treat you and your siblings.,
Try not to take it personally.,
Be kind to yourself.,
Replace negative self-talk with self-love.,
Write yourself a positivity cheat sheet.It may help you to examine any negative thoughts that are interfering with your ability to love yourself and write some positive thoughts to replace them.,
Get out of the house more.",How to Cope With Being Unloved by Your Parents1," Sometimes just talking to someone about what you are dealing with can make you feel better.Try talking to a trustworthy friend or family member about what has been happening in your home life.


For example, you could try talking with a close friend about the way that your parents make you feel. Choose someone you feel comfortable talking to and who you know will not turn around and repeat what you said to your parents.
Try to avoid becoming too dependent on this person for your emotional needs. Just talk when you need someone to listen to you. If you find yourself calling several times a day for reassurance, then you may be developing a codependent relationship with this person. Talk to your school counselor or therapist if you find yourself depending more and more on other people for validation.;
, Mentors can guide you through important life decisions and teach you things that your parents are not willing or able to teach you. You can find a mentor to help you learn new skills for navigating difficult situations, succeeding in school, or advancing your professional career. Try asking a trustworthy, responsible adult in your life to mentor you, such as a coach, a teacher, or a boss.If your coach or boss offers to mentor you, make sure that you take him or her up on that offer; however, you can also try asking someone to mentor you, such as by saying, “I admire your success in life and I hope to achieve many of the same things you have someday. I am not sure how to get there. Would you be willing to mentor me?”
Try to avoid becoming too dependent on your mentor. Keep in mind that a mentor cannot replace your parents you should not look to this person for parental guidance. A mentor is just someone who can help you reach your goals in school, work, or in another specific area of your life.

, Learning to cope with your parents’ behavior can be difficult, so you may need to seek help from a therapist or school counselor. A therapist or your school counselor can help you to develop coping mechanisms and begin to feel better about yourself.If your school has a counselor, stop by and see if you can make an appointment to talk. If you feel uncomfortable doing this or you're not sure how to go about it, talk to a teacher you trust.
Try asking your parents if you can see a therapist by saying something like, “I have been struggling with some things lately, and I would like to see a therapist to talk about them. Can you help me find one?”
Keep in mind that if your parents are abusing you, then your therapist or school counselor will be required to report it.

, If your parents seem to favor a sibling over you, it doesn’t mean they love one of you any more or less. There could be a situational reason why they treat your sibling with more thoughtfulness or effort. Most of the time it is also unintentional, and your parents may not even realize they are treating you differently.


Most aren’t trying to make you feel unloved but aren’t aware of how their actions affect kids mentally and emotionally.Try not to focus on how your parents treat your siblings. Instead, just focus on your relationship with them

, It can be hard to dismiss criticism and hurtful language from people who are supposed to love you, even if you know that what they are saying isn’t true. Remember that your parents’ behavior and words is about them and not about you.The next time one of your parents says something mean or does something to hurt you, try telling yourself, “I am a good person with value. My parents are just struggling with personal issues and that is why they said/did that.”

, Some children who are mistreated by their parents treat themselves badly as well, such as by cutting, using alcohol or drugs, or intentionally failing at school. Doing these things will not make you feel better in the long run. Instead of doing these things, make sure that you nurture yourself, such as by:



Maintaining a healthy diet.

Exercising moderately most days of the week.

Starting a daily meditation practice.

Not smoking and not using drugs or alcohol.

, People who grow up in unloving households may be more prone to negative self-talk, which can damage your self-esteem. To train your mind to think positive things about yourself, replace the negative thoughts with positive ones.


For example, if you hear yourself repeating something your parents said like “You’re stupid if you can’t figure out division problems,” you might replace it with: “Learning long division is challenging, but I can succeed by working hard at it.”

, To get started, make a chart with four columns.


In the first column, make a list of your negative beliefs. These might include things like, “I am not good at making decisions,” or, “I am not very smart.”
In the second, explain why you believe these things. Did your parents tell you these things or do things to cause you to feel this way?
In the third column, think about what believing this is costing you emotionally and in your personal life: are you depressed, withdrawn, afraid to try new things and fail, afraid to trust others or let people in, etc.? List briefly but specifically what you are missing out on by letting yourself continue believing this negative self-image.
Then for the final column, rewrite the thought to make it positive. For example, you might change a thought about your intelligence to something like, “I am an intelligent, capable person and I have accomplished many things using my brain.”

, Developing a happy, full life outside of your home will help you to feel happier even if your home life is not happy.Finding valuable ways that you can contribute to the world while being an active part of your community can help you rebuild your self-worth and confidence by focusing your attention on your well-being and happiness.


Try volunteering for a local non-profit organization, getting a job that you will enjoy, or joining a youth organization or sports team.

Your parent may seem sad, hopeless, or act helpless. You may notice changes in weight (putting on weight or losing weight) or changes in sleep (sleeping very often or not sleeping enough).Your parent may have different behavior, such as feeling more irritable, aggressive, or short-tempered than usual.
Your parent may lack energy and may appear exhausted much of the time.
Watch out for increases in alcohol consumption or drug use. If your parent has changed habits with alcohol or drugs (including prescription medications and sleeping pills), this may be related to depression.
Depression is not contagious and you cannot catch it.;
, It can be scary to bring up the topic of depression, especially when it’s with your parent. If you are concerned and feel like things will not get better, it’s okay to start a conversation about depression. Approach your parent from a place of concern and care.Remind your parent how important he is to you, and that you want to see him happy.


Say, “I’m concerned about you and your health, have things changed? How are you doing?”
You can also say, “I’ve noticed things have changed, and you seem sadder than usual. Is everything okay?”
If your parent says something about how he ""doesn't want to be here anymore,"" you should seek help right away., After you’ve had a heartfelt discussion with your parent, urge her to find a therapist. It’s important to understand that you are not responsible for your parent’s thoughts, emotions, and behavior, especially related to depression. Encourage your parent to see a therapist. Therapy can help reframe negative thought patterns, identify triggers, practice coping skills, and practice preventative measures to reduce symptoms of depression in the future.Say to your parent, “I want to see you healthy and happy, and I think a therapist could help you with that. Would you consider reaching out to a therapist?”

, While individual therapy can help the individual gain skills, involving the whole family in therapy can be helpful for everyone.When a parent suffers from depression, the whole family may suffer. Family therapy can help your family communicate and work out issues that come up.


If you feel like you are carrying much of the weight of family functioning, family therapy is a great place to bring that up and come up with compromises.

, Your parent loves you, even if he is unable to show it clearly to you.Show your parent that you love him back by making a point to spend time together. Your parent may want to spend time with you, but lack the energy to do so. You can take the initiative and invite him to do something with you. Do activities that both of you find enjoyable.


Cook dinner together.
Draw together.
Walk the dog together.

, Nature, sunshine, and fresh air can relax your parent and help her feel better. Going for a walk outside can lower depression and stress.Observe the trees and the animals and enjoy being in nature.


Go to a park or a nature preserve and take a walk together.
Even a stroll around the block while walking the dog counts.

, Sometimes depressed people feel unloved or unwanted, and a reminder can boost positive feelings. You can write a note, send a card, or draw a picture. Whatever you do, make it clear that you love your parent.


If you don’t live with your parent, you can send a card or an e-mail to show that you are thinking about your parent and love her.

, Give your parent a big hug. People that lack affection tend to be more lonely and struggle with depression at higher rates. People who experience adequate affection are generally happier and healthier individuals.Hug your parent as often as you feel comfortable.
Offer a light touch on the shoulder or arm for support.

, If you have little siblings, they may realize that something is different with your parent, but not know what. Explain to them as best as you can, as simply as you can.


Say, ""Dad has depression, and sometimes he acts cranky and stays in bed a lot. It's not your fault, and he still loves you very much.""

, Sometimes when a person is depressed he stops taking care of himself — he may stop showering, going to work, or stop doing things like making dinner, cleaning the house, doing laundry, etc. Your parent neglecting himself might mean your needs are neglected, too.


If your needs are being neglected, you need to reach out for help. If your dad is depressed your mom or step-mom is present, try talking to her about what's going on with dad and that you think he needs help. You can also call a grandparent, aunt or uncle, or even a friend's parent or teacher. You may be able to help out in little ways, like by keeping your room clean or doing little tasks like taking out the trash, but it is your parent's responsibility to take care of you.
If you are a little older, like a teenager, you might be able to help pick up the slack a little while your parent heals. Try helping out around the house, offering to make or pick up dinner, driving siblings to activities, etc. However, you should not be taking over all household responsibilities or become your parent's sole care taker. Help out with things that are high-priority (like meals), but be aware that, right now, all chores might not get done.If you are an adult, talk to your parent about getting help. If he is reluctant to see a therapist, you may have better luck convincing him to go in to his doctor for a general checkup.Set boundaries about what you are willing and able to do for your parent, remembering that your parent must be willing to accept help before he can get better. You can't force him to get help., It's scary to think about, but familiarizing yourself with suicidal behaviors is important if your parent is depressed. People who are contemplating suicide often show signs, and knowing what they are ahead of time means you can be ready if you need to act.Some signs that a person is in danger of attempting suicide include:Giving away belongings.
Talking about going away or getting her affairs in order.
Talking about death or suicide, possibly talking about hurting herself.
Talking about feeling hopeless.
A sudden change in behavior, such as calmness after a period of anxiety.
Engaging in self-destructive behaviors, such as increased alcohol or drug use.
Saying that you would be better off without her, that she doesn't want to be here anymore, that it will be over soon, or similar statements.

, If you think your parent is suicidal, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or 911. If your parent is threatening self-harm or suicide, has a weapon or lethal means (such as pills), is talking about suicide and is acting agitated or anxious, or is in the process of an attempt, call emergency services (such as 911) immediately., You may feel guilty or feel like you did something ""wrong"" to upset your parent, but this is not the case.There are usually many reasons why a person gets depressed, making the occurrence of depression more complex than just one or two reasons. Many people become depressed because they have factors in their backgrounds that make them more vulnerable to developing depression.


You did nothing wrong and you didn't make your parent depressed. Ditch the blame and guilt, because you'll just be beating yourself up, and it's not healthy for you.

, Typically, women tend to be weepy and moody, while men tend to be angry or quick-tempered. Either way, a depressed parent may say things that she does not mean.You may feel like you are the cause of stress in your parent’s life. Knowing that your parent’s emotions are different — which can cause behavior changes — can help you realize that these things are not true.


If your parent hurts your feelings, keep the remark in perspective. Try to forgive your parent and accept that she may be in a different frame of mind. While it doesn’t make the remark any less painful, it can help you understand that it’s not your fault.

, Go out with friends, spend time with positive people, and enjoy your life.Don't be afraid to get out of the house and do things. Fun outings can provide you with the mental balance you need to stay afloat at home.


Don’t let your parent’s care and household duties become your life. It’s not your responsibility to be the caretaker. Offer your help but don’t let it take over.It's important to set boundaries with your parent. If your parent relies on you to make him feel good or whole, this is an unhealthy dynamic that can have major repercussions on your own mental health. Try setting small boundaries at first, and try to do so without anger or judgement. For instance, if your parent over-shares with you, telling you more about his problems than is appropriate, you could say something like, ""Dad, I love talking with you, but this is a little more than I can handle. I think Aunt Susan could really help you with this problem.""

, Your emotions are important, and it isn't healthy to bottle them up. Find someone who is a good listener and confide in her.Your parent may be too sick to fill a parental role, so search for other adults who can be mentors to you. Consider older siblings, grandparents, aunts/uncles, spiritual leaders, and family friends.

, It's natural to feel stressed, worried, and sad when your parent has depression. It’s important for you to cope with your feelings by having healthy outlets to de-stress and recharge. Try keeping a journal, drawing or painting, listening to music, or writing.Find activities that relax you or help you feel great. This may include sports, going for a run, or playing with a family pet.

, Having a depressed parent is difficult. Your feelings are natural and valid. Crying is a great way to release your emotions in a healthy way. Crying can make you feel better because tears release stress hormones and toxins.Don’t feel ashamed to cry. There is nothing wrong with crying or expressing your emotions, alone or in public.
Give yourself as much time as you need to let your tears out. If you feel more comfortable, you can excuse yourself to cry somewhere private, like your bedroom or the bathroom.

, Depression can do strange things to your parent's mind and behaviors — wearing her down, altering her feelings, and causing her to say things she doesn't really mean. She’s going through a hard time. She still loves you very much."

Plan a timetable.,
Talk to your parents.,
Reward yourself.,
If you have tutors, as soon as you come home, do one bit of his/hers homework.,
If you can, set a reasonable amount of time on weekends and in the holidays where you can revise and do some more homework.,
Stay positive.,
Relax!,
Don't have a late night!,
If you have to go out, either wait until you have done a fair amount of work or do it another day.",How to Cope With Pressure from Parents over School Work," It really helps and you can have colours representing different things eg. you can colour play time red and work time blue. If you have too much of one colour, cancel down on that topic. If you add more to the other topic, you'll find you'll be too busy!;
, At the end of the day, all they want to do is give you the best education possible and make your life as luxurious as possible. If you get angry (this can be hormones as well) count to ten and take deep, long, breaths. Try to think of it from your parents point of view. You can always write a diary too, but make sure you have a secure lock, you disguise it in some way and you hide the keys!

, Let's say if you get 90% or higher in any test etc. that you do, you get a horse-riding lesson, or something that you are interested in. It can be sporty or it can just be meeting up with your friends. Make sure you ok this with your parents first though!

, Do bit by bit every day until you find that you have finished it all! It really helps and DO NOT leave it until the last minute. If you do find yourself in this situation, do as much as you possibly can and get your mum or dad to write a polite note explaining that you were busy and that you have tried your best. The worst your tutor can do is tell you off and it's not the end of the world! Just make sure you don't do it again!

, Stick to it! I have to do 2 and a half hours but I get a break of 10-15 minutes every half an hour. Don't turn the TV on at this time! Instead, have a snack, play a musical instrument, call your friend, go for a walk, play outside, play on the Wii, dance around, sing, do whatever you can cram into these precious minutes. Don't laze about and get your blood pumping really good! When you start on your work again, you'll find you feel refreshed!

, If you don't pass you 11+ or any other exam, it's not the end of the world! You have to pick yourself up and carry on with life.

, If you are a girl, you can go to the salon, get a friend or family member to pamper you or just have a beautiful hot bath! If you are a guy, have a hot bath, watch a bit of telly or just lie down. It pays off!

, Wake up early and refreshed and start early on that work. If you do it before your parents wake up or whatever, you'll have the rest of the day to yourself.

, Don't do it on a day where you have loads of other things on, but on one of your 'relaxing days'. If you just leave it, you'll get behind! remember, the sooner you get it done, the better!

Report any physical or sexual abuse.,
Sever your relationship, if possible.,
Resist the urge to isolate yourself from peers and other adults.,
Learn how to be independent.",How to Cope With Being Unloved by Your Parents2," If you are being abused, then seek help right away. Talk to a teacher, your doctor, a counselor, or call the police or children’s services and ask for help. Chronic abuse gets harder to recover from the longer it goes on. Don’t allow abusive people, even family, to cause you permanent physical or emotional damage. Get away from them as soon as possible.


Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at (800) 799-SAFE to talk about your situation and options.
Don't hesitate to dial 911 if you think you or another family member is in immediate danger.You aren’t going to get in trouble for reporting that someone else is breaking the law!

, If you are able to break ties with your abusive parent, do so. It is hard to give up on anyone you care about, especially family, but your primary responsibility is to take care of yourself. Don’t feel guilty for severing contact with your parent(s) if you feel it’s the best thing for you.


If you are not sure cutting off all contact is necessary, consider the amount of pain they cause you vs. the amount of happiness. Dysfunctional parents may show love sometimes, typically when it serves their own interests, but a little love now and then isn’t enough to justify staying in a bad relationship with anyone., You might think avoiding relationships altogether will prevent you from getting hurt any more or by anyone else, but human beings need social relationships to thrive. Children who grow up without a loving parent or an alternative parental figure are less successful, less happy, and physically sicker as adults.Keep talking to your friends and other family members regularly, go spend time with them whenever possible, and be open to meeting new friends and trustworthy adults.


Not every adult or loved one will end up treating you like your parent does. Don’t be afraid to give others a chance to love you.
Long-term loneliness can have serious health effects, worsening or even maybe causing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and neurological disorders. It may even cause cancer to spread faster., If your dysfunctional parents aren’t teaching you how to make it on your own after high school, ask another adult you trust how to prepare for the ""real world.""


Learn this like how to create a budget, how to do laundry, how to turn on the water heater in your first apartment.
Estimate the costs of independent living and what you will need to get started. Get a job and save up money for a security deposit on your first apartment and some furniture.
Maintain good grades despite trouble at home so you have the option of going to college. Ask your school counselor to help you find scholarships to pay for it.

Consider how your parents respond to your accomplishments.,
Think about any controlling behaviors that your parents use.,
Note a lack of emotional connection.,
Consider the boundaries between you and your parents.,
Reflect on any verbal abuse you have suffered.,
Identify narcissistic behaviors.,
Think about any parenting roles you played.,
Judge their behavior over what they say.",How to Cope With Being Unloved by Your Parents3," One sign of a toxic parent-child relationship is if your parents do not acknowledge your accomplishments in appropriate ways. This could mean that your parents either refuse to acknowledge when you accomplish something, or that your parents dismiss your accomplishments. Some parents may even ridicule your accomplishments.For example, if you get a good grade on a test, your parents should congratulate you for this accomplishment. If your parents are toxic, then they might ignore what you said, change the subject, make fun of you for being a nerd, or say something like, “So what? It’s just a test.”

, It is normal for parents to want to guide you, but parents who try to control your behavior may be toxic. This may range from small decisions like what to wear to school to larger decisions like where to go to college or what to major in. If you think that your parents exert a high amount of control over your decisions, then they may be toxic.For example, a parent who encourages you to make your own decisions might ask you questions about where you want to go to college and why; however, a parent who is exerting control over your decisions might tell you where you are going to attend college.

, Parents who have healthy relationships with their children show their emotional bond by making eye contact with their children, smiling at them, and offering affection in the form of hugs. If your parents have toxic behaviors, then they might not do any of these things.For example, a parent who shows appropriate emotional connection with his child might comfort her if she is crying; however, a parent who lacks an emotional connection with his child might ignore the child or yell at her to stop crying.

, Healthy boundaries are important in parent-child relationships. If you have good boundaries with your parent, then you should not feel like your lives are one and the same.For example, a parent who has healthy boundaries with her child might ask how her child's friends are doing, but would not insist on hanging out with her child and his friends.

, Verbal abuse is another form of toxic parenting. If your mother or father call you names, put you down, or just say things to hurt your feelings, then these are all forms of verbal abuse.For example, your parents should say things to build you up and make you feel good about yourself; however, you would feel bad if your parent said something like, “You’re worthless!” or, “I can’t stand to be in the same room with you!”
Some parents will be kind and reassuring one day and then mean and critical the next day. But keep in mind that this is still verbal abuse, even if your parents are not always cruel to you.

, Parents who are too focused on themselves to notice their children or to treat them properly can also be toxic. If your parents ignore you completely or only acknowledge you when you are doing something that they can brag about to friends, then this is an example of narcissistic parenting and it is toxic.For example, your parents should encourage you in your interests. A narcissistic parent, however, might only pay attention to you if your interests give him something to brag about, such as by telling all of his friends that you won a scholarship, even though he never asks about your studies or encourages you.
Some narcissistic parents may have a personality disorder (PD). A person with PD displays self-centeredness, refusal to accept personal responsibility, constant self-justification, a strong sense of entitlement, and shallow emotions. A parent with PD might treat children like a burden or roadblock to her own personal goals. She will typically rely on emotional manipulation to control her kids. People with PD are often hypercritical of their children and can be physically abusive or prone to endangering their child’s welfare.

, Some parents are too immature or have other problems (such as addiction) that make it hard for them to be effective parents, so a child ends up taking on some parenting duties. Consider whether you had to take on any parenting roles because your parent was not able or willing to care for you and/or your siblings. These may include things like cooking, cleaning, and caring for other children.Sometimes parents assign cooking and cleaning chores to teach children responsibility, but toxic parents may heap many responsibilities on one child to avoid having to do these things themselves. For example, a toxic parent who does not want to cook or clean may shirk these responsibilities and force one of his children to do all of the cooking and cleaning instead.

, Some children feel unloved even though their parents say that they love them regularly, because they don’t see this love reflected in how they are treated. Make sure you aren’t assuming you know how your parents feel about you without good reason.


For example, a parent who regularly says “I love you,” but who often ignores her children is not behaving in a way that shows love. Likewise, a parent who says that she wants her children to be independent, but never allows them to make any decisions is not behaving in a way that demonstrates what she says she wants.

Take turns initiating the conversation.,
Open with something creative.,
Take your time responding.,
Set up an opportunity to text your crush by doing something memorable in person.,
Ask open-ended questions.,
Use emojis and emoticons--if you want to.,
Keep your texts light and not too long.,
Tease your crush to set a fun, playful vibe.,
Don't send sexy pictures.,
End the conversation on a strong note.,
Don't keep texting if your crush stops responding.,
Flirt with your crush in person, too.",How to Flirt over Text Messages (for Teen Girls)," Try to keep things balanced between you--you shouldn't always be the one starting the conversation, but neither should your crush. If you realize you're always taking the lead, hold off and let your crush make the effort to reach out to you.If your crush never texts you first, then your time might be better spent on someone else. It's not fair for you to keep putting yourself out there when your crush won't do the same.;
, Of course ""Hey,"" and ""What's up?"" are fine greetings, but you're flirting, here! Try to send something that will immediately spark a conversation, or something that's a little cheeky, funny, and flirty to get your crush's attention. Try opening with lines like:


""This made me think of you!"" Send along with a link or funny picture that ties into an interest or joke you and your crush share.
""That thing you posted on Facebook was hilarious.""
""I had a super weird dream about you last night.""
""I bet you $5 that...."" or ""I dare you to..."", You don't have to set a timer to make sure you wait just the right amount of time before responding to a text, but you can amp up the excitement and anticipation if you stretch things out a little. Wait a few minutes before you send something back.


Keep in mind that on some phones you can see when the other person is typing.
You should also make sure you don't have ""read receipts"" enabled on your phone, which will show the other person exactly when you viewed his or her text.

, If you don't want to just text the person out of the blue, initiate a quick conversation about a new movie or upcoming game you know your crush is interested in. Then text later, referencing your earlier conversation. Maybe something about how you heard you need to sit through the end credits of the movie to see a secret scene, or that one of the star players has to sit out the upcoming game due to an injury.


If you tell your crush, ""I'll text you tonight,"" make sure you follow-through! Your crush might write you off or feel hurt if you don't text when you say you will.

, A response like ""k"" or even ""haha"" can stop a conversation in its tracks. You want to keep the conversation flowing, so ask questions that don't have yes or no answers. Ask about a recent event, or how that big math test went, or what he or she got up to over the weekend.


Ask your crush for any movie, music, or book recommendations. Try, ""I'm tired of all my music. What are you listening to?""
If your crush plays a sport, ask about the most recent game.
Talk about the things you have in common. If your crush has a hobby you are curious about, invite him or her to teach you more about it.

, Some people find emojis annoying, others will carry on entire conversations using only pictures. The benefit of using smiley- or winky-faces is that it can make the tone of your text clear. Sometimes it's hard to tell if someone is serious or joking around over text. A little winking face at the end of a teasing statement can let your crush know you're just messing.


Use emojis if you like them, just try not to overdo it. A well-placed wink can be very flirtatious!
Mix things up by sending funny pictures or animated gifs, too. If your crush says he or she is sleepy, send a gif of a cute puppy struggling to stay awake.

, Heavy subjects are usually better discussed in person or at least over the phone. While there's nothing wrong with getting into deep conversations with your crush, you might want to take the opportunity to suggest you continue the conversation over a slice of pizza. Say something like, ""It's too much for me to type everything out... Do you want to meet up and get some ice cream and I can tell you the whole story?""


Try not to send super long texts or respond to a single text with five or six messages. Try to get that balance so neither one of you is working harder at the conversation than the other., Gentle teasing is a classic flirting move. It's important he know you're not serious, so make sure you send a little smile or winky-face emoji to show that it's all in good fun.


You can poke fun at his dirty, lucky hat he always wears, or how she never puts down her guitar.
Or try, “Some friends are going bowling tomorrow night. Don’t come if you’re afraid of losing. To me.”
Don't let the teasing turn mean, and don't let the fun, light tone keep you from steering things toward romance. Think about your ultimate goal – is it to hang out? Or just start a dialogue? If you want to eventually hang out with your crush, start steering the conversation in that direction.When your crush teases you back, try something like ""Ooo, that hurt. You're going to have to buy me ice cream to make me feel better."", It may be tempting, and your crush may beg and plead and make lots of promises about privacy (which might be completely true), but this is a risk you don't want to take right now.If you and/or the recipient of the photos is under 18, sending naked photos is illegal. Even if you trust your crush would never show anyone else, it's possible a friend or even your crush's parents could find it.Think about if you and your crush have a falling out and you know that picture is still saved to his or her phone? What if the phone is stolen or the picture gets posted online or sent out? Is it really worth all the worry?Don't ever feel like you have to send a naked picture of yourself, just because your crush asked. If your crush cares about you and is worth your time, he or she won't pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable doing (or is a crime if you're under 18).

, You don't need to wait for the conversation to fizzle before saying goodbye. If you end the conversation on a high note, when things are still pretty lively, your crush will be anticipating your next interaction. Leave him or her with something to think about.


Don't end things too abruptly if you can help it. Instead of ""Gtg! Bye,"" let your crush know what you're up to. Something like, ""I gotta run! Going to a concert with Elizabeth!""
Tell your crush you're looking forward to picking up the conversation later.

, Maybe the conversation just died out naturally, or maybe you've sent your crush a few texts over the last week and gotten nothing back; whatever the reason, your crush has stopped responding to your texts. The last thing you want to do is send a million texts asking ""Hello? Did you get my text?!""


If it's something that is really bothering you, ask your crush what's going on when you see him or her in person.
If you invite your crush to do something and there's no response, don't wait around. Make other plans, keep living your life, and maybe post a bunch of pictures on Facebook so your crush knows what he or she is missing!

, Flirting over text is a great way to get over your nervousness and start to get to know your crush better, but don't use it to try and build a meaningful relationship. Don't be super playful and flirty with your crush over text, then ignore him or her in person. It's confusing, and your crush might think you're just messing with him or her.


If your crush is engaging you over text (giving you more than one word answers, initiating conversations), he or she is probably interested. Push your nervousness aside, be bold, and bring your flirtation into the physical world!
If you don't see your crush in person (maybe you live in different cites or even countries), try to transition into a phone conversation. You can tackle more personal subjects and really start to get to know each other.

Talk to your parent's doctor/nurse or carer.,
If the illness is severe, and you are the primary carer, you will have to be ready for care if and when they're discharged.,
Stay positive.,
Prepare yourself for what may lie ahead.",How to Cope when Your Parent Is at Hospital With a Severe Illness," Taking a simple jog or run can clear your mind and help you feel at ease. Exercising also releases endorphins, which help induce calming - if not exactly 'happy' - feelings.;
, Don't skip meals! You must take good care of yourself in order to have the energy needed to look after your loved one, and to cope emotionally. Sugary foods like chocolate are beneficial for coping with shock or stress, while berries and soups boost your immune system - many people can catch serious infections simply from visiting the hospital on a regular basis. Stay strong.

, You may have to take the role of responsible adult while they're in this powerless position, just as they did for you when you were young and vulnerable. Be patient, and you be will rewarded with insights that will help to create a stronger bond between you.

, For support. If you wish, you may request some time alone with your parent; this can provide comfort for some people.

, Writing out your thoughts and feelings is an important part of dealing with your situation, as if you don't get your feelings out in a constructive manner, you will only end up lashing out at someone else, and this doesn't help anyone. Start a journal or diary just for this occasion and decide whether or not you would like to share this with family members or your parent.

, Keep yourself surrounded by a support group of those who care about you and understand what you are going through. Go out for a meal, stay in and cook a meal, share a cup of tea or coffee, or work on a project together where possible. Don't be afraid to spend time on your own if you need some space to think, but don't become a recluse as this can damage your already fragile emotional state.

, Perhaps you've already spent, or are spending, several hours at the hospital. The air in hospitals can be drying, so make sure to bring plenty of bottled water with you to keep hydrated. Give yourself time to take walks in or around the hospital. If you visit the hospital along with other family members, consider starting a rota so that everyone can take some time out to relax.

, Read about your parent's illness and know what the next steps in the process might be. Prepare yourself as best you can for what may come next. Tell your parent that you love him/her as often as possible.

, Try not to feel frustrated about it but rather, use the experience to reflect upon how your parent must have met all of your childhood demands uncomplainingly when they, too, may have had tight schedules to consider. Doing this will help provide you with a sense of uniqueness and let you know just how dearly you've always been loved by them.

, It doesn't matter what religion you are - or whether you have a religion at all. This is a spiritual appeal to something greater than yourself, a way of expressing your feelings in the form of a prayer, either to a god/gods/goddesses or just the Universe itself. It will help you get through this difficult time.


Hope for the best. Sometimes the best thing you have is hope.

, They can tell you what's happening and reassure you.

, Crying is cleansing and helps release pent up emotions, washing bottled up 'stuff' out of your system. Don't be afraid to let the tears out; the supportive people you surround yourself with will understand.

, They'll know about the treatment they're being given and they'll be able to answer any questions you might have.

, Schedule accordingly, keep a small note pad and pen handy at all times, and keep a diary and record of medications and reports (in a file) as they may be needed later on as they progress with sessions.

, There's much to be said for remaining positive, as best you can, in this situation. Your parent may be fretting about the burden their situation has placed upon you. Remember, they're not used to this role reversal after having spent a lifetime being the responsible adult for you. If they can see or sense that you're 'holding up' and being positive, it can help alleviate some of that worry. The benefit for you is this: nothing is ever hopeless and the end only paves the way for a beginning. There is always hope. Positive thinking, if nothing else, alleviates some of the wear and tear of stress on you.

, Be prepared, but don't let forethought feel like you're giving up. Sadly, nothing can prepare you emotionally for a deterioration in a loved one's state. Being practically prepared, however, will mean far less stress for you and those around you, in the event the worst case scenario occurs. Consult the physician or nurse in charge and ask them to explain risks and any possible side effects which may arise from treatments.

Talk with a trusted friend.,
Visit a counselor.,
Write down your feelings in a journal.,
Don't rush to conclusions.,
Don’t snoop around.,
Check on your siblings.",How to Cope when You Find out Your Parent Is Having an Affair1," Find someone who is not directly involved, so it’s better not to choose your sibling, aunt or uncle. A good friend will not judge you for your feelings and will help you begin to sort through the information that you’ve learned., You are processing a lot of different feelings, from anger to sadness to frustration.It will be helpful to talk with a professional who has expertise in counseling about extramarital affairs, as they can offer insight that may not have occurred to you. They will also not judge your parents’ behavior and instead can offer an objective viewpoint.


They can also give you practical steps to coping with this situation.

, Journal writing is a good way to process your feelings and relieve stress.You don’t need to share your writing with anyone, and you can explore your most private concerns. This is a good way to begin processing how you feel and how you might approach talking to your parents about the issue.

, You are not in your parent's shoes and it is highly probable that you are not aware of the entire story. Marriages are challenging and both people contribute to their success. If there are problems, you may not have heard about them. Jumping to conclusions about what happened will not serve your relationship with either parent.

, It may be tempting to try to find evidence that your parent is cheating, but it’s not your place to do so. It’s not your marriage, and while you may feel betrayed by an unfaithful parent, you are still the child, not the spouse. Resist the temptation to scroll through your parent’s text messages or emails.

, If your siblings know about the situation, check on them to see how they’re doing. If you have younger siblings who still live at home, go for a walk together so that you can have some privacy. Talk to them about how they’re feeling and coping.


If your siblings don’t know about the affair, think very carefully whether telling them is a good idea. It’s not really your place to do so, and it could hurt them unnecessarily.

Remember what kind of parent they’ve been to you.,
Begin your new relationship with each parent separately.,
Decide how you’re going to treat the affair.,
Make it clear to each parent where you stand.,
Continue moving forward with your own life.",How to Cope when You Find out Your Parent Is Having an Affair2," Finding out that one parent has had an affair can rupture how you think about that parent. Your respect for them may be damaged and you may feel hurt and angry about their actions. Take into account what kind of parent they’ve been over the years. If they have been a kind, caring parent, remember that, as this defines your relationship with your parent, not the affair., In many cases, an affair spells the end of the cohesive family unit, and you will now have parents that live separately. Forming a relationship with the “new” version of your parent will help you move into a new phase, wherein you think of them as individuals instead of a team.Offer love and support to both parents. This is a difficult and confusing time for both parents, and knowing that you are offering love and support can help them through this situation.

, If you are planning to move forward and repair your relationship with your parent, think about how you’re going to treat the affair. You may not want to or need to forgive your parent who had the affair. However, don’t use it as a weapon against your parent, holding it over their heads whenever you argue or don’t get what you want.


The affair certainly doesn’t need to be swept under the rug, but it shouldn’t be trotted out every time you disagree with your parent.

, Your relationship with one parent should not tarnish your relationship with the other parent. One parent may feel like you’re taking sides or forgiving the cheating parent if you decide to repair your relationship with them. Sit down with each parent individually and tell them how you want to proceed in your relationships with them.


Let them know that your relationship with one parent does not impact your relationship with the other parent.

, While an unfaithful parent may threaten the future of your family, your own life is still in motion. You can take control of certain things in your life, which can be especially helpful when you feel like other things are far out of your control.


Ask both parents for advice and guidance, which will help continue repairing your relationship with both parents.

"
"
Tell your parents you don’t want to be in the middle.,
Do not involve yourself or take sides.,
Avoid over-identifying with one parent.",How to Cope when You Find out Your Parent Is Having an Affair3," In an unfaithful marriage, unfortunately, some parents may try to turn a child against the other parent. This is especially important if the children in the marriage are younger and still living at home.


It might be helpful to suggest that your parents see a counselor. You can lend an ear to your parent, but you should not be their primary shoulder to lean on.

, It is not your job to fix things or to make sure that one parent tells the other parent. While an unfaithful marriage can certainly impact you, the decisions that your parents make are their decisions, not yours.


Don’t report one parent’s activities back to the other parent, and don’t keep secrets for your parents. While it might seem harmless at the time, your parent is using you in a subtle way, and it can be really stressful for you.

, This can be hard to avoid, since you may feel like protecting the parent who was cheated on. But every marriage has two people who contribute, and there may be a larger story going on that you’re not aware of. Try to remain somewhat neutral, as it is not your marriage."

Decide what you want the outcome to be.,
Find a good time to talk.,
Begin with talking about your pain, not anger.,
Use “I” statements, not “you” statements.,
Try to remain calm.,
Have the conversation in manageable pieces.,
Focus on your parent’s behavior.,
Respect the resolution that your parents have decided on.,
Don’t confront if you intend to hurt your parent.",How to Cope when You Find out Your Parent Is Having an Affair4," Before confronting the parent, think about what you hope to achieve with a conversation. Bringing the issue out into the open can have serious consequences for the entire family, so think carefully about what you hope to achieve by confronting your parent. Your goal for this conversation might be:


Gathering information you’d like to know.
Conveying your feelings to your parent.
Repairing your relationship with your parent.
Assessing whether your parent is continuing the affair.

, Ask your parent when a good time would be to talk. Choose a time when neither of you is rushing off to work or school, and when you can both devote some time and mental energy to the conversation.

, Describe your feelings of pain and discomfort to your parent. Don’t start with accusations, but explain your feelings. It’s possible that your parent may not have anticipated how painful this process would be for you. When you do start talking about your anger, your parent will understand more clearly where the anger is coming from.


Start with something like, “I feel very hurt. I am having trouble sleeping and I keep crying. I am worried about the future of our family.”

, Keep the focus on how things make you feel, not on your judgments about the parent. Instead of blaming your parent, describe how things make you feel. Instead of saying, “You are a terrible person. How could you do this?,” you can say, “I feel hurt and upset.”

, This is a very emotional time for both of you, and remaining calm may be difficult. But it will be a more productive conversation if you do not resort to yelling, shouting insults, or making judgments.

, This is a giant conversation that you’re having with the cheating parent. They may be taken by surprise that you know what’s going on, or they may be very nervous or defensive. Tell them how you feel and then take some time for both of you to process where you’re at and how you’re feeling.


If your parent doesn’t want to discuss the issue, let them know that you’d like to talk about it but that you can give them some time before continuing the conversation., Keep the conversation revolving around your parent’s behavior, and how it may not fit into the roles that your parent has had in your life. The point is not to attack the person but to concentrate on the behavior that is causing you anguish.

, A parent may forgive the cheating parent, or they may kick them out of the house, or they may overlook this indiscretion. You might not agree with the way the issue is being handled, but this is not your marriage. They are finding the best resolution that works for both of them.


If you are still living at home, or you have siblings who still live at home, consider talking with your parents to let them know your concerns about how the unfaithful behavior might impact you or your siblings.

, Your parent’s behavior and actions may be deplorable, and they may be causing a major rift in your family, but this is a matter largely between your parents. You shouldn’t get in the middle of your parents or be used as a pawn."

If you're in class and you get a chance to pick partners or your teacher assigns you partners just sit and help him out like a normal girl.,
Make him laugh with your sense of humor.,

Make sure to hang out with him and mess around, e.g., telling funny jokes!,
If you wear uniform, do something to your uniform like add a badge or a brooch (not so big that it goes against school uniform rules) but just enough to show your style

If he goes to pick it up don't try to let him pick it up and just make sure when you get it from him you touch his hand. But make sure when you drop the book or whatever it seems natural not like you’re throwing it at him.;
, Take a chance, don't be scared. If he laughs you know you're doing well. Funny life stories usually make the boys laugh, but be sure the story does not make you look bad .

Apologize.,
Make repayments if necessary.,
Be careful with your actions and words.",How to Build Trust in Your Parents to Earn Your Stuff Back1," A simple first step that you can take is to apologize. Apologizing shows that you understand what you did and that it broke the trust between you and your parents. Apologizing can also demonstrate that you want to make changes and do the right thing next time. Try apologizing to show your understanding of the situation, rebuild trust, and have your privileges restored.Make sure your apology is genuine.
You could try saying something like ""Mom, Dad, I want to apologize for what I did. I get that it was wrong of me and I want to make things right.""
Having a good understanding of what went wrong can help you build a better apology.
Try giving examples that show your understanding of the situation. For example, you might say ""I see now that lying to you earlier was hurtful and makes it hard to trust what I say in the future."";
, If you've caused damage to something, you may need to either fix it or pay for it. By repairing something or replacing it, you can show that you've taken responsibility for your actions and understand how they damaged trust between you and your parents. Volunteering to fix or replace something you've damaged can be a good step in rebuilding trust and getting your things back.For example, maybe you broke something you “borrowed” without permission. Offering to either fix it or buy a replacement can demonstrate your understanding of the situation.

, Once you know what you can do to build trust again and get your stuff back, it's time to get to work. Focus on taking actions that you know are allowed by your parents, will demonstrate responsibility, and will build trust. Try to remember that this is more about your actions and choices, rather than simply getting your things back. Avoid any outbursts aimed at your parents. Try to speak respectfully, even if you disagree with something.
Be honest with your parents. Lying to your parents will only cause mistrust and may cause you to lose your things for even longer.
Always take responsibility for your actions.
Try to follow rules as closely as you can.
If you aren't sure you're allowed to do something, ask your parents first.

Take care of your chores without being asked. Make sure your homework is done and your grades are good. Your parents are much more likely to give you freedom if they can trust you to respect their rules.;
, Freedom is about being mature and responsible enough to take care of yourself. Prove that you are mature by accepting your current conditions. You can vocalize your feelings, but avoid fighting with your parents.

, It will be much harder for your parents to trust you if you're drinking, partying a lot, and hanging out with the 'wrong crowd.' If your parents don't like the way your friends look or dress, bring your friends home so your parents can see how awesome and nice they are.

, Let them know what's going on in your life, what your interests are, and what you find important. Ask them for advice. They'll be more inclined to see things your way if they understand your perspective as a person.

, If you want more freedom, you'll need to broach the subject in a mature and calm manner. You'll need to touch on several key points, so your parents can see how serious you are and how much you've considered their point of view. Make notes for yourself, so you don't forget to touch on every point (they're all important!)


Identify which freedoms you'd like i.e. a later curfew, permission to borrow the car, more computer time, permission to go to a concert, etc
Give them a few examples of things you've done recently that prove that you are trustworthy and dependable. Perhaps you get decent grades consistently, do your chores without complaints, or you are always home on time.
You might like to make a deal, for instance you could propose that you'll maintain a certain GPA if you're given an hour later curfew. Your parents may be more comfortable giving you extra freedom if they know you'll be working hard to keep it. If you don't have any ideas, ask them what you can do to gain the freedom you'd like.

, If your parents are not immediately on board, accept this decision. Becoming angry or upset will only prove to them that you are not yet mature enough to handle additional freedom. Continue your good behavior. Now that they know how you feel, they may take more notice and give you your freedom on their own.

, Eventually they'll see how hard you're working and reward your efforts.

, If you overhear your mother complaining about having to do the dishes, give her a surprise and do them for her.

, Don't answer back, use bad language, talk about adults behind their back or act bored when they are talking to you.

, Parents are humans too and can make mistakes. Instead of snapping back at them or patronizing them, be mature and try to understand their situation. Ignore the aspects which you don't like and instead focus on what you like in them.

, It is not easy to be parent. As a child we are not even aware of the hard times they may have gone through while raising us when we were infants and toddlers. Recognize their good qualities and appreciate them for all the good they have done for you.

, Treat them as you want them to treat you, do this with everybody. If your siblings are younger, help them. When they want to play with you, play with them (unless you are doing chores or homework; then tell them no politely). They look up to you and admire you so set a good example.

Finish your homework, even if you think you don't know it. Many teachers give completion points, even if the answers aren't perfect.
Try to find subjects that you're interested in and get lost in them. School can be an educational journey that is truly exciting.
Talk to your teachers. Your teachers have your best interest at heart. They want to see you learn, have fun, and succeed.;
, You may not want to flip burgers or work retail, but the job is less important than the attitude you bring with you. If you are smart, engaging, and work hard, your employers will notice. That extra money coming in will be pretty useful, too.


Make a resume of your accomplishments, and bring it with you when you look for jobs. A resume is a list of all the things that make you employable.
Look presentable for your job interview. You only make a first impression once.
Smile and be yourself. Most people will like you for who you are; the people who don't aren't worth convincing.

, When you're a teen, it's a good idea to start practicing good habits, and health is one of them. Visit your doctor and dentist regularly so that you can live your life without worrying about your health. Here are a couple tips to help keep the doctor away:


Eat healthy. Avoid excessive junk food and fast food. Try to experiment with eating lots of different fruits and vegetables.
Exercise often. Try to move your body for at least 30 minutes every day. This will make you feel and look better.
Avoid drugs. Drugs can harm your physical and mental development, putting you in serious risk of your life. If you want to be healthy, stay away from drugs.

, Teen bodies are constantly changing. Your body is going through some pretty significant hormonal changes, so make sure that you shower and take care of other basic hygiene. Don't be afraid to go to a doctor or ask your parents about anything you are uncomfortable or uncertain about.


Brush your teeth, wash your face, and try not to be dirty.
Experiment with different styles, but always groom. Grooming means taking care of yourself so that you are presentable to other people.

, This goes hand in hand with maintaining good hygiene. Wearing clean clothes will communicate to other people how confident you are in yourself.


Talk with your parents about how often they want the laundry done. You may have to start doing your own laundry.
For job interviews, family gatherings, and other important events, you may want to invest in a nice suit or dress.
Above all else, wear clothes that express who you are. Being responsible doesn't mean dressing a certain way. Being responsible means knowing what's acceptable and fitting your own personal style within that framework.

, Keep your room organized. Your parents shouldn't have to clean up after you like maids. Cleaning up after you make a mess says that you're mature and respectful of their time and feelings.


Hang your clothes up or put them in drawers. Your clothes will look nicer on you if you put in the energy to hang them up or fold them.
Make your bed after you sleep in it. A made bed feels better to jump into at night.
If you make a mess, clean it up. Offer to clean the dishes after dinner. Help clean up the backyard if you throw a birthday party.

, Every parent wants what's best for their kids. Believe it or not, your parents were also kids, once upon a time, so they definitely know what you are going through. Being honest with your parents will give them feedback about what's working and what isn't, and it will help you communicate better.


Tell your parents where you're going and who you're going out with. Your parents care about your safety.
Tell your parents when you're feeling good and when you're feeling bad. They want to celebrate your happiness and have an obligation to help you when you're sad.
Ask for their advice. Your parents might have some tricks up their sleeve, or tell you amusing stories, or suggest solutions.

, Parents appreciate it when you take some time out of your day to tell them what's going on in your life. You don't have to tell them every intimate detail of your life, just let them in on what's important to you.


Tell them about something funny that happened at lunch or that test that you took.
Ask them about their work, their friends, their goals. Listening is just as important as speaking.

, Empathy is putting yourself in other peoples' shoes. Empathy is the opposite of selfishness. Practicing empathy will help you develop emotionally, and help you develop friendships.


Show others respect, even if they don't respect you. Those people will learn to respect you.
Don't lash out at other people. Keep your temper in check, even in difficult situations.
Help others if possible. Helping others doesn't need to mean giving them something. It can mean lending a hand, or listening, or offering advice.

Take your time.",How to Build Trust in Your Parents to Earn Your Stuff Back2," If you don't know exactly what it was you did wrong or how you can rebuild a feeling of trust, getting your things back can be difficult. Although it can be tough, talking with your parents about the problem can be the best way forward. After you learn what the problem is by sharing your thoughts and feelings, you can take direct steps to rebuild trust and get your things back.Don't be afraid to ask your parents why you are in trouble. Say something like ""I understand that I did something wrong, but I'm not sure what exactly is wrong with it.""
It's okay to share your side of things with your parents and honestly talk about how you feel.
Having an honest and civil discussion with your parents can be a great first step to show maturity and rebuild trust.
Even if your parents are mad, avoid yelling at them or speaking with any kind of sarcastic tone.

, If you don't feel like there is a clear way forward, rebuilding trust can seem impossible. Knowing exactly what you can expect from your good behavior can help you know how to act, what to do, and how you can get your stuff back. Ask your parents for some details about when and how you can have your privileges back.

Ask your parents what behavior they expect from you in the future. You might say ""I want make up for what I did. What can I do to show that?""
Ask your parents when you can expect your things or privileges restored. Try asking something like ""How long can I expect to wait before I get my things back?""

, It can be pretty obvious when you've done something to make your parents upset. However, this doesn't always make it easier when you're trying to do what's right. Asking your parents to let you know when your doing the right thing can help rebuild trust and demonstrate that you are trying to make things right.You could ask your parents something like ""I want to do the right thing and apologize for what I did. It would be nice to hear when I do the right thing. I think this will help me focus on what to do next time.""

, Restoring trust between you and your parents won't happen overnight. Anytime trust is broken, it will take some time before it is restored. Don't be in a rush to rebuild trust and get your stuff back faster. For now, focus on doing the right thing in the future and avoid doing anything that might make the situation worse."
"
Wait for your privileges or things to be returned.,
Avoid damaging trust in the future.,
Ask your parents about what's allowed.",How to Build Trust in Your Parents to Earn Your Stuff Back3," When rebuilding trust, it's mostly a matter of time. You'll need to demonstrate good behavior, good choices, and a good understanding of your responsibilities. If you act in a way that is consistently trustworthy, your privileges and things will be returned to you soon.

, Trust between you and your parents can be fragile. Building up trust can take a long time, while breaking it can take only a few seconds. While you are trying to restore or maintain your parent's trust in you, always avoid doing anything that could cause more trouble. Try to avoid some of these behaviors to keep you on track, maintain trust, and keep your stuff:Yelling, angry outbursts, or screaming can all take away the feeling of trust that feelings can be shared openly.
Don't break important rules that your parents have given you. For example, sneaking out at night to hang out with friends can get other privileges taken away from you.
Don't lie to your parents. If you've been caught, lying about things can only make your situation worse.

, If you are ever unsure if something would be okay or not, ask your parents. It's a lot easier to ask and be told “no”, than it would be to break your parent's trust and rebuild it. Although it might not be easy to ask your parents, doing so can show your consideration for their rules, demonstrate respect, and help keep the feeling of trust strong. Always check with you parents before doing anything you think might break their trust and cost you some of your things or privileges.


You could try saying ""I was wondering if I could stay out an hour later than normal with my friends. I know I'm not usually allowed, so I thought I would ask.""
Don't get upset or argue if your parents say ""No"" after you ask.

Now it's time to stop wearing ripped jeans and T-shirts with offensive messages on them.,
Don't wear too much jewelry.

,
Don't wear too much make up, parents hate that!,
There are a few ways to style your hair, under 14's could try pigtails, any age group could try half up and half down, it's cute and parents like to see their daughters looking cute.

,
Take a bath.,
Use deodorant and perfume, but not too much perfume, save up to buy these yourself though.

","How to Be an Obedient, Well Behaved Child2"," Try wearing colours like pink and baby blue, maybe lavender, or neutral colors.

,, If you are 5-9 years old, do not wear make up, if you are 10 or 11 years, then try some pretty lip gloss in a cute flavour, when you turn 12 maybe try blush, depending on how strict the parent is. If you are 13 then try mascara too.

,, Parents/guardians shouldn't have to nag you to take a shower/bath, do it anyway, but ask permission first, if they say no, don't argue.

Remember your Manners.,
Don't talk at dinner time unless asked a question.

","How to Be an Obedient, Well Behaved Child3"," If your parents are talking but you have a question, don't interrupt, wait until they are done. Say please and thank you. If you burp, remember to say excuse me. If someone asks you to pass the salt/pepper/sugar etc, do it immediately. Hold the door for people, stuff like that.

Join a club or organization to spend time away from home.,
Volunteer to have a good reason to be out.,
Pick up a hobby to spend time on your own.,
Get a job to have a responsible reason to be away from home.,
Ask to spend time at friends' houses.,
Pick up responsibilities at home to earn trust.,
Don't break your parents trust.",How to Avoid Your Parents Without Hurting Their Feelings1," If you're looking for a little time away from your parents, consider joining something they'd approve of that lets you get away for certain periods of time. For example, you could join an educational club that you feel passionate about or become a part of the yearbook or newspaper staff. That way, your parents won't worry about you being away from them, and you have a good excuse for some away time., You can also fill your time by volunteering. Your parents will view this activity as a responsible, caring thing to do, and you'll get to spend time somewhere away from your parents. Look around in your area, and figure out where you'd be a good fit. You'll find a wide variety of places to volunteer. Plus, volunteering will look good on your resume or college application.For instance, you could read to younger kids at the library or volunteer at your local church.
You could also help build houses with Habitat for Humanity or help sort food at a food bank.

, If you need to be at home but you still want to be away from your parents, consider picking up a hobby that requires you to be alone to practice or work on it. For example, you could learn an instrument, plant a garden, learn to draw, take up jogging, or learn yoga. In fact, you could even convince your parents to let you take a class so you'd have time away from home and need to spend time at home working on it.

, Another way to spend some time away from your parents is to get a job. Of course, you need your parents' permission to get a job, but your parents can likely be persuaded to let you as long as you keep your studies up. Many fast food places hire teenagers, so look around in your area.Check around at the places you visit to see if any of them are hiring.
Present the case to your parents. Explain the reasons why getting a job would be beneficial to your development. For example, you could say, ""I'd like to get a job. Getting a job would teach me to be more financially responsible and allow me to at least make my own spending money. In addition, it will give me valuable experience for the future. I promise that my school work won't suffer, as I know you want me to do well in school.""

, This tactic works best if your parents like your friends, so try to pick the friends that your parents approve of. See if you can go over to their house certain nights a week to do homework or spend nights on the weekend. Most parents understand you want to spend time with friends.Of course, you need to get an invitation to stay over from your friend and your friend's parents first. If you're already on good terms with them, you can even ask politely if they've allowed you to stay over in the past.
You could ask your parents, ""Would it be alright if I spent Tuesday and Thursday evenings at Georgia's house for awhile? We're working on a project for trig together, and I already have permission from her parents."" Of course, if you say that, you really should be working on a project together.
If you need to ask your friend's parents, you could say, ""Mr. and Mrs. Jones, can I ask you a favor? Georgia and I will be working on a project together for trig, and I was wondering if we could work here two nights a week. I understand completely if you don't want to have me over that much, but I promise we'll work diligently and be quiet."" You can also ask your friend to work on her parents.

, You know that your parents like you to take care of things around the house. In fact, you probably already have assigned chores. Make sure you get your chores done on time. On top of that, if you notice something else that needs to be done, pick it up. The reason this step is important is because the more responsibility you take on, the more your parents will trust you to go out on your own. If you can go out on your own, you can avoid them more without actively rejecting their affections at home.You can also show responsibility in other areas, such as making sure you get your homework in on time and trying not to fight with your siblings.You can also be sure to drive safely and not get tickets when you're out and about.

, If you're trying to gain more independence, you need your parents to trust you. That means following their rules and doing what you say you're going to do. It also means trying not to make bad decisions like drinking alcohol or sneaking out late at night."

Figure out what you want before you talk to your parents.,
Ask them to sit down with you.,
Tell them what you want.,
Expect reasonable boundaries as a teen.,
Realize that setting boundaries may hurt your parents' feelings.",How to Avoid Your Parents Without Hurting Their Feelings2," When talking to your parents, you need to be able to know exactly what you want. Do you just want to be able to have some alone time, or do you really feel like you need some new responsibilities to be more independent? Maybe you feel like your parents don't trust you or respect your person, and by trying to avoid them, you're really just trying to develop your own independent self. Before you talk to your parents, try to sort out your feelings and figure out what you hope to gain.Try writing about your feelings. Ask yourself questions like, ""Why do I want to avoid my parents?"" and then let yourself be free to write down what you're feeling. Look at what you've written to figure out what you want.
For instance, if you really are just trying to be more independent, talk to your parents about how you can earn their trust and ways you can start to do things on your own.

, You don't want to ambush your parents at a bad time. If they're busy getting dinner ready, they won't be able to focus on you and what you need. Therefore, it's best to set up a time with them so they'll be ready to put their attention on you.For example, you could say, ""Hey, I'd like to sit down and talk to you at some point about something. When would be a good time when I'd have your full attention?""

, Of course, you don't want to be mean. However, once you've figured out what you want from your parents, you need to tell them. Start with how you're feeling, and move on to what you'd like them to do to help you change that.For example, you could say something like, ""I've been feeling restless lately. I feel like I'm getting old enough to be trusted to go out on my own more. I feel upset when you don't trust me enough to do that. I'd like to prove to you that I'm responsible enough to be trusted, but I need your input on how to do that.""
Don't blame your parents. Rather, talk about your emotions to help your parents understand.

, As you are still a teen, your parents need to know where you are most of the time. While it can be annoying, giving your parents an idea of what you'll be doing can help put them at ease. Plus, they know where to find you in case of an emergency.Remember that your parents love you and have your best interest at heart. Also, remember that they're human. They've watched you grow up, and of course, they're going to feel protective of you. Realize that it's going to be hard for them to let go.

, No matter how you go about it, setting a boundary or asking for space may cause your parents to get emotional.That's natural. However, if you're calm and respectful about it and help your parents see that you just want to be your own person, all of you can move forward with a healthier relationship.

Schedule regular time with your parents.,
Tell them you'll call them instead of waiting for them to call you.,
Get busy to have an excuse not to see them.,
Try to be financially independent so you're not obligated to see them.,
Handle your responsibilities.",How to Avoid Your Parents Without Hurting Their Feelings3," One way to help avoid unexpected visits is to schedule regular time with your parents. That way, they know exactly when they'll get to see you, and they won't be as tempted to just drop by. Try scheduling a once a week or bi-monthly time to get together.You could say, ""I love spending time with you two, so I'd like to set up a time where we can get together on a regular basis. That way, I know I'll get to see you.""

, If you tend to be busier than your parents are because they've retired, then you may not want to drop everything when they call. In that case, it's appropriate to say that you'll call them. Just be sure you do it fairly regularly. They are your parents, after all., If you are newly out of your home, you may need to find an excuse to be away from home. Of course, you want to visit, but you also need to establish your new life away from your parents. In that case, joining an organization in your community or college or even a sorority or fraternity if you're in college can help you keep your distance when you need to.This tactic can be especially good if it's something that will give you career experience, let you network, or look good on your resume.

, If you ask your parents for a loan or are dependent on them when you go off to school for spending money, it can be harder to avoid them when you need to. When you're financially obligated to someone, you must be in contact with them from time to time. Save up what money you can, and as often as possible, turn to other options besides your parents., If you're newly out of the house, it's time to start being responsible for yourself. That doesn't mean you can't call your parents for advice. Of course you can. However, try to handle the small details of day-to-day life on your own, including things like scheduling dental appointments, talking to the registrar's office if you're in school, and getting your oil changed on your car.If you're constantly dependent on your parents, it can be harder to break away from then when you need some space.
If you're in a bind at college, talk to your advisor or even your residential hall supervisor. They're there to help your figure out your way at school.

Pluck up your courage.,
Be cool and confident.,
Ask the guy for his phone number.,
Be casual in asking.,
Be a chicken.,
Don't be devastated if he says no to giving you his number.,
Have a friend pass the number to you.,
Use the phone number sparingly once you have it.",How to Ask a Guy for His Phone Number (Girls Only)," When you spot the guy away from friends (if preferred) and in a quiet spot where you can't be misheard, gather your wits about you and head in his direction.;
, There is no need to pretend you're there for any other reason than to ask for his number. He'll respect your confidence and chutzpah if you make it clear you made a beeline for him just for this purpose.


Some people advise pretending to go up for some other reason, such as wanting help with a forgotten homework question or wanting to know something. That might work if you're feeling really timid but it can also backfire in that that's the only thing you'll end up asking, as your courage fails you. Moreover, it'll soon become clear to the guy that asking for his help was just a ruse, which can show you're able to lie. Not a great start.

, Avoid beating around the bush, seeming coy or making a joke about it. All you need to do is get to the point. Guys are taught to get to the point early on, without resort to wiles and in the twenty-first century, it's somewhat odd that some gals feel they still have to play the game of coyness. So you can do this too, it's not unreasonable to get to the point.

, You don't need to be blunt but you do need to be clear, and by being casual, you can achieve a smooth request.


Say something casual on the lines of ""Hey, can I have your number to text you sometimes?"" Simple. Then say thanks, and walk away. At this point, he'll anticipate your text, and you'll have his number.
You don't need to explain the request but if you want to, keep it simple, such as ""it'd be super helpful if I could reach you by text""; or ""I'd just like to be able to reach you easily to ask you to some of the dorm parties we'll be throwing soon"".
If he asks you why you want his number, keep it simple. For example, say something like ""I'd like to keep in contact with you, I think you're really cool"" or ""You give me good advice"" or ""You're good fun"" .

, If it is really, really hard for you to be open about getting his number, use studies or work or something to get the number. Ask if you can review test subjects with him and he will most likely give you his number.


Or, approach the guy casually and show him your phone. Show him your contacts and then say: I really want to beat my friend and see who has the most contacts by the end of the day so.. can I get your number? (Don't sound pushy or greedy or excited, act as if you're telling this to your parents.)
The problem with using any ruse is that this is all he'll probably expect you to text about, unless he has made it openly clear he fancies you. If you start texting constantly about anything unrelated, he's likely to be unimpressed.

, There are lots of possible reasons, from wondering why you're asking out of the blue to not being allowed to give his number to people. Or he might not know you that well and feels that this is awkward.


Get to know him before you ask for his phone number again. There is another chance!
Say thanks for his consideration. End politely with something like: ""No worries, just thought I'd ask. I can understand if you feel it's a bit much from someone you don't really know yet. Maybe another time.""

, This is fraught with the potential annoyance this guy might feel towards his friend or even a sense of betrayal but if you work with it carefully, and don't abuse having the number, it might be okay sometimes.


Don't dump the friend in it; be vague and say that ""someone"" offered his number to you without specifying exactly who. Or, if there is a plausible reason for seeing his number, such as on a phone tree for sports practice, or something, you have a legitimate out for saying you saw it that way. Although, little white lies aren't a good start to anything.

, You don't want to end up in the situation where he so regrets that you got hold of his number that he goes and changes it just to be rid of your texting and calls! The phone number is just a small step in growing your relationship, so spend a lot of time on all the other important aspects, such as getting to know him face-to-face and hanging out together. Use the phone as a tool to make meet-ups, not an excuse to pour out your heart.


Don't text him too much. Good job if you get his number, but don't annoy him and make him regret his decision. Be mature with what you say, and have fun!

If your date is late, keep your cool. Head to a nearby coffee shop if you know you have the time, but don’t order anything that will give you bad breath. Whatever you do, don’t scold your date for being tardy; it will kill the mood. Keep in mind though, you were early. If they are 20 minutes late, that's half an hour you have been hanging around all together. Being late is rude and shows a lack of consideration and ability to plan unless it's completely unavoidable.
Scolding your date would be a mood killer, but don't just act like nothing happened. Ask why they are late and if you have another date, don't tolerate them being late again.

, If it’s appropriate, throw in a brief kiss while you’re at it.









This will mainly apply to female dates. Try to compliment your date casually like ""You look nice"" rather than going over the top with things like ""I like your dress"". There's nothing wrong with complimenting your date's clothing but they want to know that you like their whole look, not just one thing they put on.

, A romantic comedy is cute and will encourage kissing and intimacy, but could seem a little much for a first date. Comedy will diffuse tension and relax you and is a good choice for people moving from friendship to romance. Horror movies are exciting and since you're scared, you're able to snuggle together and break the touch barrier. Keep in mind both of your own personal tastes and look in to reviews and ratings beforehand.








, They won't get stuck in your teeth like popcorn or give you bad breath like hotdogs. This is especially important if kissing is on the menu.








, Even if your date doesn’t think it’s rude, everyone else will.








, Make sure your hand is warm and dry, not cold or sweaty. Putting your hand under your leg for a few minutes is a great way to warm it up in a chilly theater.









Some girls like it when guys put an arm around them. However, if it’s a first date and the other couples around you are making out, putting your arm around her might make her think that you’re trying to make out, too.
Don't do anything that you aren't comfortable with regardless of what the people around you are up to.

, This is the perfect opportunity to make easy conversation and end the night on a personal note.








, A good night kiss at the theater is sweet, but if you don't kiss on the first date then a thank you is the only thing needed.

He or she obviously is being considerate by offering you the choice, and by making one, you're showing you can be decisive., For instance, a movie isn't a good idea because you can't get to know the other person. Try coffee or visiting a museum. Take some time to talk and connect., Being late says you don't respect his or her time, so show up at the time you agreed on or a little earlier., If you're trying to act indifferent, you're not going to make a connection with the person. Just be your usual self, emotions and all.For instance, if your date brings up a movie you really like, don't just say, ""Oh, I thought that was pretty good."" Don't be afraid to show your enthusiasm: ""I really liked that movie! I loved how the main character evolved over the course of the film.""

, Unless you're a doctor on call, you don't need your phone out. Show the other person that you respect her or his time and attention enough to not interrupt it with texting or talking on the phone., If you're too tense, it will come across to your date. Take a moment to relax yourself so you can enjoy the time your spending with him or her., Dating should be fun, not torture. Plus, if you enjoy yourself, your date will enjoy him or herself more, too.

, Every conversation is give and take, so take time to listen to your date, truly listen. That is, hear what the other person is actually saying instead of just thinking about what you're going to say next. Respond in kind to show you heard him or her.If your date says something such as, ""I enjoy gardening,"" don't launch into how you have a black thumb. Ask some questions, such as, ""Oh really? What do you like to plant? Do you have a big garden?""

, Everyone likes to hear nice things about him or herself.

If you are the one planning the date, try something besides the typical dinner-and-movie. Go hiking, to an arcade, or to a science museum, for example. Doing something active and interesting will take some of the pressure off conversation and allow you and your date to relax more.
Ask what your date has in mind if he is planning it. If it’s a secret, simply ask what type of setting it is, like outdoors, active, or fancy. When in doubt, opt for something comfortable that you can move around in, especially in regards to shoes.;
, Build up your confidence before the date by doing something that makes you feel good about yourself. Give yourself a pep talk, visualize the date going really well, or think about another time that you accomplished something big in your life.


Try standing in front of a mirror and encouraging yourself! While it may feel silly, giving yourself a pep talk can really put you in a good mood before your date. Try telling yourself something like, “I am happy with myself and happy to have this date, so no matter what happens, I’ll have fun!”Think of another occasion in your life for which you were really nervous, but which went really well after all. Imagine that feeling of relief and accomplishment when you completed what you set out to do. Know that there’s no reason you can’t feel the same way with this date!

, Plan to give yourself ample time to get ready before your date, whether that means showering and getting dressed, doing hair and makeup, or just giving yourself a little pep talk in the mirror. Don’t put yourself in a position where you have to rush, otherwise you’ll be flustered right from the beginning of the date.


You probably already have a good idea of how long it takes you to get ready, so stick to that. You don’t need to do anything extra to your appearance beyond what makes you feel good about yourself. Your date already knows and expects your normal look.
Avoid getting ready too far in advance, which may make you antsy or more nervous when you finish getting ready and have to wait till the date starts. This could also increase the chance of you getting your clothes dirty, hair messed up, makeup smudged, etc.

, Make sure you’re on the same page with your date about how, when, and where you’re meeting up. This will avoid any confusion or awkwardness that could ruin your date from the start if there’s any miscommunication.


Communicate with your date about whether one of you is picking the other up and where, or if you’re meeting at an agreed-upon spot. If the latter, decide on a recognizable landmark to meet at. “I’ll meet you outside the main doors of the theater,” for example, or “Let’s meet at the horse statue in the park.”
Be on time to the date. Being “fashionably late” won’t be impressive to your date and will only make her worried you’ve stood her up., Say hello when you meet up with your date. Go in for a quick but friendly hug to show that you’re happy to see him and are open to getting close (if you're comfortable with that).


Try cracking a quick joke to diffuse any awkwardness, or even acknowledging that you’re nervous. This will either make your date feel less alone if he's nervous too, or seek to make you feel comfortable throughout the date.
Wave your date in from the car if he is picking you up and honks from the driveway. You can avoid an awkward car hug and chat casually with him while you do something natural, like pull on your coat or grab your purse and get ready to go., Let your date know you’re having a good time by remembering to smile and maintain eye contact, which shows her you’re listening and enjoying yourself. Avoid forcing any facial expression, but try to keep it pleasantly neutral.


If you have difficulty keeping up eye contact, try imagining a triangle formed between your date’s two eyes and mouth. Shift your gaze to a different point on that triangle every five to ten seconds so you don’t feel like you’re staring but still appear interested in the other person.Don’t force a smile or laugh when it doesn’t feel genuine. A natural smile will result from funny or pleasant conversation from your date, or as a result of mimicking her own smile — if your date isn’t making you smile, perhaps she isn't right for you!

, Show your interest in being physically close to your date if both of you feel comfortable with it. You don’t need to make a big move but can simply sit or stand close to your date whenever possible.


Try sitting on the same side of the table at a restaurant to be closer, or on an adjacent side so you can reach out and touch your date but still be able to make eye contact.
Remember that people respond very differently to personal space and touch. Your date might love you reaching out to touch his hand and will smile or touch you back. Or he may pull away and express physically or verbally his discomfort with that. Respect your date’s wishes and feelings either way.
Keep in mind, too, your own boundaries when it comes to physical contact. Before you go out, think about your comfort level with physical closeness and intimacy on a first date. Knowing this ahead of time can help you set boundaries with the person. If he gets too touchy or swoops in for a kiss, you can say, ""Hey, I really like you, but I like to take things a little bit slower,"" or, ""I'm not quite ready for that.""

, If you’re on a date with an activity that costs money, offer to split the check with your date. Or you can even pay for the whole thing yourself if you wish. Don’t assume that the other person will pay for you, and don’t offer to pay it all yourself if you don’t intend to. Avoid playing games and keep it equal and honest.


You can say upfront at dinner, “This one’s on me,” if you’d like to offer to pay or, “Let’s split dinner, okay?” This will eliminate any awkwardness when the check comes.
If your date insists on paying the whole check, don’t push it and accept gratefully, with a promise to get the next thing you’ll do together. You can say “Thanks, that’s really sweet of you. I’ll get the movie tickets for us!”, Speak up and don’t be afraid to show you have an opinion about what you talk about with your date. Avoid letting your date decide everything or saying you’re interested in something you’re really not.


For instance, if your date suggests a steakhouse for dinner and you’re a vegetarian, speak up and tell her so, and recommend a restaurant or type of cuisine you love instead.
During a date, avoid the “I don’t care, what do you want?” answer when your date asks you what you’re going to eat or what you’d like to do or share. Give an honest answer of your preference., Take the first date as an opportunity to learn a lot of new information about your date and what you have in common. Ask him questions about things you both like or something in his life you’d like to know more about.


Try asking about school, work, hobbies, TV shows, books, movies, family, etc. Most people avoid discussing topics like politics, religion, and former girlfriends/boyfriends, but do whatever feels natural to you and what you’re interested in.You could ask, “Hey, I saw that you were wearing a Star Wars shirt the other day. What did you think of the newest movie?”, or, “So, you moved to the U.S. from Europe? Tell me more about what it was like to live there!”
Asking questions also doesn’t have to feel like an interview or interrogation of your date’s life. You can simply ask about the music he has playing in the car, or another similar observation about your surroundings., Allow the focus to be on you for a bit and tell any funny or interesting stories you have about a topic. This is an easy way to keep the conversation going, and get your date to tell you some stories, too.For example, if she asks you about your family, instead of simply saying you have a brother, you could say, “I have an older brother named Scott. He’s traveling in Peru right now! He’s always been really adventurous. One time, on our summer vacation, he did the craziest thing…”
If you’re worried about dominating the conversation, keep stories short. Then prompt your date with, “Do you have any stories about your family? Tell me about them.” That will keep the conversation equal.

, Subtly suggest another date at the end of the first one if all went well. Tell your date to call or text you, or offer a suggestion of what you can do together next.


Try bringing up something that was talked about during the date, like an activity you both enjoy or something you’re interested to learn more about. For instance, you could say, “So when can I play that new video game you got?”, or, “I really want to check out that hiking trail you mentioned if you’ll show me sometime.”Say goodbye with another friendly hug. Don't feel pressured to kiss on the first date, unless you feel like you want to!

, Unfortunately, things don't always go quite the way we planned, and a date can take a turn for the worst — things can begin to feel uncomfortable or your date may turn out to be rude or inappropriate. You may be tempted to try and ""stick it out"" for the sake of being polite, but you absolutely don't have to. If the date didn't go very well and your date suggests extending the evening by going out for drinks or dessert, you can simply say, ""Dinner was delicious, but I'm not up for drinks after...""

If your date is being inappropriate and rude and making you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, call him out on it. You don't have to be mean. You can say, ""That's really offensive,"" or, ""I don't think that's funny; it's actually really rude and I want you to stop,"" or even just, ""I'm feeling really uncomfortable right now."" If he doesn't stop the behavior, cut the date short. Ask for the check or give him money for your share of the bill and get out of there. Call a cab, a friend, or a parent to pick you up if you need to.
If the date was fine but you're just not feeling it, it's okay to say that, too. You can say, ""I really like you, but I'm definitely getting more of a 'friend' vibe. Are you feeling that, too?""You have no obligation to spend any more time with your date than what feels comfortable. Don't worry that you're being rude or mean by ending a date prematurely. The most important thing is that you take care of yourself.

Look into your date’s eyes.,
If your gaze is returned, lean closer.,
If your date leans closer, move in for the kiss.",How to Act on a Movie Date2," Hold your gaze a little longer than you’re used to but don’t stare.









Only try this during a non-essential moment of the movie. If your date is watching attentively, you might miss your chance.
Be sure you’ve already broken the touch barrier; kissing shouldn’t be attempted before things like handholding.;
, Your body language will let your date know that a kiss is in order.









If your gaze isn’t returned, just smile and look back at the movie. Don’t give up hope yet; your date might just be nervous.

, Starting off with a closed-mouth kiss is a safe bet; it’s better to leave them wanting more than to scare them away with unexpected tongue.









If you panic at the last second and don’t move in for the kiss, just laugh it off and try again later. This will break the tension and keep the pressure off.
If you plan to kiss; you and your date might want to head to the back. Nothing ruins a moment more than getting ugly stares from the people around you.

, Don't try too hard with your appearance, especially if this is your first date.








,, At the very least, you should be able to cover the cost of your own ticket and snacks, but it’s better to bring too much than too little, especially in case you decide to go somewhere else after the movie.









Be prepared for the possibility that you will have to pay for your date – whether as a gesture or because (s)he forgot to bring money.
Having cash on hand is a good idea, since some places don’t accept debit/credit cards.
Consider bringing emergency funds; chances are you won’t have to use it, but if you do, it’ll make you seem reliable.

Accessorize with your handmade jewelry.
Choose a great pin-up dress if you're into vintage.

, Don’t try to impress your date by acting like you’re someone you’re not. Being yourself will create a longer-lasting impression because people can tell when you’re being authentic. Not only that, but you’ll have a much better time if you’re able to relax and just be you.

, A great attitude makes an impression on someone. Show your date that you have a zest for life and are happy to be out with them, and they’ll be more likely to get you stuck in their mind.Gush about the activity. Say, “I’m so excited we decided to try this!”

, Everyone loves to hear good things about themself, especially from someone they’re out on a date with.

If they’re feeling good about the date, then they’ll likely be feeling good about you, too.Say, “That shirt looks great on you,” or “Wow, I think those are the coolest shoes I’ve ever seen.”
If they’re wearing a brand or style you’re familiar with, comment on it. Say, “I see you’re a fan of leather, too. That’s a great jacket.”

Make eye contact and nod along.
Repeat part of what they said back to them to show that you’re listening and care about what they say. For example, say, “Wow, I can’t believe that your lost dog walked across the state to get back to you. It’s so great that you guys were reunited.”

, While you want to know a lot about your date and want the conversation to keep moving, don’t just ask them a bunch of questions. You don’t want your date to feel interrogated. Instead, build off of their answers.After they tell you their favorite style of music, say, “I love alt-rock, too. There’s a local record store that holds free concerts a few times a month.”
Give them a chance to talk more about the topic or ask you something before you ask another question.

, Don’t rely on getting to know each other for the whole conversation because it could wreck the vibe of your date. Instead, point out things that are going on during the date and comment about them. This will also help them remember the fun they had with you in addition to what they learned about you.If there’s music playing, make a comment about the song. Say, “It’s been forever since I heard this song, but it still makes me feel like dancing.”

, Laughing at yourself shows that you can be relaxed and take things in stride. This will show your date that you’re easy to be around. It also shows that you have a sense of humor and can be an entertaining date.Point out your goofs and laugh. This could be your gutter balls during bowling, your stray balls at mini golf, or the toppings that slid off your pizza.

, While it’s fun to laugh at your mistakes, pointing out your personal flaws on a first date will make you look insecure. It’s also no fun for your date, so don’t talk about how your eyes are too close together, you want to lose weight, or you hope your skin clears up soon. Instead, keep the conversation light and fun.Don’t tell them what you hate about your appearance.
Don’t apologize for how you look.

, Sometimes the most memorable events aren't planned, so be flexible on your date. If the opportunity to do something exciting comes up, take it.


For example, you and your date might be offered free tickets to a concert, you may come across a fireworks display or an outdoor event put on by your city, or you may notice an interesting venue near where you planned to have your date.
Go with the flow. Don't be locked into your plans if you have a chance to do something memorable.

, Bring up a fun topic from earlier in your date to remind them of the great time the two of you had and how interesting you are. Choose something that points to a follow-up date.Say, “I can't believe you've never tried Hank’s Pizza. We should go sometime soon.”
Say, “I still think I can ice skate better than you can. Want to have a faceoff soon?”

, Leave things on a positive note by telling them that you enjoyed the date. This will give them a good feeling, which should make the date more memorable. It also tells them that you’re probably open to a second date.Say, “Tonight was awesome! I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.”

, The good night kiss can be the most awkward part of a first date, but it’s also the most exhilarating. If you’re interested in a kiss, lean in. If they’re interested, they’ll likely lean in, too.

Recognize that some topics are best to avoid.,
Keep it light.",How to Act on a Date (for Girls)," Wear an outfit that makes you feel comfortable and confident. For a casual date, wear something that is slightly nicer than your usual casual clothes. If there is a formal dress code, adhere to that.


Before the date, do basic hygiene—brush your hair, brush your teeth, apply deodorant, and check your breath.
Do not dress in something you are uncomfortable in, or something that you would not wear if it was not for this date. You want to be impressive, but still very natural, and look like the real you.
Don't feel like you need to show off a lot of skin. Dress in what makes you comfortable.;
, You might want to put on some lip gloss or lipstick that matches what you're wearing (unless it's purple, black, or blue), something like brown or red or pink is good. A little mascara and eyeliner doesn't hurt, either.


If you don't have much experience with makeup, keep it minimal. Heavy makeup can look artificial unless it's done by someone who has plenty of practice. Save the experimentation for another day.

, Be kind, considerate, and respectful to your date and everyone else. Avoid criticizing your date or others. Just use the typical advice: Don't say anything you wouldn't say in front of your Grandma.

, Keep your mouth closed when you chew, and avoid talking with your mouth full.

, Many dates involve a back-and-forth: you will ask questions about your date, and they will ask questions about you. Tell as much of your life story as you are asked for and you feel comfortable with, and ask questions about your date so you can get to know them better. Ask about their...


Hobbies
Job, and/or job they want to have
Family
Passions

, Exes (yours or theirs) do not make good conversation topics. If your date seems uncomfortable about a certain subject, then find a new one that both parties can enjoy discussing.

Stand up straight.",How to Act on a First Date2," Pay attention to where your angle the middle of your body. If your belly button is pointed at your date, you're indicating to the other person that you're interested.

A handshake is a good place to start, but you can also pat your date on the arm or give his or her elbow a gentle squeeze., You'll probably do this action naturally if you're interested in the other person. It just means that you'd like to be closer to the other person, but since you can't, you're touching your face instead., If you stand or sit up straight, you'll automatically boost your own confidence. Your date will notice and likely find that confidence attractive.Also, be sure to look your date in the eye. It shows you have confidence, as well."

Don't discuss all your personal information.,
Be a little personal.,
Take your time to say goodbye.",How to Act on a First Date3," You don't want to go too deep too quickly, but you do want to open up a dialogue. Try some interesting questions.As an example, you could ask ""What's your favorite book of all time? Why do you like it?"" or ""Where did you grow up? What was it like?""

, That is, don't hide truths about yourself if he or she asks. Everyone tells little white lies, but if you say you're a doctor when you're really only a nursing assistant, that will come back to bite you later.

, Becoming too intimate too quickly can scare people off. Keep it cool and casual for the first date., You wouldn't talk about every mistake you've made on the job in the past on a job interview. The same holds true for a first date. You don't have to lay out all your personal flaws and mistakes on the first date. In fact, it's a good idea not to. You just want to make a connection with the other person, and saying too much too soon can push her or him away., That is, your date does want to hear about you. Don't always deflect the question back to your date. Tell him or her about who you are.As an example, if your date asks, ""What's your favorite type of movie?,"" don't just say, ""Oh, you know, I like most movies."" Instead, you could say, ""I really enjoy a wide spectrum, everything from goofy musicals to horror flicks. In fact, last night I watched Hairspray and Woman in Black. What do you like?""

, Saying goodbye is the last impression you leave your date with. Don't just say a quick goodbye. Take a minute to give your date a hug, kiss, or handshake, and talk about plans for getting in touch in the future.As an example, you could say, ""I really enjoyed our date.

Start by approaching him about casual topics, like class or pop culture, and gradually build up to the beginnings of a friendship, or at least until you're not strangers. Just make sure you don't start flirting until it's too late. He has to believe you could see him as more than a friend as well if he's going to ask you to homecoming.Do not approach him right away with the idea of going to homecoming. Stay away from the topic so that he does not feel pressured into dealing with the feelings of a virtual stranger. When the time comes for him to choose a date, his cool new friend—you—just might come to mind.;
, Once you've established some kind of friendship with the guy you have in mind, it's time to get on his radar in a romantic way. The best way to do this is to start flirting. Whenever you're around your crush, try to be warm and pleasant, noticeably so. And most importantly, make strong eye contact. Whenever the two of you are talking, hold eye contact longer than you would with other friends, and gaze deeply, with intention.Other small things you can do to flirt include: keeping your feet and torso pointed towards him while in a group setting and finding ways to innocently touch him like a light hand on his arm when he says something funny.

, Does he smile every time he sees you? Does he give off non-verbal flirting signs, like incidental touches and long eye contact? Look out for verbal flirting as well, such as compliments. The most important thing to consider when deciding whether you're getting flirting signs or not is to look at how his behavior towards you compares to his behavior towards others. If it's friendlier, touchier, and more intimate with his eye contact towards you, then chances are you've got his attention in a good way.

Reading body language is one of the best ways to recognize flirting. If a guy is in to you, his body language will do two things: it will become less relaxed and more alert, and it will point towards you. Some examples of things to look for include:His gaze pointing at you often
His feet pointed toward you while sitting or standing in a group
His torso leaning towards you while sitting
A straight posture and open body language, no crossed arms or legs



, Do not bring it up during every conversation, but mentioning it every other day or so should get the point across. Mention how eager you are to attend. Talk about all the little details involved, including the way your outfit looks and what you plan on wearing with it or, if you do not have an outfit yet, the sort of outfit you would like to wear. Also make sure to talk about how fun you think homecoming will be.Some examples of things you can say include: ""I can't wait to see all my friends in their dresses,"" ""I wonder what kind of music they'll play at homecoming,"" and ""I can just tell that this homecoming is going to be memorable.""

, When you talk about homecoming, make sure your crush knows that you are currently dateless. Along with mentioning how eager you are for homecoming to come, mention that you do not have anyone to go with yet or that you are only planning on going with your friends ""so far."" Use terminology like ""so far"" to suggest that you are open to the idea of going with a date rather than your group of friends. Avoid saying anything desperate, though, like ""I don't know what I'll do if no one asks me to go.""
Instead, keep the statements positive. You can say something like ""I can't wait until homecoming. I wonder who I'll go with,"" or ""So far I've just got plans to go with my friends. We've been talking about it non-stop.""

, If the guy you have your eye on already has a date for homecoming, no amount of hint-dropping will make him ask you. Find out if your guy is available or a lost cause by asking about his homecoming plans. Do not blurt out the question, ""Do you have a homecoming date?"" Instead, as you are casually talking about your own plans, slip in a question about whether or not he plans to go or if he is looking forward to it. You can say something like ""My friends and I have already planned out what we're going to do before homecoming. What about you?"" As he begins talking more about homecoming, you can gradually ease the information out of him., If you find out that your crush is available for homecoming, let it be known that you would be interested in going with him. This can be difficult unless you are already pretty good friends with him. You need to be able to joke around about it by saying things like, ""We'd be the best dressed couple there if we went together"" or ""We'd be able to show everyone what having a good time looks like."" By joking about it, you plant the idea in his head to ask you without putting any pressure on yourself or him.Only mention it lightly and do not talk about it too much or be too pushy about the suggestion.

, If you want to try something a little more playful, literally drop hints by placing unsigned notes in various locations. Stick a note in his locker, at his lunch table, or anywhere you think he might see. The notes should say something along the lines of, ""There is someone who is secretly hoping you'll take her to homecoming."" Make sure the notes are addressed to him so that he knows, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they are for him. Leave him strong clues to your identity but never come right out and say who you are. If he asks you directly whether or not you wrote the notes, though, confirm his suspicions; otherwise, another girl might try to take the credit.

, If you are on good, friendly terms with your crush, ask him to see a movie or a game a few weekends before homecoming. Avoid labeling it as a date. Instead, act as though you are interested in going out with him as a friend, or leave the day out together ambiguous. If necessary, you can even invite him out as a part of a larger group. The point is simply to have fun together. If you successfully have a good time, it may prompt in him the desire to ask you out to homecoming., If you can get at least one of his friends to go to homecoming with one of yours, it opens the door for going together as a group. When you're paired off friends are chatting with you and your crush, you can casually throw out the idea of going together as a group. You could also ask your friend to bring the idea up, or ask her to have her date bring it up. This works especially well if he has multiple friends going with multiple friends of yours. , If you have mutual friends, ask them to plant the idea of inviting you to homecoming in your prospective date's head. The guy you have in mind may not have realized that you are interested, but if a friend of yours brings your name up and casually suggests that he asks you to the dance, he just might get the hint. Your friend does not necessarily need to mention that you expressed the specific desire to go with him, but your friend should make it clear that she feels confident you would say yes if asked.For example, ask your friend to say something to your crush like ""Have you thought about who you're going to ask to the dance? What about so-and-so? You guys would probably look cute together.""

, If your crush is a little on the shy side but seems like he might be interested, you can ask him indirectly to go to homecoming with you. Phrase it in a non-committal sort of way, though. Instead of specifically asking, ""Will you go with me?"" or saying ""I want to go with you,"" ask him ""if"" he'd be interested in going with you. It gives him a strong hint that you are interested while allowing you to casually brush it off if he says otherwise.

There are ways to phrase this question casually, such as ""Hey we both don't have anyone to go with to homecoming yet right? Maybe we could go with each other. That might be fun.""

Remember it's only one date.,
Try not to overanalyze.,
Decide if you want a second date.,
Figure out any potential red flags.,
Think about the level of attraction.",How to Act After the First Date1," People have a tendency to judge quickly after a first date. When deciding your feelings, have some perspective. It's only one date. Whether you felt so-so about it, or had a great time, this is just one encounter and you can't make any sweeping decisions yet.If there was very little spark, do not decide it isn't worth pursuing. Unless there were very obvious reg flags, consider giving the person a second chance if you had a decent time.
If it went well, remember it was only one date and the other person may not have felt the same way. You're not in a relationship yet, so try to take things one day at a time before leaping to conclusions about where the relationship's going.;
, It's important to examine your feelings about the person after a date, but overanalyzing can do more harm than good. Try not to obsess over the meaning of every hand touch, hug, or other gesture. While small things can sometimes indicate a character trait, they can also be meaningless.For example, if your date checked a text during dinner, you may be wondering if this means they're an inconsiderate person. If this only happened once throughout the whole date, they may have been checking the time or waiting on an important call. For now, try not to think about the text incident too much.

, Sometimes, you know for sure you want a second date, but sometimes it's more confusing. There is no pressure to go on a second date if you don't want to, but it's worth giving someone a chance if you had a decent time. However, if you were very uncomfortable or didn't have any fun, you may want to move on to someone else., Sometimes, red flags show up early. If your date engaged in behaviors that seemed rude or inappropriate on more than one occasion, this may be a sign this person is not worth pursuing.For example, maybe they rolled their eyes or laughed at a serious comment you made. Maybe they barely engaged in conversation. Maybe they just made you uncomfortable throughout the night.
Trust your instinct. Don't keep seeing someone if they have a bad vibe.

, If you felt no attraction to the person at all whatsoever, a second date may not be worth it. However, keep in mind you may not be wildly attracted to the person right away, especially if you're nervous. If you felt the person was decent looking, even if you weren't swept off your feet, it may be worth a second date to see if attraction develops."

Be sure it's legal and safe.,

Get to know him.,
Hang around him outside of school.,
Dress in clothes that enhance your appearance.,
Use makeup subtly.,
Be confident.,
Be yourself.,
Tell him how you feel.",How to Get an Older Guy to Like You (Teen Girls)," If you're under the age of consent, do not date someone over the age, even if you believe you are mature. It will become difficult to manage and put boundaries down. If the age gap is more than a few years, be very cautious about it because it can lead to abusive relationships and emotional manipulation, since you will be in very different points in your lives. For a rough idea of how old you should be at minimum, half his age and add 7. This is used by many people to figure out ages, for example a 25 year old should be dating at minimum someone at least 19-20 years old.
, This is the best place to start. If he doesn't know who you are, how can he like you? It can be difficult talking to someone you don't know for the first time, so, just try to become friends with his friends, or start talking to him on Facebook. You could also nudge him when walking past, but make it look like an accident, then apologize and start to converse; however, if he doesn't take the bait, or doesn't seem interested, better luck next time.

, Ask him questions. Boys love talking about themselves, as do us girls. But if you want to get him, you're going to have to sacrifice talking about yourself so much, unless he asks about you. Ask him if he plays any sport, or what music he listens to, his favorite movie. Anything. But the most important thing to remember when having a conversation with any boy, is not to bombard him with an inordinate number of questions, or else he will think you are obsessed with him. Instead just let the conversation flow.

, Ask him if he wants to go get some ice cream etc. Or if you are to shy/uncomfortable confronting him, ask over text. Its best to do this by indirectly asking. For example, instead of saying, ""Hey do you want to hang out at Baskin' Robin?"", say something like, ""This triple scoop mocha fudge sundae is delicious! It's a shame I don't have someone to share it with, so that they could experience its amazingly life changing flavor as well"". Or you could always use something more subtle, as a hint that you want to hang out. Once you too are together, show him how fun you can be and don't forget smile a lot. It makes you seem happier, and guys love happy girls.

, Don't wear clothes that make you feel less confident or hinder your decency. In other words, don't wear clothes that are too revealing, clothes that are too baggy or faded (unless intended), or clothes that are dirty/stained. Instead wear clothes that you feel comfortable and presentable in. Although you should always keep these in mind, its important to remember that guys are visual creatures, and crave even the littlest bit of skin. However, to retain the classy mature look that is key in attracting an older gentleman, you must show skin sparingly. So choose your best body part, whether that be legs, arms, cleavage etc. and use that as the focal point of your outfit.
, Makeup is an irksome subject when it comes to those of the opposite gender because whether they like the all natural look or cake face really depends on what guy you are talking to. So it all comes down to this: What matches the style you are going for, without being too cake faced and still being sophisticated and mature enough to woo that older guy of yours? Foundation/tinted moisturizer, blush/bronzer, a little bit of eyeliner or eyeshadow, mascara and lip gloss works for the experienced makeup wearers, or for the more natural look you could use blush/bronzer, mascara and lipgloss, but don't use any unnatural colors that cause you to look similar to a clown.

, A guys don't like a girl who is insecure about herself and gossips. It gives her an air of meanness. By keeping your head held high, and not caring about what others think about you, it makes you seem more mature, and he is more likely to like you, because you wouldn't care what people would say about you dating someone older than yourself. If you are confident, it will also be easier to flirt when it comes time and you seem more mature.

, Don't act suddenly different, and like everything that he likes when you talk to him. Aside from the fact that the conversations become boring due to the fact that all you're doing is agreeing with him, he can see through it. The majority of guys dislike fake girls and automatically are turned off. Be one of the genuine girls in the world; it really makes a difference in you relationship, considering the fact that he will be more comfortable being himself around you too.

, Not over IM/Facebook/MSN etc. Do it face to face, if you feel comfortable. Tell him that you really like him, and you needed to get it off your chest, or whatever you feel the need to say. Don't tell him you're totally in love with him and obsessed and want to marry him; this will scare him away and he is likely to think that you're creepy. If he doesn't feel the same just smile and say okay! Move on, any guy that doesn't want you is missing out on a lot! There's plenty other fish in the sea, you just got to find the right out for you!

If someone catches your eye in your after-school activity, it’s far more likely that you’ll be able to talk to them than someone who has completely different interests.


If you don’t have an after-school activity, you may want to consider joining one, to make new friends as well as to pursue romantic interests. You can also find a person who doesn’t do extracurricular activities and see if they’d be free to do something after school with you.
It can also be beneficial to find someone that you have a lot of classes with, because there are lots of ways to start a conversation with them. Light-hearted gossip can be okay: “Can you believe what so-and-so said in class today?” You can also suggest studying together: “I get so bored memorizing all those dates and names. Do you want to quiz me later?”;
, Once you have found someone you are interested in, try to figure out who they really are. It can be easy to fall for someone’s wonderful hair or beautiful eyes, but you know that there’s more to a person than that. You need to be able to hold a conversation if you plan on dating in the future.


You can always begin a conversation by talking about what you have in common, but you should try to branch out quickly into what is important to your crush. Ask them about their family and other parts of their life. When they tell you, ask for more intimate details. If they tell you that they have your brother, say “Do you get along?” If they tell you that they like music or video games, ask what they like about them, and try to figure out why. The more that you ask, the more that you’ll understand about them. As a bonus, if you act more interested in them, they will be more interested in you.

, Don’t make a big deal out of spending time together. The best way to do it is to invite them along for something you were going to do anyway. For example, you can say “I was going to swing by the coffee shop before studying after school. Do you want to come with me?”


This is important for a couple reasons. First, there is no risk in getting rejected if you were going out anyway. Second, it reduces pressure because it is not a date, and you will be comfortable doing something you are accustomed to doing.
It is important to create a solid base of friendship before you try to embark on a relationship. It will reduce your risk of idealizing your crush in an unrealistic way if you interact with them like one of your friends.

, If you’re into someone, the best thing to do is to see if they are interested in you. In the teen years, this stops being so much about teasing and hair-pulling and more about body language and flirting.


Just talk to them. If they listen to you and remember what you say, then they are interested you at least as friends. If they laugh at your jokes or ask about your life, even better.
Expressions of affection range from glaringly obvious to extremely subtle. On the obvious end of the spectrum you have unsolicited touching. If they insist upon hugs or playfully poke or smack you, it’s a good sign. On the subtle end, something as simple as where their feet are pointing can be an indicator. If they cross their legs or edge away when you get really close to them, then it’s probably not a good idea to ask them out. , Maybe you have text conversations-- keep them going and make sure you stay on their mind. Try to extend one-on-one time with them. Try to see if you can be quiet with them. If you can be excited, but not awkward, you are ready.

, Try not to be too intense. Teen crushes can be extremely strong, but to preserve everyone’s feelings, try to take it slow.

You may be tempted to say that you are “in love” with your crush. This is an incredibly strong phrase that can seem unreal or scary to someone else. Instead, try to frame your confession in terms of “liking” them.
It is best to do this at the end of a conversation, so that if they do not reciprocate, you can escape without it getting too awkward. As the conversation dies down, you can say, “I really like talking to you”, or “I really like spending time with you”. These are sort of vague, so they are lower risk. If you feel like they like you back, you can simply say, “I really like you”.

, You’ve done the hard part: you’ve become their friend and put yourself out there. Now it’s time for the fun part: dates.


If you regularly hang out in a certain place, it might be as simple as asking them to go to that place with you romantically. For example, “Do you want to go on a date to the arcade? I’ll buy your first two games.”
If you hang out mostly with friends, or if you want to be more romantic you can ask them out to a new place. For example, “Do you want to go on a date to the movies?” Or, “I know a really beautiful place to watch the sunset. Maybe we can get ice cream and watch it.”

, This is likely to occur pretty early on in the relationship, or at least one of you might be thinking about it. It’s important to spell out what you don’t want and what you might be open to. You might be embarrassed, and it might feel somehow un-sexy, but the more you communicate about it, the easier things will be in the long run.


It’s less than ideal to interrupt with ground rules during a makeout session. If things are going too fast, though, don’t be afraid to tell your partner that you’re not comfortable. It’s more important to be safe. It’s okay to say, “I don’t want to go this fast right now. Can we go back to what we were doing before and talk about it later?”
If you think that you want to go further and your partner hasn’t shown any signs one way or the other, you should bring this up as well. It’s okay to be matter-of-fact: “I’m interested in having sex in the future, but I don’t want to go faster than you’re comfortable with. What are your feelings about having sex?”
If you are both on the same page and want to have sex, make sure that you use proper protection . This can mean condoms, dental dams and birth control in some cases. If one of you has had sexual partners before, they should get an STD test at a local clinic.

, If something that they do bothers you, don’t let it fester. No one is a mind-reader, and might be surprised at how difficult it is to tell what you are thinking. Try to be open about your feelings.


If you think that your partner cares more about hanging out with friends than spending time with you, don’t immediately accuse them of neglecting you. Instead, try to find a way for your partner to do what they want while still meeting your needs. For example, “We haven’t hung out much this week. Can we have a date on Saturday?”
You should be able to disagree about small things without fighting. If anyone is trying to control what the other person thinks or does, it can quickly become an abusive relationship. You should never be afraid of what your partner thinks.

, You should not be dating anyone you do not respect. This is why the friends stage is so important-- you have to think about your partner as a person, not just as a romantic object. Listen to your partner. If you’re dismissing things that they do and calling them stupid, you aren’t respecting them. If you make fun of them to your friends, or don’t defend them to your friends, you aren’t respecting them.
If your partner forces you to do something that you do not want to do, emotionally or physically, you should end your relationship immediately. You deserve someone who respects you and your free will.
Search for things that you respect about your partner-- look for talents they might have, and try to notice when they’ve worked hard on something. When you say, “I really admire your ability to work hard on x”, or “I’ve never seen someone so great at x”, your partner will notice, and by searching, you will see them as more capable too.

, Everyone needs alone time, or time to spend with other people. If you become intensely jealous or possessive of your partner’s time, they might start to feel trapped and controlled.


If it makes you uncomfortable that your partner is spending time with someone, it might be best to just tell them how you feel. For example, “I get jealous when you spend so much time talking to this person. I just need a reminder that you aren’t interested in anybody else.”

Knowing that age matters ahead of time can save you from trouble and potential heartbreak in the future.


In high school, there’s generally more division of social groups based on grades as well. Understand that the activities seniors engage in may be very different from what you are used to. For example, it’s common for seniors to go out and party more than freshmen. Don’t engage in any dangerous or illegal activities just to spend time around your crush.;
, Sexual acts between a minor and someone who is legally an adult (18+) is called statutory rape. The age of consent varies from state to state but generally charges can be brought against an 18 year old if they are caught in a compromising situation with a minor so be safe and don’t break the law.Understand that this is one major drawback of dating an older person in high school. If they start pressuring you to engage in sexual acts that you are not ready for, stay true to yourself and don’t cave. If they do not respect your boundaries, it’s time to end the relationship.

, In terms of expectations and daily life, being a senior can be pretty different from being a freshman. After all, seniors are in their last year of high school and therefore have to prepare for the future. Oftentimes, this means that seniors are busier with college applications, job searches, testing, socializing, and more. Be prepared for and accepting of these and any other grade-related differences.Not only are there differences in terms of workload and social groups, but freshmen and seniors also differ in terms of maturity, both physical and psychological. Because of this, it may be inadvisable to get into a relationship with someone who is much older than you unless you are both sure that you’re at a similar level in terms of emotional and psychological maturity, which will lead to the two of you making safe, healthy decisions., Don’t push your boundaries or let anyone else cross them. Always be sure to firmly establish what the boundaries are in your relationship (should you end up in one). Otherwise, you may find yourself in an uncomfortable situation.These boundaries are not only physical but also mental and emotional. Decide what you want out of a relationship beforehand and don’t stay with someone who doesn’t respect the boundaries that you have decided on. For example, if you end up going to parties where seniors are drinking or doing drugs, don’t feel pressured to join in. And if your crush (or anyone else for that matter) pushes you to do things you’re uncomfortable with, that’s a clear sign to walk away.
One in three adolescents in the United States is a victim of physical, sexual, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner.Keep yourself safe by watching for warning signs, such as aggression, threats, or manipulative behaviors. As a freshmen, you are more vulnerable to be on the receiving end of relationship abuse as seniors tend to be older, bigger, and may see themselves as having power over you.
If you feel unsafe or think you may be in an abusive or unhealthy relationship, seek help from a trusted family member or other adult.

, You want to start by finding out basic information, such as whether they are already in a relationship or not. It’s always best to know ahead of time and if it turns out they are unavailable, you could still get to know them as friends!


To find out this information, ask around but try to be discreet about it and only ask friends you know you can trust. After all, you don’t want the word getting around that you are interested in someone without getting a chance to know them first!
If you don’t already know their age, find out! After all, if you are in the older end of your grade and your crush is young for their grade, there might not even be much of an age gap between you two.

, Getting to know what your crush’s hobbies are will not only give you something to talk about, but will also inform you if you two are actually a good fit. After all, an infatuation may be based on being attracted to someone’s looks, but a relationship requires having similar interests and goals and it’s better to find out sooner rather than later if you aren’t actually compatible with your crush.


For example, ask around to see if they are involved in any sports, clubs, or extracurricular activities. Or, if you already speak to each other from time to time, make a point of casually asking your crush about what they’re into. Maybe they’re secretly a film buff or love to draw and you do too. Don’t be afraid to ask as you may end up having some unexpected interests in common!
Once you’ve learned about some of their activities, you can include yourself in them, especially if they are school-related, such as a sports or club. Just be sure to do it if you are also actively interested in the activity--never do something just for the sake of being around your crush.

, If you haven’t talked to your crush before, make a point of doing so! After all, the best way to get to know a person is simply by talking to them. Though the grade difference may intimidate you at first, if your crush is a kind, mature person, they’ll look beyond that and treat you like any other human being.


Since there are very few private places in school, you may always feel like you have an audience watching you when you approach your crush. You can either decide to just ignore the onlookers or approach your crush in a more relaxed setting, such as at the beginning or end of the lunch period or between classes.
Be relaxed and direct in introducing yourself. Avoid blushing, giggling, or otherwise showing signs of nervousness as that can just make both you and your crush feel awkward. Keep the introduction short and simple by saying something along the lines of, “Hey my name is _____ and I just wanted to say hi because I’ve seen you around and you seem like a really cool person.”
If you have a sibling or other friends who are seniors, you can also ask them to introduce you to your crush. That’ll take some of the pressure off of you and also give your crush more of a reason to get to know you.

, Learning more about your crush’s values, faith, and culture can teach you a great deal about who they are as a person and, again, show you whether you two would actually be compatible dating.


Ask them questions about their religion, beliefs, or background but do it in a way that isn’t overly prying or obnoxious. Just take a sincere interest in getting to know them as a person and pick up on nonverbal cues. For example, if they only tell you the bare minimum about their family or what they believe in, don’t press them and instead move onto another subject or tell them a little bit about yourself. After all, the goal is to get to know your crush and if you interrogate them too much, you may end up driving them away!

, It’s not just a cliche--being yourself is likely one of the most crucial steps to attracting your crush. After all, you don’t want your crush to fall for a fake version of yourself and if they are not interested in you, you’ll know right from the get-go that this isn’t the person for you and not to waste your time.


For example, if you prefer reading and watching movies over going to your high school football games, don’t pretend that you’re a huge sports fan. You want your crush to like you for you, not the person you're pretending to be.

, Perhaps the biggest difference between being a senior and a freshman is that everything in the school is new for freshmen. After a few years, most students develop more confidence and ease and this comes naturally with age. However, if you want to attract a senior, you will have to project that same sort of laidback confidence.


Be aware of your body language. Everyone picks up on body cues subconsciously so communicate confidence with good posture, direct eye contact, and an easygoing smile.
If you are feeling uncomfortable or insecure, fake it til you make it. Laugh and smile a lot and try to keep things in stride. For example, if someone insults you while you are talking to your crush, make a lighthearted joke about it rather than getting upset or depressed.

, People are interested in dating those with the same maturity level and so, as you get to know your crush, aim to match their maturity level. Depending on your individual personalities, this may not require all that much effort on your part. Girls also tend to mature more quickly than boysso if you are a freshman girl interested in a senior guy, you may find your levels of maturity are actually similar.


If that isn’t the case, practice maturity by being organized, disciplined, and rational in your decision making.Of course, there’s only so much you can do as maturity comes with age, but consciously working towards being mature rather than childlike will definitely make you stand out from other freshmen.

, Not only will learning about healthy relationships help you know what to expect, but it will also make you more confident and self-assured. After all, if you are trying to attract a senior, you should know the fundamentals of healthy relationships instead of always looking to them for guidance as this will create an unequal power dynamic. Finally, understanding and practicing healthy relationship skills will set you up for safe and fulfilling relationships down the road.


Good communication and mutual respect are perhaps the two most crucial aspects of any healthy relationship. When talking to your crush, be honest about yourself and practice good listening skills. Also be sure to respect them by being considerate of their time and feelings (and make sure they are reciprocating!).
You’ll know if you are in a healthy relationship if you feel good about yourself and energized when spending time with that person. Unhealthy relationships tend to be emotionally unfulfilling, draining, and negative so make sure to watch for how you feel when spending time with your crush as that will clue you into whether the relationship is actually healthy or not."

Send a casual text saying you had a good time.,
Interact casually online.,
Ask to see them again if there was a spark.,
Let them know respectfully if there was no connection.,
Accept rejection.",How to Act After the First Date2," This is usually best if you're interested in going out again. You do not need to gush about what a great time you had, but just send something simple. For example, ""I had a great time with you yesterday. Hope we can do it again soon!""There's no need to wait the customary three days, as this is no longer considered dating gospel. You can send the text when you get home from the date or the next day.

, You should only do this if the two of you already follow each other on social media. Try replying to tweets or posting on their Facebook a little bit more if you're interested in them. This can show you've been thinking of them and would like to go out again.If you don't already interact with them online, however, suddenly adding them on Facebook may seem like a bit much.

, If you want to see them again, say so. Do not wait too long, as this can feel like playing games. In a day or two, send a text that says something like, ""When are you free? I'd love to see you again."", If you've decided not to pursue things further, you should communicate this. This is especially important if the other person has been texting you expressing interest. After about 24 hours, send a polite text saying something like, ""I had a really great time meeting you, but I just didn't feel a connection. Sorry."", Unfortunately, sometimes the other person does not feel the same way about you. If someone turns you down for a second date, try to accept it with grace. Send them a text thanking them for letting you know there wasn't a connection and wishing them well.


For example, say something like, ""I appreciate you letting me know how you feel. Good luck in the dating game.""

It's okay to text a lot after a first if the person is encouraging conversation, but if you're getting silence on their end, it may be best to tone it down. You don't want to seem overeager, as this could potentially put someone off.

, For the most part, people rarely make phone calls anymore, especially in the dating game. Texts are generally the preferred method of communication, so stick to texting your date rather than calling them.However, if you're older and do not use smart phones, calling may still be appropriate. If your date has preferred phone calls previously, calling may be a better route in this case.

, Again, it's okay to interact on social media if you're already connected there. However, if you're not, do not add them on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. You should also avoid scrolling through their profiles, as this may cause you to overanalyze things and jump to unfair conclusions., Even if it went well, one date does not mean you're in a relationship. If you're talking to other people you're interested in, keep in touch with them. This relationship may not work out, so it's okay to keep looking in case things fall through."

Dressing for your date will be easier once you know what’s in store for the actual date.For a classic dinner and a movie date, you’ll know to dress in nicer, fancier clothes. Don’t forget to discuss exactly where dinner will be, so that you can gauge how dressy you need to be.
For a hiking date, casual jeans and a t-shirt or gym clothes are perfectly acceptable first date wear!;
, There’s nothing wrong with doing a little shopping for a first date, especially if you have a fun activity planned and need a few new items to prepare.


Although it’s not necessary to go shopping, wearing something new will show your date that you’ve made extra effort.

, Before deciding on exactly what to wear, try on a few different options. What you’ve envisioned as the perfect clothing combination in your head might look different once you’ve got it on.If your first date involves lots of movement – perhaps you are taking a ballroom dancing class together or going horseback riding – make sure you can move freely and comfortably in each outfit you try.

, First dates can be nerve-wracking enough as it is – you don’t want to add extra worry by wearing uncomfortable, tight, see-through, or low-cut clothing if that’s not a look you were intending.


You will be happiest and most at ease if you wear clothes you like and feel confident and comfortable in., Everyone wants to look their best for the first date, but unless you’re planning to attend a Halloween party together, don’t dress up as someone else. Wear an outfit that reflects your own personal style and flare.


Not only will you feel more relaxed, but it will be easier for your date to get to know and adore you!

, You don’t need a brand new outfit or expensive clothes to impress your date, but it is important that your clothes are clean, neat, and wrinkle-free. Be sure to make any necessary laundry or repair preparations ahead of time.


If you did buy new clothes, be sure to remove tags and stickers. Sometimes, they like to hide and you don’t want your date to be the one to find them while you’re out!
To ensure that your date outfit stays neat and clean, consider keeping it and any extra accessories stored inside a closed garment bag in your closet until you are ready to wear it.

, Depending on the type of date you have planned, you’ll want to plan for your hair accordingly. Practice styling it a few days ahead of your date to make sure your vision goes with your outfit. You don’t want to be scrambling with your hair leading up to your date.


If you plan to wear makeup, you may also want to try out your intended look a few days before your date, just to make sure application goes smoothly and that you achieve your vision.

, If you’re a guy that breaks out after a fresh shave or you’re a girl who gets a little red after a fresh eyebrow wax, plan on some pre-date grooming a day or two in advance so that you have time to recover and look your best!


Although grooming is important, don’t undergo any procedures just for the sake of the date. If you feel like you have to dress or appear a certain way to impress your date, the person probably isn’t right for you. You deserve to be seen and adored for who you are!

, Before you start getting dressed, double check the weather for the timeframe of your date. Even if you plan to spend most of the time inside, you still have to get there and you’ll want to keep your clothes neat and dry.


Grab a raincoat if it’s raining or re-think your long-sleeved shirt and pants if it’s unseasonably warm.
If the weather is particularly wet or snowy, consider wearing a pair of boots during travel and taking your nice pair of shoes to change into once you arrive at your destination.
If you know your date’s size, grab an extra sweater, umbrella, or raincoat if the weather is bad, in case he or she doesn't think to bring one. Your date will be impressed by the sweet gesture and that you thought to plan ahead.

, Even if you’re headed for a 5k marathon on your first date, you’re going to want to smell nice and clean when you first meet up.


If you need extra time to blow-dry your hair before you style it, make sure you budget enough time.

, When you’re anxious or stressed, that tends to be the time a button falls off or a zipper gets stuck or your nylons get a run. It’s better to be ready too early than scramble around because you’re late. Take your time getting dressed so you can handle any last minute mishaps with your garments!, Even if you’re planning on a fancy dinner at a swanky hotel or you’re attending a prestigious ballet performance, plans can change. For example, you and your date might have so much fun that you’ll decide to take a walk for ice cream or stay up all night watching old movies together!


Pack something comfortable, so you’re prepared to go with the flow!

, If you’re taking a purse or you need a water bottle and a hiking pass for the state park, make sure you’ve got all the accessories you’ll need for a successful date.


Make sure your cell phone is charged in case of an emergency.
It’s always a good idea to bring a little extra cash with you, in case the date doesn’t go well and you need to get a ride home or the date goes so well, you splurge for extra dessert.

, It’s normal to be nervous and anxious before a first date, but don’t let your clothes be a factor. Be confident in what you’ve chosen, enjoy yourself, and concentrate on getting to know this new wonderful person you’re with., Some people are especially sensitive to scents and sprays, and too much scent can be overwhelming. Apply just a single spray or a few dabs.


Deodorant is always a good idea, but be careful not to over-apply that either.

, Even if you have extremely dry skin, consider skipping an application right before your big date. First dates are always a bit nerve-wracking, and you’ll likely be sweaty (or greasy) until you settle in. By avoiding moisturizer for the date, you can try to avoid unwanted shine.

, Choosing a few simple pieces to accentuate your outfit (if you’re going somewhere fancy) is appropriate, but if you’re drowning in jewelry, your date might feel distracted by it.

, A bright red burn or a bad haircut could ruin your whole look, so skip any drastic changes right before your date.

It’s easy to take a partner for granted, especially when you’ve been together for a long time, but maintaining physical contact is very important for helping you create and keep a strong bond., It can feel kind of awkward, especially if you aren’t used to doing it, but talking about your relationship is healthy and important. It's generally a great bonding activity to make plans for the future and discuss what you really love about each other. Talking about your relationship will give her a sense of stability that she might not be able to find with anyone else.


Create a safe, nonjudgmental space where you both know that you can be honest with each other without being laughed or yelled at.
Discuss and fix problems in your relationship before they become too big to solve.
You can say something like, “You know how to make me laugh, even when I’m in a bad mood. I really love that quality about you, Ashley.”
Alternatively, if you have an issue, say something such as, “Jacqueline, I feel upset when you ignore my text messages. It makes me wonder if I’ve done something wrong. Have I?”

, She’s going to have her own challenges to deal with, such as fights with friends, problems with her boss at work, and stress when she’s got a ton of things to juggle. Never let her doubt that you know she can handle it like a boss. You know that she’s strong and smart enough to conquer all of her problems, so tell her that.


Say something like, “I’m sorry that you’re dealing with Becca’s drama. It sounds like you’re in a tough spot. But that’s one of the really great things about you: you are such a loyal friend and will stick by her no matter what.”

, When you talk to each other, don’t just skim the surface and keep your conversations to things like what you did that day. It’s not enough to know her favorite color and her middle name. You need to talk about things that really delve into who you are as people. Doing so creates a deep and lasting bond.Ask questions like:


“What do you want your future to be like?”
“Why do you avoid your sister’s calls?”
“How does it feel to be the soccer captain?”

, Setting aside time to be a couple is crucial for your relationship, no matter how long you’ve been together. She needs to feel like you’re really there for her and that means being present as much as you can.For instance, plan a date for just the two of you, rather than your usual group of friends.
If you’re living together, you can go to bed half an hour early so that you two have time to talk and be intimate.

, Don’t tell her your life story on your first date. Instead, slowly reveal details about yourself and your past experiences to her. For instance, wait until she asks about your education to reveal that you graduated at the top of your class from MIT. She’ll be impressed by the accomplishment as well as your modesty.Don’t tell your girl you’re an amazing cook. Instead, surprise her with a home-cooked meal that will have her praising your skills in the kitchen. You can even bring the meal to her for lunch if you aren’t able to have the house to yourself.

, If you are a genuinely interesting person, it’ll be easier for her to stay interested in you. Work on becoming more mature and pursuing new goals, and let your interests change naturally.]

For example, try taking one of your interests and making it into a serious hobby. If you love comic books, try creating your own.

, Respecting her is crucial to keeping her interest. Show her that you value her opinion and make sure that she puts in her two cents when it comes to decisions that you make together. Let her talk without interrupting her, listen to her, and never insult her or belittle her. Basically, follow the golden rule: treat her how you would want to be treated., Being kind is an underrated value, and your girl will appreciate that quality in you. It’s not enough to just be nice to her, though, you need to show that you are truly a kind-hearted person. When you're mean to other people, and especially to people that are ""weaker"" than you, you send the message that she might someday expect the same.For example, if you talk behind your best friend's back, she may assume you’ll do the same to her when she’s not around.
Be polite to strangers. Hold the door open for the people behind you, for instance.

, When you're in a relationship together, focus on meeting her needs in balanced proportion. She has physical and emotional needs, and meeting just one of them isn’t going to cut it. If you don’t know what her needs are, then ask her. She will appreciate you taking the time to find out how to make her happy.Fill her physical needs by showing affection and ensuring she receives pleasure when you are intimate.
Fill her emotional needs by listening to her, being supportive, and talking to her about stimulating and interesting things.

, It can be easy to stop putting in effort after you’ve been together for a while. Yet, when you stop making the effort, she'll start to feel taken for granted, and you don't want that. Be sure to keep up with your appearance, make efforts to surprise and woo her, and keep trying to impress her.For example, come up with a really special way to ask her to prom. Consider her likes and interests and incorporate them into your plan. If she loves jelly beans, spell out “Prom?” in jelly beans in her room (after getting her parent's permission).

, While spending time with each other is essential, you also need time apart. Couples that spend too much time together can get bored of each other’s company. It’s important to make sure you each have your own interests and friends. So, set up a Tuesday poker night with the boys or join a sports league that gets you out of the house on Saturday mornings.You could decide that you’ll hang out four nights a week and spend the other three with your own friends or family.

, While she might not be outright looking for an adventurous guy, she certainly won’t say no to someone who’s willing to try new things and keep her life exciting. When all you do is sit on the couch, it can be hard to maintain interest. Solve this issue by getting out and enjoying your life together.


Take her to an amusement park and ride all the roller coasters together, for instance.
For example, traveling and outdoor activities are always an easy way to experiment with being more adventurous. Try going for a hike in the mountains in the next state over. Road trip!

, When you show her that you care about things she finds important and that you’re willing to work to help her pursue that part of her life, she’ll be really impressed. She wants to stay with someone who can understand her in that way and that she knows she can count on for support. Find ways to help her pursue what she loves and you’ll go far toward keeping her interest.For example, if she really loves fashion, help her start a blog or vlog where she can give advice to others. You can take pictures of her and help her figure out how to start and design a website.

, Taking on challenges together will certainly make your lives more interesting, but it will also help you feel closer together and increase your confidence in each other. Taking on challenges together is actually one of the most effective ways of building strong feelings between two people. You can consider things like:


Getting in shape or trying a new sport
Improving your grades and raising your GPA

, Learning together can be a great way to keep things interesting. This will not only engage your brains (together!) but it will also give you more things to talk about and chances to bond. There are lots of different ways that you can learn together and many are free. By choosing a subject that you’re both interested in, you also ensure that it’s fun.Watch online educational videos, like TEDTalks or Crash Course on Youtube
Take free online courses with sites like Coursera, or sign up for a class at your local community college.

, One of the worst things you can do for a relationship is to let things become routine. Eating at the same restaurant and going to the same stores in the mall every weekend gets boring, and she may lose interest. Instead, be spontaneous to show that you’re always thinking about ways to make her happy, not just following a set pattern of behavior.Take her on imaginative dates. Try something unusual every now and again, like geocaching or volunteering in your community.
Get her a simple gift (flowers, a teddy bear, etc.) and surprise her with it at work or school.

Learn his practice schedule and accept it.,
Accept that you aren't going to be his top priority all the time.,
Go to his games.,
Know the team.,
Get into it.",How to Be a Football Girlfriend," Acknowledge that you support him playing football. Make sure he knows it too. If either you or your boyfriend feel no support towards each other, the relationship isn't going to work out. Show your support by showing up to his games, talking about how good he is or even just cuddling him and saying, ""Well done"". If he knows that you love what he does, he'll love you.;
, If he gets sent off and you cheer him, things will end badly. If you don't quite understand the rules of football, learn them. The internet can be your best friend here.

The last one can be quite tricky to understand. Why not ask your boyfriend? He'll be glad you're interested.

, You need to know and learn how to plan things around his busy schedule.

Convince your parents your partner is a friend.",How to Date Secretly when You Are a Tween or Teen," Especially if your parents have expressly forbidden you from dating, if they find out that you have disobeyed their rule you can get in serious trouble. This can damage your parents trust in you, which will take time and effort to rebuild. Damaged trust might make it even harder for you to date when you are older and have more freedom.


There's nothing wrong with starting to date young. However, though you may be excited to start dating as a teen, your young age will limit what you can do with your partner. Damaging your parents trust early on might make it harder to enjoy dating when you have more options available when you're a little bit older.;
, Your teenage years are a time of change, and it's only natural for your emotions to be strong and difficult to control. This includes your emotions concerning your romantic partner. Feelings of love can lead to sex, and although safe sex dramatically reduces the chances of an unplanned pregnancy, there's still a chance you could get pregnant.An unplanned pregnancy will change all of your future plans. You'll no longer be able to pursue your dreams alone, you'll also have to take into account your child and how you will provide for and raise it.
Depending on a state, as a minor (person under 18), your parents may have the power to make decisions for you concerning your unborn child. This situation could result in you having to go along with your parents wishes., Stress can cause many negative effects to your health, like stomach problems, heart problems, emotional problems, tension, a weak immune system, and more.Your decision to keep your relationship a secret won't only affect you, it will also affect the person you care about. Even if you and your partner feel comfortable keeping your relationship a secret in the beginning, you should check with your partner as time passes to make sure the effects of stress aren't having a negative impact.

, While at this point in your relationship things might be going well, there's always the chance that your partner isn't who you think. In the heat of the moment, you might be pressured into doing something you're not ready for, and if you're keeping your relationship a secret, you might feel like you have to keep this a secret from your parents as well.


In some cases, this might lead to you staying silent about rape or abuse instead of seeking help or reporting your partner to prevent it from happening to someone else. Speaking out about rape or abuse can be difficult, but you are not to blame., Keeping your relationship a secret might make your partner feel unimportant. In some cases, your partner might even feel like you're embarrassed about your relationship. This can lead to unhealthy stress, which could have a negative effect on your relationship.


You should think about whether you're really giving your relationship a fair shot by keeping it secret. After all, the stress and potential negative feelings that could result from keeping it on the down-low might even cause your relationship to fail., Even if you have traditional parents who are strict about things like dating, your parents had to get together for you to be born! This means that, on some level, they understand the basic need for romantic love.By showing your parents you want to understand and respect their point of view, they might interpret this as a sign you're mature enough to start dating. And even if they don't, by understanding their concerns, you can take steps to ease their fears., How you address parental concern will depend on your situation, but it's highly likely that showing maturity will help convince your parents you are old enough to date. When talking with your parents, you should ask them how you might prove to them you are ready to date, or if there is something you can do to make them feel more comfortable with the situation.


Remember to take your parents concerns seriously. In most cases, they are only looking out for your well-being. Although you're branching out and becoming your own person, you're still your parents' responsibility.
Respond to parental suggestions seriously. If your parents ask you to show maturity by doing something and you fail to do it, it may reinforce their opinion that you're simply not ready to date., Now that you've learned some of the reasons why your parents don't want you to date, think about how you might resolve those concerns. This might mean agreeing to check in with your parents by text message every hour you are on a date, or maybe it would make them feel more comfortable if you only went on dates in public places.You might be able to put your parents' minds at ease by doing something as simple as giving them your partner's, and your partner's parents, phone numbers. But before you give your parents the number, let your partner (and his or her parents) know first.Although it can be embarrassing, some especially strict parents might only be willing to allow you to date with a chaperon. Having one of your parents or one of your date's parents along on your date might be awkward, it's better than getting sick from stress and it's definitely better than no date at all.

, Sometimes, no matter how good your reasoning is, your parents won't take you seriously. Even though you're growing up, to you parents you're still their child, and it can be hard for your parents to accept your new, more adult perspective. In this case, you might talk with an adult you feel comfortable with, like an aunt, uncle, church leader, teacher, or school counselor, and ask if they can help you talk to your parents.


You may want to try talking to your parents on your own first, even if you are certain they won't listen. This way, if your parents get upset that you've involved someone else, you can politely point out that you already tried to talk to them about it. Be respectful, upsetting your parents might make things more difficult for you., Hiding things from your partner or not telling the whole truth about your situation can be unhealthy for your relationship.Make sure your partner knows your situation and why you feel like you can't be honest with your parents. If your partner is still OK with dating secretively, you can discuss the boundaries you'll both need to respect to keep your parents from finding out.These boundaries will vary according to your situation. In a city, it's likely you'll have more anonymity than a rural area, which means you'll have less of a chance of someone spotting you with your partner.
There's always the possibility that you'll bump into a friend, relative, or acquaintance, so you'll need to discuss how you expect to act in public and what you story is. You could claim you are simply friends, classmates working on a group project, or maybe you ran into each other and decided to hang out at the mall.

, Due to the fact that keeping your relationship a secret can cause severe stress, you might want to find at least one trustworthy person you can share your feelings with. This will give your feelings an outlet which should help decrease stress. However, choose your outlet wisely; there's always the chance that your outlet may let the cat out of the bag.


Think about choosing an adult to confide in, like an aunt, uncle, or school counselor. You may trust your best friend with your life, but you never know when an argument or hurt feelings might lead to something being said., Word can spread very rapidly on social media. Even if you don't have any lovey-dovey pictures posted on your Facebook page, posting too many pictures of you and your partner together can also be suspicious.If you want to use social media to help keep track of milestones, fun times, birthdays, and so on, you could make a fake profile and keep it private from your personal life. Your partner might also make a profile so you can be ""Facebook official"" without anyone knowing.

, But not the same passwords! Your parents may even already know your favorite passwords, so you'll want to choose something different from the usual and difficult to guess to protect your privacy.You might also want to come up with an excuse in case your parents become suspicious about why you suddenly have a new password on your phone when you never did before.


To explain your new passwords, you might say something like, ""The other day a friend of mine got pranked when someone got his phone. I don't want that happening to me, so I decided to put a password on my phone.""
Passwords can be difficult to remember. You might find it easier if you used a quote, lyric, or phrase that you'll never forget to create your password. Make your password even more difficult by using the first letter of each word and the number of words per line for lyrics, an example of which might look like:

Song: Somebody to Love, by Queen
1st line: Can anybody find me somebody to love → Cafmstl7 (the seven comes from the seven words contained in the first line)



, This can be very difficult when you're with someone you really care about, but showing your affection in public could lead to someone seeing! Gossip in middle school and high school can be especially bad, and people talking about your PDA could lead to your parents finding out.


You may find you have more privacy to physically show your affection to your special someone in secluded areas or places with poor visibility. For example, in a dark movie theatre or off the beaten path in a deserted park.

, This can be tricky. As your relationship grows and you become closer with your partner, it's only natural that you'll want to express your feelings physically, like by holding hands, hugging, kissing, and so on. You'll have to resist the urge to do so in front of your parents and others so your secret doesn't get out.


This technique can be especially useful if you and your partner aren't big on public displays of affection. However, you shouldn't just assume your partner is OK with it; he or she might actually want to hold your hand without you knowing. Keep in good communication with your partner so you're not neglecting unspoken needs."

To start dancing, just pace back and forth for a while.,
There!",How to Ask Your Crush to Dance with You at a School Dance," He might think you're a little annoying and so will the person he's dancing with. Don't be the jealous type. Let him have his fun first, no matter how hard it may be.;
, Try some slow country songs, like, ""Big Green Tractor"".

, Don't run to him right away and ask him, just do it slowly, but before anyone else does.

, Try to sound sweet and casual. Don't make it awkward for him. The worst he can do is say no. If he does, smile and say, ""No problem!"" or even, ""Okay."" You don't need to act to sad or desperate in front of them. If he says yes, make your way out to the dance floor and wrap your arms around his neck. If your crush knows how to slow dance, he will most likely wrap his hands around your waist.

, A lot of people do this when they're slow dancing, and it's not hard at all! Remember to stay calm though, and don't step on his feet! Strike up a conversation with him, otherwise it will be a bit awkward.

Identify your likes and dislikes.
Define your dreams.
Determine if there are areas of your life that require additional work., With the media bombarding you with idealized images of beauty, it is easy to forget that perfection is not attainable and beauty is not perfection. Your flaws are what make you unique—embrace your imperfections and start making them work for you.Instead of focusing on the negative aspects of your appearance, praise the features that you love.
Surround yourself with positive people that make you feel loved and beautiful. , Beauty is more than skin deep—your thoughts, actions, and passions are a reflection of who you are as a person.

Instead of judging others, compliment them.
Freely donate your time and resources to those in need of your assistance.

Be kind and ] to everyone you meet.Embrace your passions—when you do things that make you happy you will feel happy., The people in your life can have a significant impact on your self esteem.

Take care of yourself.,
Understand that girls don't see ""hot"" until high school.",How to Be Irresistible in Middle School (Guys)1," If you are a raggedy, dirty, bad-smelling guy, you are an immediate turn off for anyone- girls and boys alike.


Shower regularly, not daily. Twice a week is good because some studies show that a small bacterial build-up is actually good for your body.
Comb/brush your hair every day. Bed head can sometimes go in your favor, but it's better to play it safe. Find a hairstyle that works for you and use it every day.
If you feel the need, groom your eyebrows.
Use deodorant or any antiperspirant. Smelling good is absolutely necessary if you don't want to drive a girl away.
Brush, floss and use mouthwash on a bidaily basis.
Get plenty of sleep. Tired, bag-ridden guys look like zombies, and that is not going to attract anyone.;
, If you want someone to date you in middle school, you need to understand that until high school, most girls don't think guys their age are ""hot""; they see ""cute"" and ""adorable"" instead.


Shave whatever you're trying to grow. One of the best methods to look cute to girls is to look boyish, and facial hair will not accomplish that whatsoever. Don't worry about not looking ""manly"" around your guy friends who have some decent stubble- you'll look a lot more manly if you get a lady friend.
If at all possible, be a little chubby. An attractive girl once told me that she liked guys with a little extra (but not too much) body weight because she thought it was, like I keep saying, ""cute"" to her and her friends.

"
"
Focus primarily on academics.,
Participate in extracurricular activities.",How to Be Irresistible in Middle School (Guys)2," A guy who is smart is a major attraction to girls. If you have bad grades, a girl is less likely to be attracted to you because she doesn't want to look bad.


Complete all assignments, homework, and projects on time and to the best of your ability. You are capable of many things if you put in the effort, and that effort is very attractive to girls.
Keep your binder, notebooks, backpack, locker, desk, etc. organized.
Learn more about the topic than required.
Pay attention in class, take notes, and ask questions when you don't understand something.

, If you are into any sport your school offers, take it. Girls love athletes. Even if sports aren't your thing, there are tons of opportunities at your school for you to present yourself in a way you don't often get to.


Whatever you end up doing, work your butt off (sometimes literally!) to be the best you can. Girls love guys who do something special, but they definitely like guys who do it well better.

, Even if you aren't theoretically dating the girl, give her small things. I used to give a girl I liked a small portion of my lunch. If you feel the need, get her flowers, a drink, or something similar.

, Use your manners, hold the door open for her, say please and thank you, things of that nature. A respectful man is an attractive man.

, It may not mean much to you, but a smile is infectious. A person who smiles at another person is an encourager, who is offering a moment to another soul who just needs to know someone cares.

, While you don't want to overdo this, you will want to hug as a hello and a goodbye when you are with the special someone. This shows you care and makes them feel like you are engaged in what matters to them.

, Now, if you really are not into someone, but they really like you and you want to keep up the charade, then kiss them in unlikely places... Their hand, for instance, would be considered chivalrous. You can follow a kiss to the hand with taking said hand and pressing it against your cheek. Their forehead, however this may come across as paternal or maternal if you are not careful. Their cheek, though this may backfire as it seems rather stand-offish. More like what a friend would do. You can kiss them chastely on the lips and if they seek more involved kisses, just say its something you are saving for when you get married. This will force them into keeping it chaste as well to keep you in their love tryst but also will make them begin to wane their interest in you because their fire may burn out for you.

, Every so often, as if to punctuate what you mean, just so slightly place your hand on their arm or shoulder or, if you are more daring, their back around their waist for a 3-count then remove it. Young women especially have their hearts race pitty-pat from casual caresses. Make sure to keep eye contact

, Whatever you do, sound sincere. People can feel a fake usually from miles around. If you sound false or insincere, most people can tell, so hone up your acting skills. This will work not only with fake relationships but with your bosses and even your parents, if you get good enough.

, A person who cries is a person who has shown vulnerability in front of someone. Don't do it at the drop of a hat or for some insubstantial reason, rather cry because your dog has died or you didn't get into the college of your choice or your mom and dad are getting a divorce or you just feel so frustrated with life you could die. Make it a good reason and go with it. Don't discuss it again afterwards. Just make it a once and done kind of thing. Don't complain about everything because no one likes a whiner and don't mope for too long. Give it a half a day and then act like nothing ever happened. Smile again. Life is good.

, A person who takes time to talk with someone shows interest. Whisper it in his or her ear for more intimacy.

, Communication is a 2 way street. Don't play just the talking part, ask questions and sit back because people love nothing more than to talk about themselves. For the ones that don't and are true introverts, it make take some convincing, but if you want them to fall in love with you even more, this will do the trick.

, A person who sings for their loved one shows they are not afraid to let go of their inhibitions in front of them. We have all been told not to sing before, even the really good singers. Sing quietly just for him or her while holding them in your arms. This tells them you are willing to unhinge.

Be yourself on your date!",How to Tell a Guy You Like Him," If he does, go forth with confidence because you have nothing to lose! If he doesn't, don't despair, you have a chance to change his mind. Obviously, if he's seeing someone else, you want to move on, at least for the time being. But if he doesn't yet have feelings for you, there's still plenty of room to be friendly and flirt. Here are some ways to learn about a guy before you approach him:


Ask around about him. If you're shy, ask a good friend to help find out if he likes you, or is dropping hints. If you know for a fact that he likes you, you can afford to be a little more bold.
Look for hints he may drop. If a guy likes you, he tends to go out of his way to be with you. (This is not always true, but often a good indicator.) He'll make excuses to sit next to you, be at social events you're at, and may even start to hang out with your friends. Keep an eye out!
If you catch him staring at you, look at him in the eyes and try to hold contact for a few seconds. If he keeps contact, you know he likes you back. If he turns away, it could mean he likes you and is shy. Beware, however, as there is more than one reason for people to stare at each other. You may have spinach in your teeth!;
, In order to tell a guy you like him, you'll need to first have a talking relationship. This just means being on friendly terms, knowing a little about each other, and beginning to develop a more intimate familiarity. This is also a good chance to learn more about a guy - this new information may influence whether you want to tell him you like him or not. Here's some ways to start friendly conversations:


You may want to start a conversation about something that will flatter him. A great conversation starter is something that makes him feel good about himself. Try:

""That was a great football game you played in last Friday. I was in the stands watching with my friend. How long have you been playing?""
""You're always at the top of the class in English exams. Can you read every teacher's mind, or just Ms./Mr. ?""
""I like your hair. Did you get a haircut recently?""



, A great conversation starter is talking about things you can potentially do together (this doesn't necessarily have to be something you share the same interests in - the boy might eventually enjoy it if he is doing it with you). That way you both feel more comfortable.


Here are just a few conversation-starting examples:

""Hey, do you know what the math homework is? I left my planner in class and I don't have it memorized.""
""Does your older brother go to Gunn? My sister thinks they share a class together.""
""I noticed you have a Schwinn bike. How do you like it? I was thinking about asking my parents for one this Christmas.""


It may seem obvious, but it bears mentioning: Don't tell him you like him if you're not at least on good speaking terms. If you surprise someone you don't know well by openly revealing your attraction, you could scare him off. At the very least, it will affect the course of any future friendship or courtship.

, Stereotypically, guys are bad at realizing that girls are flirting with them. This may have some basis in fact - the internet is full of guides for men that attempt to answer the question, ""is she flirting with me?"" That doesn't mean that you should flirt more; it just means that you should be aware that he might not flirt back with you, even if he likes you.


When he's talking to you, twirl your hair as you listen. This action is natural enough for most people not to make anything of it, but if he says something about it, then he's definitely paying attention. This is an easy flirting method to use.
Ask him to do you a favor. This one is sweet, but it can backfire for a number of reasons: he might not want to do you a favor in front of his friends, or yours, because he's embarrassed. Stick to simple favors:

Ask him to hold your backpack in between classes. You can tell him it's really heavy and you want someone strong to help you out.
Ask him to do homework with you, even if you don't need much help. This is the perfect excuse to get close to him, and also a good indicator of how patient he is.
Above all, try not to be needy - don't try to make him help you move or anything!


Smile, show him your eyes, and be available. Show him all the things that make you really attractive. Smile your wonderful smile, show him your mesmerizing eyes, and be around when he's around. He'll start to notice you very soon!

, Begin to show him that you're interested by touching him in safe but suggestive places. Try these on for size:


Hang or rest on his shoulder. Pretend to be bored and rest your head on his shoulder. Or simply rest your hands on his shoulder. Give him a good look in his eyes if he looks back at you.
If he teases you, gently ""hit"" them on the shoulder. Mostly, girls do this when guys are playfully teasing them. You can pretend to be upset or take it with a laugh.
Find excuses to touch him. If he's got really big hands, just take his hands and say something like ""Wow, you're hands are huge; look at how big they are compared to mine!"" Fit your hand into his.

, If you're feeling brave, simply tell him. You want to catch him away from his friends, and with ample time. Look confident (better yet, be confident.) Start up a regular conversation, and wait until a pause to tell him.

, This is a good method to try because you're not openly expressing your attraction - just the possibility of future attraction. All you're really asking is whether he wants to go somewhere with you. If he's been responding well to your flirting and conversation, there's no reason why he shouldn't want to! Try something like:


""Hey, I was going to see that movie on Saturday until my friend bailed on me. Do you wanna go with me?""
""I've been dying to go to that haunted house on Main street and I haven't found anyone brave enough. Are you game?""
""My parents and I go to the state fair every year — don't ask, it's a long story — and they were wondering if I wanted to bring along someone from school. Do you want to go?""

, Either place the notes yourself or have one of your trusted friends to help you out.


Write a cute note saying, ""I like you"" and stick it in his locker.
Write ""I like you"" on a piece of paper, making sure to write who it's for but not who it's from. Ask a few of your friends to pass the note around and ""randomly"" get it to him. If he reads the note and looks around expectantly, you can either hint that you wrote it or leave him guessing.

, If he says yes, be confident that he likes you for who you are and that you're genuinely likable. Don't question his reaction - you might shoot yourself in the foot by saying ""really?"" if he says he likes you too. You have every reason to be confident.


If he doesn't like you back, just casually dismiss him by saying something like, ""Oh, OK. Don't worry about it."" Then, move on! Remember that a ""no"" response doesn't mean he thinks you're horrible. His motivations may be complicated. Have confidence that his tastes don't define you, and that there are plenty of other guys out there who would be lucky to have you. Remember that!

, then send one saying ""Soooo sorry that was meant for (insert you friend's name here.)"" If he likes you, he'll now have almost no reason not to ask you out.

, Romantic feelings can be confusing! Give yourself at least a few days to consider your feelings and follow some of the advice in this article. If you act too soon, you may find your feelings about your crush change over time.


Ask yourself questions like these: ""Do I have a true romantic crush on this boy, or just an infatuation?"" ""What things do I like about this guy?"" ""What outcome do I want?"" If you can't answer these questions, try to get to know him better before proceeding.
Only you will know whether you truly like someone. However, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, you can try taking an online quiz and interpreting the results as you please.

, No matter how cute your crush is, he's still a human being! He's probably as nervous as you are about discussing who he likes. Similarly, even if it's not apparent yet, he probably has plenty of flaws. Don't get too emotionally invested in a relationship that hasn't even started!


If you're having a hard time thinking of your crush as anything other than a perfect Adonis, try to mentally note things about him, however small, that make him look silly or stupid! Does he have a tiny bald spot? Does he pronounce ""epitome"" as ""ep-it-tome?"" Recognizing that everyone has flaws will make even the cutest guys much more approachable.

, Does he seem to pay special attention to you? Does he smile a lot around you? Or, on the other hand, does he tease you and try to playfully ignore you? These are all signs that a guy might like you. If you can identify possible attraction cues, you'll have a much easier time telling him you like him because you'll already have an idea of how he feels!


A guy's body language can reveal his inner emotions. Does he position his chest and shoulders toward you, even if his attention is momentarily occupied by something else? Does he seem to make eye contact with you a lot?He may be pondering how to tell a girl he likes her!


, Despite your best preparations, he might not return your interest. Acknowledge this as a possibility and try not to worry about it - if he says no, it's not because he hates you. He just doesn't currently want to date you. This can be for any number of reasons. Don't let him see that his negative response bothers you ( even if it does).


He may be reeling from a messy breakup.
He may be too emotionally immature to pursue a relationship.
He may simply enjoy being single.

, In the past, it was scandalous for women to ask men out. Today, much of the stigma has disappeared. However, many women still are hesitant to ask men out. A 2011 study of mostly college-age people found that 93% of women preferred being asked out by men.Be proactive! You will get more dates if you are confident enough to approach men yourself.

, Keep your momentum up - don't let a budding attraction wither because you're both too afraid to plan a date. You don't have to go on a date the very day you find out you like each other, but try to plan one within a week or two. By dating, you'll get to know each other even better and you'll learn whether you're a good romantic match.


A good time to schedule a date is the weekend following whenever you admit that you like each other.
For your first date - try to plan so that at least part of the date allows you to talk to each other. For instance, if you want to see a movie, plan to have dinner as well. A good first date is casual, low-pressure, and uniquely ""you.""
A date doesn't have to be extravagant. A great first date can be as simple as doing homework and having a picnic at the park. Here are a few more low-cost ideas if you're having a hard time thinking of dates:

A local carnival, seasonal fair, or amusement park.
Rollerskating or ice skating. If one of you isn't a great skater, even better - you'll have to hold each other to keep from falling!
Hiking. If you can make it to the top of a local hill or bluff, you'll be treated to a gorgeous (and romantic) view.



, The period between expressing your attraction and going on your date can be nerve-wracking, but try not to worry. A first date is a chance to get to know someone


If you're really nervous, talk to your girlfriends. They may be able to tell you hilarious first date nightmare stories. At the very least, they'll be able to remind you that first dates aren't supposed to be tremendously stressful.

, Feel free to send your crush a few flirty texts before your first date, but don't overdo it. It can be tempting to shower him with compliments, especially if you're really into each other. Resist the urge - too much too soon can be awfully intimidating, especially if the guy is less romantically experienced than you. Some sources even recommend creating a sense of mystery before the first date by maintaining total ""radio silence."", Once you know someone likes you back, it's pretty hard not to change your behavior a little bit. Still, remember that he likes you for who you are - there's no need to adopt an unnatural sex-queen persona for your first date! Act like you usually do around him - make the same inside jokes, tease him the same way. If you're a good fit, that's usually all you'll need to do.

Take it slow.",How to Avoid Dating when You Are Not Prepared," Whatever your circumstances, there has to be one main, stand-out reason. Whether that person just isn't right for you or if you're just not ready, be honest with yourself and develop your own reasoning for not wanting to date. That way, you'll be in a good position to explain yourself and won't feel as if you have to give false reasons to accept or avoid dating.;
, At some point in time, you may meet a person and think that you could possibly develop feelings for them as you're getting to know each other. Be honest with yourself about what you want, and whether or not you're ready to become emotionally intimate with another person. Either way, you can become friends with this person at a later point in time when you may be ready for a relationship.


You may find that the friendship you've shared so far will add depth and meaning to your relationship. But, if you do not intend or want it to ever blossom into an intimate relationship, that's okay, too. Being honest with that person about your expectations for the relationship and your intentions is the best thing you can do, but remember to use your words appropriately.
Use the 'Golden Rule' when deciding how to tell someone you're not interested.

, Sometimes you'll get that annoying question: ""Why are you, or why do you choose to be single?"" Be prepared to answer it in a way you feel comfortable with, but don't feel as though you have to answer in detail. Something simple like: ""I want some time to discover myself,"" or ""I don't need a relationship to be content,"" works fine, too. But not having even a simple explanation can make the interested person feel as though they have a fatal flaw. And even if that is the case, there's no reason to tear that person apart.

, Spend time with friends and family or gain a new hobby/invest more time in a current one. You'll learn that you are capable of doing activities that you enjoy on your own.


When you are ready to date and get into a relationship, you'll have your own interests to keep you busy in your partner's absence, or you'll have a great passion to share with them. Remember that you are your own person!

, The bonus is that these people will likely share more interests with you; the downside is that you may feel compelled to connect romantically. However, there is no universal law saying that you must be in a relationship with someone you share interests with. Instead, take this opportunity to make some great friends and do some serious networking, especially if you see this hobby turning into a career path.

, Being friendly and being flirty can sometimes be perceived as the same thing, but you should never let someone make you feel guilty or pressured into a relationship because they misread your signals. But also be clear to the interested person about your intentions at that point so that they cannot further misread your signals. If they continue to be persistent and you're not interested, it's probably time to ask yourself if the friendship is worth putting effort into.


If you find yourself in a situation where you've been asked on a date, and don't feel ready to, make it clear to the interested person that you don't want to be in a relationship. Turn them down politely, with a legitimate reason, otherwise you risk hurting their feelings--especially if you want to be friends. Or, instead of declining a date for the two of you, you could suggest inviting friends to join your activity together. Be clear though that it is not a date, and make sure the interested person understands your intentions.

, If they like you as a person, then nothing should have changed in your relationship. If they get mad or upset with you, remember; it's not your fault! Try leaving them alone for a few days so that they can cool off. If they care for you and understand you, they will not let it affect your friendship. Try not to scared away easily. You can still remain friends after turning someone down, but you should always be sensitive to whether or not the other person is willing to continue the friendship, despite their intimate feelings towards you.


Don't pressure them or make them feel guilty about maintaining the friendship if they are uncomfortable with only remaining friends.
If you sense a person is starting to take an interest in you, make sure that you are clear from the start that nothing more than a friendship will be possible. Do not lead them on to stroke your own ego because that can definitely hurt any chances of remaining friends. But don't apologize for being friendly either. Some people may misinterpret friendly behavior as interest, which is why it's important to be clear about your intentions using both verbal language and body language.
Don't stay friends with people who persistently ask you out if you don't feel ready. If you remain friends with such people, you are likely going to end up committing yourself or hurting the other person.

, It's okay if dating isn't number one in your priority list. Just have fun and enjoy life to the fullest. Sometimes it's great to be single!

, You of all people know what you're ready for, and feeling pressured to find a mate can be emotionally draining. Tell your close friends and family members about your choice to stay single and your reasoning behind it so that they don't continue to harass you. Otherwise, those people may assume to know your reasoning, which can complicate things even further.

, If you had a traumatic experience that has influenced your choice to stay single, do not bear the weight of that incident alone. Reach out to trusted family and friends to help you work through what happened, and/or see a therapist or psychiatrist. Keeping a private journal can also help you work through the experience and overcome it, but do not be fooled: unresolved traumatic experiences can fester over time and create new or worsening problems like anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Do some research to find the best options for your recovery so that you can live a more enjoyable and peaceful life.

, Don't forget that there are three outcomes to any intimate relationship: marriage, long-term commitment, or a breakup. Don't date unless you feel prepared for any of the above scenarios. Don't let society's expectations (or your mom's opinion) make you feel like you're a weirdo for wanting some time to date yourself. Embrace your freedom!

, If you are in a relationship where you are friends with someone but they want to date you, just remember that if you don't want to date them keep it in the friend zone. If they are truly your friend, they will understand. If you have been asked to date but you don't want to, tell them you'd rather be friends for now and not jump into things so quickly.


Let them decide whether they want to keep you in the friend-zone until you're ready or whether they find it better to go their separate ways. Whatever they choose, have knowledge in the fact that you were honest with them from the very beginning. Appreciate their decision just as they will hopefully respect yours and don't forget that if they truly like you, they will wait until you are ready. After all, if they don't wait, it's their loss!

Be genuine with your compliments and make your conversation nonchalant, fun and witty at the same time. You will probably catch a smile or giggle from her. Compliment that she has pretty hair or that she looks nice.;
, Be yourself. Your body language reflects how you feel. Being relaxed will show you are confident and amiable. Otherwise, you may appear awkward, or worse, look like someone to avoid.

, Show respect for her even as you are flirting-- that way she will not take your remarks the wrong way. Don't be scared to let her know you enjoy her company and want to get to know her.

, This is an innocent way to see if she will respond to more flirtatious behavior from you. Think of other things about her that you can compliment, such as her appearance, her dress style, her weird purse or the color of her eyes. Try to comment in such a way that you catch her interest and also make her laugh.

, Go up and talk to her! Don't be shy; girls love it when you just talk to them.

Be obvious.",How to Flirt if You Are a Shy Girl," If you already have your crush’s number, texting is a great resource for flirting. Since you’re not having an in-person conversation, there’s no pressure to respond immediately, which gives you time to brainstorm the next witty comment you’re going to make.


Don't just text ""Hi."" This puts all the pressure on him to move the conversation forward, which often leads to the conversation going nowhere.Instead, try asking what he's up to or reminding him of something funny that happened in school.
Be available but not too available. Responding to texts right away shows a certain amount of over-eagerness that your crush may find unattractive. By letting a little time go by between texts, you show your crush that you’re a busy person with a lot going on, which makes you more appealing.
Don't wait longer than 24-hours to text back, as this indicates a lack of interest on your part.;
, If you and your crush are friends on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or SnapChat, use those platforms to flirt. Leave a comment on a post or favorite one of their Tweets. Showing interest in them online gives them a heads up that you might be interested in them in person. Also, knowing what they’re up to on social media gives you something to talk about when you finally speak face-to-face.


Don't go overboard when it comes to showing interest on social media platforms. You don't want to scare them off. Avoid liking very old pictures or Tweets, as this indicates stalking.Try commenting with compliments. Everyone wants to hear nice things about themselves, so try complimenting him on anything from the shirt he's wearing in his Facebook profile picture to a move you saw him post on SnapChat.

, Use your own social media platforms to show how much fun you are. Post pictures of you and your friends, post funny status updates, anything you think showcases your point of view and interests. Showing your crush how much fun you are to hang out with will make them want to spend time with you more.


Make sure your profile picture is a good representation of you. This is the first image your crush will see of you online, so make sure it's flattering and portrays the best version of yourself., If you feel awkward talking to your crush by yourself, bring a friend along to serve as your buffer. Your friend can help by moving the conversation forward, helping you and your crush find common interests and by telling your crush things about you that maybe you’re too shy to tell them yourself.Give your friend a head’s up that you’re interested in your crush. If they don’t know, they can’t help you, and they may accidentally end up flirting with them themselves.

, If you’re concerned that you might be too shy to flirt, creating an alter ego is a great option. Creating a character version of yourself gives you the freedom to be bigger and braver than you might be in real life.Pick a character that has characteristics that are completely different than your own. There's no point in creating an alter ego if she's going to be a very similar version of who you are in real life.
Give your character a name and backstory. Shop for clothes for her that are different than the ones you would normally wear as yourself.

, Asking questions is a great way to take the pressure off you, while still demonstrating interest.Asking your crush specific questions about his life shows that you’re interested in learning more about him as a person and the more questions you ask, the fewer you have to answer.


If you're worried about running out of questions to ask, take some time before hanging out and create a list. There are many lists of great first date questions available online, so try referencing those for some fun ideas.

, Just asking the question isn’t enough. You also have to listen to and care about the answer. If you’re spending the whole conversation thinking about what your next question will be, you’re not truly listening to what your crush is saying.Be present during the conversation and occasionally rephrase what your crush is telling you, just to show that you’re listening and you care about the message.


Put your phone down. It's impossible to be a good listener if you're fooling around on the Internet, so stash the distractions and focus on the conversation., It takes most people a while to realize you’re interested in them, and making eye contact is one clear way to cut down on the confusion. Make eye contact with your crush and hold their gaze for up to three seconds (if you look away sooner, they may think you’re not interested, as most non-romantic eye contact lasts approximately 1.18 seconds.)Don't stare at your crush, it may make them uncomfortable. Count to three, slowly, in your head, and then break eye contact. Eye contact lasting longer than three seconds may be off-putting.

, On the whole, men find women who wear red more attractive.Red is the color of romance and attraction, so by wearing something red, especially close to your face, you’ll be able to flirt without saying a word.

, A smile can light up your face and be a clear indicator of friendliness. Try making eye contact with your crush, smiling, and then after holding their glance for a little longer than is comfortable, looking away.This will leave your crush wanting more, but also clearly conveys your interest and attraction to them.

, Only 36% of men and 18% of women are accurately able to identify when they’re being hit on. The clearer you are with your intentions and affections, the higher the chance that your crush will realize what is happening and start flirting back.

Your effort to make a good impression should be subtle, yet noticeable. Aim to find a balance in all that you do to prepare yourself for the date and in your behavior as well.


For example, don’t wear overly dressy clothes to make a good impression. Wear something that is comfortable for you to wear, but that is a little nicer than your daily attire.;
, Get clothes that fit you and aren't overly baggy or tight. Choose a style that makes you feel comfortable and confident. Don't choose flashy clothing just to make a good impression. You'll feel more at ease and the date will go better if you feel comfortable in the clothing that you're in.


If you're a bigger guy avoid horizontal stripes or clothing that's overly baggy or tight.
If you are skinny, you'll want to avoid the monochromatic look and choose lighter colors and fitted shirts.
If you're short, consider accessories like a necklace or watch and avoid wearing big prints or graphic t-shirts. Short rise pants may also help you look taller.Button down shirts, clean slacks, jeans, and clean t-shirts are all good options for a casual dining date.

, Once you pick out an outfit that you'd like to wear, it's important that you clothes are washed and pressed. It will show your date that you put in the effort to look nice, and may impress them. Wrinkled or stained clothes give off a vibe that you couldn't care less about the date, and that it's not really important to you.It also serves as an indication of how organized you are in other areas of your life.

, The way you smell has a big impact on whether your date will find you attractive. Remember to shower or bathe before your date so that you smell fresh. Wear underarm deodorant if you are prone to sweating, and consider wearing a cologne or a fragrance if you typically have body odor.Don’t overdo it on cologne, aftershave, and body sprays. Keep it light to avoid an overpowering scent.

, Before you make your plan, talk to your parents and ask for permission. Then, talk to your date and ask them what they enjoy doing to get ideas for the date. If you're going to see a show or movie, you can ask your parents to buy tickets in advance just in case they sell out. Planning in advance will show initiative and will put your date at ease.If you want to go to a nice restaurant, make sure to make reservations.
Planning a date will also show that you're confident in your decision making. However, keeping your plans for the date a surprise can also be a nice way to build excitement.

, Think about how much money the date is going to cost and make sure to bring extra cash to cover all of your expenses. If you don't have your own money, you'll have to ask your parents to help you. If you were the one that asked for the date in the first place, it's good etiquette to cover the costs., It's important that you set the pace for the date. Giving them a hug will set a positive tone for the rest of the date and put it in a romantic tone. Don't go for a hug if the person doesn't look like they want one. You should be able to notice this if you go for one and they pull back. In this case, just shake their hand and start talking to them., Make sure that you talk to your parents before you plan a date to get permission. You will also want to introduce yourself to your date's parents when you pick them up. Shake their hand when you meet them and explain what your plan for the date is so that they know where you are going.


To introduce yourself say something like, ""Hello Mr. Green, my name's Gerard and I'm here to pick up Lilly. How are you today?""
Be sure to tell her parents about your plans, but try to keep some of your plans secret from her.

, It's best if you both arrive at the date at the same time, that way you don't have to go looking for each other in a crowd. Make sure to figure out how you'll be getting to the date. If it's not in walking distance, then talk to your parents and ask them to give you a ride. Before you leave to pick them up, give them a confirmation call or text and let them know you are coming.Taking public transit or riding your bike can also get you to the date.
If it doesn't make sense to meet up before the date because you both live far away, make sure to be on time for the date.

, You don't want the date to feel like an interview. Don't be overly concerned with the fact that it's a date. Rather than constantly focusing on acting polite or doing the right thing, be yourself and try to get to know them better. Humor is a great way to lighten up a dull conversation. Try to be funny.
If you are concentrated on saying and doing the right things at all times then you'll come off as dull and boring.
Keep in mind that acting natural can take some practice. Try putting yourself into an uncomfortable situation and allowing yourself to get used to the feeling, such as by wearing a watch and asking people for the time anyways.

, Aim to have fun, while also learning more about her and letting her get to know more about you. Don't talk about serious things too quickly. Instead, talk about what they like to do for fun, their favorite TV shows or musicians, or weird pet peeves they might have. Serious conversations about close friends and family should be reserved for once you're in a more serious relationship with them.If the conversation gets boring, throw out a random question like ""If you could travel to any place in the entire world, where would it be?""
If you notice that a topic has struck a nerve or made them feel uncomfortable, back off the topic and talk about something else.

, Get specific with your compliments but don't make them feel uncomfortable. Point out things like their hair, their stylish shoes, or jewelry. You also want to make sure not to shower them with too many compliments or it may come off as fake and forced.You can say something like, ""Wow, your shoes really flow with the rest of your outfit. You look pretty.""

, One of the rudest things that you can do on a date is to look at your cellphone constantly, browse social media, or respond to texts during the date. This shows a lack of interest in your date and what they have to say. Put your phone on silent and put it in your pocket.When you are more absorbed by what's on your phone rather than your date, your date will feel neglected.

, Talk about how much fun that you had with them towards the end of the date and how much you enjoyed it. This will make them less nervous and self-conscious about how the date went and will show them that you are interested in going out again.


If you didn't enjoy the date at all, be honest and tell them that you're not sure if you'll see them again. Don't give them false hope if you didn't have fun. However, don’t be rude if this is the case. Be direct and tactful.

, If you enjoyed your time with them, you should ask them for a follow-up date. Make sure to get permission to text or call them occasionally. Make the follow-up date for a specific time in the future so that they can free up their schedule in advance.You can say something like, ""I really had a lot of fun. I'd like to get together again, are you doing anything next weekend?""

, Watch their body language at the end of the date to see what is appropriate for you to do. If you both had a really good time, you should go in for a hug. If your date didn't seem to enjoy themselves or seemed uncomfortable and handshake will do. Lastly, if the date was very romantic and flirtatious, they may be open to a kiss. See if they are happy and smiling when you hug them. If they pull away, they do not want to kiss or hug you., Make sure that your date gets home safely by driving or walking home with them. Talk to your parents about giving them a ride home. Even if the date didn't go well, you should take it upon yourself to make sure that they get home safely.

, It is common to want to reflect on how the date went, but don’t replay every aspect of the date back to yourself and try to analyze it. Just move on with your day, even if you don’t think the date went well. You cannot change the past, so it’s best to just use the date as a learning experience and move forward.

Be yourself.,
Clean yourself up.,
Dress well.,
Do what you enjoy.,
Relax.,
Be honest with your intentions.",How to Act Around Girls1," Altering your personality to gain the approval of a girl can work in the short-term, but eventually she will find out who you truly are. In the meantime, you’ll feel fake and unhappy. Know who you are. Own up to your thoughts and feelings in life. This makes you appear genuine and certain of yourself, which is appealing to girls.Avoid becoming overly generous or aggressive in an attempt to win her over.Put less attention into pleasing girls, too. Appreciate your flaws and don’t let them distract you.
If you like yourself and become comfortable with who you are, then you will be more comfortable around other people. And if things don't go well, it won't matter as much. Only you can make yourself happy, and if you like yourself, that's the most important thing.;
, Maintaining proper hygiene makes you look and feel better. Take a shower in the morning. Wash your hair. Put on deodorant and clean clothes before you go outside. It’s better than having to worry about how you smell when you’re around a girl.


You may choose to put a little perfume or cologne on your neck and shoulders. If you do, use it sparingly.

, If possible, go out and find some clothes that are right for you. They don’t have to be expensive, but they should fit well and feel comfortable on you. Clothes that you like wearing make you feel more confident and able to focus on girls instead of your appearance.Try observing those around you for ideas on what’s fashionable, but remember that a good outfit is one that is customized to you.
Ask store employees for feedback. Many can guide you to a proper fit.

, You can have fun with girls doing what they want to do, but remember to take time out for yourself. Go out and continue to do what makes you happy. If it’s watching science fiction and reading comics, do it and don’t be embarrassed. This makes you happier and appear more genuine because you don’t have to feel ashamed of your interests.


You may find yourself getting absorbed in a girl you like. Remember to take a step back some days and give yourself some space.

, Being tense around girls makes them tense too. If you’re looking around trying to figure out what to say or how to escape the situation, you aren’t focusing on the girl. Breathe deeply before approaching and when not speaking. Repeatedly tell yourself that nothing bad will happen. Stay present, focused on the girl instead of an anxious feeling.Most people aren’t out to hurt you, are absorbed in their own lives, and will forget your mistakes., Starting out befriending a girl you’re interested in is a good idea, but if you have feelings for her, don’t hide them. Work towards starting a relationship, paying attention to her. If you hide your feelings, she won’t know how you feel and can feel betrayed or in a bad position when she does find out. Conversely, don’t lead on a girl if you only want to be friends.Remember to respect her boundaries. Don’t push your feelings upon her if she doesn’t return your interest.

Make her feel special.,

Make contact.,
Don't be upset if she's not into it.,
Slide your hand under hers.,
Place your hand on top of hers.,
Do the palm-to-palm.,
Clasp hands.,
Hold pinkies.,
Know that it's okay to take a break.,
Mix it up.,
Kiss her hand.",How to Hold a Girl's Hand," When you see the girl, say hi, make eye contact, give her a wave, and start talking to her. If it's your first time holding hands, then you may both be a little nervous, so it's important to put both of yourselves at ease first. Though holding hands is an innocent gesture, it does come with a level of intimacy, so you should have a good sense that the girl likes you before you go make the move. Even putting your arm around her or putting a hand on her knee can be seen as less intimate than actually holding hands, so try initiating other innocent physical contact before you hold her hand first.;
, If you're sitting, just place your hand down about an inch away from hers. This can help you get a read for how ready she is to hold hands -- if she moves closer to your hand, then she's probably ready for more. If you're standing and walking together, try to get closer to her until your hands are just inches apart.

, You should make some physical contact before you go ahead and grab her hand. If you're standing, put an arm around her shoulder and brush against her arm until you reach her hand, or keep walking and gently ""accidentally"" touching hands until taking her hand in yours feels natural. When you're ready to make contact, you can choose from a variety of ways to hold her hand.


Try to be as relaxed as possible before you make contact. The more nervous you are, the more likely you'll be to have sweaty hands! Of course, this is not the worst thing in the world, but if you can avoid it, that's great.

, Contrary to what you may think, not all girls love holding hands. If she pulls away because she's not interested in you, then you'll get the message pretty fast because she'll pull away with her entire body and will look generally uncomfortable. But there's a good chance that she's just not into holding hands because she thinks it's corny or because she's nervous that she has sweaty hands or something, so don't worry too much; you'll figure it out eventually.

, This is a bold and effective maneuver. If you're nervous, let just the edges of your hands touch for a bit before you go in for the kill. Just slowly and gently slide your hand under hers so that her hand is on top of yours. You can move your hand around a little bit to gently play with her fingers. This works great when you're sitting down.

, This is another intimate technique. Just move your hand so that it is over her hand and gently pat or touch her hand. If you feel more comfortable, you can even give her hand a few gentle squeezes or even a massage. This can be a great hand holding technique if you're sitting at a restaurant or even watching a movie. It doesn't get as tiresome as holding hands when you're walking can get, because you can just relax and rest your hand on top of the girl's.

, This is a common way to hold a girl's hand. Just move your hand so that your palms are facing each other. You can even gently caress her palm if you're sitting down and feeling more playful. You can do this more relaxed hand holding move before you fully clasp hands.

, After you touch palms, you can intertwine your fingers, fully clasping hands. This can work whether you're sitting down or standing up, though it's probably more typical for couples that are standing up and walking. You can hold her hand passively, just clasping it, or caress her fingers a little bit. If you're walking while holding hands and are feeling playful, you can even swing your hands back and forth a bit.

, This is another flirtatious and fun way to hold hands. Simply move your pinkie towards hers and lock pinkies. This is a fun one because you can pull apart or get closer together and just be playful with one another. You can also try this one when you're walking, which can be fun if you're swinging your hands back and forth a bit. You should probably wait until you're more comfortable holding hands the regular way before you make this move, though.

, Once you start holding hands, you aren't required to spend the rest of the evening, the walk, or the movie doing so. It's okay to take a break, whether it's because your hands are sweaty, your hand is getting tired, or because you just feel like it. Just break contact off gently instead of abruptly dropping the girl's hand, and you'll be fine.

, You don't have to clasp her hand, clasp pinkies, or put your hand on top of the girl's the whole time. Mix up your hand holding techniques so you don't make the girl feel like she's holding a limp fish in her hand. Stimulating her hand too much can make her feel too frenzied, but just letting your hand sit there can make hand holding feel about as romantic as studying for a Geometry test, so find a balance between caressing her hand, not caressing it, and moving between different hand-holding techniques.

, If the hand-holding is going great and you and the girl are really hitting it off, lift her hand to your mouth and kiss the back of her hand. You can even make eye contact when you do it for a more intimate touch. This is a very romantic gesture, and you should use it sparingly. But if you do it at the right time -- like at the end of a nice hand-holding session -- it will really make her like you!

"
Maintain eye contact.,
Engage girls in conversation.,
Listen actively.,
Show genuine interest in people.,
Be attentive to her feelings.,
Make her laugh.",How to Act Around Girls2," As you approach a girl to start a conversation, look her in the eyes. This displays confidence and, when she is speaking, an interest in what she is saying. Don’t stare, however, especially when you’re not having a conversation with her. Look at her enough to show that you’re paying attention, then look away.


To practice eye contact, start with a mirror, then move on to friends and strangers.
Eye contact is difficult but it prevents you from getting caught looking at the rest of her body.

, Greet girls by saying hello and bringing up appropriate topics. Icebreakers include asking for opinion on clothing, talking about a class you share, complimenting a girl on making a good point, or offering to help her.Do this at times to gain confidence around girls and build towards deeper conversations.

, Truly listening to what she says and means will be appreciated by a girl. Put down your phone and try to grasp the complete meaning of what she’s saying. Don’t interrupt. Show interest by nodding and responding when she’s finished.Respond by paraphrasing the message, such as by saying, “So what you’re saying is…” to show that you get the important point of the girl’s message.
When you respond, be respectful and nonjudgmental no matter how you feel.

, To grow trust between you and a girl, communicate on a deeper level with them. Ask a girl about herself, her interests, and her desires. Show that you’re interested in learning about her as a person. This makes you appear more confident and helps girls feel more comfortable around you.A good question, for example, is to ask her what kind of music she likes. If she likes the same music, you can share that interest.

, Displaying an interest in a girl’s life builds trust with her, so she may open up to you about something that’s troubling her. Listen with interest and respond to her empathetically. Never make her feel judged or ridiculed.For example, you can say, “That’s okay, the test was really hard. You did your best.”
Encourage her in her goals, too. If she wants to be a photographer, encourage her to do it no matter what you think of the idea.

, Humor is an effective way of being charming and charismatic. Engaging in banter with girls reduces awkwardness as you learn about each other and allows you to talk about more serious issues. You don’t have to be a natural comedian, but making witty observations or recalling funny tales from your past will help you communicate with girls.Not all humor is appropriate in every situation. For example, avoid telling crude or sexist jokes around a girl you’ve just met.
As you spend more time with a girl, you’ll learn what she finds funny and develop inside jokes between you and her.

"
"
Respect personal space.,
Display good manners.,
Treat everyone the same.,
Don’t talk about people behind their backs.",How to Act Around Girls3," When first meeting a girl, a handshake is enough. Don’t crowd up against her, bring your face near hers, or touch inappropriate areas such as the face. As you build your relationship, use your judgment as to how much physical contact is welcome. Start with gentle hand and shoulder brushes during conversations and standing close during opportune times such as parties and concerts.If you desire a relationship, ramp up your contact as you go. Then you can try hugging and flirting if she is okay with it.
Never touch a girl when this is unwanted. Respect her personal boundaries and pull back when she is uncomfortable.

, Behave with grace around girls. Inappropriate actions including swearing, farting, or telling rude jokes are sure to make a girl not want to be around you. In addition, hold open the door and say please and thank you to show respect.

, Talk to everyone — boys, trans people, and so on — the same way you’d talk to a girl. Show everyone respect and kindness and you listen to what they have to say. Avoid starting fights. When girls are around, they’ll see this and consider you to be a mature and genuine person.This is hard to do when arguing or encountering someone you don’t like, but try to avoid outbursts of emotion. Breathe deeply and control what you say.

, Talking badly about someone who isn’t present has the same effect as an unpleasant confrontation in-person. Avoid gossiping. Sharing negative information will make you look immature to girls and cause them to wonder if you talk about them too when they’re not around. Continue to be respectful as much as possible.


In return, don’t speak negatively about girls or share their secrets with your friends. This information may get back to them and give you a bad reputation.

Choose an opening line.,

Lightly touch your crush.,
Flirt innocently.,

Be a good listener.,

Leave them wanting more.",How to Flirt (for Teens)," If you want to flirt with someone, you need to talk to them! Come up with an opening line to make this approach easier.


The opening line, though, should not be something too corny or cliché or the crush might respond with a laugh! If they do, laugh it off yourself! You could offer the person gum or a Tic-Tac.
The best opening lines refer to natural points of common interest. For example, you could make a comment or ask a question about a homework assignment or a movie everyone is talking about. Say something like, ""Hey, what did you think about that math test? I thought it was hard."" Or: ""Did you see X movie? I'm trying to decide whether to go check it out.""The key is to break the ice and strike up a conversation.;
, Flirting should be positive, and make the other person feel better about himself or herself.You could say, ""Hey, I like your T-shirt! Where'd you get it?"" Or: ""How do you always do so well on tests? Tell me your secrets!""


People will want to be around you more if you build them up with positive, but sincere, compliments. So pick something that you really like about the person, and let them know! Don’t do this too much or in an over-the-top fashion or it could sound phony.
A compliment can also work as an opening line. A compliment is also basically a reaching out to the other person, and it’s likely to make him or her open up to you more.

, Try not to make the other person do all of the conversation heavy lifting. Conversation can be very flirtatious if done right.


Don’t let the conversation sink into long silences because that can be awkward and uncomfortable for everyone. Ask questions if all else fails. ""How do you think the football team is going to do tonight?"" Or: ""Did you hear that new song that X artist put out?""
When talking, try to focus on common interests. Maybe you both like the same music group or have common groups of friends. Stay positive and don’t badmouth other people! Ask a question about something they like or are involved in.

, Do this nicely. Mean teasing that hurts someone’s feelings isn’t going to make him or her feel closer to you.


Lighthearted teasing, though, is a way to communicate interest. You could say something like, “You tried out for football? You’re so good I’m surprised you even needed a tryout!”
Be funny. Humor is attractive to most people if it’s done in a way that doesn’t seem cruel and doesn’t poke fun at people’s differences. Be very careful about teasing or complimenting a teenager about his or her body size or appearance because what you think they will like, might not work. Teenagers can be very sensitive. , Although a cliché, this requirement is essential when flirting. Being phony or fake isn't attractive.


Think about it: if this whole flirt thing gets to bf/gf status anytime soon, the other person is going to realize you're not the same person if you put on airs and graces and pretended to be different from your true self in some attempt to win the other person over.
If this person isn't attracted by who you really are, then they're not worth your time and effort.

, Body language is a big part of flirting, and a big part of that is eye contact. Eye contact conveys intimacy and interest.


You will seem uninterested or even snobby if you make no eye contact at all. Or you will seem extremely shy. Glance at his lips and then look away.Don’t stare endlessly. That can be creepy. Make periodic eye contact. Meet your crush’s gaze briefly, smile coyly, and then glance away. Then, repeat.

, A key part of flirting is smiling. Smiling communicates to people that you feel positively and warm about them.


Don’t smile too much or it could seem phony, as with eye contact. It’s important to smile at natural moments.People like to be around people who seem happy and make them feel good about the world and themselves. Confidence is infectious, and a key way to project confidence is to smile.

, Body language experts say there is closed body language and open body language. To flirt, you will want to communicate with open body language.


Open body language means such things as palms up, arms and legs uncrossed, moving slightly into the other person’s space (say by leaning forward), and smiling.Closed body language means feet turned away, hands turned down, arms crossed over the chest, a non-smile, and leaning away. In addition to communicating open body language to him or her, you can assess whether he or she likes you or is receptive to flirting by studying his or her body language.

, Awkward alert, for sure. However, if you’ve chatted before and get along well so far, try making light contact with the person by playfully poking or wiping an imaginary eyelash off their cheek.


Tap your crush on the elbow when you say something about them, or gently fix a flyaway hair.
See how the other person reacts. If they step away (putting physical distance between you), cross their arms (putting symbolic distance between you), finds an excuse to start texting, etc., stop flirting (or stop flirting so hard – it’s possible you’re coming on too strong).

, The best flirting is subtle. It means that you’re communicating interest in the other person without doing it overtly. There’s an art to it.


That means that overt activities such as sexting are not good ideas. For one, it can be illegal and against school rules. For another, it is highly unlikely to gain you the type of interest you want.A much better way to flirt is simply to talk to the other person with actual interest about things you’re both involved in. Avoid sexual talk. Even if you weren’t young, it’s not a good way to go about it!

, This doesn’t mean that you send dirty texts or sext. Don’t do those things. They are not attractive and could get you in big trouble.


Flirting by text (or other social media) simply means you indicate interest and offer positive feedback. You could text them a comment about a homework assignment for example. Be casual. Stay only very positive on social media, posting statuses that focus on activities you are doing. This will make him or her want to be part of your exciting life!
You could click like on one of their photos on Facebook, retweet one of their Tweets, or add them on Snapchat. This is the Internet equivalent of going up to the in person to say hi. You could use emojis to indicate interest., People like to talk about themselves. Let’s face it. You will draw his or her interest by being a good listener sometimes and a support system.


Ask questions when he or she is talking in order to indicate that you are really listening and offer positive feedback.
Lean a little closer or touch the person’s shoulder if they are going through a hard time to indicate warmth and caring. Don’t only talk about yourself!

, Research has shown that people, especially boys, are naturally drawn to red, sometimes without even realizing it.Similarly, if you’re female, you could wear lip gloss, which some people find attractive, or dangling earrings to highlight a long neck. Spritz perfume or cologne on the back of your neck.
Avoid dark colors that seem drab and depressing. Wear vibrant and fun colors and softer pastels that indicate romance (like pink, light blue, etc.)

, If your flirting session is going really well, you might not want it to end (especially if you like the person), but this puts the flirting session at risk of getting boring.


Avoid the friend zone. Being friendly with someone sometimes puts you at risk for coming across as too much of a, well, friend, and nothing says unsexy like being thought of as a BFF by your crush.
Avoid being too available, giving too much (time, energy, attention), or trying too hard. If you and your crush usually bump into each other at the same time every day by the lockers or in the lunch line, for example, make a point of not being there every once in a while so that they have a chance to miss you.

Let him that you think he looks nice, that you like his hair, or give him praise when he has done well on a test.Make the compliments specific to him. Think about what he likes, and what he does well. Tell him he does a great job in gym class if he’s into sports. Let him know that you really liked his English essay if he enjoys writing.
Compliment him, but don’t overdo it. Too many compliments can seem insincere.;
, Most everyone has a phone nowadays, so passing a note can seem a little out-of-date. The fact that note passing isn’t as common is what makes it fun and flirty. It’s different from the usual, and it takes more thought and effort than sending a quick message through social media or text. Take a piece of paper from your notebook, write a message, fold it up, and hand it to him during an appropriate time.Do not pass a note during class, or you might get in trouble. Wait to pass a note in the hall or during lunch.
The note can say anything you want. Short and sweet is flirtier than a sappy, long love letter, though. You can write “I’ve been thinking about you,” or “You look really awesome today.”

, Most people like to talk about themselves and enjoy when someone shows interest in them. You might already know quite a bit about your boyfriend, but there is always more to learn. If he is talking, ask questions about what he is talking about. You can also ask questions about his past, his daily life, and his interests.


If he is talking about a game he played, ask him to tell you more about how the game is played.
Ask about what he likes to do after school, what he wants to do when he gets older, and what his favorite childhood memory is.

, A sense of humor is always attractive. It shows that you don’t take things too seriously, that you know how to laugh and make people laugh, and you have the ability to let things go. Don’t be afraid to tell jokes or laugh when you find something funny. You can also find the humor in whatever situation you find yourself in with your boyfriend.Find the humor in common things. Joke about the weather, about class, or something that happened in school.
Think about your and your boyfriend’s sense of humor. What makes you laugh? What makes your boyfriend laugh? Those are the things you will want to joke and laugh about.

, Sending notes is fun, but sometimes it is easier to send a flirty text. You don’t have to wait for him to send you a message. You can message him first. Don’t send a simple “hi.” Instead, send him a sweet or funny opening text, like “I saw you falling asleep in class today.”Use emoticons, especially the winks.
Send him a text that you were happy to see him in class, or that you are looking forward to seeing him.
Don’t text him back immediately when he responds. Wait at least a few minutes.
Avoid sending a text in class. Wait for an appropriate time.

, Make plans to continue your flirting outside of school. It’s okay to ask him to hang out or go on a date after school. You can ask do to something specific, or leave it open-ended. Boyfriends will often appreciate when the other person takes initiative to ask them out.You can leave it open-ended by asking “What are you doing after school or this weekend?”
Be specific by saying “I’ve been wanting to see this movie. Do you want to go with me?”
Ask your parents permission if you are not yet at an appropriate dating age.

, Take it slow by sitting next to him whenever you see the opportunity. Sit next to him in class, at lunch, during break, or at a sport’s game. You can take this opportunity to put your head on his shoulder or hold onto his arm. He might be shy, so ask to sit next to him or do it without asking.Don’t be too close to him if it’s inappropriate during class.

, Holding hands is a sweet and simple gesture. You can brush your hand up against his to hint that you want to hold his hand, or you can simply reach out and hold his hand. Sit next to him while holding hands, or do it while walking down the hallway. The amount of time you hold hands can be as short as a few seconds, or as long as a few minutes.Try to hold hands for a short amount of time during school hours.

, Most people appreciate a hug, especially your boyfriend. A hug is a quick way to show physical affection without overdoing it. Give him a quick hug in between class, or a longer hug when you are saying goodbye at the end of the school day. You can give a quick side hug with one arm, or a full on hug. It is better to keep it quick during the school day to avoid getting in trouble.Spray some perfume on the back of your neck so that he will smell it when going in for a hug.

, Kissing during the school day can lead to trouble if it is overdone or too obvious. Instead, leave the kissing to the beginning or end of the school day and between classes when no one will be watching. Give him a quick kiss on the cheek, or a peck on the lips..


Avoid making out or prolonged kissing. This goes beyond flirting, and no one wants to see it in the hallway.
Don’t feel pressured to kiss if you have never done it before. Only kiss when you feel it is the right time for you and your boyfriend.

, Eye contact can be a powerful part of a relationship. It takes confidence to make and maintain eye contact. Your boyfriend might shy away at first, but don’t be afraid to make eye contact. You can make eye contact from across the room, or while holding a conversation.Lean into him when having a conversation and look into his eyes. This will show him that you are paying attention to him. Don’t make it uncomfortable by widening your eyes and hardly blinking. Be natural and respectful.
Make eye contact as you pass him in the hallway if you don’t have time to stop.

, You can make something for a holiday, special occasion, anniversary, or just because. You don’t have to bring him something expensive or extravagant, and it doesn’t have to be often. It can be a small and simple gesture that shows you like him. What you make him might be something sentimental, or something that you think he would be interested in. Give it to him whenever you see him during the day. If he offers you something he made, accept it and be sure to say a heartfelt thank you.Make him a scrapbook of your relationship if you’ve been together for a while.
Paint a picture. It can be of something to do with his favorite sport team or movie.

, Go to any events of his, and don’t be afraid to ask for him to attend your events. It is kind to support each other in whatever you and your boyfriend enjoys. If he plays a sport at school, attend his games and cheer him on. You can also show up to events if he’s a part of a team or club, like the debate or academic bowl team. Simply showing up will remind him how much you like him.Say yes if he asks to attend any of your events. If you ask him to attend, and he says that he can’t, don’t be upset. Tell him that it’s okay, and he can attend another one.
If he’s not part of a team, you can cheer him on while he’s playing a sport during gym class.
Compliment and support his work if he’s into art, like film, drawing, or painting.

, A well known cliché is that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach. Most boys will appreciate the thought if you bring him a dessert for his lunch, or bake him his favorite treat. Ask him what his favorite dessert his and make sure he is not allergic to what you bring him. Give it to him for a snack during the day, to eat with his lunch, or to take home.Don’t be shy if he asks what your favorite dessert or food is. Tell him if he asks. A relationship works both ways. It is not only your job to make him food, or do favors for him. If he makes something you are allergic to, tell him that you appreciate the thought, but you can’t eat it. Offer for him to share it with his friends instead.
Baking cookies and brownies is simple and won’t be difficult to take with you to school. A cake is great, but it may be hard to transport.
Ask your parents for help if you aren’t sure how to bake or make food.

, It is always nice to help a person, and you should help your boyfriend when he is in need. He should also be thoughtful enough to help you. It is especially thoughtful to help him with something when he’s not expecting it. What you decide to help him with depends on the situation and who he is. It may be as simple as giving him an extra pencil when he’s going to take a test.Ask for help if you need it. Helping each other is a healthy part of any relationship.
If you see that he’s struggling to carry his books, offer to hold one or two for him.
Offer gently to help him with a project if he’s worried about completing it or doing it. Don’t help him cheat, but offering to take some stress off of him would be appreciated.
Help him study for a test, or quiz him before an exam.

Touch them lightly.,
Make good eye contact frequently.,
Listen in an active and responsive way.",How to Flirt in High School1," If you’re comfortable with the person, feel free to touch their arm or give them a friendly hug. Touching someone frequently while you talk to them will let them know that you’re maybe interested in being more than friends.


You could try touching the person’s shoulder if they say something funny or playful.
You could also try touching their arm or hand to get their attention if you’re talking to each other in a crowd.Be careful of touching the other person too much, especially if you’re at school. Everyone has different boundaries for personal space, and you should be cautious, especially if you don’t know the person well.;

Prepare a large cage.,
Use a stainless steel cage.,
Position your cage well.,
Provide perches.,
Consider providing an indoor bird room.,
Create an outdoor bird area.",How to Care for a Hyacinth Macaw1," The hyacinth macaw requires a large cage, with the minimum of 42 inches deep, 42 inches wide and 72 inches tall. The hyacinth macaw needs a lot of room to climb, forage, and move around. Even with the larger cage, the blue macaw will need a good deal of time to fly outside the cage.If you are the owner of a blue macaw, you’ll need to be prepared to share a good deal of your home with the bird.
As the blue macaw can easily pull most locks off a cage. You’ll need to either be prepared to replace the lock often, or invest in a strong lock.;
, The macaw will easily break a standard cage 8-gauge wire with his beak. Instead, use a stainless steel wires that will not rust, bend or chip. This is the most expensive type of cage. As the hyacinth macaw will climb on and chew the bars of its cage, you’ll want to make sure it’s not ingesting any paint.If the cost of stainless steel is out of your price range, steel cages that are coated in nontoxic and non-chipping paint is an option.
Paint also helps keep your cage looking neat and presentable, and guards it against rust.

, The hyacinth macaw is a very social bird whose cage should be centered in an area of the home where it can feel part of the family. While the macaw can tolerate a wide variety of temperatures, it’s sensitive to drafts. Make sure the cage is placed in an area free of drafts.The cage should receive a good deal of natural sunlight, which the macaw will need for the development of vitamin K. Vitamin K is necessary for healthy skin and feathers.
You should let your bird out of its cage as often as possible so that the bird can spend time with your family. It also needs to get a good deal of exercise by flying out of its cage.
Because the hyacinth macaw is a very noisy bird, make sure you’re not placing its cage where it will disturb neighbors or sleeping children.

, Perches made of the branches of fruit trees are idea, since your bird can safely chew them as well as perch on them. Each perch should have an area that’s about 1 inch in diameter. You’ll need to be prepared to replace these branches regularly.In addition to perches inside your birdcage, offer plenty of places throughout your home for your hyacinth macaw to perch.
A playpen outside the cage is highly recommended. A large, free-standing perch with food and water bowls, and places to hang toys from can provide hours of entertainment for your bird (and your family!). The playpen should have a tray underneath to catch anything your bird may drop.

, If you have space for it, your hyacinth macaw will appreciate having a room dedicated for its use. Make sure the room is “bird-proof”, emptied of anything the bird can get its beak around. For example, wooden moldings, window sills, and any wooden trim will quickly get destroyed. There shouldn’t be any electrical cords visible which the bird might chew.Make sure any trees or plants are non-toxic, as your macaw will chew them.
Have fun providing perches for your bird to stand and climb, places for toys, and mounted food, water and treat dishes.

, An outdoor or breeding aviary framed in brick or metal will be ideal for your macaw. It should have a protected shelter that can be climate-controlled where necessary, as well as an attached flight cage. The flight should be long so your macaw has room to stretch his wings. Install a hardwood perch at each end and consider including a climbing branch made of a fruit or nut tree.Your bird area should also include a bird bath, generally made of concrete to prevent damage.
Make sure your bird area is well-lit for maximum benefit. Again, your macaw needs natural sunlight to maintain good health.

"
"
Tease them a little bit.,
Give them a compliment.Giving sincere, meaningful compliments can be hard, but try to get beyond something like, “I like your shirt” or “Cool sunglasses!” Instead, you should say something you like about the person that sparks a conversation between the two of you.,
Ask them an “unnecessary” question.,
Practice “reciprocal disclosure.” You and the person you’re flirting with should try to disclose about the same amount of personal information.,
Keep it positive.",How to Flirt in High School2," Don’t be mean or cutting, but you can definitely tease the person a little bit to flirt. It lets the person know that you’re comfortable joking around with them and that you’re paying special attention to them.For example, you could give your crush an endearing or dorky nickname. You could say, “Oh, you horseback ride? I think I’ll call you Saddle Club!”
You can also challenge your crush to a contest, like a race or arm wrestling. Some type of competition gives you the opportunity for flirty “trash talk.”
You could also pretend to be angry or annoyed with them. If your crush loves football, say, in a clearly joking manner, something like, “Ugh, another football fan? I’m not sure I can talk to you anymore!”,


For example, say, “I love your jersey. Are you a soccer player, or just a fan?”
Or you could try, “I liked your article in the school newspaper! Have you always been interested in organic food?”
Or say, “I love your outfit today. Who’s your style inspiration?”

, Ask them a question just to show that you’re interested in them. Something like, “What was the math homework?” does not count as an unnecessary question. Instead, try asking some of these questions:“How was your day today?” This one shows that you care about how the person is feeling.
“How did you feel about that movie?” This question demonstrates your interest in the other person’s opinion.

, This helps to build more comfort and intimacy with the other person.


For example, if the person you’re flirting with starts talking about how moving in the sixth grade was really hard, you can talk about how switching from middle school to high school was a tough transition, too.
However, if the person you’re flirting with is talking about the weather, don’t go into the details of your parents’ divorce., Negative things certainly happen (and will happen) in your life, but, for the purposes of getting to know someone, make an effort to keep your complaints to yourself. Consistent negativity is unattractive to other people."
"
Don’t wait for them to text you first.,
Respond within the day, but don’t text back immediately.,
Leave some information to be desired.,
Text randomly to make spontaneous plans.",How to Flirt in High School3," If you want to text first, go ahead! If the person wants to flirt with you, too, then they will be happy that you texted them first. Don’t worry about seeming needy or making the first move. Texting them first will show that you’re confident and interested.


If you need something to say, try talking about something you have in common, like a class you have together. Try, “This physics lab is taking me forever...how’s yours going?”
Or text, “I saw you guys had a game this afternoon! How did it go?”
You could also write something like, “Are you watching Grey’s Anatomy tonight? I can’t wait until 9…”

, Don’t text them back right when you get their text, especially if you’re doing something else. Wait a little while (anywhere between five minutes and a couple hours) to respond. Sometimes it’s better to space out your conversation so that you don’t run out of things to talk about before you see each other next.You shouldn’t let texting interrupt your life! But, if you wait longer than a day, your crush might think that you’ve lost interest or are flaky.If you take a few hours to respond, tell your crush what you were doing. Say, “Just got back from an awesome water skiing session!” or “Have you ever gone to that new restaurant in town? My parents just took me there, and it was SO yummy!”

, Don’t feel like you need to respond to every single question they ask you. Leave some questions unanswered on purpose, so they have to ask you again if they really want to know. You don’t need to respond with an essay when they ask you a question.For example, if your crush asks you what you’re doing this weekend, don’t give them your entire itinerary. Instead, say something like, “Dinner with my family, seeing some friends on Saturday, but no plans on Sunday. You?” This way, you leave your crush some room to make plans with you if they want to.
Or, if your crush asks how your lacrosse game went, say “We won, but you really have to be there to get the full experience. :)”

, Rather than having a long, drawn-out conversation that might lead to hanging out, send them a text asking them to hang out. Think about what the person likes, as well as your past conversations, when you’re thinking about what to do. Pick something that’s easy and fun, like having dinner or going mini golfing.


For example, try texting, “Loved talking about baseball with you earlier! I have two tickets to a Sox game this Saturday. Want to go? :)”
Or, you could write, “Our convo about pasta earlier made me so hungry. Want to grab some Italian food tonight?”If the person says no, make one of your friends go with you instead! You’ll still have something fun to do, regardless of whether or not your crush wants to go with you.

"
"
Ask the person to hang out with you and your friends.,
Ask the person to a dance or school event.,
Ask the person out on a date.,
Make a move.",How to Flirt in High School4," If you want a more low pressure situation to hang out with your crush, you could ask them to hang out with you and your friends that weekend. It’s a low key way to get to know them more without the added pressure of a date. You’ll also get a feel for whether or not this person gets along well with your friends, which can be important if you want to date them!


You could say, “So my friends and I usually hang out on Sunday nights and watch the game. Would you be down for that?”
Or, “Bobby, Jackie, and I were thinking about going to lazer tag on Saturday afternoon. Do you want to come?”

, If there’s a school event coming up, like a dance or a carnival, ask the person to go with you. It still has less pressure than a date (because the person would probably go anyway), but it’s still special for you two to go together. Here are some ways you can ask your crush to go with you:


You could say, “Hey! I don’t know if you’ve heard about the dance on Friday, but I was planning on going and was hoping that you would go with me. Would you like to do that?”
Or try, “Do you want to go to the home football game with me on Saturday afternoon? We could get ice cream afterwards, if you want to!”

, If you are interested in the person and they seem interested in you, too, you might want to ask them out. You should ask them out in person, rather than over a text message, because it seems more sincere. Here are some tips for asking someone out:


Have a specific date and time in mind. Don’t just ask, “Want to go out with me?” Instead, ask, “Would you like to go see the new James Bond movie with me on Saturday night?”
However, you should also be willing to move around the date and time. People can have really busy schedules, and you should think of a couple dates and times that would be convenient for you. The person might say, “I would love to, but I have plans on Saturday!” If that happens, you should have a couple of other times lined up.
Don’t take a “maybe” as a “no.” Sometimes, people have to check their schedules or check with their parents about whether or not they can go out on a date. Don’t get discouraged yet!If the person says no, don’t sweat it! There are so many people in high school (and beyond!) that will make you happy. It also might have nothing to do with you personally.

, If you want to take things to the next level with your crush, you could also try to do something physical, like put your arm around them or hold their hand. If you want to do this, you should be getting clear body language signals that your crush wants to do this, too.


If the person has positive body language around you, such as smiling at you, standing or sitting close to you, or makes a lot of eye contact with you, they might be ready for physical affection.It’s always better to ask, “Can I hold your hand?” or “Can I kiss you?” than to not do so. This will make sure that you don’t make your crush uncomfortable and that any advance you make on your crush will be well-received.

Provide appropriate food.,
Supplement your macaw’s diet with raw vegetables and fruits.,
Develop a feeding schedule.,
Discover your macaw’s favorite food.,
Provide fresh water.",How to Care for a Hyacinth Macaw2," The hyacinth macaw requires a diet unlike that of other parrots. In the wild, it eats two varieties of palm nuts which it finds undigested in cattle dung. To mimic this diet, you can substitute Brazil nuts, almonds, macadamias, coconut, pistachios and cashews.Pellet diets are not appropriate for the hyacinth macaw because the high protein content can result in kidney problems for the bird.
Macadamia nuts, high in fat, are a favorite of the blue macaw. You can also pour macadamia oil over pieces of bread for a treat. Filberts (hazelnuts) and brazil nuts are also good choices.
Smell or taste the nuts before you give them to your bird to make sure they aren’t rancid., Vegetables and fruits comprise a small part of the hyacinth macaw’s diet, compared with other parrots. However, your macaw can eat nearly anything you might, so share your groceries with him. Fresh pieces of kale, cantaloupe, cucumber, for example, make for tasty snacks. Don’t give your bird food that’s moldy, or uncooked meats.Fresh fruit pits (such as cherry, apricot, peach or plum) are poisonous to the hyacinth macaw. Never give your bird avocado, as this is toxic to parrots.
Wash all fresh food well before feeding it to your hyacinth macaw to rid it of any pesticides or fungicides.

, When you’re training your hyacinth macaw, It’s helpful to have a regular feeding schedule. Being slightly hungry will support your bird’s interest in the training activities. If you’re available to feed your bird 3 meals per day, engage in training sessions just prior to each meal.If your schedule doesn’t permit lunchtime feedings, then 2 meals per day will suffice.
Snacks will also delight your bird, and it’s a great time to get your bird used to feeding from your hand. Give her special treats of nuts, carrots, or pieces of coconut from your bare hands.
Snacking is also a good way to bond with your bird, and can be incorporated into training exercises. If your bird is fearful or cautious around you, providing snacks is a good way to encourage and develop trust.

, It’s actually quite easy to find out what your bird’s favorite food is. Simply provide a portion of all the different foods your macaw eats, including: carrots, coconut, Brazil nut, walnuts, almonds, macadamias, sunflower seeds, grapes, etc.After setting out all the portions in a neutral location, allow your bird loose to choose from the foods.
While your bird will likely poke around for a few minutes, it’s likely to eat to its favorite food first. Hyacinth macaws are not known for delaying gratification!
Knowing what your bird’s favorite food is will make training more fun for you both. You should bring along some extra treats when you’re teaching your bird a new trick.

, Change the water in your bird’s water dish at least once per day. Your hyacinth macaw should have access to fresh, clean water at all times. Clean the water bowl with hot, soapy water every time you change the water, so that you’re not pouring clean water into a dirty dish. Make sure you’re cleaning inside the bowl’s ridges, rims and corners, checking it for any residue or slime.Bottled water, spring water or fresh well water is the best choice for blue hyacinths.
Parrots will use the same water for drinking and bathing, and many birds dunk their food in their water.

"
"
Bathe your bird regularly.,
Teach generalization of skills.,
Don’t teach bad behaviors.,
Provide plenty of activity for your bird.",How to Care for a Hyacinth Macaw3," If your bird is young, get it used to taking baths in your kitchen sink with about an inch of water in it. Older birds may already be comfortable with a kitchen sink bath, and readily hop into the water. You can also put a shower perch into your own shower. These perches can attach to glass windows or shower walls.Bring your bird into the bathroom a few times before you introduce the shower.
Young birds may require a little bit of unscented glycerine soap, but older birds shouldn’t receive soap. The soap is safe for them, but the soapy residue is very difficult to completely remove from feathers.
You can find small pump-up sprayers made just for bathing parrots online or in specialty stores.

, The hyacinth macaw has the tendency to bond strongly with one person. This can lead to difficulties, and if you don’t explicitly teach your bird to accept commands from different people, it’s likely that he’ll only respond to you. The way to do this is to make sure to teach the command in a variety of settings, with different people, so that the bird learns to focus on the command, rather than on you.Once you’ve taught a particular command, such as “step up”, teach it in different locations, with different background sounds, and with different people.
By teaching this generalization of skills, your bird will be able to adapt more quickly to new people and situations.

, The blue macaw’s bite is strong enough to crack open nuts, so it’s not surprising that it’s quite painful to be bitten! If you react to being bitten by ending a training session, putting your bird back in its cage, then your bird will learn that biting is a quick way to achieve these results.Instead of reacting to the bad behavior, ignore it. Your macaw is less likely to repeat the behavior if it doesn’t see any results.
The same holds true for your bird screaming loudly, or any other behavior you don’t want your macaw to do.

, The hyacinth macaw loves to play. It will chew on wooden toys, and will likely break them due to the strength of its bite. Metal toys are a good choice for these birds. For example, fix nuts holding washers onto a screw, creating something fun for your bird to play with.Metal cups or spoons are a good choice, and you can also put holes in stainless steel bird bowls and place nuts and bolts through the holes.
Never allow your hyacinth macaw to bite rope or wooden toys affixed with rope.
Destructible toys are good because they help to relieve boredom, but can get expensive. A variety of toys is best, for the hyacinth macaw is an intelligent bird who requires a great deal of engagement to stay healthy and happy.

Keep the cage clean.,
Watch for disease.,
Be on the lookout for behavioral problems.,
Make sure to provide plenty of sunlight.",How to Care for a Hyacinth Macaw4," This will be easier to do if you make sure to keep cage paper (or old newspaper) over the floor of the cage. You can easily pull this out and replace it as needed. You can wipe down the cage with a nontoxic disinfectant as needed.Be prepared to change your macaw’s water daily, and clean its bowls.
You’ll need to wash all the perches and bird toys weekly, using nontoxic soap and fresh water.
Plan to do annual disinfecting and cleansing of your macaw’s cage.

, A well-cared for hyacinth macaw will rarely become ill, but you should be alert for signs of possible illness. The illnesses that hyacinth macaws are prone to include proventricular Dilation disease (also known as Macaw wasting disease); psittacosis (chlamydiosis or parrot fever); and bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. If you notice signs of illness, you’ll need to make an appointment with an avian veterinarian right away.Some of the more commonly observed signs of illnesses include:


Listlessness
Drooping wings
Sagging body
Extreme mood changes
Avoiding food, or not eating its usual amount
Partly closed or watery eyes, or swollen eyelids
A raspy voice
Difficulty breathing
Excessive saliva
Dirty vent

, Behavior problems usually arise from something missing in the macaw’s environment. As an intelligent, social creature, the hyacinth macaw requires a great deal of interaction. Without enough to do, the macaw can develop some maladaptive patterns of behavior, including biting, feather plucking, and screaming.If you notice these signs in your bird, try to spend more time taking interacting with your parrot.
Make sure your parrot has enough activities to do when you’re not home.
Find ways to provide your bird more exercise, and limit the time it’s expected to spend in its cage.

, Your hyacinth macaw has photosensitive skin that doesn’t respond to artificial light, even full-spectrum artificial light. It needs regular exposure to natural sunlight in order to maintain good health.This is different from other parrots, who consume a pellet diet which can provide their vitamin D. The hyacinth macaw, since it doesn’t rely on pellets, requires sunlight in order to get enough vitamin D.

Understand that unlike other animals, lovebirds mate for life and can continue mating throughout their almost 15 year life cycle.Monogamy underpins the social structure of lovebirds and is vital to the stability of flocks.Be aware that if a mate dies, its companion can exhibit erratic behavior that is like a form of depression. Lovebirds do not like to be alone.Enjoy the fact that lovebirds are romantic with one another and may feed each other to re-establish their bonds after stress or separation.;
, Lovebirds usually live in holes in trees, rocks or shrubs in the wild. Buy the supplies to give your lovebirds a home where they feel comfortable and can breed successfully.Get your lovebirds a cage of no less than 18x18x12 inches with the bars spaced no more than 3/4"" inch apart. Try and purchase a square or rectangular cage so they have places to hide.Place different sized perches in the cage along with toys to keep the lovebirds happy and stimulated.Avoid wooden
Put separate water and food dishes in the cage away from the bottom.Clean the cage and dishes daily to keep your lovebirds healthy.Disinfect the cage once a week., Choose the best lovebirds to breed. This can help ensure the health of the birds and the breed.Check that the lovebirds you want to mate are not related.Make sure the birds have not mated for more than 2 clutches, which can cause them serious illness.Avoid mixing breeds, which results in hybrid birds that don’t belong to any species of lovebirds.Determine the sex of your lovebirds by looking at their plumage, as males may have different plumage than females. Be aware, however, that some species of lovebirds are androgynous and it’s difficult to tell the sexes apart.You may need to watch for signs such as building a nest to determine which of your lovebirds is the female.Contact groups such as the African Love Bird Society for places to get birds of the same species as yours., Choosing a healthy mate for your lovebird or two healthy lovebirds is important to maintaining their health and that of the breed.Look for the following qualities of a good lovebird specimen when selecting a mate or pair:


Rounded body shape
Good ability to stand and walk
Broad rump and back
Rounded and full breast
Sharp and compact tail
Large, wide, and rounded head
Wide and appealing face
Large, round, and bold eyes
Even, deep and clear plumage, or feathers
Immaculate feather condition
Clean, large, and strong feet with straight toes and no scars
Clean and large bill, or beak, free of scars., You cannot introduce lovebirds unless you know that both animals are healthy. Take the pair to the vet to make sure that they’re healthy enough to breed.


Let your vet know that you plan to breed the lovebirds.
Ask her any questions you might have about the birds, their health, or breeding the pair.

, If you bring a new lovebird into your flock for mating, consider quarantining the pair for a few days. This can help ensure that both are healthy and that the female doesn’t get territorial or reject the male.If you are breeding lovebirds you already own, you likely don’t need to quarantine the pair

, When you know that each lovebird is healthy, introduce the pair. Take it slowly, as it could take a few days for the birds to get used to one another.


Place the birds in cages next to one another before putting them in the same cage.
Move the birds to the same cage after a couple of days.
Put nesting materials in the cage to encourage the couple to start building a nest.Remove any birds that are exhibiting signs of aggression or rejection of a potential partner.

, Lovebirds are prolific reproducers and you may notice many signs of mating.Signs of mating can include:


Courtship
Aggression
Jealousy or being “hormonal”Carrying material in the feathers
Nest-building., Lovebirds that are breeding need dense, nutrition packed foods because of the stress on their bodies. Avoid giving them just seeds, which may not provide enough nutrients for the birds or their babies.Some examples of what you can mix together to feed your lovebirds are:


Cooked elbow macaroni
Pearl barley
Frozen vegetables
Granulated sea kelp
Whole grain brown rice
Apples
Greens
Cereal, toast or crackers
Cuttlebone., The only way to be certain that your lovebirds have mated is by checking for eggs. In most cases, the female lovebird will lay her first egg ten days after mating and then will brood, or sit on the eggs, after the second is laid.Look at the nest every morning to see if there are any eggs. The female will generally lay eggs at night. She may produce one egg every other day, up to 5 or 6 eggs.Be aware that two female lovebirds, if placed together. can lay up to 10 infertile eggs., It takes around 25 days for a female to brood, or sit on, her eggs.Let her brood uninterrupted for at least 10 days.Be aware the female will only leave to excrete waste, drink, and have a bite of food. In most cases, the male will feed the female during brooding., It’s common to have infertile eggs, especially if a pair is too young or old.After allowing the female to brood for 10 days, you can check to see if the eggs are fertile.Handle the eggs as gently as possible.Check each egg by holding an egg up to a light source, such as a flashlight and looking for a membrane, which is a sign the egg is fertile.You can also check by placing the egg in a shallow dish of warm water one week before it hatches. After five seconds, check if you can see a membrane.Be aware that it is normal for eggs to not be fertile or for a baby to die in the egg., After between 21-26 days of brooding, your eggs may hatch. Be sure to not handle the eggs or the hatchlings for the first 6-8 weeks of life.The mother bird will feed the babies for 6-8 weeks from the nutritious food you provide.Remove any unhatched eggs or baby lovebirds that die.

Rotate a selection of several different toys through their cages each week.,
Take your parrot in the bathroom when you perform your ""grooming activities"" each morning.,
Play ""The Towel Game."",
Play ""The Box Game."",
Exercise your parrot with the ""Flapping Game.""",How to Play with a Large Parrot," Macaws and cockatoos need two types of toys: durable puzzle-type ones to occupy their bright minds and to (mostly) withstand their chewing; and safe materials such as untreated wood and cardboard that they can rip up and destroy each day.;
, Parrots find tooth-brushing hilarious and fascinating. They will understand that your hair-combing is a form of preening. And most parrots will love showering with you, which must remind them of the ancestral rain forest. Expect much exuberant screaming and other parrot silliness to result.

, Sit at a table with your parrot on the table top. Fold your arms on the table, put your head down on your arms, and drape a big fluffy bath towel over your head. Your parrot will not be able to resist running up to the edge of the towel and lifting it up with his beak so he can slip underneath to be with you.

, First, present your parrot with a medium-sized box with something fun inside to chew up like a big wad of newspapers. Once he's busily chewing, get an interesting-looking kitchen implement like a big, shiny ladle and gently tap with it on the side of the box. This will grab his attention. Gently tap the ladle closer and closer until you dip it briefly into view. This should get a huge reaction - possibly a full puff-out if you have a cockatoo. Repeat with different cooking utensils for maximum fun and stimulation.

, Place your parrot on the back of your hand and gently move your hand up and down or swoop your hand in figure-eights. Your parrot will flap his wings as you move him through the air. Stop and give the poor guy a break once he starts breathing hard.

Take your bird to the vet on a consistent basis.",How to Keep a Lovebird As a Pet," Contrary to popular belief, keeping lovebirds as a single pet is not frowned upon by breeders and experts so don’t be too concerned about purchasing more than one lovebird at a time. In fact, introducing another lovebird to your lovebird at a later date can be dangerous, as the older lovebird may try to harm or kill the new bird. Another risk of keeping more than one lovebird is that the birds will want to bond with each other, rather than you, their owner.If you do want to keep more than one lovebird at a time, introduce the bird when they are both very young. Groups of lovebirds create social hierarchies, so there is one alpha bird and every bird follows the alpha.
Another common myth is that lovebirds can be mean or aggressive, especially female lovebirds who are marking their territory or their cage. Most breeders agree that male lovebirds make better pets, though males can also show territorial behavior and chirp at any fingers that enter their cage. Most lovebirds, male and female, have mild temperaments. To counteract any aggression from them, it’s important that you train your lovebird to prevent nipping.;
, There are many different breeds of lovebirds, but the three most popular breeds are:


Peach-faced lovebirds: These little birds are the most commonly kept breed. They stand at 5-inches tall, with green and blue plumes, and have a rosy colored face. Peach-faced lovebirds have been bred into hundreds of color mutations, from pure white albino birds to deep purple birds.
Masked lovebirds: This breed has eye-rings, a black mask, an orange beak, yellow chest feathers, and green wings. Some breeders consider masked lovebirds more aggressive than the two other more common breeds.
Fischer’s lovebirds: Also known as eye-ring lovebirds, as they have a white ring around their eyes. They are smaller than peach faced and masked lovebirds and have a distinct, high pitched chirp. Most breeders agree that Fischer’s are more aggressive than the peach-faced lovebirds or masked lovebirds.

, Most local pet stores have lovebirds for sale, likely peach faced and Fischer’s lovebirds. Before you buy the lovebird, check that:The bird looks healthy. The bird should be perky, active, and alert with bright clear eyes. They should also have a clear cere, or fleshy nose area, and nares, or nostrils.
Watch the bird eat and drink to make sure the bird has an appetite. The bird should also be well groomed with neat, bright feathers. The feathers should be mostly smoothed to the body, not fluffy or raised. The bird’s feet and legs should be smooth and free of lumps, scabs, and rough scales.
The bird should vocalize with you in chirps, clicks, and whistles. Most lovebirds are excited to communicate with new faces, though some bird can be shy or intimidated around new people. A healthy bird will be confident and inquisitive, but cautious and aware as well.
If possible, ask to hold or touch the bird. Make sure the bird is interested in interacting with you and does not peck or nip at you. This may be a sign the bird is aggressive.

, There are several databases of lovebird breeders available online that you can search based on your state or area and your preferred breed.Be wary of overpriced birds and always contact the breeders directly to establish a rapport before you buy a bird from them.Most reputable breeders hand-raise their birds. This means they are involved in every stage of breeding, from choosing the mates to creating a good breeding environment in a cage to maintaining the birds’ diet and nutrition.
Breeders will also carefully watch over the eggs and take care of the babies until they have found suitable homes. Some breeders will hand-feed the babies to tame them and wean them off of their parents. Hand-feeding and hand-taming the babies are also good ways to get the birds used to human interaction. This makes most hand-raised lovebirds very tame and loving pets.Hand-raised Lovebirds can range in price from $40 to $130 for the more common species and mutations. Parent-fed lovebirds from a pet store are generally less expensive. But the rarer species and mutations will be more expensive than the more common species., Birds can pick up health problems that may not be obvious to you, so bring your new lovebird to a vet to confirm the bird is healthy.If you know you are going to be buying a lovebird in the near future, schedule a vet appointment for right after you pick up the bird from the store or the breeder.
For an additional fee, the vet can create a wellness plans to help your lovebird live a long, healthy life. These plans include annual health check ups and emergency medical care., Lovebirds are not sexually dimorphic, which means you generally cannot tell if a lovebird is a male (a cock) or a female (a hen) just by looking at the lovebird. The best way to confirm the sex of the lovebird is to have your vet do a DNA test, or to conduct one yourself with a DNA kit.A DNA kit usually costs between $15 and $22. You will need to clip one of your bird’s toenails a little higher than you normally would and send the sample to the lab.
The vet can also take the sample for you and send it to the lab for testing.
Some visual differences between the sexes exist, as hens tend to have a wider stance on the perch, they are a bit larger than cocks, and they have wider pelvic bones that you can check gently with your index finger.
Peach-colored hens will also tuck material under their wings to take them to the nesting box, while peach-colored cocks will try to do this but fail. However, there are exceptions to these general characteristics depending on the bird.

, Lovebirds are active, playful birds so they need a cage that will accommodate all the toys and perches they need to keep them busy. The larger the cage, the comfortable it will be for the bird.The cage should also have horizontal bars on at least two sides. The bar spacing should be no more than ¾” apart to prevent injury.

, The cage should have at least two or three perches of various sizes, shapes, and textures to help your bird’s feet stay healthy and strong. The perches should be thick enough for the bird to stand comfortably on them without losing her balance. The smallest perch should be about ½” in diameter.Look for perches made from wooden dowels, natural wood branches, bonded sand and concrete, and rope., Your bird’s cage should be raised and kept away from air vents and doorways. Some birds can catch a cold if exposed to a draft while they are wet, such as after a bath.Lovebirds can be sensitive to smoke and strong odors, as well as loud noise.If you smoke, do not smoke in the room where your lovebird lives.

, A room that is too dark may cause your lovebird to behave oddly and develop health issues. But you should not place the cage near a window that gets full sun during the hottest months of the year as this may cause heat stroke or death for your little bird.Weak, unfiltered sunlight on the cage is ideal as this gives your bird vital ultraviolet-B light to keep her healthy. If your lovebird’s cage is near a window with weak light, you may want to consider investing in a special light bulb that emits safe levels of ultraviolet-B light to hang over your lovebird’s cage. You can turn on the light for 8 to 10 hours a day to make sure your bird gets enough light., Sleep is important for lovebirds. If you are going to keep your lovebird in a cage indoors, you may want to get a cover for the cage to help your bird sleep at night.You can also get a smaller sleep cage for your bird if you don’t have enough space for a large cage indoors. Using a sleep cage will ensure your bird has a quiet, safe place to sleep.
You should put your lovebird to bed at the same time every night and bring her out of her sleep cage the same time every morning., The tray and dishes in your bird’s cage should be cleaned every day. But your bird’s cage is your bird’s home so it should also be cleaned once a week.Use warm water and soap. Remove your bird from the cage and wipe down the cage, the perches, and any toys in the cage.
You can also use a product called Cleansing Gel to do a deep clean of the cage. This cleaner contains stabilized chlorine dioxide and is safe for birds.Be careful when using a diluted bleach solution to disinfect the cage. Bleach is toxic to birds. So rinse the cage thoroughly after you use a bleach and water solution. Then, place the cage in the sun to air dry.Be certain the cage and bowls are free of any bleach smell before you place your bird back in the cage.

, The right food size for your lovebird will be indicated by the image on the label of these bird foods. Look for bird food that has high quality seeds that are hulled and bound together with supplements that contain vitamins and minerals, such as pellet foods. The average lovebird should have 2-3 teaspoons of pellet or seed based bird food a day.You can also give your bird seed mixes. But keep in mind loose seed mix allows your lovebird to pick and choose what seeds it eats. Nutri-berries, Avi-cakes, and Pellet-berries require your lovebird to work to pry off a piece, so your bird is more likely to get a variety of seeds.Look for seed mixes from your local pet store that contain canary seed, millet, rice, oats, safflower and a small amount of sunflower seeds. Corn is often a big hit with lovebirds, as well as sprouted seed., Pellet foods and seed mixes should be given to your bird on a daily basis, but should not be the only food you give your bird as they do not provide proper nutrition. About 5-10% of your bird’s diet should be bite-sized fruits and vegetables.Give your bird healthy fruits like apples, grapes, berries, papaya, and mango. You should also feed your bird vegetables like carrots, broccoli, zucchini, squash, cooked sweet potatoes, and dark leafy greens like kale and romaine., These include cooked whole grains, like brown rice, whole grain pasta, multigrain breads, and sugar free cereals. When you feed your bird fresh foods, make sure you remove anything in their cage that is uneaten so the food does not spoil. You should also wash the bowls in their cage before using them again.It’s fine if your lovebird shares many of the foods you eat. But limit her consumption of fried, greasy, sugary, and salty foods so she stays healthy.

, Do not give your bird tap water or unfiltered water. Most cages come with a water attachment so your bird has access to water all the time., These substances can kill your lovebird, even in small amounts.You should also avoid giving your bird avocados, rhubarb, asparagus, onions, raw legumes like beans and peas, and dairy products.

, Regular bathing is important for keeping your bird healthy and free of disease. If lovebirds are not bathed, their feathers can get ragged or dirty.Use a fine mist sprayer filled with water to shower your lovebird. Spray lightly a foot or two above your bird so the water droplets drift down like rain.
Do this a few times so your lovebird gets used to the “rain” and starts to preen and groom herself.
Some birds love to bathe and will happily hop into a small ceramic dish filled with water. Your bird may also splash around in the water for several minutes.

, After each bath, make sure you give your bird a quick dry with a small towel and keep her in a warm room so she doesn’t get chilled or catch a cold., This is not a required part of grooming your bird but will help to tame her. Wing-trims will also keep your bird from flying into ceiling fans, windows, and other potential hazards. Wing clipping is controversial, because clipping the wings alters the bird's flight which leads to ""crash landings"" and damage to the brisket area. It has largely gone out of vogue now, in favor of making rooms bird-safe and training the bird to come when called.


If you are uncomfortable clipping your bird’s wings yourself, you can talk to your vet about getting your bird’s wings clipped by a qualified professional.If you opt to do it yourself, you should have a trained professional clip your lovebird's wings for the first time so you can observe her as she trims. She should hold your bird in one hand while trimming with the other hand.She should only trim the first five to six primary flight feathers first. No cuts should be made high up on these long feathers. There are two layers of short feather that lay on top of your bird's longer flight feathers. The short feathers should not be cut during the trim. Instead, the professional groomer should trim about a quarter inch below them, only cutting the primaries. She should follow the angle of the upper, overlaying feathers so the trimmed wings rest nicely against your bird's body and do not irritate your bird by poking into her skin.You should also trim your bird's toenails to keep her feet normally shaped. This will help her grip on the perches in her cage and reduces the chance of her toenails snagged on clothing or fabric. If you are uncomfortable with trimming her nails on your own, let a qualified professional give her a nail trim.

, You can get bird-safe toys at your local pet store. You can also make simple toys with the plastic tops of pill bottles or soda bottles, wads of clean toilet tissue stuffed in a small box, or leaves and branches from safe plants like rose bushes, hibiscus bushes, and mulberry trees.Do not place a mirror in your bird’s cage as lovebirds will treat its reflection as a mate.Rotate the toys in your bird’s cage on a constant basis so your bird does not get bored of them. Replace any toys that are worn or damaged, as they can injure your bird.
Always introduce a new toy to your bird in a neutral location before you place the toy in her cage so she can get used to it.

, Germs that your bird carries can be transmitted to humans, and vice versa, and this can cause serious illnesses for you or for your bird.

, Do this in increments of 30 minutes throughout the day to keep your bird well-socialized. Most birds enjoy hanging out on their owner’s shoulder, snuggling up to their necks, or hiding clothing like sweaters or scarves.When lovebirds get bored, they tend to chew on clothing and jewelry and pull off buttons. Protect your clothes when your bird is out of her cage by wearing clothing that do not pull. You should also avoid wearing any necklaces when your bird is with you.
There are “birdie necklaces” available made from bird-safe chain with small bird toys attached to the links that you can wear so your bird has something safe to play with., Do this by tapping on the toy and gently instructing her to step up. This training will help to control any territorial behavior, which usually occurs when your bird reaches sexual maturity. During this time, your bird may bite any object that comes near her nest area or the cage.Teaching her to step up will help her move away from her territory without biting and help her to calm down.

, Lovebirds are intelligent and sweet birds and tend to get along well with people. They can “talk” like other parrots, though they do not have extensive vocabularies. Engage your lovebird by talking in low tones and encouraging your bird to respond to you or repeat your words.


Birds can be scared to death. Frightening your bird can cause enough stress to harm and possibly kill her. Avoid making quick movements or loud noise around your lovebird.
Predatory animals such as cats, dogs, and ferrets should never have direct contact with your bird.

, Most birds will hide their illness until it is in an advanced stage. So it’s best to take your bird to your vet often so she can check for any early signs of illness or potential medical issues."

Preen your conure.",How to Care for a Conure," Conures are active birds that like to keep busy.Your conure will need a cage that gives him lots of space to move around and play with his toys.If you have a small conure, his cage should be at least 18 x 18 x 18 inches (46 x 46 x 46 centimeters).A larger conure would need a cage that is at least 36 x 36 x 36 inches (91 x 91 x 91 centimeters). The cage can be either horizontal or vertical.The cage bars should be horizontal so your conure can climb on them.The bars should be spaced no further than 3/4 inches to one inch (two to 2.5 cm) apart.
Consider purchasing a cage cover to give your conure a sense of security when he sleeps.Alternatively, you could use a blanket or large towel to cover his cage at night.;
, Your conure’s cage should be in a room that is not in the direct path of harmful kitchen fumes.Within the room, make sure not to place the cage in direct sunlight.Conures are most comfortable in rooms that are 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C), which is the typical room temperature for most homes.


The room should also be free of drafts.Many types of fumes are toxic to conures, including perfumes, aerosols, and fumes from cleaning products and non-stick cookware.

, Perches are an essential item in any bird’s cage. For your conure, choose at least two perches that are 1/2 to 5/8 inches (about 1.5 centimeters) in diameter.


Position the perches such that your conure’s tail feathers will not rub against the cage bars when she sits on the perches.Place one perch close to your conure's food and water dishes.Consider using perches that have various sizes, shapes, and textures. This will help keep your conure's feet healthy and strong.Many types of perches are available at your local pet store.
Place two to three food and water dishes in her cage. One dish would be for water and one or two would be for food.
Conures love to take baths. Place another water dish in your conure's cage,preferably one that is large enough for her to step in. Look for these dishes at your local pet store or housewares store.
Line the bottom of your conure’s cage with newspaper or paper liners., Conures can be messy, so you will need to maintain a regular cleaning schedule for your conure’s cage. On a daily basis, you should clean his water and food dishes.Conures like to dip their food in their food bowls, so you may need to clean your conure’s water dish several times a day.Replace the cage lining each day.Clean your conure’s toys and perches on a daily basis. Dishwater detergent is sufficient for cleaning these accessories. Make sure to completely rinse off the soap before placing the cleaned items back in your conure's cage.Depending on how messy your conure is, you will need to disinfect his cage either weekly or monthly.Since bleach fumes can be toxic to your conure, you will need to keep him in a separate room when you disinfect his cage and allow it to dry.Speak with an avian veterinarian or avian expert about safe cleaning products to use in your conure’s cage.

, Conures like to be kept busy. Without things to do, your conure could become bored and resort to feather picking.Giving your conure a variety of toys will keep her happily entertained. Popular toy types for conures include foraging toys, wooden chew toys, and shredding toys.Foraging toys mimic your conure’s natural food foraging behavior in the wild.Shredded toys can help your conure relieve stress and boredom.If you don’t want to purchase a shredded toy, you can place some newspaper in the cage for him or her to shred.
Avoid toys that have small parts. These parts could catch on your conure’s beak or claws, possibly leading to damage or injury.Keep different types of toys at your conure’s cage at all times to prevent boredom with any one toy.
Consider installing a play stand in your conure’s cage that can hold toys.All types of toys can be found at your local pet store.

, Conures need lots of exercise to stay happy and healthy. Swings, and ladders would provide your conure with plenty of exercise during the day.For the ladders and swings, install them at heights inside the cage that will keep your conure’s tail from rubbing up against the cage bars.

, Mirrors can be a good choice of enrichment to keep your conure busy. However, introduce him to a mirror only after he has bonded with you—otherwise he may bond with the mirror instead of you!Mirrors can also encourage mating behavior (e.g., regurgitating food, tail lifting).Mating behavior can be especially problematic in female birds, since they can lay eggs without a mate. If you have a female conure, mating behavior can lead to spontaneous egg laying that could result in physical stress and illness.Your conure could see the mirror as a ""love toy.""Speak with your veterinarian if you are unsure about placing shiny objects in your conure’s cage.

, Pelleted bird food is commercially available at your local pet store. Pellets should make up approximately 60 to 70% of your conure’s diet and seeds no more than 10% and fruits and veggies for the rest. They can come in different colors, which adds a little variety to an otherwise uninteresting food.Pelleted bird food, along with seed mixes, provide a good, nutritious diet.
Some commercial seed mixes have fillers or harmful additives.Ask an avian veterinarian or the staff at your local pet store if you are unsure about which pelleted food and seed mix would be best for your conure, or select a seed mix that is labeled as ""organic"" or ""all natural.""

, Variety is key to feeding your conure a nutritionally balanced diet. Fruits and vegetables are a great way to add this variety. Examples of fresh vegetables to feed your conure are collard greens, spinach, pumpkins, and zucchini.There are many types of fruit you can feed your conure, such as mangoes, blueberries, kiwi, and apples.Fruits and vegetables also add important vitamins and minerals to your conure’s diet.Wash the fruits and vegetables thoroughly with water to remove pesticides.Consider purchasing organic produce but not  avocado because it is poisonous to your bird.Cut the produce into smaller pieces.

, Nuts add healthy protein and fat to your conure’s diet, and should be a mainstay in her daily eating regimen.Examples of nuts to feed your conure are hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, and brazil nuts.The nuts should be low in salt.
Although important, nuts should be fed only in small amounts because of their high fat content. Your conure could become obese if she eats a lot of nuts.If you feed your conure peanuts, they must be unshelled. Peanut shells contain a fungal toxin called aflatoxin that could make your conure very sick., In addition to nuts, grains and legumes are mainstays of a conure diet. There are many types of healthy grains you can feed your conure, such as cooked brown rice or barley, as well as cereal, pasta, and crackers.Conures cannot break down sugar very well, so avoid sugary cereals.
Examples of legumes are lentils and different types of beans (e.g., green beans, black beans).Legumes and grains have vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are essential components of your conure’s diet., You may need to supplement your conure’s diet with certain nutrients, including calcium and vitamin K. Incorporate foods into his diet (dark leafy greens, soy oil, and fish meal) that are high in these nutrients.Adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin K are important to prevent a condition called Conure Bleeding Syndrome.Calcium perches are available that your conure can chew on to get extra calcium in his diet.Cuttlebone is another calcium source, but is not recommended for conures.Water-soluble vitamins can be added to your conure’s water.
Speak with your veterinarian before supplementing your conure’s diet.

, Conures are not picky eaters.However, there are certain foods that she should not eat. For example, your conure should not eat avocados, cocoa, or onions.These foods contain toxins that could sicken your conure.


Human foods that are high in sugar, salt, or fat should also be avoided, since a conure’s digestive system cannot break them down very well.Processed foods tend to be high in these ingredients.

, Feed your conure once in the morning and once in the evening. At each feeding time, place a variety of fresh foods, cooked foods, and seeds in his food dishes. After about one hour, remove any remaining food.In the morning, give him some pellets after you have removed the other food. He can snack on the pellets throughout the day.Conures are prone to obesity. To prevent him from overeating at mealtime, feed him only as much as he can eat in one sitting.It will probably take some trial and error to determine how much to feed him at mealtime.
Since conures are messy eaters and like to dip their food in their water, you may have to replace your conure’s water dish at each meal time.

, Since conures are very social and outgoing birds, interacting with your conure is important to his overall care. To have quality interactions with her, you will first need to gain her trust. One way to gain her trust is to talk to her in a smooth and calming voice.Talk to her throughout the day, especially when you are feeding her and cleaning her cage.
The more she hears your voice when you are near her, the more comfortable she will be with you.
Another way to gain her trust is to approach her cage slowly and calmly. When she sees that you are not a threat, she will be much more at ease when you are nearby.

, In addition to trusting you, your conure will also need to be comfortable with your hand. Begin by gently placing your hand either on or near the outside of his cage.Talk to him while you hold your hand nearby to calm his anxiety.


When your conure is comfortable with your hand outside his cage, slowly place your hand inside his cage.Hold some treats (e.g., millet spray, dark leafy greens) in your hand and keep your hand still while he approaches and explores your hand.
It may a few days or a few weeks before your conure is comfortable with your hand. Just be patient with him.

, When your conure trusts you and is comfortable with you, you can have all types of fun with her. For example, you can teach her to step up. Using your index finger as a perch, gently press your finger against her lower chest (just above her feet) to encourage her to step up onto your finger.Give her a treat and verbal praise when she steps onto your finger.
When she gets good at stepping onto your finger, you can take her out of his cage and practice stepping up in a different room, such as the bathroom.

, Parrots are known for their ability to talk. However, conures are not as good as other parrot species when it comes to talking ability.Try as he might, your conure will probably be able to learn only about five or ten words.


Your conure will need to focus all of his attention on you to learn how to talk. Turn off any other noises (television, radio, phone) that may distract him.Choose simple words and phrases, and associate them with a specific object or action.For example, you can say ""Are you hungry?"" when you feed him and ""Goodbye!"" when you leave the room.
Speak with enthusiasm to your conure. The more excited you sound, the more excited and motivated he will be to mimic your words.Your conure’s voice will be high pitched., Another way to interact with her is to help her take her morning bath. Use a spray bottle to gently spritz her with a mist of water.If she will let you, gently wrap your conure in a towel after her bath and hold her close to you until she is dry.Conures are very cuddly, so your conure will probably enjoy being so close to you after a good bath.
When she is dry, your conure will preen herself. To preen, she will use her beak to reach back to her oil gland (located at the base of her tail) and spread the oil over her plumage., Believe it or not, conures have rhythm and like to dance!When your conure is excited or is trying to copy your movements, he will sway back and forth. If you like to dance, turn on some music and dance in front of your conure. Watch in amusement as he sways from side to side to match your movement.

, Playing with your conure is a great way to interact with her. A simple game is ""peek a boo."" Simply wrap her in a towel and say ""peek a boo"" when you uncover her face.Do this any many times as you want—chances are your conure will love to play this with you over and over.


Play fetch with your conure. Toss a soft stuffed toy towards your conure.Be aware that she might not be very good at catching what you toss, but she will have fun anyway. She may even toss the toy back to you.Mimic your conure’s actions and vice versa. For example, when your conure stretches her wings, stretch your arms out in response.Move side to side, and see if your conure will do the same.
Make a mess with your conure. Conures love to shred things. When you have your conure out of her cage, sit on the floor with her and make a mess by shredding some newspaper. Give her her own newspaper to shred., Conure owners like to teach this popular trick to their birds. With your conure perched on your finger outside of his cage, place him against your chest with his back facing away from you. Gently place your free hand on his back and begin to bend your body forward very slowly.


Keep your hand on your conure’s back as you bend forward. Lying back may feel a bit strange to your conure at first, so he will need your hand on his back to feel more secure with this movement.
When he is comfortable lying back on your hand, you can play with him by tickling his tummy.You could also give him small toys that he can play with when lying on his back.When your conure can lie back, you can teach him more advanced tricks like doing back rolls., As important as it is to interact with your conure, you should not pay her attention when she screeches. Conures are prone to making very loud noises.As ear piercing as these screeches can be, do your best to ignore her when makes this noise.


If you go over to her cage when she screeches, she may learn that she can screech to get your attention. To her, your attention is a reward for her behavior.
Interacting with your conure on a regular basis and giving him plenty of toys to play with may help to temper his screeches.

, Molting happens to a bird when its feathers naturally shed and new ones replace the old ones. Molting is necessary to any bird's (including conures') growth., Molting begins when the conure is around 8 to 10 months of age and continues on every year. The season in which molting occurs depends on the species of the conure., The conure will be more annoyed and won't be too cooperative. The conure will feel itch due to the new feathers growing out. Water could be sprayed on the conure to relieve the itchiness.,, This could be done by gently brushing your hand on the conure's body to help the new feathers to come out. If you have a couple of conures who are molting at the same time, the conures can support each other by preening each other and rubbing their bodies against each other.Preen gently as new feathers could be painful to the conure when touched.

What to do if the boy does not hang out with your group of friends, but you sit next to him in class or something similar.

,
Do not insist that the boy hangs out with your group.,
Do not constantly single him out.,
Do not push invites.,
Do not try to get near him privately.",How to Avoid Being Accused of Flirting2,", If the boy you are accused of flirting with, whether he is just your friend or you really do like him, does not normally hang out with your friends, then insisting that he be invited to outings after school will make things seem too obvious. Instead, suggest his name when the invitation list goes around, but do not push the issue.

, If you suddenly insist that one boy should be your partner in all projects, your study-buddy, and he should come over after school so you two can grab some tacos and talk about your latest book in English, it will only invite a plethora of flirting accusations. Besides being awkward for the boy, who will probably also receive teasing from his friends, it is just too much to seek the boy out in every situation.

, If you invite him to eat with you at lunch and he politely declines, don't do anything overly childish like pulling on his arm and saying, ""Oh come on, Jason, you know you want to!"". Your friends and him both will think of you as coming on too strong, even if you don't mean it.

, ""Private"" conversations, or when you take the boy out of a setting to hang out by yourselves, will instantly spark flirting rumors. It is far easier to call someone who wants to spend time alone with a certain boy a flirter than if she invites him to eat lunch with her group.

"
"
Accuse your friends of over-reacting.,
Ignore them.,
Tell them to stop in front of other people.",How to Avoid Being Accused of Flirting3," Accusing someone of flirting is considered childish anyway, and is only ever done to get a reaction. If a true friend wants to know if you like someone, he or she will ask in private. If someone says, ""OMG, everyone, have you noticed how much Kate has been talking to Erik lately? I think she has a crush...,"" then just call her out on it. Rolling your eyes and saying something to indicate that the speaker is being immature and childish is a good bet (""Oh, I'm sorry Sarah, are you still stuck in middle school?""), or indicating that the speaker is acting out of jealousy (""Sarah, you're just jealous because I can flirt with boys and you can't."") are good bets. Overall, try to turn the situation around so that the speaker feels childish and awkward, not you.

, There is a high probability that they will grow tired of taunting if you do not give them a reaction. Don't get angry or violent. You are the best judge of your situation; in some cases it may be better to ignore them, while in others you should speak up.

, As said above, accusing someone of flirting is already acting immature. If one person has been constantly pointing out how much you have been hanging out with a boy, confront them in front of your friends. Turning around and saying seriously, ""Sarah, I know that you think it's cute that I have a new friend, but when you keep saying that I flirt with him, it really pisses me off. Please stop."" Showing that you are really angry, and not just flustered, is a good way to shut them up.

"
"
If a friend called you on flirting in the middle of a big group, feel free to defend yourself.,
Single him out later.,
Strike up a conversation, if you can.,
Bring up the issue smoothly.,
If you feel like this might be a good time to reveal your feelings, go for it.",How to Avoid Being Accused of Flirting4," Nothing is more awkward then revealing, intentional or otherwise, that you like a boy around other people, especially if he is there and doesn't know. But what to do next? You like him, but just said you didn't.

, You need to talk to him privately, possibly by calling him on the phone. While this contradicts a step above, it is OK if you need to correct your mistakes.

, If you don't talk a lot, it might be awkward. Try not to introduce the flirting issue too suddenly. If conversation will be forced, simply come straight out with it.

, Again, DO NOT stutter or mumble. These indicate you are far more emotionally attached to the issue than you want to appear to be. Boys like confident girls, be one. Say something introductory, don't jump straight to, ""I really do like you!!"" Instead, start with, ""You know that thing at lunch today?"" He'll probably remember. Continue easily. ""Jenny just pissed me off, it's not like I hate you or anything."" Mention at one time or another that, ""It's no big deal, I just didn't want it to be awkward or anything tomorrow.""

, Asking someone out over the phone can be a good way to start things.

Give your lovebird a physical exam.,
Get a blood test.,
Get your bird surgically sexed.,
Determine if you have a breed of lovebird that has unique sex characteristics.,
Do not rely on paper shredding and nest-building behavior to sex your bird.,
Don't assume that a bonded pair of lovebirds are male and female.",How to Determine the Sex of a Lovebird," If you are just curious about the sex of a lovebird, and are comfortable with the possibility of being wrong, a physical exam can give you some clues. For example, feeling the distance between the pelvic bones can help you determine the sex.Female lovebirds need more width in the pelvic region in order to pass eggs through it. This means that you may be able to determine a male from a female by comparing the width of several lovebird's pelvic bones.
Take the bird into your less-dominant hand so that it is held upside down and its head is away from you. Take the pointer and middle fingers of your dominant hand and gently feel around the pelvic area of the bird. You should be able to feel the pelvic bones through the feathers and skin.
Then compare how one bird's pelvic bones feel compared to others. This is the only way you can determine which ones are wider.;
, The best and most conclusive way to find out a lovebird's sex is to get a blood test. Your bird's DNA will be examined in a lab and you will have a conclusive answer as to the sex of the bird.There are online services that will test your bird's DNA. The company will send you a collection kit, you send it back to them after following their directions, and then they will send you the results., With this procedure, the bird will be put under anesthesia, a small incision will be made in its abdomen, and the veterinarian will inspect its reproductive organs. This is an invasive procedure that is not usually suggested for pet birds. Instead, it is predominantly used by bird breeders.Surgical sexing is usually cheaper than DNA sexing but it has many more downsides, such as the risk of illness and death associated with surgery.
Once a bird is surgically sexed, a tattoo is usually applied to the bird to permanently mark it as male or female.

, Most lovebirds can't be sexed based on a visual examination. In fact, the most common type kept as a pet, the peach-faced lovebird, has to be DNA tested to truly determine the sex.Some people argue that female lovebirds are generally smaller than male lovebirds. This is only visible in certain breeds of lovebirds.Some people also assert that a female lovebird's feet are perched wider apart than a male's feet. This has to do with the assumption that a female's pelvis is wider than a male's.This depends on the species.
Unlike many other types of birds, most types of lovebird coloring does not differ based on sex. There are some exceptions, however, such as the Madagascar lovebird. The male Madagascar lovebird has grey on its head, while the females are solidly colored green., In general, when lovebirds are interested in mating they tend to shred paper, whether they are male or female. This seems to be true across species, with Fischer's and peach-faced lovebirds, for example, exhibiting the same behavior regardless of sex. While some argue that females are better at paper shredding, and so can be spotted by their skill and precision, this seems to be a difficult wary of determining sex.Some suggest that birds that tuck the paper into their tail feathers are likely to be females., If lovebirds are kept in a pair, they tend to form an intense bond. It does not matter what the sex of the birds are. Birds kept together will become a unit. Bonded pairs of the same sex are even known to work on nesting together."

When buying a parrot you must think first about the cost.,
Think about the cage size.,
Put accessories and toys in the cage.,
Find out which special type of food the parrot eats.,
Calculate the cost of veterinary care.,
Calculate the cost of boarding care.,
Add the total.",How to Calculate the Cost to Adopt a Parrot," Cost varies according to breeder and species. Hand fed birds cost more. Below are some examples of prices you may need to pay:


Congo African Grey $900
Macaws $950-1400
Cockatoos $950
Hahn's Mini Macaws $600
Baby Amazon $900-1200;
, Smaller parrots like the Conure can reside in smaller cages, which cost around $400, but larger parrots like the Macaw need more space, thus, their cages can cost several thousand dollars.

, In the wild, a parrot will fly an average of 30 miles (48 km) a day. Clearly, cage living is a far cry from that kind of freedom and exercise. This necessitates climbing apparatus and plenty of time out of confinement. Structures such as play gyms and t-stands are a good solution and cost between $100-500. Toys generally range in cost from anywhere between $50-100, unless you do some research and make your own.

, All types of parrots require a mixed and balanced diet of seed mix, pellets, and fresh fruit and vegetables. The cost varies according to the size of your bird. Seed mix will range from $8-20 a month, pellets will cost between $10-30, and fresh produce will cost roughly $15-50. This means that a monthly food total can run between $65-140 a month.

, This includes annual exams and immunizations, and will cost between $100-250/year, again depending on the breed and size of your pet. Emergency care costs more; anywhere between $250-2000

, When you go on vacation or have any sort of emergency that takes you away from home, your parrot will have to be boarded somewhere. The fee for a 10-day stay ranges between $100-250.

, The total cost of caring for a parrot for a year can cost anywhere between $2000-4000.

Know the red-winged blackbird's habitat.,
Identify them by their calls and appearance.,
Know the birds' size and body shape.,
Try drawing the birds to you.",How to Identify Red Winged Blackbirds," You can find them by walking near the shore of a lake or river, using binoculars or a scope to spot them. Check trees and shrubs along the water's edge. You can take a boat out as well, but always take proper caution while operating boats. Red-winged blackbirds are almost always found near water sources. They nest in reeds and plants ringing lakes and ponds, and will often be spotted on fences and trees near the water's edge.
, Watch for birds flying above lakes with steady wingbeats, often calling while in flight, as these will be red winged blackbirds. Listen for a screeching, raspy call, possessed by both sexes. Remember that coloration may not be the best way to identify them until closer observation - these birds' coloration varies greatly by gender. Males are shiny black or brown, with brilliant red, yellow, or orange shoulders. The females are smaller and light brown, with white underparts, and darker brown streaks all over.

Walk near a place inhabited by red-wings. Watch the reeds and keep an eye out for a medium-sized black bird with red shoulders, as females are much harder to spot then males, as they are much less striking. Use a bird call app to attract birds if they are not easily spotted.

, Red-winged blackbirds are relatively small blackbirds, with short tails and obvious, blackbird wing-shape. They fly with constant flapping and short dives. They often ""lean"" when perching, instead of sitting upright. Males are much more identifiable then females due to their striking markings and color. There are occasionally records of leucistic birds, which are white with black speckling and red shoulders., You can attract red-winged blackbirds by setting up several bird feeders, birdbaths, and feeding tables far from any human activity. Add a game camera on a nearby tree or pole to catch sight of the birds, or quietly watch with binoculars from far away. Check your feeder daily for at least an hour for best results.

Red-winged blackbirds are not common feeder birds, but ponds or birdbaths can attract them to your yard, and they will take birdseed off the ground and occasionally from a feeder. These birds prefer mealworms to birdseed, and need plenty of small trees and shrubs for cover to feel comfortable.
They are much more shy then Brewer's Blackbirds, and are wary of humans. This makes them difficult to approach without causing them to fly away.

Notice the size.,
Take note of the shape.,
Pay attention to colors.",How to Identify a Mockingbird1," If you want to figure out if a bird is a mockingbird, take note of its size first. This can help you determine whether he fits the characteristics of a mockingbird.


Male and female mockingbirds are both of similar sizes. However, some males may be slightly larger than females.Mockingbirds should be about the size of an American Robin. It's a fairly average sized bird.Their wingspans are about 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm).;
, Once you've observed the bird's size, pay attention to its shape. This can give insight as to whether or not you're looking at a mockingbird.


Mockingbirds are thin in appearance with longer tails.A mockingbird will have a somewhat small head. Its beak will be long and curved downward slightly.Mockingbirds have relatively long legs in comparison to most birds.A mockingbird has short, somewhat stubby wings. In flight, the nature of the wings make their tails look even longer., Coloring is one of the best tools you can use to identify a mockingbird. Mockingbirds have specific color patterns on different parts of the body.


Overall, mockingbirds are gray-brown in color. Their breasts and bellies tend to be grayer.Their coloring is darker and more solid in appearance on the upper parts of the body, like the head and back.There are bits of white on specific places in the mockingbird. You'll see a few white feathers on their tales. Their wings should each have one white bar.A younger mockingbird will have a similar color scheme, but the grayish colors may be spottier and somewhat dappled in appearance, especially on the belly and breast.The mockingbird can be mistaken with the northern shrike, which has similar coloring. However, shrikes do not have white on their wings and their coloring tends to be blacker, especially around the face."

Notice the bird's feeding habits.",How to Identify a Mourning Dove," Mourning Doves have a tan or grayish brown body, with slightly lighter coloring on their chests. Their wings have several dark spots on them, often nearly black; tail feathers are usually somewhat darker than their body color, with white tips and edges.Head feathers often differ between adult males and females, with males having a bluish tint to theirs and females having a pinkish hue; however, these patterns sometimes overlap.In addition to feather coloring, Mourning Doves can also be identified by their dark brown or black beak, their bright reddish-pink feet, and the light turquoise flesh around their eyes.;
, Adult Mourning Doves range from about 23 to 34 cm (approximately 9 to 13.5 inches) in length from beak to tip of tail, with females slightly shorter than males by a few centimeters; most Mourning Doves come in at around 12 inches in length. Common weight ranges are between 86 and 170 grams (again, with males being heavier than females).An adult Mourning Dove's wingspan is around 45 cm., Mourning Doves are often described as having a round head that looks too small for its body. These birds are rather slender overall and delicate in appearance, with a smooth body profile from head to tail and a round chest.The Mourning Dove's beak is tapered and sharp at the tip; its length is only about a third the depth of the bird's head.
The Mourning Dove has relatively short legs for its body size, even when fully extended.

, Mourning Doves have a distinctive tail, which is very long and tapers to a point. This is one of the features that can be used to easily distinguish between Mourning Doves and some of their close relatives (such as other birds in the dove family), as no other North American dove has this feature.The Mourning Dove's pointed tail does not fan out during flight, landings, or while the bird is standing still., Mourning Doves can be found in habitats extending from southern Central America into southern Canada and all over the contiguous United States. They are also found on the Caribbean and Hawaiian islands, but their exact range varies with climate and terrain.Mourning doves generally avoid very cold climates, which is why they are not likely to be found in extreme northern regions.
Mourning doves are not likely to be found in extreme desert environments because there is nothing for them to eat there.

, With a few exceptions, Mourning Doves are seasonally migratory birds, meaning that their habitats and geographical locations change with the time of year. You may have no luck finding these birds in the winter season in places with harsh winter temperatures.Mourning Doves are only found in Canada during the summer breeding season, when temperatures are warmest. Conversely, they are found in Central America in greatest numbers during winter, when northern temperatures are colder; however, in their southernmost range many do not migrate north in the summer.In the Rocky Mountain region of the U.S., Mourning Dove occupation is limited to more southern latitudes than in other regions of the U.S.

, Mourning Doves are not usually found in swamps or dense forests. These birds prefer to live in grasslands, brush fields, farm areas, and sparse forests. However, they can be found in high-elevation mountain habitats during the warmer months, so long as the vegetation is not too highly concentrated.Though they are not commonly found in dense urban areas (except for city parks and areas with lots of bare ground), Mourning Doves can often be seen perching on telephone wires and similar overhead structures., Mourning Doves do not put much effort into their nests, so they are typically made of whatever vegetation can most easily be found nearby.Mourning Dove nests can be found at various heights from the ground, ranging from the ground itself to high tree branches; they are not fond of dense tree canopies, however.
Often, the loose construction of the Mourning Dove's nest leaves gaps between twigs that are large enough that an observer can spot their eggs when the nest is viewed from below.

, Although Mourning Doves have been known to nest (during the breeding season) at elevations up to 10,000 feet, your best bet for finding and identifying these birds is to look for them at lower elevations.This is due to these birds' preference for open areas without lots of dense trees or groundcover.


This is not likely to be a significant issue unless you are seeking Mourning Doves in extremely mountainous regions of Washington, California, or the Rocky Mountain states in the U.S.

, Mourning Doves are given this name because their call sounds particularly sad, as if they are in mourning. The call is relatively quiet and follows the same pattern each time, which sounds like, ""Oo-whoo, ooo-ooo-ooo,"" hitting its highest pitch on the ""whoo"" syllable.This is the male Mourning Dove's mating call; other, similar sounds can also be heard coming from these birds, such as their warning call and the female's soft coo in response to a male's call.These calls can most often be heard in the spring and summer seasons, during the Mourning Dove's breeding period.

, Mourning Doves nest in pairs during their breeding season (during the spring and summer months) but migrate in flocks (during autumn and winter). If you are looking for these birds during the breeding season, you will most likely notice them hanging out in pairs, even if other Mourning Doves are present nearby.Immature Mourning Doves often join flocks before the end of the breeding season, but are not joined by adult birds until the migration season approaches.Mourning Doves sometimes feed in small groups during nesting periods.

, Mourning Doves have very smooth, swift flight, even from take-off. The path of a Mourning Dove's flight is usually more or less a straight line, with minimal swooping and swerving (except when necessary).The rapid beating of the Mourning Dove's wings when it takes off produces a high-pitched whirring or whistling noise, which usually fades as the bird gains speed., Mourning Doves usually feed on seeds found on the ground.This is why these birds typically prefer open habitats with sparse vegetation. Mourning Doves often feed in agricultural fields due to the ease of finding grains and weed seeds there.Because these birds are so common throughout the U.S., you are likely to see them in your own yard if you put up a bird seed feeder or spread seed on the ground.

Listen to the sounds the bird makes.,
See if the bird behaves in a territorial manner.,
See if it's mimicking other sounds.,
Take in the habitat.",How to Identify a Mockingbird2," You can also identify a mockingbird by its call. Mockingbirds both sing and call to one another.


The call of a mockingbird is loud and sharp. When singing, the mockingbird produces a complex series of notes and sounds. It tends to repeat the same songs over and over again.During the breeding season, in spring and summer, males will sing 24 hours a day. If you hear a bird singing for the entirety of a day, you might be hearing a mockingbird., Mockingbirds tend to be territorial. You can identify a mockingbird by paying attention to how it behaves around other birds.


Mockingbirds are easy to spot as they sit out in the open. If a bird is sitting on a tree branch in plain sight, hopping along the road, or in other easy-to-see places like fences or telephone poles, it may be a mockingbird.The mockingbird will be protective of what it sees as its environment. It's not uncommon to see a mockingbird dive and then attack other birds or animals that invade its space. A bird that is aggressive with intruders may very well be a mockingbird if it also matches the physical description., Mockingbirds get their name because they are excellent imitators. A mockingbird will often imitate the noise of other bird's songs. However, you may also hear a mockingbird imitating the sound of a cat, a dog, or other animals in the area. If you hear a grayish brown bird imitating a variety of odd noises, you're likely looking at a mockingbird., Mockingbirds live in specific environments. If you're still unsure if what you're looking at is a mockingbird, examine the bird's environment.


Mockingbirds typically live in the southern half of the United States. They're present year-round in parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Delaware, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New York, and in the southern part of Maine. In some nearby states, like Colorado and Utah, you may see mockingbirds in the spring or summer during mating season.Mockingbirds are often present in suburbs or towns. They prefer open country areas where there are some woods and foliage present. If you live in a more urban town or suburb, with little forest, you're less likely to encounter a mockingbird."

",How to Identify a Finch," You can keep a wild bird book to reference if you'd like. Basically, get ready to bird watch.;
, The ones that have raspberry or magenta feathers almost from head to tail are the purple finches. The bright yellow ones with black wings are the American goldfinches (you can see where the name came from). The ones that have vermillion (orangey-red) feathers on their head, breast, and back are the house finches.

, Purple finches like a dry landscape, while house finches and American goldfinches prefer the typical American backyard. The latter two can also be found in meadows, orchards and farmland.

, Each of these birds have favored areas. The American goldfinch can be found almost everywhere in America except Alaska and Hawaii. The purple finch can be found in the Southwest, near Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The house finch seems to enjoy habitats to the East of the Mississippi River.
Compare this with a European Goldfinch.

, These can be found in many European countries and in New Zealand.

, Whether you choose a book or a website as your field guide, this is most certainly the next step in identification. Spend time beforehand getting to know the layout and format of your guide, so that you can use it with ease.


Field guides are organized into groups of birds that are related to one another. The groups are listed from the least-evolved to the most-evolved birds. Many guides have helpful color tabs to make the process a bit easier for you.
When trying to identify a bird, look at the bird rather than the book or image. The bird provides all the details and leads the way. It’s easy to get distracted by things you see in the book, but it’s the bird that provides all of the field marks and identifiers! At this point in the identification process, any photographs you took of the bird are incredibly helpful.

, There are multiple options for bird search engines online. You can enter a bird name, shape, region, field marks - as much or as little information as you have. These search engines are extremely accurate and incredibly easy to use!

, There are some excellent ones out there for a broad range of different technologies and most of them are free! Do an app search with your device(s) and research your options. Some of the most popular field guides are also available in app form!

, Some common group examples are warblers, flycatchers, hawks, owls, and wrens.Later, when it comes to the identification process and using your field guide, this skill is invaluable because field guides are organized by bird group. Spend some time with books or websites that can help you learn these groups.

, Once you get bitten by the bird bug, you should obtain a good field guide to assist you. You can purchase field guides inexpensively, or check out one from a local library. Your local Audubon Society will also have field guides.You want a guide that is easy to use, portable, accurate and specific to your region.


In general, painted pictures in field guides are best to use. You can also try a mixed approach by checking out guides that use photos rather than paintings.
Even electronic field guides are available! Unlike printed field guides, these guides have videos and sound clips to guide you in identifying birds.

, The more details you can see on a bird, the more easily you can identify it! There is a large range of products with a variety of prices available.It’s all about your personal preference and what you can afford.

, Taking down notes in the field and consulting your field guide later is generally considered to be the best method of identification, allowing you to focus fully on the bird and fixing it more readily in your memory. , Photos to go along with your notes in the field are incredibly useful for identification. This can be done as simply as using the camera on your phone. Serious birders usually opt for a professional grade camera in the field. By and large, digital images have almost completely replaced film in bird photography.


If you do choose to use the camera on your phone, there are excellent adapters that you can buy that will tremendously improve the quality of those images. These are usually very lightweight and portable.
Serious birders suggest a camera that can manually override the automatic functions. Birds can be difficult to photograph, so you need a camera you can customize to what you’re seeing in the field.Carrying a tripod along with you in the field while you are birding will improve your photographs significantly., Many state and national parks have checklists of the birds seen in the park.These can be incredibly useful. Field guides can be purchased that focus on specific regions or you can obtain more general guides.


Check out Wildbirds.com. There you can research checklists that cover every single state in the Unites States, among other regions., Do some research about the habitat each species of bird prefers. After learning about the habitats, learn about bird songs you hear in your own backyard. Then move on to research the songs of other birds that you know are found in your region. To find a bird, you will often hear it first!


WildBirds.com is a great resource for assisting you in finding birds. Do a quick Google search to find other websites about birds and birding locations in your state or area of the country. There are tons of excellent websites out there that will help you find information about the birds in your region!
Bringing the birds to you is also an option! Read up on particular plants that can draw birds in your area. Consider a bird feeder and building a bird house.

, Distance, tricky lighting, individual variation, and a host of other deterrents can confuse or disguise some of a bird’s most obvious field marks, such as the color of its plumage. Because of this, first take note of its size and structure.


Use size relativity to get a general idea of the birds size. Size relativity refers to being bigger or smaller than a bird you are familiar with, such as a sparrow, robin, crow, or pigeon. Keep in mind that a common mistake that even experienced bird-watchers make is to overestimate the size of a bird. , The silhouette can provide insight pertaining to the group and sometimes even the species of a bird. When examining silhouettes, pay attention to the body shape, tail shape, beak length and body proportions.

, As your observation skills improve, familiarize yourself with the field marks. Field marks are colored or patterned areas on the bird's body, head, and wings that help distinguish species.Check for wing bars (stripes across the folded wings).
Inspect the wing tips (color of the pointed end of the wings).
Examine the wing lining (color of underside of the wing).
Check for wing patches (blocks of color on the wings).
Look for an eyebrow stripe (the color of stripe above the eye).
Note any throat patches (color blocks around the throat area).
Look for an eye ring (the ring of color around the eye).
Examine the upper and lower beak color.

, Many birds have distinctive postures that can help you differentiate between them. Pay attention to the bird’s posture when it is walking and moving about, as well as when it is perched. Noting whether the posture of the perched bird is vertical or horizontal can be very helpful during identification. Check the posture while the bird is feeding and resting, as well. , Most species of birds are born in and live all of their lives in one particular habitat. Did you see the bird in a forest, a marsh, an empty field, in the desert or near the sea? Did you see it at night or during the day? This can help you considerably when trying to narrow down the identity of a bird.


Take note of the location. What part of the country did you see the bird?

, Identifying birds in flight can be challenging, since you may only get a short glimpse and the distance between you and the bird in flight can be vast. Nevertheless, there are some key features that can be revealed in flight that can help you identify many types of birds. , Birds, particularly males, use their song to attract a mate and to protect their territories. They sing the most in the early morning during breeding season, and they normally repeat the same song over and over. Pay attention to what the bird is doing while singing. Connecting the song to an activity can be very helpful for identification. Break the song into different parts such as tone, pitch and rhythm. This is much easier than trying to identify all of it at once. Try to translate the sound into words or a pattern than you can remember. "

Purchase a bird field guide.,
Create a birdwatching pack.,
Choose a location.,
Walk slowly and quietly.,
Pick a place to settle down.,
Observe the bird.,
Notice any distinguishing features.,
Make a list of birds you see.,
Keep birdwatching regularly.",How to Be a Birdwatcher," Before you leave your home, spend some time doing a little preliminary research on the birds in your area. Having an idea about what you can expect to see in the wild is a great way to begin preparing yourself for your birdwatching excursion.You can read books about birdwatching or look up information online.;
, Part of being a good birdwatcher is blending into your surroundings so that you don’t disrupt the birds. This way, you can spend more time observing them in their natural habitats. Put on some dark or camouflaged clothing so that the birds won't notice you as easily.You may also want to wear a hat to keep the sun off your face and prevent sunburn.

, In the birdwatching community, there is a difference between a birdwatcher and a birder. A birdwatcher is someone who enjoys watching birds a bit closer to home, while a birder is someone who will travel far and wide to spot a rare species of bird.Some people use these terms interchangeably, but typically a birder is considered someone who is more intensely invested in watching and documenting birds.

, To be a good birdwatcher, you’ll need a solid pair of binoculars to help you spot those birdies from a distance. Try to find a local nature center that will let you try out different kinds of binoculars before you spend your money purchasing one.Look for binoculars that are waterproof and that magnify at least 8x.
A good pair will probably cost you between $100 and $300.
You could also use a telescope, though these are significantly less portable than binoculars.

, The field guide is important because it allows you to match what you’ve seen in nature to the accurate species. This is how you start fine tuning your knowledge and learning about various species of birds.A good field guide should cost you between $15 and $40.
Some guides use photographs of the different bird species, while others use paintings and illustrations. Decide which kind you like better.
Try to begin with a field guide that is specific to your geographical region. This will help keep you from getting overwhelmed in the beginning when you are still learning.

, Depending on how long you stay out birdwatching and how far you travel from home, you may need to bring some important items with you. Pack a small bag or backpack with the following items:Several bottles of water
Some food
Jacket and/or change of clothes
Lantern
Pocketknife
Insect repellant
Notebook to record your findings
Sleeping bag and tent (for overnight excursions)

, Go to a park or place where you suspect there will be a lot of birds. This means finding places where birds usually live – near water, trees, or feeding sites. Check the internet or your local field guide for recommendations about places to start your birdwatching adventure.There are many online websites that provide lists of well-known locations for birdwatching all over the country., You don’t want to startle the birds as you enter their habitat. So try to keep the noise and interference to a minimum. Walk as quietly as possible and make a serious effort to walk slowly through the area.This will help you from scaring the birds away.

, Choose a location to sit down – on a bench, on the ground, wherever you can make yourself the most comfortable. Stay very still and use a notebook and pencil to record the birds you see. If you don't know the name of a bird you have seen, try to draw a picture.It may take a little time for you to find a bird, but letting them come to you is a better way to observe them in their natural habitat than trying to search them out as this might scare them off.

, Once you spot a bird, spend some time observing it. Use your binoculars to inspect the bird without getting too close so you don’t scare it. Focus your binoculars so you can see the bird as clearly as possible. Enjoy this glimpse into the natural world and absorb what you can.Watch how the bird behaves, its mannerisms, and listen for any sounds it makes.

, In order to identify the bird, you’ll need to observe certain markings and features that can help you differentiate what specific type of bird it is. Notice the coloring, any unique markings, or any identifying features on its head or tail.First, identify the most obvious feature of the bird. This characteristic is called a bird’s field mark and will help you identify the bird.
Start at the top of the bird’s head and work your way down. This will help you keep your clues organized and to develop a system of observation and identification over time.

, Keeping track of the birds you see is a fun activity for you as a birdwatcher. But it will also help you make discoveries about what kinds of birds can be found in various areas.This isn’t a requirement for birdwatchers, but if you want you can use the information from your list to help organizations that collect bird-related data.

, As with any hobby, the more you practice birdwatching, the better you will become at identifying the various species. This will probably make the activity more enjoyable to you over time. With practice you will be able to identify more birds more quickly, and you will know where to find them.

Consider your location.,
Be aware that there are two species of Cattle egret.,
Make sure the bird you are looking at is white.,
Check the eyes.,
Check the body and legs.,
Note its behavior.,
Watch, don't intrude.",How to Identify a Cattle Egret," Cattle egrets are found in the tropics, subtropics and warm temperate zones. Hence, if you're in the Arctic, you're not looking at a cattle egret. However, even though this bird was originally native to parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, it has moved around the world and can be found in many parts of the world where it's warm enough for the bird. The map included in this step will help you to see whether you're in a place where this bird might also be.


The color key to the image is: Green - present all year round; Yellow - breeding season only; Blue - non-breeding season only.
You can also check a local bird book for more details about the distribution of the bird in your area, or contact a local bird expert (ornithologist).;
, One is the Bubulcus ibis, and the other is the B. i. coromandus. You'll need to find out which of the two species lives in your area.

, Cattle egrets are of the heron family and they exhibit shiny white feathers. When ready to mate, they produce thin, glossy, orange feathers on the head, chest, and wings. If the bird your looking at is purple, the the chances are you have a different bird species.

, Cattle egrets have either red, yellow, or orange eyes.

, Cattle egrets have stout bodies and long slender legs.

, The way that an animal behaves is a good way to identify them. Cattle egrets, for example, get their name because they follow cows around to eat the insects the cows attract and snack off. It is a symbiotic relationship in which the cow provides food to the egret and the egret cleans the cow.

, If you happen to correctly identify the cattle egret than congratulations, but make sure to leave the birds to their usual, daily lives and to not disturb them.


In the image, note the difference between the smaller cattle egret and the larger great egret. They don't mind each other's company though.

Make sure the weather is good.,
Check infrequently to allow the birds space.,
Alert the birds.,
Open the box and quickly check.,
Don't touch baby birds unless absolutely necessary.,
Don't touch eggs or even move them.,
If a bird is sitting on eggs, don't disturb it.,
Check the nest.,
Consider setting up a more sophisticated method of continual observation.,
Consider keeping a spreadsheet to record progress.",How to Monitor Nestboxes," If you open the nest box when it's cold or raining, you may chill the babies.;
, Some birds are more tolerant of humans than others and some birds have a very keen sense of smell and will be terrified by your presence. You'll need to learn about each species' needs specifically but on the whole it is recommended that you only check twice a week to avoid abandonment of the nestbox and potentially of the babies.

, Before you open the nest box, make sure the birds know you're there, since a startled bird may fly into your face. Just tap lightly on the box or call.

, Do this quickly, so as to not agitate the parents or terrify the babies. Spend no longer than a minute checking, less time if possible.


Don't be scared if the parents dive at you. They're just defending the nest.

, You may scare them to death, as you look, seem or smell like a huge predator to them.

, Eggs are very delicate. The oil on your fingers may damage the shell, and some eggs are very fragile.

, Moving may stress the parent.

, There may be parasites such as wasps and their nests, intruders such as frogs, reptiles or mammals, or a dead baby bird. Remove unhatched eggs and dead babies to keep a nest clean. If there is an intruder, deal with it as best you can or seek professional advice.


Even if the birds are no longer there, they may return to find the intruder, so remove the invader to somewhere else or to a nest box of its own.

, If you're good with electronics and computers, why not make use of cheaply available modern technology to rig up camera surveillance inside the nest box and have the images fed back to your computer. This will allow you to check on the birds' activity from the comfort of your desk without having to disturb them unless truly necessary. If you're not sure what to do, seek advice from an online bird watcher's forum or ask a retailer for advice on setting up such a monitoring device.


When setting this up, do it outside of the breeding season, so that the birds are not disturbed.
If you notice damage to the nest box itself, make repairs immediately and as quietly and non-intrusively as possible. Temporary fixes that don't disturb are better than longer term ones that can frighten the birds; leave more complicated repairs until after the babies have grown and left.

, If you want to compare progress from year to year, key in relevant information on a computer log to allow you to do this. Over time, such information could prove useful for scientists working with native bird recovery programs.

Research birds in your area.,
Choose a bird feeder.,
Provide seed and other food.,
Know what foods to avoid.,
Install the feeder in a safe location.,
Maintain the feeder.,
Provide grit.",How to Attract Birds1," Find out what types of birds live in your area or are likely to come to your property through migration. You may want to obtain a field guide to the area in order to know which birds to attract. Aim to create an environment that can support many different species. Bear in mind that you can attract different species depending on the season, as well., The type of feeder you choose will influence what bird species you attract. No matter what, your bird feeder should have a few essential qualities: it should be difficult for squirrels to access, it should keep food dry, and it should be easy to clean. Bird feeders need to be washed out regularly so the food inside remains free of fungi and disease.The most common types of feeders include:


Tray feeders. Tray feeders are simple, flat trays that allow birds very easy access to seed. The downside is that seed is also accessible to squirrels and unprotected from the weather.
House feeders. These keep seed in a contained area and dispense it as the birds feed from a small tray at the bottom of the feeder.
Window feeders. Window feeders attach to your window with suction cups, offering a full view of bird activity. They will attract birds like chickadees, finches, and some kinds of sparrows.
Suet feeders. Suet feeders are designed to offer suet cakes, which attract different birds like woodpeckers, nuthatches, and chickadees.
Tube feeders. To attract hummingbirds, use a tube feeder. These dispense sugar water through a tube.

, Birds will be attracted to your yard if you offer them food. However, there are certain things to keep in mind. Do you know what species you are hoping to attract? If you would like to invite a wide range of native species, it's a good idea to have more than one type of feeder and to offer a variety of food. You will inevitably bring less desirable birds – common sparrow, pigeon, or crow – but with good seed choice you can maximize your target birds.Corn is a favourite among nearly all birds but is to be used sparingly -- it will attract all sorts of animals. It is also important to be careful about the source of the corn, since cheap corn can be contaminated with pesticides that are toxic to birds.
Sunflower seeds are popular among all seed-eating birds, which makes them a good choice if you want a variety of species. However, the shells must be raked up frequently. Sunflower seeds will also tempt squirrels.
White proso millet is a tasty treat for cardinals, quail, sparrows, doves, and crows. It is also attractive to house sparrows and other animals. Hummingbirds love to drink sugar water, meanwhile, and safflower seeds are good for attracting cardinals, chickadees, doves, sparrows, and grosbeaks.
Suet, the fat around cow and sheep organs, attracts woodpeckers, nuthatches, wrens, jays, and starlings. Peanut butter makes a good winter food, since it is highly nutritious. Just make sure that it doesn't contain additives.

, Birds can easily be poisoned by food that is contaminated or contains hard-to-digest ingredients. Be sure to buy high-quality seed or suet. Some cheap manufacturers of bird food cut corners, so consider springing for a more expensive brand. Here are a few foods to avoid putting out:


Bread, crackers, or other processed carbohydrates do not offer birds much nutritional value and can have toxic ingredients. Bacon drippings or other meats can meanwhile contain harmful nitrates. Both may end up attracting mice and rats instead.Cheap feeds often contain “filler seeds” that are not eaten like red millet, golden millet, oats, and flax. Be sure to check the ingredients in purchased feed.

, If you want the feeder to be near enough for you to view it from your house, place it within three feet of your window. Placing it further away is dangerous for birds, since they are more likely to collide with a window (a situation that kills millions of birds every year). The feeder should also be far enough away from tree cover to prevent squirrels from reaching the feeder from a tree., It is important to change the food frequently and clean the feeder with soap and water every few weeks. Otherwise, bird droppings, fungus, and bacteria can contaminate the feeder and the food, potentially sickening birds. Be particularly vigilant during wet weather, when damp food is more susceptible to mold. For the same reason, and because it attracts undesirable animals, food that has fallen to the ground should be cleared away., Birds lack teeth and many instead rely on an organ called a gizzard to digest food. To work properly the gizzard needs grit – bits of sand, gravel, or other small stones. You can help by offering insoluble grit (e.g. small pieces of gravel) or soluble grit (like cuttlebone, crushed oyster shell, or crushed eggshell). Eggshell serves a dual purpose by giving the birds calcium needed for egg-laying."

You very well may decide to buy binoculars especially for birding, but you can use opera glasses, telescopes or anything you have on hand. Ask a friend, who may have binoculars, if you can borrow them., If you decide to buy, the way binoculars fit on your face and feel in your hands is important. Go to a sporting goods store or find a nature center that may have different pairs to try. Find a lightweight pair that will be easy to carry and hold steady while you spot birds.

, Binoculars will have two numbers that are listed like 8x29, 7x50, 10x40, or some other combination. The first is how many times they magnify an image and the second is the lens size, or how much light they bring in. Pick a lens on the low end, because a high one captures a lot of movement too and can be too bulky for watching birds in a forest or field.


Pick a magnification of 7 to 8 times.
Pick a lens number between 30 and 40 millimeters for the most versatility., When you go into the field, you will be wearing binoculars on your neck for hours at a time, so make sure the strap is wide and comfortable. Use a harness that distributes weight to the shoulders and back, if you have a heavier pair., A scope will offer stability, since it’s used on a monopod, and has higher magnification abilities. If you get serious about birding, invest in a scope to spot birds from greater distances, like across lakes or fields. Look for one with at least one lens that is fully coated with magnesium fluoride.This will give you the sharpest views of feathers and colors. It will also capture movement easier than binoculars., A regional field guide can help you narrow down what birds to look for locally. Learn about different families of birds, like swallows, warblers and herons. Get into the habit of studying their habits, calls, and field marks. Other than binoculars, your field guide will be your go-to for bird watching, because it will have all the information you need to identify different species.

, Photographs will chronicle what birds you spot and - if you need the help - identify them later on. Find a quality camera to take bird pictures, since they are small and do not stay still. Look for a DSLR one with a lens attachment of at least 300 mm. If you cannot swallow the cost of a higher end DSLR, find a camera with a super-zoom lens. Place it on a monopod, because images can get shaky the more you zoom in., Learning bird songs and calls are a helpful way to identify them. You may want to record their sounds while you're out spotting. Take either a parabolic microphone or a shotgun mic that you can attach to your camera. Use your camera to record. Regular microphones will be ineffective at recording soft or distant bird sounds and will capture too much background noise., What better way is there to learn about birding, than from other birders? Look at audubon.org or check with your local nature conservatory to find bird watching groups you can join. Also consider informal groups, like those you'd find through Meetup. The more sets of eyes and ears there are, the more birds you'll find, especially if you go with bird watchers who are more experienced than you are., Going out into the field means you’re going into a lot of the same areas you’d be in if you were hiking. Stick with the same type of breathable, loose clothes and sturdy boots you’d wear for long treks through forests or fields.Wear waterproof boots, so you’ll be prepared if you encounter puddles or mud.
Wear dark, neutral colors, like brown and gray, so you don’t frighten birds away.
Bright or white colors enhance movement around them.

, Loud talking or laughing can cause birds to flee before you even get close. Put your phone on silent, and speak softly or use hand signals and gestures to communicate with a group. Don’t be tempted to yell “Look over here!,” no matter how excited you get by spotting a rare bird.A whisper can often communicate the same thing.
Avoid flash and camera noises.

, Depending on where you’re located and what birds you’re trying to spot, the time of day you venture out can greatly impact successful birding. A lot of birds wake in the early morning hours, when the sun first rises, because they’ve been nesting all night and want breakfast. Others are not as dependent on the sun, especially if it’s summertime and the days are longer.Songbirds are normally spotted two hours after sunrise and right before sunset.
Hawks and eagles are best seen when the sun first rises.
Spot ducks any time of day.
Shorebirds are out when ocean tides change., If you don’t want to join a birding group or take long walks through potentially thorny forests, you can enjoy bird watching from your own backyard. Use bird feeders filled with food for species you’d like to see. Sit by a window and enjoy the scenery.


Start with simple black oil sunflower seeds and diversify with things like meal worms and fruit.
Place a bird bath or fountain in your yard. Birds love shallow or running water.

, No matter what type of binoculars you use, they will lessen your field of vision. Avoid missing birds by spotting them with your own eyes first. Find birds around trees and overhead in fields, and then use your binoculars to have a closer look., Your field guide is going to be increasingly important as you fine tune your birding skills and encounter similar looking birds. Compare markings and colors of birds with your guide. Learn about bird songs and calls as well. Other things to consider include:


The shape and size of the bird, including whether it’s big, small, round or oval.
What the bird is doing. Is it searching for insects, circling overhead or soaring?
Places where field markings are normally, like wing bars or the tail feathers., Focusing on bird colors can lead to misidentification. Light and shadow can make colors appear different than what they really are. A bright red feather can look brown in certain light. Focus instead on shape, size, markings, posture, behavior, etc. , Sometimes the only way you can identify a bird is by their songs and calls, because they are good at hiding. Listen to bird chirps to determine where they may be coming from. Keep in mind what birds you may see on an outing and look up their calls beforehand.


Record sounds with a parabolic or shotgun microphone.

, You wouldn’t expect to see a heron in the desert. Moreover, you should expect to see different birds in a forest than you would see in the city park. There will also be different birds by oceans than by lakes. Always consider the known habitat of species you're looking for.

, Use a camera, without a flash or clicks to prevent frightening birds, to look back on after an outing. This way, you can record what you’ve spotted, but also help identify birds later on, when you're not in the field. With time, you’ll become an expert and may only need the camera to record all the interesting birds you encounter.

Decide what you want your binoculars to do.,
Choose the features you would prefer.",How to Buy Binoculars for Birdwatching1," Buyers need to consider several variables when choosing the right pair of birdwatching binoculars:



How often will you use them? A casual birdwatcher likely won’t want to invest several hundred dollars in a top-of-the-line set of binoculars. Conversely, someone planning to dive into the hobby will probably be better off making a bigger financial commitment in order to ensure quality and durability.







Where will you be using them? Watching from your window, front deck or patio is a low-impact exercise that makes heavier binoculars with the option of using a tripod a better choice. If you plan to be more mobile while watching birds, you’ll want a pair of binoculars that are lighter and easier to carry.







What is the geography like in your area? Different landscapes demand different styles of binoculars. If visibility is a concern—somewhere near the ocean, for example—you may want to invest in fog-proof binoculars. Not everyone will need to worry about this variable, but those who do should look into minimizing visibility issues.







What time of day will you be most active? Binoculars that excel in daytime watching may not be suitable for nighttime viewing. Determining when your typical birding time will be should make finding suitable binoculars easier.





;
, Once you’ve decided on the basics, it’s time to personalize things. Here are the factors to consider:



Shape: Binoculars generally come in two shapes: roof prism and porro prism. Roof-prism binoculars feature two straight sight barrels and are usually the smaller of the two types. Porro-prism binoculars have dogleg-shaped barrels with offset eyepieces, and are usually more affordable because they aren’t as compact.







Magnification: This determines the extent to which you can make faraway objects appear closer. Experts suggest that most people find a happy medium—enough magnification to identify birds from a distance, but not so much that unsteady hands become more noticeable and the viewing area becomes too small. Higher magnification is also less than ideal when you’re tracking a moving target, which will probably be the case when you’re birding.







Objective lens size: This refers to the size of the front lens, which determines how much light gets in. A larger objective lens will make it easier to see greater distances, as well as improve visibility at dawn or dusk. They cost more, but most birders agree that larger objective lenses are a must.
(Note: Most binoculars are identified using magnification and objective lens size paired together, like 8x32 or 7x42. As a general rule, the wider the ratio, the larger the image. For instance, an 8x42 pair of binoculars produces a larger image than a 8x32 combination.)







Prisms: Most binoculars feature either BK7 or BAK4 prisms. BAK4 prisms are higher quality, with finer grounded edges that improve clarity and focus. BK7 prisms are also good, but aren’t as finely ground and therefore don’t provide the same quality image.







Coatings: These are layers applied to lenses to reduce the glare that washes out images. Coated lenses range in quality from ""coated"", which has moderate glare reduction, to ""multi-coated"" with near complete glare reduction.







Zoom: This option changes the effective magnification of the lens and allows the user to view a bird in a scene or close up, even from a great distance. Zoom lenses are effective when viewing birds standing still, but may make it difficult to follow moving subjects. They tend to be larger and heavier than fixed lens units. Birders pay a premium for excellent zoom lens optics. Less pricey models often have fuzzy or distorted images and a smaller field of view.

Follow the minimum requirements for washing.,
Clean more often when needed.,
Watch for diseased birds.,
Wear gloves.,
Disassemble your feeder.,
Clear out any solid debris.,
Soak your feeder in a solution.,
Rinse, dry, and reassemble.,
Place feeders away from water sources.,
Offer multiple feeders and space them far apart.,
Clean areas under and around feeders.,
Limit the amount of food that you put in.",How to Clean Birdfeeders," This will vary depending on what type of feeder you have, but regardless, always follow the recommended cleaning schedule for that type. Be aware that failure to do so will allow mold and other contaminants to develop. Keep your birds healthy by washing:Ground feeders every other day.
Hanging feeders every other week.
Hummingbird feeders every week.;
, Remember that minimum requirements mean just that. Expect to have to wash them more frequently depending on weather and bird activity. Wash them at least twice as often if:You live in a damp climate.You’ve experienced heavy precipitation lately.
Your feeder attracts lots and lots of birds.

, Keep in mind that birds carry diseases that can infect the food and spread to others. Wash your feeders immediately if you see any birds that appear sick near them.Look out for birds that:Appear slow to respond to their surroundings.
Seem lethargic and unwilling to fly or eat.
Have unhealthy-looking feathers.
Have visible sores in and around their beaks.
Consistently drop food and/or water without swallowing.

, Remember that bird diseases can be transmitted to humans. Protect yourself with a pair of rubber gloves (or even a thicker pair of leather gloves if you don’t mind getting them wet). Avoid touching your mouth, eyes, and exposed skin while wearing them., Some feeders are designed as one piece, so if that’s the case, skip this step. Otherwise, refer to its directions regarding disassembly. Clean each piece individually to ensure a thorough wash., Give your feeder or each of its parts a vigorous shake to dislodge any food or other clumps that may have stuck its sides. If there’s still stuff lodged in there, grab a tool, like a screwdriver, paint stick, or spatula. Pick or scrape the garbage out.Make sure to discard of anything you clean out into the trash, as opposed to the open ground. Don’t leave possibly molded or infected food in the open for birds to feed on., For hanging and bird feeders, mix one part bleach with nine parts water in a bucket, sink, or similar container. For hummingbird feeders, mix one part vinegar with four parts water. Then let the feeder or each of its parts soak in it for at least three minutes to disinfect.If necessary, use a bottle brush to scrub any crud that you couldn’t scrape off out of your feeder when it was dry, then soak again.Some people use a dishwasher for their bird feeders, but this is unadvisable unless the manufacturer specifically states that your feeder is machine-washable.
When using bleach, be sure to wear gloves to protect your hands.

, After you’ve soaked the feeder, towel it off with a clean cloth. Then let it air-dry. Wait until it has totally dried, then reassemble and/or refill it with food.If you cleaned your feeder because the birds outside seemed sick, wait a week or more before refilling it. Doing so immediately will only result in new food becoming contaminated right away., Keep in mind that sick birds often have trouble swallowing, and so they drop their food a lot. If you have a birdbath or any other water source that birds drink from regularly, set your feeders as far from it as possible. This won’t eliminate the risk of infected food being dropped in the water (and thus contaminating it), but it will lower the risk substantially. Also:Even if all of your birds are healthy, wet food will develop mold, which can then lead to disease.

, If you only have one feeder, purchase a second or even more. Give your birds multiple food sources so that healthy birds aren’t necessarily feeding from the same one as infected birds. Hang them far apart so that any dropped food isn’t ending up in the same, limited area.Again, this won’t prevent an outbreak of disease entirely, but placing multiple feeders in different areas can help limit its scope.

, Whether your birds are healthy or not, don’t let any dropped food just sit there on the ground. Rake or sweep it up and throw it into the trash. Leaving food to rot on the ground can:Cause health problems for birds and pets that may eat it.
Draw other animals that you may not want in the area.

, Expect mold to have a better chance of growing if you overfill your feeder. In dry conditions, only add enough to last a couple of days at most.In wet weather, only put in enough to last a few hours."

Plant native trees, shrubs and plants.,
Build a birdhouse or nesting box.,
Create a nesting site using natural materials.",How to Attract Birds2," Use a local field guide or call your local Audubon Society chapter (if you live in the United States) to find out what grows naturally in your region, and add these plants to your garden. Native trees, shrubs, and plants are more likely to attract birds than non-native trees, shrubs, and plants. A variety of native trees, shrubs, and grasses will also provide natural shelter and cover for birds.Evergreen trees and shrubs like hollies make great homes for birds over the winter.
Many birds are attracted to fruit and berries, so consider planting an apple tree or planting a blueberry bush.

, Different species nest in different places, so it is a good idea to conduct research on the type of bird you wish to attract. If you plan to buy a birdhouse or build a nesting box, take note that boxes with different holes, shapes, and orientations will attract different species. Such a box can be mounted to a tree or hung from a pole. Make sure that the box is up no later than February if you are in a southerly location; if in the north, hang it in March.Make sure that your nest site has adequate ventilation and is supplied with a ""baffle"" and reinforcement ring at the opening. This will prevent predators from entering.

, If you would like to create a more natural nesting spot, an easy way to do it is to allow your yard to grow a bit more wild. Let the grass grow in a certain spot or build a brush pile. This simulates the type of habitat where birds nest in the wild. You might alternately heap branches into a large pile or create sites under your bushes by raking mulch around the base.Consider supply nesting material such as string, hair, or other fibres, or stuff mesh bags with pieces of yarn or string, straw, pet fur, small bits of cloth, or anything else that a bird might use to nest.
Don't remove dead trees unless they are a danger. Standing dead trees are important nesting and foraging spots for many species, especially woodpeckers, which eat the insects that infest dead trees.

"
"
Provide a water source.,
Avoid pesticides.,
Keep cats and other predators away.",How to Attract Birds3," Birds are attracted to the sound of dripping or moving water. You can buy a birdbath or create a shallow pond with a fountain. Make sure it is close to the ground and not made of slippery material. If you are short on time or resources, hang a water-filled container with a hole on the bottom above a dish. Try not to place the water source near trees or bushes where cats might hide. Also, make sure the water is not more than 1 inch (2.5cm) deep.Consider using a heated water source during the winter. For the sake of sanitation, find a bath that is easy to clean. Ensure that the water does not become stagnant or harbor algae., Pesticides are harmful to birds in more ways than one. First, they kill vital sources of food for some species. Second, the chemicals in the pesticides can be dangerous for birds to ingest. In order to attract birds to your property, use natural forms of insect control instead of chemicals on your lawn, trees, and shrubs., Cats, snakes, raccoons, and rats prey on songbirds or their eggs, killing millions every year. No matter how hospitable your yard may seem, having a cat prowling around will act as a disincentive. Keep your cat away from feeding, drinking, and nesting areas if you are seriously interested in attracting birds. Hole restrictors, baffles, and tube entrances are good ways to secure birdhouses. Mounting the the house well above ground and using predator repellent are two added safeguards."

Search for brick-and-mortar binocular retailers, online vendors, or private sellers.,
Read product and user reviews on the brands you favor.,
Seek out fellow birdwatchers and ask their thoughts.",How to Buy Binoculars for Birdwatching2," Use the Yellow Pages. Check weekly flyers. Enlist the help of a search engine. The more searching you do, the more options you’ll find. Each has benefits and drawbacks, depending on what type of binoculars you want and how much you’re willing to spend.

, The Internet features plenty of reviews on birding binoculars, from both expert and amateur birdwatchers. Consulting as many different reviews as possible will often result in the recognition of themes or patterns. Perhaps one brand is consistently more durable than another, or one style is overpriced compared to other models.

, Birding clubs are all over the Internet—and they take their hobby seriously. Find a club or message board devoted to birding, and load up on questions to ask. You may get varied opinions on different products, but the insight should provide you with an expanded knowledge base when it comes time to make your selection.

Be willing to sacrifice one of your wants if you can’t find exactly what you’re looking for, but don’t settle for something subpar just to save a dollar.

, Not being able to try the binoculars out first is a major disadvantage, but you can mitigate some of the drawbacks by getting in touch with the seller and sharing any concerns or inquiries. While a quick reply is always appreciated, you’ll occasionally find yourself waiting. A major purchase like this is worth the wait, so be patient and thank the seller for responding when the time comes.

, If there are any other birding supplies you need while you’re completing your purchase, now is the time to get them. Otherwise, select the binoculars you want and prepare to pay.

An employee can help you decide between two or more options if you haven’t quite narrowed down your list. If you already know which binoculars you want, he or she can point you right to them.

, Binoculars are multi-functional devices, and any good inspection should be as thorough as possible. Test the magnification on something far away. Fiddle with the zoom feature. Try different barrel spacing. Make sure nothing is left to chance before taking the binoculars home.

, Retain the receipt in case you have a problem with the binoculars.

, Look for anything that might have a negative impact on the quality of the binoculars. Lens quality is probably the most important factor here. If there are scratches of any kind, you should politely decline and consider a different option. Test out every feature before ultimately deciding whether or not you’re going to buy them.

, If you’re satisfied with what you see, you should either agree to pay the listed price or take your chances at negotiating for a lower one. Some sellers are firm in their valuation (and will often say so in their ads), but many are willing to at least entertain an offer. It is ultimately the seller’s decision.

, Congratulations! You are the newest member of the birding fraternity.

Pour out all the nectar.,
Disassemble the feeder.,
Select a cleaner.,
Soak your feeder.,
Scrub down the interior of your feeder.,
Rinse the feeder completely.,
Allow it to dry completely.",How to Clean a Hummingbird Feeder1," As you likely stock your feeder with nectar, make sure to remove that before cleaning the feeder. You should simply pour the nectar down the drain, as it can be difficult to save the nectar for later. You can make more nectar later with simple sugar and water or restock the feeder with store bought nectar., You may need the manufacturer's guidelines to disassemble your feeder. However, disassembling a feeder is often self-explanatory. You can usually see the knobs and screws that must be undone to take the feeder part.If you are at all unsure, however, you should consult the guidelines to make sure you do not damage your feeder. If you lost the guidelines, you can type the name of your feeder into a search engine. You may be able to find a copy of the guidelines online.

, Usually, bleach is not necessary unless there is black mold in the feeder. For the most part, minor cleansers work best as they're less likely to leave behind harmful residue or damage the feeder.Unless you see mold, opt for white vinegar or 3% hydrogen peroxide as your cleaner. Vinegar should be diluted with water. Use two parts water to one part vinegar.You can also use simple dish soap.

, Fill up your sink with your chosen cleaner. Allow your feeder to soak for several hours. This will remove any toxins and make it easier to scrub off any grime., You will need a thin bottle brush to get into the various nooks and crannies of the feeder. Scrub the interior of your feeder with the bottle brush. You want to remove any nectar or sugar residue, as this can spoil and contaminate new nectar.After being soaked, residue should come off easily. You should not have to scrub with too much force.

, Rinse the feeder under hot, running tap water. Rinse each part of the feeder until the water runs clear. It's very important to rinse the feeder completely in order to keep harmful residue from getting into hummingbird nectar., Set the feeder in a dry, safe place in your home. Allow it to air dry completely before reassembling it and putting it back in place. How long this will take depends on the humidity of your region. It can take anywhere from a few hours to overnight."

Dilute your bleach.,
Soak the feeder in the bleach for an hour.,
Clean the feeder with a bottle brush.,
Rinse the feeder thoroughly.,
Refill the feeder.",How to Clean a Hummingbird Feeder2," If there is black mold in your hummingbird feeder, you will need to clean it with bleach. You should never use bleach without diluting it first, as this can be dangerous. You should also make sure to wear gloves when handling bleach.To dilute bleach, mix a quarter cup of bleach with a gallon of water. It's easiest to put your bleach and water in a large bucket.

, This is important to remove any mold and spores that could potentially harm hummingbirds. Submerge all parts of your bird feeder in the bleach solution. Allow them to sit for an hour.Remember to wear gloves when working with bleach.

, Keeping your gloves on, remove the parts of the bird feeder from the bleach. Clean each part of the feeder with a bottle brush.Make sure to scrub off any traces of black mold. You do not want any black mold on the feeder when yo put it back in place.
Where gloves for the duration of the cleaning process.

, It's vital to rinse the feeder as bleach can be dangerous to birds. Run the feeder under hot water until the water runs clear. The syrup in most nectars will neutralize small traces of bleach, but you should give your feeder a good rinsing to get rid of the bulk of the beach., After bleaching a feeder, you do not need to let it air dry. You can simply refill it and put it back in place. However, if the feeder is very wet, you can pat it dry slightly with a towel before putting it back in place."

Clean the feeder at the right frequency, depending on the season.,
Replace the nectar regularly.,
Deep clean the feeder at least once a month.",How to Clean a Hummingbird Feeder3," In the warmer months, feeders will need to be cleaned more often. If it's hot, windy, or rainy out, clean the feeder every one to three days. During colder, dryer months, clean the feeder every four to six days., Watch the nectar closely and throw it away when necessary. How long nectar lasts depends on your region and climate. When the nectar appears cloudy and white, it needs replacing.In some cases, nectar can go bad in only one to two days.

, The feeder should be cleaned regularly with a mild cleanser. However, once a month you should deep clean it with bleach. This is particularly vital if you notice black mold growing on the cleaner."

",How to Choose the Right Bird Feeder," Some tube feeders can also hold nyjer (thistle) seed.


Different shaped feeders such as houses and balls (or hot air-balloons) are also great for mixed seed.;
,, The mesh socks only work for goldfinches (and other small birds). The small wire thistle feeder is sturdier and can hold bigger birds.

,,, These are great because they can dispense just about any type of feed.

,, You'll also find many other birds enjoy suet too., All you have to do is put a few short dowels into a board and stick the oranges onto the dowels.

, Simple suet feeders can be made at home. Be sure to choose a place that squirrels cannot get to though.

, Look at what they eat. Decide if you want to attract a certain type or types and match the feeder to the type of food it can hold and the relevant birds. Also buy the seed that they will eat to attract the birds to your yard.

, Ones that come with squirrel deterrents are a good choice if there are squirrels in your area. Any feeder used long-term should have a heavy base, to prevent swaying in the wind which would make it difficult for birds to eat.

, At the store, examine it yourself. The holes for birds to eat seeds out of should not be too big so that seed can fall out, or too small so that birds can remove the seeds from the feeder. Make sure you have a way to hang it before you buy it.

, Be sure to bird-proof the window from birds so that they do not fly into it. A lightweight trellis works well, as do stickers. If a bird is startled when feeding, it may fly in any direction that looks like an escape route. Birds do not see windows, but the reflection in them. This reflection will look exactly like your yard, thus you must always bird-proof your windows.

, (For example: 1cup white sugar + 4 cups water.)

, Measure after.

Maintain the bird feeder.",How to Build a Milk Jug Bird Feeder," However you design your birdfeeder, you will need some basic materials: an empty, cleaned, and dry gallon or half-gallon plastic milk jug, some string or wire, scissors, and bird food (birdseed, sunflower seeds, millet, etc.). Depending on your design, you might also want to gather:


Dowels or sticks to use as perches (these should be a few inches wider than the jug)Markers, paints, leaves and glue, or other materials to decorate the feeder
An aluminum pie plate to use as a bottom;
, Using a marker, draw a shape on a side of the milk jug away from its handle. It should be positioned a couple of inches from the bottom of the jug, so that it covers the middle of the jug’s side. This shape will mark the opening where the birds will be able to access the food inside. You can draw a circle, a semi-circle, square, or any other shape that a bird could enter to reach food inside the feeder.


A hole between two and four inches wide is sufficient for many common birds.If your jug is large enough, you can cut another hole or two (of the same size) on its other sides.

, Using the scissors or another sharp implement, carefully poke a small hole in the jug somewhere along the outline you drew on its side. Then, using the scissors, carefully cut along the line you marked until you cut the circle entirely off of the jug, leaving an opening about three inches wide.


If you marked places for other openings on your jug, cut those away too.

, If you want your milk jug bird feeder to have a perch for birds to stand on as they eat, then you can use a dowel or stick to easily add one. Use a hole punch, scissors, or some other instrument to puncture the jug about a half-inch below the opening, and then again on the other side.The hole should not be any larger than your dowel or stick is wide.


Repeat this step if you have more than one perch.
Instead of a dowel or stick as a perch, you could glue an aluminum pie plate to the bottom of your milk jug feeder. This can give birds something to perch on as they feed.If you use a pie plate, you do not need to punch the small holes in the sides of the jug.

, Take the dowel or stick you want to use as a perch, and carefully insert it into one of the small holes you punched. Push the perch through until it passes through the small hole on the opposite side of the jug.Adjust the perch until it sticks out approximately the same amount (a few inches is fine) on both sides.


Repeat this step if you have more than one perch.

, You will need to create some sort of loop or hook that you can use to hang your jug outside. There are several ways to do this, depending on the materials you have. Make sure to leave some of the material dangling to use later when you hang the feeder (the exact length depends on where you will hang the feeder). You can:


Punch a small hole through the cap of the milk jug. Then feed string or ribbon through the hole, and tie a knot on the inside of the cap so that the string won’t slip through. Then, you can take the other end of the string and tie to a branch or hook outside to hang your bird feeder.You can also punch a hole in the cap of the milk jug and use wire or a coat hanger instead of string.Another method is to punch a small hole near the top of the jug (just below the cap), and then another on the opposite side. You can then pass string, ribbon, or wire through the two holes and use this to hang the feeder.You an also just wrap string, wire, or ribbon around the neck of the jug, if it is secure enough.

, Decorating your milk jug bird feeder isn’t a necessary step, but it can add personality and fun to the project. For instance:


You can use markers to draw a design on the plastic jug.
You can also gather leaves, twigs, etc. and glue them on the outside of the jug as decoration., This step is optional, but putting some small rocks in your jug can help to weigh it down and keep it stable.This is especially helpful if you live in a windy area.

, Pour your chosen food (birdseed, sunflower seeds, millet, etc.) through the large opening(s) and into the bottom of the jug.Don’t overfill the jug; pour in enough food to just about reach the bottom of the opening(s).

, Choose a location where you can easily reach the jug to refill it with food when necessary.Try hanging the feeder from a low tree branch, a post, or other place that is accessible to you and to birds. Make sure to hang the bird feeder using a strong knot or secure wire.

, You’ll want to choose a place to hang your feeder that allows you to see it and to enjoy watching the birds eat. You’ll also want the feeder to be in a place that birds find safe.


Different species of birds have different preferences, so you might have to try putting the feeder in several locations to find one that birds like best.
You can also try different kinds of food if one kind does not seem attractive to birds.

, Periodically check on your bird feeder to make sure that it is filled and safe. How often you need to do this will depend on the type and number of birds that visit your feeder, and the weather in your area.


If it is low on food, refill it.
If the feeder is damp or dirty, then clean and dry it or replace it.
If the plastic of the jug becomes brittle (this can happen in time), replace the feeder with a new one.

Help by making a decision to put out bird food regularly.,
Choose the right food.,
Ensure that the birds have constant access to drinking water.,
Offer a roosting birdhouse or nest boxes.,
Keep the feeding regular and all through winter.",How to Help Songbirds in Winter," In particular, when the winter weather is very severe, be sure to leave food out for the birds. Be especially attentive after storms, when the birds will probably have been unable to find feed until the storm passes.


If possible, feeding first thing in the morning and late afternoon can help the birds restore energy when it's most needed.
Position feeders where the birds can find them easily and can keep an eye out for any possible dangers. Some feeders are best at ground level for ground feeding birds, others hanging.
Always aim to locate feeders out of the wind.;
, Provide the sort of food that the birds would be getting on their normal diet, while focusing most on foods of high calorie content (some of which wouldn't normally be found in nature, such as bread or pastry). A variety of food will attract a variety of birds. While you should familiarize yourself with the particular needs of species of birds visiting your garden, in most cases, the following foods will be ideal:Fat and suet scraps (woodpeckers love suet); suet cake should always be hung to avoid attracting rats and their ilk
Cooked potatoes
Mild grated cheese
Soaked fruit
Pastry
Cracked corn
Niger/Nyjer thistle seed for goldfinches
Safflower seeds for chickadees, titmice and downy woodpeckers
Black oil sunflower seeds and sunflower hearts
White millet for sparrows, juncos and mourning doves
Sunflower-rich birdseed mix
Apples and pears (chopped)
Bird cake
Millet, corn and canary seed mixes for ground feeding birds (sprinkle under bushes); avoid mixes with too much red millet though as birds don't like it much and what isn't eaten gets left as a mess
Unsalted high fat peanuts.

, Obviously, water can freeze over in very cold temperatures, so you might wish to give the birds tepid water.


Put up a heated birdbath. Birds will be able to get a warm drink and bath. You can buy birdbaths with heaters or heaters that can be added to a birdbath at most birding stores.
Never add any anti-freeze product to drinking water. These products are poisonous.
If there is enough room for birds to get into the water and it's not heated, add rocks to prevent this on very cold days, as they will quickly become cold when wet. When the weather warms up, you can encourage hopping in by removing the rocks.

, These are a place where birds can spend the night away from the cold. You can build your own, or buy one. If it's a nest box, the birds might choose to breed there in the coming spring, providing your family with a wonderful source of joy watching the growing birds.


Adding hay and dried grasses to nest boxes or birdhouses will help keep the birds warm inside.
Prevent drafts by covering up ventilation holes during winter.
Try to face the bird box or house in the direction of the afternoon sun to help increase warmth and face it away from the harshest winds.

, Once you attract birds to feed during winter, you will need to remain consistent because the birds come to rely on the food source you're providing and expect it. Sudden cessation of the food source they've grown to rely on while the weather is still severe can be catastrophic for the birds.

While bird owners have reported success planting these seeds, or even growing them accidentally by dropping them in the garden, seeds or young plants purchased from a plant nursery will most likely be labeled with an exact species. This gives you a better idea of what to expect, and may help you find more specific answers to problems you encounter while growing.


""Ornamental millet"" varieties such as Purple Majesty or Foxtail Millet Highlander are recommended for small garden plots due to their attractive appearance. They still produce edible seeds that will attract birds and other wildlife.Some millet varieties, such as Golden Millet, grow to 18–24 inches (46–61 cm) in height, while other common varieties require more space and reach 5 feet (1.5 m) or more in height.Your millet plant may not reach its maximum height in cool climates.If you plan on eating the millet or feeding it to birds, use organic millet seeds and do not treat the plant with pesticides.;
, For best results, especially with ornamental millet, start the seeds indoors approximately 6–8 weeks before the last frost of the year.Alternatively start the seeds directly outdoors as long as the frost is over and soil temperatures are above 50ºF (10ºC), but be aware that this may not give the plant time to mature and produce seeds by the end of the growing season., You can purchase seed starting soil, or mix ordinary potting soil with an equal amount of compost.Using soil from your garden may not be as effective, but you can attempt to grow millet in any soil that drains quickly. Mix perlite or sand into the soil if the soil clumps together or tends to stay soggy after watering.

, Seeds should not be buried deep, but instead placed no more than 1/4 inch (6mm) below the surface.Ideally, plant the seeds 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) apart. If you don't have enough space, you may plant them closer together and thin out the smallest seedlings once the seeds have sprouted.

, The seedlings should sprout within a few days. Many millet varieties are adapted to warm climates, and grow best if exposed to bright, indirect sunlight for most of the day and temperatures around 78ºF (25ºC).If the millet you purchased came with other instructions, follow them instead.

, Water the seeds immediately after planting to help them sprout and grow.Subsequently, water whenever the soil is dry or nearly dry, but not if it still feels damp. Make sure the water drains well. Millet will not grow well if the seeds are soaking in water.

, After the last frost has passed and the soil temperatures are above 50ºF (10ºC), dig the seedlings out individually, taking care to keep their roots intact. Transplant them into outdoor pots or directly into the garden, using the same soil they were in before. Try to plant the seedlings to the same depth they were before, not burying stem that was previously above the soil level. Keep the millet in full sun unless it shows signs of withering or burning.


The recommended size of the pot or spacing of the plants varies greatly with the type of millet.
If the weather is hot or the seedlings are still small, consider keeping them in an outdoor area with partial shade and wind protection for one or two weeks before moving them to an area of full sun. This allows them to gradually adjust to outdoor conditions.

, Because there are thousands of millet species and varieties, it is impractical to give specific instructions for each. Generally speaking, millet plants enjoy good-draining soil and do best if the soil is not allowed to dry out completely.Millet is unlikely to survive freezing temperatures either as seeds or adult plants, and most types thrive in warm weather.If your millet appears unhealthy or some of the plants die, have a botanist or garden nursery employee identify your species of millet and suggest specific care.


If your millet rots or looks slimy at the base or roots, reduce watering.
If your millet dries out or falls over, it may be a short-root variety. Add compost to the soil to help trap moisture and provide a sturdier support for the plants.

, If you wish to collect seeds to feed to house pets, or to plant again next year, you'll need to get to them before birds and other wildlife. The time it takes for millet to mature varies greatly with variety and climate, so once the plants flower, keep an eye out for seed pods. These pods grow among the fluffy ends of the plant, and eventually open up to release seeds. Periodically break open a pod to see if the seeds inside are brown or black. If they are, the pods are ready for collecting. Gather them individually, or simply cut off the whole stalk.Note that millet is an annual crop, meaning the plant will die after producing seeds.

, Seed pods can be left in a paper bag to dry for one or two weeks. Shake the bag to separate seeds from the other material (chaff), then store in a dark, dry place to plant next year. Alternatively, feed fresh or dry seeds to pet birds in small quantities as treats. If you have enough millet seeds, you can boil them into a porridge.


Together, millets and other treats should not make up more than 10% of your bird's diet."
"
Decide on the height.,
In addition to the 8 feet (2.4 m) above ground, you will also need about 2 feet (0.6 m) of pipe to drive into the ground; this is the support for the structure and also allows the above ground section to be removed and modified, or swiveled if you like.,
Solder a simple coupler (sleeve) once the pipe is driven to an adequate depth, over the end of the pipe so the upper half of the structure can slide in and out of the coupler as needed and be supported by the pipe in the ground.

,
Decide how many ""limbs"" you want.,
Prepare and add the actual limbs that you will hang the feeders or houses on.,
Slide each arm into its respective ""T"" fitting, stand your pole with the limbs attached into the base coupler and you are ready to hang your feeders on the hooks.

",How to Build a Copper Bird Feeder Pole," The starting point is deciding how tall you want the structure so you will know how much pipe is needed. A good size is a pole that is about 8 feet (2.4 m) tall so the feeders hang at between 5 and 7 feet from the ground.;
, Try using a hammer and block of wood to hammer the 2 foot (0.6 m) section into the ground about 1.5 feet (0.5 m) deep. The wood is used so you do not hit the pipe directly with the hammer which would bend the pipe.

,, (Remember that the more limbs, the more breaks you need in the main pole which will create more movement at the top. You also want to try to equalize the weight distribution of the feeders to each side of the pole so it does not lean over time.) You can decide to have three limbs, two at about 7 feet (2.1 m) and then another off the very top. From this point, you simply cut the main pipe at the height you want the first limb and attach a ""T"" fitting so you have the ability to add another pipe perpendicular to the main pole. Then add another length of pipe into the ""T"" fitting that will extend the main pole to the height of the second limb and repeat as desired.

, The further out you want your feeders hung, the less weight the pipe will bear. This image shows somebody using 1"" copper pipe which seems to be holding the weight well but it is a soft metal and will kink easily so it is not suggested making the limbs more than 12 or 18 inches (30.5 or 45.7 cm) long. A good idea is to find a way to secure the feeders in such a way that they could spin easily for a different look and could be removed for cleaning and filling. The easiest way some would think to do this was to drill a hole in the bottom of each arm about an inch from the end. A hole is drilled large enough for a deck nail shaft to fit but not the head. Taking a pair of vice grips, the nails are bent so the pointed end acts as a hook which can be fed through the inside of the hole drilled in the pipe so the nail hook is suspended by its head and can spin freely.

Give your bird vegetables.,
Give fruit sparingly.,
Give seeds and whole grains as a treat.,
Offer a variety of treats.,
Don't give commercial treats with poor ingredients.,
Avoid foods that are bad or toxic for your particular bird.,
Don't leave old treats in your bird's cage.",How to Choose Treats for Pet Birds," It's important for your bird to get a well-rounded diet and treats of vegetables can help you achieve that. Try giving your bird dark green vegetables or yellow and orange vegetables, such as carrots, as a treat on a daily basis.If you give your bird vegetables that it loves, it will feel like you are giving your bird a treat when you are really just giving it a healthy snack.


Try feeding the vegetables to your bird directly. See if he or she will eat a piece of broccoli or sweet potato right out of your hand.;
, Treat fruits like a dessert and only let them constitute about five percent of your bird's diet. They shouldn't be given every day and should only be given in limited quantities.Give fruit at most once a week, while vegetables should be given daily.


Fruit for a bird is really a treat. It is high in sugar, so giving too much of it can make a bird unhealthy or ill.

, The core of your bird's diet should be bird pellets, which are formulated and fortified to give your bird a balanced diet. These will give your bird many of the proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, minerals, and vitamins it needs.Because of this, seeds should only be given as a treat. If overfed seeds, your bird will be getting too much fat in its diet.Many pet birds with nutritional deficiencies have them because they are only fed seeds. It is a myth that birds only need seeds. In order for your bird to avoid these deficiencies, feed it a fortified bird pellet and vegetables on a regular basis.

, It's good to vary your bird's diet a bit, including its treats. Even if your bird really loves a specific type of treat, such as dark greens like broccoli, you need to give it a variety of foods to give it a complete diet. Rotate broccoli in with a few other vegetables, so that your bird gets a variety of nutrients.


This does not mean that you should give your bird totally new foods all of the time. In fact, new foods need to be introduced to your bird gradually. However, have a variety of treats that you give it on a regular basis.It could be that you give your bird a different vegetable every day of the week but that you repeat these foods every week. This means that every Monday your bird would get the same treat.
Take your bird's special dietary needs into account. There is no one ideal diet for all pet birds. Some birds have special dietary needs all their own. You can fulfill these with treats. For example,

, Some commercial bird treats include a variety of artificial ingredients that are not good for your bird. Giving your bird a store bought, prepackaged treat could mean that you are giving it salt, sugar, and artificial coloring. Instead, focus on treats that have very few ingredients, or are just one ingredient, like a few nuts or a small piece of fruit., There are some foods that you should not give to your bird because they contain chemicals that are bad for the bird. In particular, there are many common human foods that a bird should not have access to. These include, but are not limited to: coffee, avocado, chocolate, alcohol, nutmeg, and rhubarb, to name a few.This includes certain vegetables, such as bok choy and spinach, which contain a chemical called oxalate. This chemical limits the amount of calcium the bird can absorb, which is not good for the bird.Additionally, don't let your bird have the pits of stone fruits, such as peaches, apricots, and plums. These pits contain a chemical that is toxic to birds.

, Only give your bird the amount of food that it will eat in one day. You don't want old food sitting around the bottom of your bird's cage. New fruits and veggies should be given daily.


Taking good care of a pet bird means cleaning its cage out every day. When you are cleaning the cage, its easy to remove all fruits and vegetables from the bottom. Then you can simply replace the vegetables the next day with new ones."

Select a millet variety suited to your needs.,
Plant millet in warm temperatures.,
Prepare the seed bed.,
Plant at a shallow depth.,
Adjust your spacing depending on variety and local conditions.,
Fertilize.,
Cut millet and leave in the field if using for hay.,
Make sure all weed and pest control substances are safe for millet.,
Harvest before migrating birds appear.",How to Grow Millet2," Millet is a general term for annual grass crops grown in the warm season, so there are many species, varieties, and hybrids to choose from.Some farmers grow millet as forage crops or to attract wildlife, while farmers in India, Africa, or China harvest the grain to sell as food for humans. Be sure to select a variety suited to your purpose and to your local climate and soil. The following are the most common types of millet, but note that each one has many subtypes with varying characteristics:



Pearl millet is most commonly grown to produce birdseed or poultry feed in the southwestern United States, or as human food in India and Africa.Foxtail millet grows reliably in semi-arid conditions, and has a fast growing time that allows it to be planted later than other crops.Proso millet is another hardy millet with fast growing times. Inside the United States, its growth is concentrated in Colorado, Nebraska, and South Dakota.Finger millet can grow at higher altitudes or hillier conditions than many other crops, and is favored by some subsistence farmers due to its cheap cost and long storage times., Millet is sensitive to cold and should only be planted when soil temperatures at a 1 inch (2.5 cm) depth are consistently at 65ºF (18ºC) or above to ensure reliable sprouting. This is typically three or four weeks after corn planting time and one to two weeks after sorghum planting time in your area.Most millet grows to maturity within 60 or 70 days, and some in even shorter periods if the climate is warm.

, Clear the seedbed of all weeds and prepare it depending on soil type. Deep-till hard or textured soil to break up hardpan soils. If your soil has high clay content or erodes, you may have better success with no tillage or conservation tillage (leaving last year's crop remains on the soil). For limited tilling, planting later is advisable as these seedbeds will be cooler.You may plant some varieties of millet on fallow fields, although you will likely not receive maximum yields if you do not provide nitrogen fertilizer.

, Standard millet planting depths range from 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25–2.5 cm), as the seeds are rarely strong enough to reach the surface if planted any deeper.You may wish to plant to a depth of 3/4 inch (2 cm) for small seed.


A seed drill with a small seed attachment may be required for some varieties. The seeds can also be planted by hand in furrows that are closed over them., Soil type, climate, and millet variety all affect the density your field can support, so seeking local advice is recommended. As a general rule, millet can produce good forage when sown at 4–5 lbs/acre (4.5–5.5 kg/ha), but can support seeding as high as 20–30 lbs/acre (22–34 kg/ha) if irrigated.Space millet rows farther apart if grown for cultivation rather than forage., Many millet varieties can grow in poor soil or even fallow fields, but fertilizing is recommended for higher crop yields. Apply 40–50 lbs of nitrogen per acre (45–56 kg/ha) after planting, and another 40–50 lbs/acre (45–56 kg/ha) after three or four weeks. Some soils may require potassium, phosphate, magnesium, or sulfur as well.If you cannot find recommended levels of these minerals for your millet, you may follow guidelines for sorghum instead.


Drill row fertilizer applications may harm millet, unless the fertilizer is straight phosphorus., Foxtail millet, and possibly other varieties, deteriorate quickly if left alone after the growing season. Swathe and windrow them instead, leaving the cut plants in the field until late fall or early winter to dry before you bale the hay.

, Millet is a type of grass, and so can be killed by some grass-controlling herbicides; other herbicides and insecticides may not be safe for use on forage crops, cultivated crops, or both. The exact diseases and insect pests that attack millet crops vary widely by region, and can be best prepared for with crop rotation and seed treatment. Learn as much as you can from local millet farmers or your regional agriculture department or society.

, Keep a careful eye on grain development and bird activity, as the harvesting window can be short between the ripening of the grain and the appearance of large bird flocks. Harvesting methods vary by millet variety and intended use, but be sure to cut low enough to obtain the entire ear.


Millet seeds should be stored at 13% moisture or less."
"
Set up a feeder on your property (or somewhere you have permission to do so).,
Stand a little closer to the feeder every day.,
Replace the feeder with a bowl or coffee mug.

,
Once they are eating out of the bowl or mug with you standing next to them, start holding the bowl or mug.

,
Once they're comfortable with that, start feeding them from your hand.

",How to Hand Feed a Chickadee2," Keep it filled with sunflower seeds. This will let birds know that there is always a regular supply of food at that location.

, At first, the birds will be skittish, but over time, they will get used to you. When they get comfortable, start to stand a little closer until you can stand right next to the feeder.

,,,"
"
Keep in mind that not all seeds are created equal.,
Buy nectar, or make it yourself.,
Consider providing other kinds of bird food.,
Search for specific bird food recipes.,
Take note of how much you're feeding to wild birds.",How to Feed Wild Birds1," Seed is the most common bird food used for feeding wild birds, but choose your seed wisely. Different birds prefer different kinds of seed.



Cardinals, small or large finches, and grosbeaks prefer to stay at the feeder while eating. These birds enjoy black-oil sunflower, while small finches prefer sunflower hearts and thistle.
Other birds tend to grab food and eat it away from the feeder. These birds include chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, and woodpeckers. They prefer black-oil sunflower and shelled peanuts split in half (whole peanuts).
Choose white proso millet for ground-feeding birds, such as juncos and sparrows, towhees, and doves.
Some birds prefer nectar over seeds, such as the rainbow lorikeets in Australia and hummingbirds in North America.
Above all, watch neighborhood bird species' behavior to learn which seeds they will prefer.;
, Nectar, used to attract hummingbirds and orioles, should have a ratio of four parts warm water to one part sugar. Bring the water and sugar to a rapid boil, stir the mixture, take it off the heat, and then allow it to cool completely before using. Do not leave the pan to boil for very long, since this will cause water to evaporate off and will change the ratio of water to sugar.


Do not use artificial sweeteners since these do not contain the calories the birds need to survive, and effectively starve the birds. In addition, the chemicals in artificial products or manufactured items such as jelly can cause digestive disturbances in birds.
You do not need to add food coloring to your solution to attract birds. Most commercial hummingbird feeders are bright enough to attract the birds without the need for additives.
Once you've made your stock solution, store it in a clean airtight bottle in the fridge, but make sure the ""nectar"" is at room temperature before offering it to the birds.You can also purchase nectar commercially, in liquid or powder form. This might be more appropriate where the balance of nutrients in the nectar is important for maintaining the birds' health (such as with rainbow lorikeets). Look for brands that explain how they have nutritionally balanced the nectar for the species specific to your backyard.
In New Zealand, putting out nectar when native nectar is in short supply will attract tui, waxeyes, and bellbirds. In the meantime, plant some nectar-flowering trees to improve the local natural supply.

, Suet is the food of choice for many species, including woodpeckers, nuthatches, chickadees, Carolina Wren, and Tufted Titmouse. Dripping or lard can also be used. Birds like orioles and mockingbirds enjoy eating fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges and raisins. In New Zealand birds such as tui and waxeyes enjoy oranges, apples, grapefruit and pears.


Insectivorous birds (meat-insect eaters), like blue birds, kookaburras, crows, magpies and willy wagtails will appreciate insects, particularly mealworms. However, this sort of food must be prepared fresh every time you give it, and should usually be restricted to a once-daily feed only.
Water should be provided for wild birds as well. It can be provided from a bird bath or other container. Many birds enjoy the opportunity to visit an open body of water, such as a bird bath, since this allows them to clean their feathers as well as drink.

, There are quite a few great ideas for making your own bird food targeted to specific bird species. Ask for advice from such places and people as your local conservation centers, national parks resource providers, your vet, local bird rescuers and bird experts. Making balanced food can help to ensure that certain species are getting much needed nutrients and it's also a lot of fun for the family to get involved in. Here are just a few recipe ideas:


How to make homemade suet cakes
How to make mealworm suet cakes for bluebirds
How to make homemade bird food
How to make peanut butter bird feed
How to make oat bird cake

How to make hummingbird food.

, If there is food left over after the day's feeding, then you're probably overfeeding the birds. Reduce the amount you're leaving out each day, making sure that all of the seed is consumed.


To avoid the chances of leftover food or food sitting about too long, note the times that the birds prefer feeding and target the placement of new food at these times (also note the increased needs during the breeding season). The birds will soon grow used to your routine matching theirs.

Keep your property clean.,
Kick them out of their roosting sites.,
Buy ""bird strips"" for your house.,
Use a ""scare pigeon"".,
Obtain a pigeon trap.,
Place some bait.,
Place your trap.,
Set your trap.,
Keep some pigeons in the trap.,
Drive a long distance and set the birds free.,
Kill the birds using a gun.,
Use bird-controlling poison.",How to Trap Pigeons," Pigeons are natural scavengers who thrive off the waste that humans leave behind.


If you maintain a clean property, free of food scraps and loose fruit and vegetation, you are decreasing the chance that pigeons will roost by your home or apartment building.
While this may not prevent the pigeons from occasionally traveling through, they probably won't be sticking around long.
Make sure you have trash cans and/or dumpsters that can close. This will keep pigeons and other pests away.;
, Place fence or netting around the areas where pigeons roost. Placing these types or netting and wire around the ledges and perches of your property will effectively encourage pigeons to set up shop elsewhere.
Before they set up residence, you can cover ledges and other roosting spots with sheet metal. Set this at an angle as it will be difficult for pigeons to roost on a slope.
You can also prevent pigeons from roosting with bird netting. This will keep pigeons at bay without harming them.
Place bird netting around trees and barn rafters.

, These are rows of small spikes that prevent pigeons from congregating and roosting. These strips of spikes. are placed around the perimeter of large buildings.
They are spaced out specifically to prevent pigeons from resting and roosting on roofs and fences.
These are relatively inexpensive and humane.

, These are essentially the equivalent of scarecrows, but designed for pigeons. These come in many different forms, from fake owls to flying model hawks.
Pigeons may get used to a model owl sitting in one place for a long period of time.
The most effective kind are model hawks attached to a kite with streamers. These will move in the wind and trick pigeons into thinking a predator is near.

, These are typically in the form of large cages with a single door.
There are some more elaborate types of traps but simple ones are relatively inexpensive.
You can usually trap multiple pigeons in a single trap.

, Do this in an area where you plan to place your pigeon trap.Let the pigeons feed off it for a few days.
The pigeons will become used to feeding there and will continue to return to the area.
Once the pigeons return continually for a few days you can place a trap.

, Do this where you've been placing bait or where they roost.Leave the door open at first. Don't set the trap.
You will want the pigeons to get used to the trap's presence in their feeding or roosting area.
Place some bait inside the trap in the meantime to get the pigeons used to going inside of it. Cracked corn works best.

, Do this once a large hoard of pigeons has assembled. You will want to trap as many as possible at once.
Make sure to put in fresh bait regularly.
Make sure the trap is secure where you've placed it.

, Once you've trapped them, the presence of the birds will lure other pigeons to the area. It will be easier to trap more pigeons if they keep coming to the area.
Remember to continually refresh the bait in your trap.
Be careful when dealing with live birds or going near their roosting area.

, You won't want to let them go on your own property or they will just roost again in the same spot.This will only really work well if your pigeons have only recently roosted on your property.
Pigeons that have been in a place for a long time will find their way back, even from a distance.
Contrary to opinion, pigeons are very intelligent and can find their way back to a roost from very far distances.
The best combination of methods is to use preventatives like netting and bird strips as well as traps to get rid of a pigeon problem.

, Killing the pigeons should only be a last resort when all humane methods have failed. You don't want to unnecessarily harm an animal.


Only use a gun in a rural area away from other homes. There will likely be local ordinances on this in more crowded areas.
While pigeons are not always a standard in rural areas, they are not wholly uncommon.
If you have annoying pigeons on your large property, it will be easy to shoot and kill pigeons with a low caliber gun like a .22 caliber rifle.
Because pigeons have, over time, developed a tolerance for humans and are rarely scared in their presence, it should not be very difficult to get a good shot.

, Again, this should only be done as a last resort as it is inhumane.


Bird poison can hurt other animals, so be careful if you or your neighbors have pets. Be aware of other non-threatening wildlife in your area as well.
By baiting and poisoning pigeons, you can easily eliminate them.
How to dispose of a large number of dead pigeons is a big concern and poison is inhumane, so only poison pigeons as a last resort.
Try all preventative and humane methods before resorting to this.

Decide how much you’re willing to spend.,
Build a home for your pigeons before they arrive.,
Locate a breeder or seller and order your pigeons.,
Introduce your pigeons to their new home.,
Take good care of your pigeons.",How to Train a Homing Pigeon1," You should purchase the highest quality birds that you can afford. It is better to purchase a smaller number of pairs of a higher quality, than a larger number of pairs of a lower quality. You should buy pigeons in pairs, unless you’re buying a very specific pigeon of a particular pedigree.


If you’re buying the pigeons for the purpose of racing, base your buying decision on performance before anything else. This can include the performance of the specific pigeons you’re purchasing, the performance of the family line (i.e pedigree), or even the performance of the breed.If you’re buying the pigeons for show purposes, or you just want really cool looking pigeons, then you’ll want to base your buying decision on conformation. For show purposes, judges pick winning pigeons based on a certain list of physical characteristics.Homing pigeons can cost anywhere from approximately $50 up to several hundred dollars, depending on the pedigree and breeder.Keep in mind that in addition to the cost of the pigeons, you must also pay the cost of shipping. And because you’re shipping live animals, shipping can be quite expensive, depending on where you’re ordering from.;
, Your pigeons are going to need a place to live the minute they arrive at your door, so be prepared. Pigeon homes are referred to as lofts and lofts can come in a variety of sizes and configurations. You can build your own, hire someone to build one for your, or order one pre-made. Each pair of pigeons should have approximately 8-10 cubic feet of space inside the loft - so the space you have available for a loft might also dictate the maximum number of pigeons you can have.Some of the most important things to remember about a loft is that it should: protect your pigeons from predators (including the neighbourhood cat), have both interior and exterior (protected) space for the birds, have an excellent ventilation system, and have additional space for feed and equipment (you don’t want to store this stuff outside). If you’re breeding your pigeons, you will also need to separate out a space just for them and their eventual offspring.Pigeon lofts need to be located in an area somewhat free of aerial obstructions. Remember, your pigeons fly, so wires, trees, lamp posts, etc., can be a distraction for your pigeons when you’re trying to train them.Racing pigeon lofts should be designed so the birds don’t spend a lot of time on the roof. This means the roof should not be flat, if possible, and might need bird spikes to help deter your pigeons from landing., Pigeon breeders and sellers are located around the world. If you’re concerned about the cost of shipping your pigeons, you’ll probably want to choose a breeder located as close to you as possible. Otherwise you’ll want to choose a breeder based on pigeon performance and pedigree.Most breeders band their pigeons when they’re young, so this is not something you’ll have to do once you receive your pigeon.Ask for recommendations from a local pigeon club if you’re unsure as to the reputation of a breeder.

, If these are your first pigeons, then you can put them in the loft right away without a problem. However, if you’re adding new pigeons to your collection, you’ll need to keep them separated from your existing pigeons for a couple of weeks., Your pigeons need clean water everyday. Their food should be consumed within 15-20 minutes of you giving it to them. After 15-20 minutes cleanup and remove anything they haven’t eaten. They’ll also need grit to ingest, which helps them obtain vitamin and minerals, and assists with digestion.You’ll need to feed your pigeons (using the 15-20 minute technique) twice per day.


Remember to clean your loft on a regular basis, especially the floor.
There are several bird-specific online stores located around the United States that specialize in pigeon care. Their level of experience will be helpful if you’re new to the world of pigeons.Pigeons will require more protein if they’re breeding, but more energy (i.e. fat and carbohydrates) when their racing. The protein amounts contained in the feed should be listed on the bag. For breeding season you should feed them a 16-18% crude protein mix. For racing and training season you should feed them a 14-15% crude protein mix. When you pigeons are molting, in the off season, you’ll want to feed them the 16% crude protein mix again.
While all veterinarians have learned to care for birds as part of their training, not all veterinarians will take care of birds on a regular basis. If you already have a vet whom you trust, and they feel confident they can treat your pigeons, great. If not, ask for recommendations or referrals to a bird-specific vet in your area. You can also ask for referrals from a local pigeon racing club, or pigeon rescue organization.

Look for a bird feeder which is easy to fill, does not have sharp edges, and is easy to clean.,
Provide large or ground feeding birds with ""platform feeders."",
Choose a tube feeder if you want to feed small birds.,
Let hummingbirds feed from nectar feeders.,
Keep suet in suet feeders.,
Choose a hopper feeder for a decorative look.",How to Feed Wild Birds2," In addition, you want to make sure that it keeps seeds protected from rain and has correct drainage.


Keep in mind while you are shopping for a bird feeder what kind of seed you want to put out. Make sure the feeder you choose can dispense the bird seed you intend on feeding.
Make sure that the feeder you choose is sturdy and will not be damaged if it falls. Bird feeders can really take a beating, especially from squirrels, so buy one that is strong and made of quality materials, so that you don't have to replace it quickly.

, A platform, or tray, feeder is a tray with a roof above it, and holes in the sides or bottom for drainage. Hang platform feeders on trees or poles, at least twelve inches above the ground. Birds attracted by platform feeders include sparrows, doves, jays, and cardinals.


Platform feeders are best suited to fruit eating birds. Cutting up grapes, apples, or pomegranates and putting them on a platform helps to attract fruit eating birds. However, be sure to put the fruit out fresh. Also remove it once it is no longer moist as it will attract vermin., Tube feeders are designed with short perches and large holes; the former is so small birds can feed without being intimidated by larger birds and the latter is so they can feed on large seeds such as sunflower seeds. Hang tube feeders from trees or porch leaves, or set them on high, flat surfaces.

, With a tubular shape and small holes, nectar feeders are designed for hummingbirds. Clean nectar feeders frequently to ensure scrupulous hygiene. Since you'll need to clean frequently, choose a container that is easy to take apart and clean.


Sugar solution does not just feed birds, it also encourages bacterial growth. In order for the birds not to ingest infected nectar, it's important to change it regularly and clean the feeder. In cool temperatures (below 70 F) once a week is sufficient, but if the temperature is above 90 F, you need to clean the feeder and change the solution daily., Suet feeders, which are square wire cages, are designed for feeding suet. Birds can hold onto the cages as they eat the suet. Having more than one in your yard is recommended to avoid conflict between larger and smaller birds.


If you have dripping or lard leftover from cooking, small pieces of it can be stuck onto clean upright nails or similar items along fence tops for the birds to alight near and peck at. Do not use rusty nails or objects and don't have any sharp ends poking out.
For birds such as Woodpeckers, consider rubbing suet on the bark of a tree, which will help attract them to your garden.Many suet eating birds don't like to feel exposed, so positioning the feeder near the cover of trees is a great way of helping them to feel at home. Woodpeckers like to store their food in tree crevices and enjoy eating on high branches, but will move to lower ground if necessary.If the suet starts to smell strongly or gets moldy, the chances are it has gone rancid. Birds can get sick from moldy suet, so throw it away!, With an appearance similar to a tiny house, hopper feeders can hold a variety of seeds and can have perches to suit small and large birds. However, hopper feeders are favorites of squirrels, and extra protection is necessary to keep them out.

Choose the right location for viewing.,
Choose the right location for the birds.,
Mount the bird feeder.",How to Feed Wild Birds3," Since you'll want to watch birds as they feed, setting up the bird feeder next to a window in a room you're frequently in is recommended. Keeping the feeder within three feet of a nearby window will also prevent birds from accidentally colliding into the window.

, Pick a location that provides protection from the wind. Though some feeders do not need this, pole-mounted feeders will sway if exposed to high winds.


Also keep the feeder near trees and bushes. These provide a place for the bird to hide if predators come too close, something birds are constantly mindful of.
Ensure that predators such as your beloved cat or dog cannot get to the feeder. Place your feeder in a location that your pets cannot get to.
When feeding nectar eating birds such as hummingbirds, mount the feeder in the shade and the sugar solution will stay fresher for longer. Whilst you can put the feeder in the full sun, be aware you need to change the nectar more often to avoid it becoming contaminated with bacteria. , There are different ways to mount bird feeders and this largely depends of the type of feeder you are using. The feeder can be hung from a shepherd’s hook, mounted to a post, hung from a tree, set on a stable, or flat surface. Certain feeders even attach to windows, giving you a close-up look at the birds.


Remember to follow the mounting instructions accompanying the design you've purchased. If you made your own bird feeder, be sure to mount your feeder securely.

Keep away unwanted birds.,
Keep away insects.,
Keep away predators.,
Keep away mice and rats.,
Keep squirrels away.,
Be careful about encouraging fruit-eating birds to the garden if you're growing fruit for your own consumption.",How to Feed Wild Birds4," Your feed and feeders will influence what birds come to your yard; for example, if you want to keep away Brown-headed Cowbirds and House Sparrows, avoid white proso millet. If you prefer smaller birds, choose feeders (such as tube feeders), which larger birds cannot use.

, The sugar rich nectar offered to nectar-eaters is highly attractive to insects, such as ants or bees. Using a hanging hummingbird feeder (rather than a window mounted device) can help, or chose a feeder with a built in ant guard, which stops the ants travelling down to the nectar.


Be wary of using other methods such as applying vaseline or sticky agents, because there is a risk of injuring the birds you are feeding by soiling the birds' feathers and reducing their ability to fly.
Bees are more of a problem to deter because they fly. The best remedy is to take care when filling the feeder so there are not splashes of sugary solution to attract the bees in the first place.Never use insecticides to kill ants or other insects. Different types of birds eat different things, and what might be good for a Hummingbird could be very bad news for a different type of bird, such as a Woodpecker, which eats ants., Choose a tube feeder or other small feeder which birds of prey cannot access. Keep the feeder near a native shrub with dense foliage that can offer protection from attacking predators.


Think carefully about putting out food for birds, if you own outdoor cats or there are a lot of cats in the neighborhood. By attracting the birds to feeder, you may inadvertently set up a buffet for the cats.

, Mice and rats are often attracted by discarded seed, and minimizing the amount of discarded seed will keep mice and rats away. To do so, choose seeds (such as black-oil sunflower seeds) that birds in your area enjoy and eat quickly, add a seed catcher tray to the base of a tube feeder, or feed entirely different feed.


Also remove food that is dried out and no longer attractive to birds. It may still be a tasty treat for vermin., Consider using a baffle, a dome-shaped piece of plastic that can be placed under or over the bird feeder, or a squirrel repellent that will not hurt the birds, such as one that contains cayenne pepper. Hang your feeder at least four feet above the ground. If the feeder is hanging from a tree, hang it as far away from the trunk as possible. If the feeder is mounted on a pole, keep the pole away from trees or structures.


See also How to stop squirrels from eating your bird food.

, You may find they'll eat your fruit too! Consider using bird netting one your precious fruit trees and bushes so that you can both live in harmony.


Grow native food plants to attract the native birds to your garden and to discourage them from eating human food crops. This should also work well for saving water in your garden and lowering the intensity of your gardening work, as native plants thrive best in their local environment.
Avoid feeding birds problem plants. The birds will spread these when excreting the seeds, causing invasive plant problems well beyond your garden.

Start your pigeons’ training program when they’re 6 weeks old.,
Ensure your pigeons have incentive to return to their loft.,
Begin training your pigeons to come home after being released.,
Expand the training distance by 5 miles per week.,
Be careful of bird loss.,
Create a second “home” for your pigeons.",How to Train a Homing Pigeon2," At 6 weeks you can help your pigeons figure out the trapdoor in your pigeon loft. The trapdoor is designed to allow your pigeons to get into the loft anytime they want, but you’ll be able to set the trapdoor to only let them out when you want.These trapdoors might be a little confusing to your pigeons at first, so you might have to help them go in and out at first.It may be helpful to put together a training schedule so you have something specific to follow everyday. Training requires dedication on your part, so knowing what you have to be ready for each day will help keep the training consistent.The training schedule should allow for training to occur at least once a day, and either the method or distance being worked on should change once a week. For example: everyday during week 1 practice going in and out of the trap door with the pigeon; everyday during week 2 practice returning to the loft from 1 mile away; etc.
Read pigeon club blogs - specifically ones written from your geographical area. Local blogs will have advice on your specific geography and climate.

, Good food, comfortable lodgings and being treated like royalty is what makes your pigeons want to come back.Provide your pigeons with the highest quality food and lodgings you can afford.

, This part of the training can begin when your pigeons are between 6 and 8 weeks old.Start by taking your pigeons 1 mile from home and releasing them. Do this several times a week.Use a cage or a basket to carry your pigeons to the release location.

, Each week go further away from home to release your pigeons, and go in different directions each time.Don’t expand the distance too far, too fast. If your pigeons have any trouble, stop increasing the distance and continue training them at the last distance they were successful.
Some of the longest pigeon races are several hundred miles in a single flight. This is the maximum distance from home that you should practice with your pigeon, but do not go to these distances until your pigeon is able to return from shorter distances, in any direction, consistently.

, Bird loss is unfortunate, but not uncommon. If you experience bird loss, reduce the training distance and frequency for a while.For example, if you were training at the 10 mile distance, reduce back to 5 miles for several weeks.


Pigeon clubs all have lost bird reporting processes that you can take advantage of if you lose a bird. People who find lost birds can report those birds (using their leg bands) on these websites. You can then contact the finder and arrange to have your bird brought home.
Some pigeons might simply get tired on their return journey and need time to rest. While they may normally come back to the loft in one day, it may take them a few days to return if they've stopped for a break.

, In addition to training your pigeons to return to your home loft, you can train them to fly between two loft locations (maybe your home and your cottage, or your home and a friend’s home, etc.). Feed your pigeons at both lofts periodically, to give them incentive to want to return to each loft. If they’re at one loft and are hungry, they’ll fly to the other loft to look for food."

Find a local pigeon racing club and join.,
Attend racing events and observe.,
Get advice from existing pigeon racers.,
Enter your pigeons in racing events.,
Race your pigeons.",How to Train a Homing Pigeon3," The American Racing Pigeon Union (ARPU) is the national organization for pigeon racing. They have hundreds of affiliated clubs around the United States. Most homing pigeons, when purchased from an American breeder, will come banded with an ARPU band. Use the ARPU’s “Find a Club” link on their website to locate the nearest club to you.The ARPU has a number of different memberships available, including junior memberships (for kids under 18), family memberships, and memberships for people interested in pigeon racing, but unable to participate.You will have to be an active member of the ARPU before you can join a local club.

, Using your local club’s website, Facebook page, or newsletter, you can determine when that club will be hosting races throughout the year. Races are normally divided between “young birds” and “old birds”.


You may also want to consider attending the American Racing Pigeon Union’s annual convention, if you have the time and funds. The ARPU’s convention is held in a different location each year.The convention usually includes a race.

, The ARPU offers a “Help-a-Beginner” Program which is for those who have only flown in one racing season and would like some assistance or advice on how to be a better pigeon racer. Beginners are matched with mentors and breeders and work together throughout the season., Once you’re a member of a local club, you’ll be able to enter your pigeons in races. Check with your club to determine the best race for beginners - which would usually be a shorter race. Try racing different pigeons in different races to see how they perform.


Note that the “Help-a-Beginner” program doesn’t allow beginners who have raced more than one season to participate. Therefore, if you’re interested in this program make sure to apply after your first racing season., Pigeons race from a specific location (as determined by the race organizers) to their home loft (i.e. your house). The organization will determine the actual distance between the release point and your home loft, and that distance, plus the time the pigeon took to travel, will be used to calculate speed.And the fastest pigeon wins!

 Let the cocks out to free exercise for an hour four to five mornings and two or more evenings per week.,
Keep calm.,
Give medication.",How to Use the Widowhood System to Train Homing Pigeons," They are left with the hens for two hours after a short race up to overnight on a long race. After week three, just open next boxes for 15 minutes before crating for the race. Remove the cocks that are not racing before the hens are brought in. Toss the cocks that did not race to the hens in the morning or place the cocks that did not race back in the loft once the hens have been removed for the day.

, This is the day to feed for the race. On that afternoon if shipping is next day, feed all they want of a mixture of 20% barley, 70% European mix and 10% safflower/hemp/flaxseed. ;
, Feed ¼ ounce per bird safflower/hemp/flaxseed about 1:00 pm. Never feed too late into the afternoon or they may dehydrate. Water is always fresh with nothing added day of shipping.

, The bath relaxes the birds and helps them stay calm all night on the truck, plus it brings on form. Skip the bath if rain is predicted.  

, After short distance races, feed half European mix half depurative mix on day of return to build back reserves. Sunday through Wednesday 100 % depurative, Thursday morning 75% depurative, 25% European. Thursday afternoon, see the pre-shipping step above.


On the day of return, one gallon of water must contain 1 tablespoon glucose, ¼ teaspoon vitamins and electrolytes (any brand made for chickens will do), ¼ teaspoon iodized salt along with a good friendly bacteria.

, For long distance races 400 miles and above, feed the birds 50% depurative and 50% European mix Saturday through Tuesday. Feed mornings and evenings. Wednesday and Thursday, with Thursday being day of shipping feed 50% European mix and 50%  safflower, hemp, rape and flax mix. 


Feed the birds all they want then pull extra feed out.    
Vitamins and electrolytes on Wednesday with fresh clear water on Thursday.
Pigeons should get vitamins and electrolytes on the day of return and the day before shipping.

, For one feeding mix one ½ to one tablespoon flaxseed oil (buy at health food store) on grain and add brewers yeast, Belgium pink minerals, whey protein natural or vanilla flavor and 1/8th teaspoon of iodized salt.


Grit should be in front of pigeons at all times. Plus one little pot of Belgium pink minerals, one little pot of brown mineral block, one little pot of oyster shells and one pot of mixed commercial grit.  

, Let the cocks come home and spend over night with the hens. The following week, bring in the hens 24 hours before shipping. Put in nest bowls and nesting material. Ship the cocks and let them spend over night with the hens when they return. Now, go back to regular widowhood. They will be in great form and mentally be ready again.  

,


Week three, put in only one really good hen before shipping.
Week four, put in bowls for the first time.
Week five nothing, just crate and ship.
Week six add one strange cock to the widow loft for one hour before shipping.
Week seven bring in hens 24 hours before, see above.


Always have well fed hens waiting for cocks to return from race.







, Feed rich European mix the day the hens will see the cocks. You do not want them to think about eating when the cocks come home. Feed the widow hens barley five days per week. Not really heavy, keep them a little hungry. Treat hens with same medications at the same times as the cocks.  Do not let them re-infect cocks. If hens mate up, do not use them for the cocks. No hen or sharing of a hen is better than a mated hen. Use stock hens that have been separated to add spark. Use yearling hens, they mate less.  

, Use your judgment on how they act. If they are acting great, then pool them.  

, You can give a toss to cocks that did not race on the day of the race if needed. Toss one long toss (70 miles) mid-week for the first month of the race season. If they have raced 300 miles or above they can go two weeks without being raced or tossed. They will get all they need around the loft.  


Do not have the hens waiting when they return from a mid week toss. Seeing the hens too much causes a loss of form.

, Do not go in loft while birds are resting. You must do all loft chores while they are out exercising. Widowers just eat, exercise and rest. This is the name of the game. No disturbances!


The loft should be comfortable and warm. No open areas that cause the birds to fear something outside. Keep moisture out and dryness in by closing loft down on cold or rainy days.  

, A good sound health program must be followed with canker and respiratory medications given every other week Sunday afternoon, Monday and Tuesday. Rotate the two and use different drugs each cycle. 

For example, rotate flagyl, ridzol and emtryl for canker.Rotate, suanovil and doxycycline for respiratory.Baycox for coccidiosis if needed or much dampness and rain is going on for an extended period.Using different drugs each cycle helps fight resistance to the drug.
Worm the birds around week six or seven.

Consider the commitment.,
Purchase cages.,
Purchase food.,
Find a pigeon.",How to Keep a Single Pigeon1," Because pigeons are social animals, keeping a single one is only recommended if you're sure you can offer enough time and companionship to keep your pigeon happy.


You should also consult local regulations to verify that you are permitted to keep pigeons.There are many different breeds of pigeons and their respective social needs vary considerably. However, you should be able to set aside some time every day to help socialize your pigeon.;
, You should have indoor accommodations for your pigeon and, if at all possible, outside accommodations as well. It is important that you prepare these ahead of time. It will be disconcerting to the pigeon to relocate it without providing it with a new home immediately. Clean all cages before your pigeon arrives.


An ideal indoor cage is rectangular and partially enclosed. Be sure that there are no holes in the cage long enough for the pigeon to stick its head through. Because pigeons like to walk, the bottom of the cage should be covered with paper or grassy sod. Keep the cage in a bright area but not one with direct sunlight. If the cage is in a place liable to be exposed to light at night, you should cover the cage during the evening.
An outdoor aviary should be approximately 6’ square and 8’ high. Include shelves for nesting, including one as high as possible in the enclosure. The enclosure should be sturdy enough to protect against outside predators. If possible the aviary should be oriented toward the south or southwest, allowing for maximum sunlight.include in the housing a bath that the bird can use to clean itself.
Certain breeds are adapted to free flight. You can provide them with a “dovecote,” which is a small structure that can be attached to the side of your house. Be aware, however, that your bird could be hunted by predators if permitted to fly freely., There are a variety of mixes that are designed for pigeons and doves. Pelleted diets are the best source of nutrients. Seed diets and other commercial mixes will require more supplementation.


You can supplement the pigeons regular diet with lettuce, endive, chickweed, spinach, berries, apple, and pears.
Providing the pigeon with grit and gravel will help it digest its food.
Pet stores also sell vitamins and calcium supplements for birds that can help improve your pigeons health., Online you can find databases of local breeders.. Some locations also have issues with abandoned pigeons. That means you should be able find them at the local animal shelter.Either way, you should ask about the breed of pigeon and care specifications, because different breeds vary considerably in terms of needs and behavior.


it is recommended that you meet a few pigeons beforehand to check for allergies, and make sure they meet your expectations. Judge whether or not the shelter is clean and the pigeons well cared for. If the pigeons are not well cared for, it might be difficult to socialize them."

Slide your hand under the pigeon.,
Let the pigeon's legs slide between your fingers.,
Wrap your thumb around the pigeon's wings.,
Bring the bird close to you.",How to Hold a Pigeon1," When you are picking up a pigeon, you will be using your dominant hand to do so. You will need to hold your hand flat, keep your palm up, and have a slight gap between your index and middle fingers. This will allow you to safely and securely pick up your pigeon., Once you have your hand positioned correctly, you will need to slide it underneath the pigeon. Move your hand towards the pigeon slowly as you go to pick it up. Moving too quickly may scare it and cause it to fly away from your hand.You will move your hand towards your pigeon's side.
The pigeon should be facing the outer edge of your hand.
The pigeon's tail feather should be facing your thumb.

, Begin by moving your hand underneath your pigeon. As you do, keep a small gap between your pointer and middle fingers to allow space for your pigeon's legs. This will both support and secure the pigeon in your hand.The pigeon's legs should gently rest between your fingers.
Don't hold the legs or the pigeon too tightly.
Ideally, your pigeon will be in its cage when you try to pick it up.

, After the pigeon is in your hand and its legs are between your fingers, you can grasp the bird with your thumb. Bring your thumb down, covering the wings. Keeping its wings secure will help keep your pigeon safe and prevent it from flying away.Don't hold the wings down tightly.
The wings should rest flatly on the pigeon's back.

, After you've gotten a good hold on your pigeon, you can move it towards your body. Bringing it closer to your body will help it feel secure and will allow you to support and hold it safely.You can cup the bird with your other hand to provide even more security.
Move the pigeon slowly to avoid scaring it.

Younger birds will only ever be familiar with you and your space, and they shouldn’t have to overcome any bad experiences with previous owners. Mature domesticated pigeons should eventually learn to trust you as well, but they may require a little more time and patience., Pigeons are extremely social birds who need constant companionship. If your pigeons choose to court and mate, they’ll be together for life. Plan on keeping at least two birds. If you have room, consider creating a small flock of four to six pigeons.If you end up with a mated pair, you may need to keep the pigeons from breeding. Female pigeons lay eggs every month. Once they’ve laid two eggs, remove the eggs and replace them with warmed-up wooden eggs. Both pigeons will continue to lay on the wooden eggs until they realize they won’t hatch. Destroy the real eggs by leaving them outside for other animals to eat. This process will need to be repeated each month., There are many domesticated pigeons without homes located at animal or bird shelters and rescues. While adopting may not allow you to choose the exact age or breed of pigeon that you’d like, you’ll be helping out a bird in need. Adoption is also a generally less expensive option than purchasing birds through breeders.Most adoption services will cover any initial vet bills. They sometimes also allow you to foster your birds to see if you make a good match.
Adopting may provide you with birds that either require more time before they’re tamed, or that never become fully comfortable being touched or handled by you. Be ready to spend lots of time building trust.

, Find reputable breeders by contacting them directly. Ask how long the breeder has been operating, and see if they’d be willing to send photos of their facility to make sure their birds are well treated. Breeders can allow you to choose younger birds, or racing, homing, and other types of unique pigeons. They’ll also be able to provide you with a pair of birds that’s used to spending lots of time with people.Birds from breeders may be ready to be handled more quickly than rescued birds. However, they’ll likely cost more than rescued birds.

, If you find a lost or injured wild pigeon, take the bird to a wildlife rescue that won’t kill the bird. While wild pigeons may eventually become comfortable as pets, they’ll likely never be as tame as domesticated pigeons. It’s also not fair to the wild bird to prevent it from enjoying its previous lifestyle.Before you take the pigeon to the rescue, call the facility to be sure they’re prepared to care for and then safely release the pigeon. You can find a map of bird-safe rescues located in the United States here: http://www.pigeonrescue.org/resources/some-pigeon-dove-friendly-rescues-in-the-us/


, Unlike indoor birds who can be let of of their cages, outdoor pigeons will be spending all of their time inside the aviary to keep them safe from predators. For 2-4 birds, create a 7-foot (2.13-m) by 4-foot (1.22-m) space that’s at least 6-7 feet (1.83-2.13 m) high.Make a solid, sloped roof to keep out the weather and provide a “attic” for roosting. You may want to leave a small area of the roof exposed to the elements by covering it just with your wildlife-proof mesh. This will brighten up your aviary and allow your pigeons to play in the rain.
Enclose the sides of the aviary in wildlife-proof mesh with with openings of an half-inch (1.27 cm) or less.
Pigeons prefer long, rectangular spaces that make it easier for them to fly around. Avoid circles or hexagons.
Note that some larger types of pigeons, such as King Pigeons, require outdoor aviaries.

, Line your aviary floor with cement and 1.5-inch (3.81-cm) drain rock. A covering of drain rock will make it simple for you to clean your aviary. You’ll need to clean pigeon poop off cement or wooden floors daily, while drain rock can be hosed down or raked every week or so. The rocks and pebbles need to be larger than 1.5 inches (3.81 cm) to keep your birds from swallowing them.A cement floor is crucial for keeping out digging predators. If you can’t lay down cement, line the floor with hardware mesh with openings of an half-inch (1.27 cm) or less. Your mesh will need to be covered with earth or drain rock to protect your birds’ feet.

, Place your aviary in a spot where it can benefit from plenty of sunshine, as pigeons love the light. Since pigeons do coo and make some noise, ask your neighbors where they’d be most comfortable with the aviary. This will keep you from becoming your neighbors’ new worst enemy., Two birds require a cage that’s no smaller than 42 inches (106.68 cm) wide, 27 inches (65.58 cm) deep, and 30 inches (76.2 cm) high. Cover the bottom of the cage with a pigeon-friendly and easy-to-clean liner, such as a plastic or yoga mat that’s cut to size. Widely-spaced bars will work for cages in homes without other pets, but you’ll need thinly-spaced bars that keep out snouts and teeth if you have other furry critters in your home., Pigeons have poor vision in low light, and indoor spaces will always be dimmer than the outdoors. Locate your cage in an area that gets plenty of sunshine and that receives additional lighting from a mounted fluorescent-tube light. Keep the cage away from the kitchen to prevent the birds from inhaling any damaging cooking fumes, and don’t smoke, light candles, or use air fresheners inside your home.


Be sure to avoid cooking with Teflon or non-stick pots and pans, as these give off toxic fumes that could injure or kill your birds.If you can’t mount a fluorescent-tube light in the room where your birdcage is located, place a fluorescent lamp near, but not directly next to your birdcage., Most birds will need about a week to get used to their new space. Keep their environment quiet during this time, and ensure that you and everyone else in your family give the birds the time and space they need during this adjustment period. Keep pets away from the cage or aviary to avoid traumatizing your new birds.It may be a good idea to keep young children away from your new pigeons during the first week or so. Children may not fully understand why they have be quiet or calm around the birds, and this may cause the birds to think they’re predators.

, As your pigeons get used to you and their new home, it’s important that they don’t become scared of you. Keep your hands behind your back whenever you approach the cage, and avoid sudden movements. Speak, sing, or coo softly to the birds to comfort them and make them familiar with the sound of your voice., As your birds begin to become more comfortable with your presence, spend more time with them. If your birds are still hiding or cowering when you’re near their enclosure, give them more time. If not, study or read next to their cage or aviary for a few hours each day., Reach through the bars or wire mesh of the birds’ cage or aviary to provide treats. At first, simply place the treats on the ground. This will let the birds know that you’re a source of food and care. Slowly, the birds should begin to take treats directly from your hands.Stay outside of their enclosure the first few times you do this. The security of the cage or aviary will let the bird know they’re safe. Once they’ve eaten out of your hands a few times, either open the cage door or let yourself into the aviary to feed them more directly.

, Once your indoor birds are responding to your presence and eating out of your hand, they’re probably ready to be allowed out of their cage. Indoor birds need to spend time outside of their enclosure daily to keep their minds and bodies healthy, so start this process as soon as you feel the birds are ready.If you’re worried about getting pigeon poop in your house, use pigeon diapers, also known as pigeon pants. They’re adorable and practical.
Do not clip your birds’ wings to keep them from flying. This inhumane practice won’t prevent your birds from flying away if they get outside.
Do not let outdoor birds out of their aviaries. While indoor birds can be allowed to safely roam around inside your house, it’s not safe for outdoor birds to be released from their cages. Instead, spend time taming your outdoor birds inside their enclosure.

, Neither indoor or outdoor pigeons should be let outside for free flights. Once they’re domesticated, they’re extremely vulnerable to attacks from predators. Pigeons protect themselves in flocks in the wild, and your pair or small group of birds will be unable to do this. Your birds also may not be able to find their way back to your home if they fly too far away., Allow your birds to set the pace of your relationship. Rather than reaching for the birds or picking them up, let them hop into your hands or climb onto your shoulder. This will keep the birds from getting scared of you, which could cause setbacks in the taming process. Eventually, your birds should become affectionate and playful., Other animals pose a constant threat to your pigeons. Beyond ensuring that you’ve set up a cage or aviary that can fully protect your pigeons from pets and predators, be extremely careful when you close your birdcage or aviary. Use a carabiner to secure outdoor aviary locks, and zip-ties for indoor cages. This will keep the birds in, and pesky creatures out., Birds need spaces and tools to both rest and play. Pigeons use shelves for lounging and perches for sitting and watching the world go by. A mirror will act as a sort of television for your birds, as they’ll recognize themselves in the surface and watch their own movements.Outdoor birds will also need nesting boxes to keep them warm and dry during wet or cold weather.

, Pigeons thoroughly enjoy bathing and playing in water. Place a large ceramic casserole dish or plant saucer filled with clean water in their aviary or cage. Change the water weekly, or whenever you notice that it’s dirty.Healthy birds are very conscious of their cleanliness, so if your bird isn’t bathing, they may not be feeling well. Mist your bird with water and see if having damp feathers inspires them to bathe. If not, contact your vet.

, It’s very important for pigeons to stay hydrated. Your birds should have constant access to clean water in bowls that won’t tip over when they use them. Provide ceramic bowls filled with water, and change the water daily., Start by providing 2 tablespoons (28.36 g) per bird of pigeon-appropriate bird feed each morning. Check if any is left the next morning, and decrease by a small amount of feed each day until you’ve found the measurement of feed that your bird can fully consume in 24 hours. You should also provide a small bowl of chopped-up carrots, broccoli, snap peas, kale, cauliflower, and/or lettuce 3-4 times per week.Good-quality pigeon or dove feeds will contain a mixture of safflower seeds, crushed oyster shells, bird-safe grits, and a few other seeds and grains.

Keep the pigeon indoors at first.,
Bond with your pigeon.,
Allow your pigeon to explore your house.,
Move your pigeon outside.,
Get your pigeon a mate.",How to Keep a Single Pigeon2," When you first purchase your pigeon, it's recommended that you keep it indoors, because this will help you bond with it. Because the pigeon doesn’t have any companions, it is important that you be in close proximity to provide company.Your kitchen is not a suitable room to keep your pigeon because pigeons are the fumes given off by non-stick frying pans are toxic to them.

, For the first few days, allow the pigeon to adjust - don't touch him, but talk frequently and stay nearby the cage. Slowly build up to petting the pigeon gently., Allow him to come out of the crate, preferably in an enclosed space such as a small room. If you repeat this daily, your pigeon will become calmer, and eventually you will be able to handle it. Spend time every day handling your pigeon; this will allow you to bond.Pigeons can carry diseases that can be transmitted to people such as psittacosis. So if you or someone in your house has a weak immune system, consider checking in with your physician to make sure it is OK to share the same air space as a pigeon.
Washing your hands after handling the pigeon because pigeons are associated with carrying salmonella.
Do not keep pigeons in close proximity to cats and dogs., Pigeons can live inside, but they enjoy living outside even more. It's recommended you build an enclosure to keep your pigeon in. Consult with the breeder as to whether your pigeon is capable of free flight., Pigeons are monogamous and will mate with a significant other for life. However, they can also be territorial. To prevent confrontations, introduce the pigeons to one another slowly, keeping one inside to acclimate to its surroundings and become comfortable."
"
Bond with your pigeon.,
Remove distractions.,
Don't force interactions.",How to Hold a Pigeon2," The more familiar your pigeon is with your presence, the more likely it will be comfortable with you holding it. Make sure you take the time to build a strong bond between you and your pigeon before trying to hold it.Spend as much time around your pigeon as you can.
Try to gently speak with your pigeon throughout the day.
Always act calmly when near your pigeon.

, A calm pigeon will be more likely to allow you to hold it. Before you attempt to pick your pigeon up and hold it, you will want to make sure it is calm. Keeping a relaxed environment will help keep your pigeon calm and make it feel more comfortable with you picking it up.Don't try to pick your pigeon up in a noisy environment.
Make sure there aren't other pets trying to investigate the pigeon.
Try not to have other people around when you are interacting with your pigeon.

, Pushing any interaction with a bird will only make it stressed and break any sense of trust or bond it has with you. Never force your pigeon to let you hold it, allowing it to decide when it feels comfortable with your actions.If your pigeon becomes uneasy, stop for a while and let it relax.
A nervous pigeon may flap its wings quickly and try to escape.
Birds that are scared will often hold their feathers tight against their body.
Very frightened birds will hiss at you and try to bite, spreading their wings out while doing so.

Capture the pigeon.,
Find a safe place for them to rest.,
Offer them food and water.,
Identify a possible owner.,
Take the pigeon to professional help.",How to Hold a Pigeon3," The first step in helping a lost or injured pigeon is to capture it safely. The method you use will depend on what condition the bird might be in. Take a look at the following methods that you can use to capture a pigeon:Get a container ready to hold the bird once you capture it.
If possible, put the bird in your container without using your hands to avoid further injury.
Throwing a blanket over a bird can help contain them while you capture it.
Leaving food in the container or enclosed room can help lure a bird in.
If you must, an injured and non-flying bird can usually be captured with just your hands.

, If you find a pigeon that needs your help you will need to provide a safe spot for them to rest. Giving them a comfortable space can help them relax and keep stress to a minimum.Keep the enclosure clean and dry.
A bird cage is ideal to use.
You can use something simple such as a cardboard box. However, you may want to use a mesh covering for the top of it to allow light and air into the box.

, If the pigeon is lost or injured, it will likely also be hungry and thirsty. While you decide what to do next with the pigeon, make sure you have given them access to fresh food and water.Pigeons can eat grains, greens, and seeds. A pigeon can also enjoy most fruits.
Do not offer your pigeon avocado, as they are thought to be toxic to pigeons.
Make sure you offer clean water. You can put the water in a simple bowl for them to drink from.

, Many pigeons are owned by other people and will have a noticeable band around one of its legs. This band will have a number or code on it that will help identify the owner of the pigeon. If the pigeon is unable to fly back to their owner, you can use this number to help return the bird yourself. Look for some of the following markings on the band to learn more about the owner:A.U. stands for the American Racing Pigeon Union
IF indicates the International Federation
C.U. stands for the Canadian Racing Pigeon Union
Other markings may indicate individual owners or private clubs.

, Once you've captured the pigeon and cared for its basic needs, you will want to deliver it to someone who can care for it further. Finding either a wildlife rehabilitation center or aviary veterinarian will allow the bird to get the care it needs. These centers can also help the pigeon be reunited with its owner.

Seek urgent care.,
Get a ventilated box or cage.,
Capture the pigeon.,
Care for a baby pigeon.,
Give the pigeon clean water.,
Purchase pigeon feed.,
Provide vegetables.,
Check for a leg band.,
Read the leg band.,
Release a wild pigeon.",How to Take Care of a Lost Pigeon," If the pigeon is shaking, bleeding, or vomiting, immediately take him to an avian veterinarian. If you are not sure where to take the pigeon, call the WildCare Hotline at (415) 456-7283. They can also tell you how to care for the pigeon.Always seek urgent care if you have a baby pigeon. If the pigeon makes any type of squeaking or chirping sound, you have a juvenile pigeon.;
, A small cardboard box or a bird cage can be used to house the pigeon. If you use a cardboard box, poke small holes in the side of the box for ventilation.You could also place a screen on top of the box for ventilation.Line the bottom with a soft cloth or some paper towels.An ideal cage would be at least 42″ wide, 27″ deep, and 30″ high. You can also use a small dog or cat crate.
Any container that you use should protect the pigeon from any cats or dogs.

, If the pigeon is tame or injured, you should be able to pick the pigeon up with your hands. If you can’t pick the pigeon up, try throwing a towel over the bird and then scoop the pigeon in the towel and place it in the box. You can also use food to bait the pigeon into the container.You can also walk behind the pigeon to get him to walk into the container or into a place where you can easily catch him.
Grab him across the back and gently hold him with two hands.

, If you have a baby pigeon, place him in a ventilated box with the heating pad turned on low. Half of the container should be heated and the other half should not. Baby pigeons have a special diet. Call the WildCare Hotline to get instructions to care for the pigeon and find a hospital or veterinarian for the baby pigeon.Call the number before you feed the pigeon. Improper feeding can result in death or a serious injury.

, Put water in a container that is at least 1 inch deep (e.g. old margarine tub). Water is more important than food if a pigeon is lost. The pigeon may be exhausted and not recognize the water. If you notice that the pigeon is not drinking, dribble a few drops of water into the container to make a splashing sound.If the pigeon looks super exhausted, put a teaspoon of Gatorade in two cups of water and give it to the pigeon. This will help replace lost electrolytes.

, Pigeons eat grains and seeds. Go to a feed store to purchase pigeon feed. Pet stores usually do not carry pigeon feed. If you cannot go to a feed store, you can buy wild bird seed or dove and quail mix from the pet store.You can also give the pigeon uncooked popcorn, rice, split peas, barley, and buckwheat. Do not give your pigeon a slice of bread.Start by giving 2 tablespoons in the morning and see how much the pigeon eats. Adjust the amount until all of the food you provide in the morning is gone by the end of the day., In addition to grains, your pigeon will enjoy eating vegetables 3 or 4 times a week. Chop or mince vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, snap peas, kale, cauliflower, dandelion greens, edamame, and bell peppers.Wash the vegetables to remove any chemicals before you feed them to your pigeon.The vegetables should be placed in a small, separate dish.
Start out with 2 tablespoons and reduce the amount based on how much your pigeon eats.

, If you have found a racing pigeon, they will be wearing a leg band. The band will tell you where the bird is registered, the year the bird was hatched, the pigeon club, and the pigeon’s unique number.Some bands may have the owner’s name and contact information. If the bird does not have a band, it is a wild pigeon.


If the leg band has the owner’s contact information, contact the owner and let them know that you have their pigeon.
If there is no contact information, you will have to read the leg band to determine who to contact.

, The first 2 letters of the leg band will let you know which national organization that pigeon belongs to. You can then contact the organization and let them know that you have found one of their pigeons. All of these organizations have websites. Here are some common organizations:


AU stands for the American Racing Pigeon Union.
CU stands for the Canadian Racing Pigeon Union.IF stands for International Federation of American Homing Pigeon Fanciers.NPA stands for the National Pigeon Association.If the band says “IFB” call 1-877-355-7727 or email them at foyspigeon@zoominternet.net.
ADA stands for the American Dove Association and you can contact them at secretary@doveline.com.
If the band has letters that you cannot identify, contact the American Racing Pigeon Union. They will help you find the owner.
The Vancouver Poultry & Fancy Pigeon Association will also help you locate the owner if you are unable to do so. Email them at info@vancouverfancypigeon.ca.

, If the pigeon does not have a leg band, it is most likely a wild pigeon. Do not keep a wild pigeon as your pet. It is better to take care of the pigeon for a few days until you can get him some help at a rescue society.Most pigeons can find their way home after 1 or 2 days of rest, food, and water. Take the bird to an area without electrical wires and plenty of open space and release the pigeon.Again, you can call the WildCare Hotline at (415) 456-7283 to find a rescue place for the pigeon. Avoid calling your local humane society. They are more likely to euthanize the pigeon instead of providing care and releasing him back into the wild."

Install pigeon spikes in places where pigeons are likely to roost.,
Install a bird slope.,
Install bird netting.,
Put up a scarecrow.,
Use repellent gel.,
Display a pigeon predator.,
Put up flash tape, scare balloons or flashing eyes.,
Install a motion detector.,
Remove all food and water sources.",How to Catch Pigeons1," Imagine something similar to a bed of nails, but with the nails tilted in different directions - this is a pigeon spike. Since it’s not a flat, comfortable surface, pigeons will tend to avoid areas where these spikes are installed. They are best installed in areas where pigeons would attempt to congregate for nesting or sleeping.In addition to the spikes (which come in metal and plastic) there are also pigeon coils, which are coiled pieces of wire (like a slinky) that can be stretched out to allow for different sized spaces between each loop.;
, Bird slopes are slippery, sloped surfaces you install on your roof that a pigeon, or any bird for that matter, can’t grip with their feet. Instead, they slip and slide until they “fall off” (i.e. fly away). Bird slopes are nice in that they can be made to blend in with your roof and won’t look as obvious as bird spikes., Bird nets are nets to deter birds, not catch them.Nylon netting is used for large surface areas like tall buildings or fields of crops. Because the nylon is quite thin, it can be made to look almost invisible on a tall building. Depending on what type of structure it’s covering, you may want to check that the netting is fire and water proof.Bird nets are designed for large spaces and are therefore better suited for commercial or agricultural use, rather than residential.
Pigeons can also be prevented from entering certain locations using wire mesh instead of nylon netting. It is heavier but also comes in different sizes depending on your needs., This “scarecrow” doesn’t have to look like the traditional ones you remember from movies like The Wizard of Oz, but simply needs to take the shape and size of a human. (Another term used somethings is “human effigy”.) They work just like you’d expect, but more modern versions can be made of inflatable material that blows around, creating movement that helps scare the pigeons away., Repellent gel is sticky and when a pigeon lands on/in it, it’s uncomfortable and they fly away. You can also use crushed dried chili peppers instead of gel to get a similar result. Keep in mind, however, that this method, especially the chili peppers, washes away and has to be reapplied.This is more of a short-term, temporary option if you need a quick fix.


Note that some repellent gels (and liquids) are not legal in some countries. Make sure your check your country’s laws before using these types of products., A pigeon predator can take the form of a statue, robot or even the real thing. The best predators for pigeons are peregrine falcons and owls.Some fake predators can be automated to move and make sounds to scare pigeons away.Others are just plastic or wood decoys molded and painted to look like an owl or peregrine falcon, although some are designed to have moveable parts driven by the wind, so no power or batteries are required.Robotic fake predators can be costly and are designed more for commercial than residential use.
As with other “bird” deterrents, the fake predator may also scare away all other birds, including the ones you may want to keep around.

, Scare balloons are designed to be bright, reflective, and scary to a pigeon. They aren’t filled with helium to float, but rather are hung from trees, balconies, decks, etc.Flashing eyes are large flat boards with eyes painted on both sides. The eyes are mounted on a stake that’s put in the ground, and mirrors are placed to reflect up into the eyes as they spin. The combination of eyes, movement and reflective material help scare pigeons away from the area.Flash tape essentially looks like large pieces of tinsel, with an iridescent surface that is sometimes made to look like eyes (like the flashing eyes). It comes in rolls (like tape) and can be cut to various lengths and hung anywhere to blow in the wind.Note that all these devices are not bird-specific and will work on any bird that is not a predator. Therefore these items might also scare away birds you want to attract like swallows, hummingbirds and chickadees.

, When a pigeon’s movements are detected by the motion detector, a sound, sometimes at an ultrasonic frequency, is played. This sound is annoying to the pigeon and they won’t stick around. If the motion detector plays ultrasonic sounds, humans won’t be able to hear them, so it won’t be annoying to you.Note that motion detectors need a certain amount of clear space in front of them, and must be set up at certain heights and intervals to be effective.
Motion detectors can also be designed to spray water (from an attached hose) rather than play a sound.As with other “bird” deterrents, the motion detector may also scare away all other birds, including the ones you may want to keep around.
Ultrasonic devices should NOT be used in an area also occupied by bats., Pigeons are hanging out on your property because they’ve found food and/or water they can easily access. If you remove that food and water, your property won’t look as appealing to the pigeons and they may relocate.This is obviously more difficult to do if you’re in a highly populated urban area where your property is surrounded by the property of others at a close proximity. The food and water might actually be located on someone else’s property, but yours is close enough for them to fly to for resting and nesting. In this case you may want to consider bringing up the problem with your landlord, condo association, community league or city council.

Determine if the pigeon is domesticated or wild.,
Look for signs of injury or weakness.,
Feed and water the pigeon.,
Take the pigeon to a veterinarian.,
Locate the owner’s contact information.",How to Catch Pigeons2," This is rather easily done by looking at the pigeon’s legs. Pigeons raised in captivity and sold for racing and show purposes will have a metal band around one of their legs.This metal band will have information on it, and you’ll need to catch the pigeon in order to read this info.

, Sometimes racing pigeons are just taking a break, and simply need to rest awhile before moving on. If the pigeon looks like it’s injured, or too weak to protect itself, you will need to catch it to take care of it. Under the circumstances the pigeon shouldn’t put up much of a fight and should be pretty easy to pick up.Place the pigeon in a basket, cage, large box or pet carrier.


If the pigeon is injured, but is also trying to get away, you can try getting close enough to throw a blanket or towel over the pigeon while it’s on the ground, then pick up the towel or blanket and carefully remove the pigeon.Make sure the box, basket, carrier or cage is lined with a towel, blanket or paper towels. If the pigeon is injured it will need to be kept warm until you can get it help., If the pigeon looks healthy you can leave it where it is, but you may want to consider putting out a bowl of water and some food (wheat, corn, small grains or fine seeds) for it to snack on while it takes a break. If the pigeon is injured or weak, provide it the same type of food and a bowl of water inside the basket, cage, carrier or box.If the pigeon is too weak to stand, or is having trouble with balance, do not give it water right away. The water bowl would be more a hazard than a help at this point., If the pigeon is gasping, has tremors or seizures, is bleeding or throwing up, you must take the pigeon to a vet right away.The vet’s office will be able to help you determine what to do with the bird after, including helping you read the tag and contacting the owner.

, If the pigeon is a racing pigeon, it most likely has a leg band from the American Racing Pigeon Union (ARPU). If this is the case, the number on the leg band will start with the letters “AU”. The next two numbers represent the year the pigeon was hatched and banded. The next three letters represent the specific pigeon club to which the owner belongs. And the final four numbers is the pigeon’s personal identification number with their club. Using the information found on the leg band, you can use the ARPU’s searchable band listing on their website to find the owner’s contact information.


If the number on the leg band starts with a “CU” the bird is registered with the Canadian Racing Pigeon Union (CRPU). You can use the lost bird form on their website to list your contact information and information about the pigeon and the CRPU will assist you in locating it’s owner.
If the number on the leg band starts with “IF” the bird is registered through the International Federation - American Homing Pigeon Fanciers Inc. You can use their IF Band Listing PDF documents to look up the owner’s contact information.
If the number on the leg band starts with “NPA” the bird is registered with the National Pigeon Association. Send an email to secretary@npausa.com to let them know you’ve found the pigeon and they’ll assist you with contacting the owner.
If the number on the leg band starts with “IPB” send an email to foyspigeon@zoominternet.net or call 1-877-355-7727 to report the pigeon you found.
If the number on the leg band starts with “ADA” the pigeon is registered with the American Dove Association (ADA). Send an email to secretary@doveline.com to inform them of the pigeon you found and they’ll help you with contacting the owner.
If the number on the leg band starts with “NBRC” it is registered with the National Birmingham Roller Club. You can use the online form on their website to send them all the relevant information and they’ll help you locate the owner.

Pick a location where you’d like to eventually place the trap.,
Start placing pigeon feed in the trap area on a daily basis.,
Put out the trap with food inside.,
Relocate the pigeons away from your property.,
Leave the pigeons alone.,
Keep the pigeons as pets.,
Hire a pest control specialist.",How to Catch Pigeons3," This location needs to be easily accessible to both you and the pigeons. You will have to go to this location daily to put out pigeon feed, plus you’ll have to go back to check the trap on a regular basis. Once the pigeons are caught, you’ll then need to move the trap from this location to another location, so you’ll need to be able to access it while holding and carrying a bulky, and possibly heavy, trap.

, You may have to do this everyday, maybe multiple times a day, for up to a week before laying out the trap.The key is to try to attract as many of the pesky pigeons as possible to the area so they’ll be around when you put out the trap.

, After a week or so of baiting the pigeons, it’s time to try to catch them. Read the instructions for your specific trap to make sure you understand how to operate the trap door, and set it up. Place a bunch of pigeon feed inside the trap, and immediately outside the trap door., Hopefully you were able to capture several of the pigeons from your property in the cage without much trouble. Now you’ll need to take the cage somewhere to release them. Ideally this should be an area away from private property as other property owners may not appreciate being stuck with your pesky pigeons.Keep in mind that many pigeons have an innate homing ability which allows them to find their “home”, i.e. the place where they find food, from miles, possibly even hundreds of miles, away. If the pigeons on your property were there for some time, and found regular food, they might actually come back to you! You should prepare for this by implementing pigeon deterrents while they’re gone in anticipation of their return. If, by luck, they do not come back, the pigeon deterrents will help keep other pigeons from stumbling onto your property and setting up house.

, Rather than catching the pesky pigeons, you could just leave them alone. They’re just trying to survive like the rest of us. If they’re on your property, they’ve found a place that makes them feel safe and provides them with food and shelter. They aren’t harmful, and contrary to popular opinion, you’re not going to get any nasty diseases from having them around., Pigeons, while messy in large, unruly groups, are actually quite nice pets when you have a manageable number and the proper pigeon loft for them to live. You can even train them to return to their loft from far away and enter them in pigeon races. Check out the American Pigeon Racing Union (APRU) to get an idea of the fun you could have with pigeons.

, Pest control companies handle the removal and elimination of pests of all sorts, including pigeons. If your pigeon problem is severe, or you’ve tried other methods that haven’t worked, it may be time to call in a professional. Different pest control companies will “handle” pigeons differently.Make sure you tell them you’re looking for a humane solution if you do not want the birds to be killed.

Feed the fledgling baby bird food.,
Mix the baby bird formula with water.,
Fill the syringe with the formula.,
Push the sides of the beak to open the pigeons mouth.,
Feed the fledgling by hand.,
Provide seeds for the fledgling.",How to Care for a Fledgling Pigeon1," The best food for a fledgling pigeon is a commercial baby bird formula. These can easily be obtained from a pet food supply store.You can also feed a fledgling pigeon chick crumbles that can be crushed into smaller pieces and mixed with water. These can be purchased at a pet store.
In emergency situations, you can feed a fledgling pigeon dog biscuits that have been crushed and softened by mixing with warm water.
Do not feed a fledgling milk or bread crumbs.;
, Follow the instructions provided on the package in order to prepare the formula for feeding. In most cases you will need to mix the formula with warm water. For young birds you will mix 1 part formula with 6 parts water. As the pigeon ages you will decrease the water content.Do not heat the water or formula in the microwave because this can create hot pockets that will burn the fledgling.

, Most fledgling pigeons receive their food from their parents. In order to mimic this type of feeding, use a syringe to feed to pigeon. Fill a syringe with the formula.A fledgling pigeon should eat approximately 24 ccs of formula, twice a day., Pigeons don’t open their mouths when they want to be fed. As a result, you will need to push the sides of the beak in order to open the mouth. Have someone hold the body of the pigeon while you use your hands to open the mouth and insert the syringe. Gently squeeze out the formula.Stop feeding the pigeon once the crop is full.
The crop is a pocket that hangs on the inside of the chest. When full the chest should feel squishy, like a balloon filled with water., You can feed a fledgling by hand by placing seeds and chick crumble into the bird's mouth. For very young or distressed birds a syringe is easiest, but as the bird ages it will be able to take food from your hand., You should also help encourage a fledgling to begin eating food on its own. Place a few pigeon seeds in the bottom of the cage for the bird to eat. This will help the bird learn to pick up seeds on its own using its beak.Once the fledgling is eating seeds on its own, you can stop feeding it formula with a syringe.

Go to a place where pigeons usually walk around like, the town or city, or even a park.,
Buy some seeds (unsalted) at your grocery store and feed it to the pigeons, come to them slowly and show them the seeds you have so the pigeons know you are not any harm to them ,if you are coming to fast you will scare them away.,
Establish relationships with the pigeons.,
Look at all the variety in their plumage and try to appreciate it instead of just keep track of it.,
Listen to their soft cooing sound and think about it.,
Research about pigeons on the Internet to know about them more.

",How to Appreciate Pigeons," Observe them and keep note of their plumage.;
, Do not feed pigeons bread as it is not as nutritious as seeds and other foods they need to eat to be healthy, and the pigeons will fill up on bread instead of eating foods they need.

, Think of names and personalities for them, and watch them get used to you.

, Pigeons aren't that boring as you think.

, Think about how lovely it is,and how bleak the world would be without these nice birds.

Contain the bird in a box or cage.,
Place a heating pad in the cage.,
Create a nest using a small bowl and towels.,
Provide the bird with access to water.,
Situate the bird in a quiet area.",How to Care for a Fledgling Pigeon2," A fledgling pigeon can be housed in a small cardboard box or bird cage. A young fledgling may be kept in a high-sided cardboard box. The box does not have to be large because this is only a temporary solution. You should take a found fledgling to a wildlife sanctuary or release the bird into the wild as soon as possible.If you are housing the pigeon in a closed cardboard box, make sure there are lots of air holes.

, Fledglings pigeons need to be kept warm, especially if they are injured. Place an electric heating pad or hot water bottle in the cage. You should cover the heating pad with towels so that the bird has an indirect heat source.Alternatively, you can place a heating lamp over top of the bird's cage to help keep the bird warm.

, Try and mimic a nest, by lining a small bowl with a dry towel. Place this “nest” in the bird’s enclosure. This will allow the bird to feel cosy and secure.Change the towel daily in order to keep the nest clean.
Do not place the bird on a slippery surface, such as plastic. This could cause their legs to splay, which can impact their development and mobility.

, It is also important that you provide the bird with water. Fill a small deep and heavy bowl with water. The fledgling should be able to drink water on its own.Do not squirt water into the bird’s mouth.

, Place the bird’s habitat in a quiet space away from other pets. You also want to choose an area that doesn’t get a lot of human traffic. This will help to calm the fledgling.

Examine the pigeon for injuries.,
Take the bird to a wildlife rehabilitation center.,
Ask a vet to help the bird.",How to Care for a Fledgling Pigeon3," If you have rescued a fledgling pigeon that you believe is injured, it is important to fully examine the bird for any injuries. For example, the bird may have a broken wing or foot. You should also look for scratches or bleeding in case the bird has been attacked by a predator.If you notice any injuries or ailments, you should immediately contact a rehabilitation center.

, The best place to take an injured or sick pigeon, is a wildlife rehabilitation center. They will likely be able to provide the bird with the medical attention necessary. They may even be able to house the bird in a sanctuary with other pigeons., You can take a fledgling pigeon to a veterinary clinic; however, it should be noted that many vets do not have experience nursing or caring for an injured bird. As a result, they will often recommend euthanasia, even in instances when the pigeon could recover."

Measure the diameter of the paintball gun's barrel.,
Measure the distance across the barrel.,
Purchase one piece of 1 inch (2.5 cm) PVC pipe, and one piece of 2 inch (5.1 cm) PVC pipe.,
Cut the 2 inch PVC pipe to a length of 10 inches.,
Cut the 1 inch (2.5 cm) PVC pipe to a length of 12 inches (30.5 cm).,
Draw a line of drill holes down the suppressor barrel.,
Draw another line of drill holes down the barrel.,
Drill the holes with a 3⁄16 inch (0.5 cm) drill-bit.,
Sand the inside and outside of the suppressor barrel, and the inside of the 2 inch (5.1 cm) PVC pipe.,
Create the end caps.,
Slide the suppressor barrel into the larger pipe.,
Attach the end cap securely around the barrel of the suppressor, within the PVC pipe.,

Stuff the space between barrel and 2 inch (5.1 cm) PVC pipe firmly with steel wool, cotton balls, heating insulation, or mattress foam.,
Add the other end cap.,
Attach the barrel of the silencer to the barrel of your paintball gun.,
Secure the barrel with a 1/2 inch (5.1 cm) to 2 inch (5.1 cm) hose clamp.",How to Make a Suppressor," To do this, simply place one end of the measuring tape on the end of the barrel and measure straight up along the widest part of the circular barrel. This will give you the most accurate measurement of the diameter of the gun's barrel.;
, Use measuring tape or a ruler to measure the entire distance across the barrel. In other words, do not just measure the hole.

, The inches refer to the width/diameter of the pipe, not the length. These pipes will create the framework for the suppressor.

, You can cut the pipe using a handsaw, a hacksaw, a plastic pipe cutter, or a miter saw. Simply measure from one end of the pipe until you reach ten inches, mark the spot with a pencil, and then cut the pipe accordingly. Remember that if you measure twice, you'll only have to cut once.

, Just measure out until you've found the 12-inch mark, and mark it with a pencil. This will be your suppressor's barrel.


Note: These lengths may be adjusted for different size paintball guns. Longer suppressors are more unwieldy, but may increase dampening effect. The suppressor's barrel should always be 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than the other PVC pipe, no matter which measurements you use.







, Using magic marker, draw a line of drill holes down the suppressor barrel, evenly spaced with 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) between them. Use measuring tape to evenly measure the holes, and make sure to keep the line straight.

, Now, turn the suppressor barrel 1/4, or 90 degrees, and draw another line. Use the same technique you used to mark the holes the last time.

, Do not stop when you drill through the first surface. Drill through to the other side, so that you can see straight through. When you are finished, you should have four lines of parallel drill holes.


You can use a hand drill, but a drill press is preferable.
Use a drill-bit of size appropriate to the size of your projectiles. The holes should be smaller than the projectiles. Consult a permitted manufacturer to ensure that your drill-bit is the correct size.

, Use a rotary tool or sandpaper to smooth out any imperfections.

, If you have a jigsaw or scroll saw, you can make end caps from a piece of wood. If not, you can use thick cardboard or another sturdy material. Here is how you make the end caps:


Trace a circle on the wood or cardboard around the 2 inch (5.1 cm) PVC pipe.






Within this circle, trace around the suppressor barrel, creating a donut shape.






Cut out the end caps. The end caps should fit securely around the barrel, and within the 2 inch (5.1 cm) PVC pipe.







, The barrel should extend straight through the 2 inch (5.1 cm) PVC pipe to the other side.

, It should snugly fit in place.

, Give the glue time to dry before you touch the end cap again.


The barrel should extend two inches out of the 2 inch (5.1 cm) PVC pipe, and the end cap should be on the other side.







, This will secure the two pieces of pipe, which are the two main parts of the suppressor, firmly in place.

, Secure it with crazy glue or caulking.

, Neatly place the suppressor over the barrel of your paintball gun. This is why the suppressor has to be wider than the barrel of your gun, so that it can fit over it neatly.

, Just use the clamp to secure the barrel in place, and use a screwdriver to turn the screw that keeps it in position. You're all done! Again, just remember that this is an illegal suppressor unless it has been properly registered.

Learn how to move silently.,
Acquire a target.,
Observe your target for a while.,
Get close.,
Take them out.,
After you have captured your opponent, take them somewhere out of the way and leave them there until the game is over.

",How to Perform a Stealth Take Out,"


Roll your feet. Place the heel down first, lightly, then push into it as you shift your weight. Move more slowly on louder surfaces (gravel, sand, etc.)
Wear tight clothing. Loose clothing rubs together and can get snagged far more easily than Under Armour.
Control your breathing. Through the nose and out the mouth is ideal, but different people breath better with different techniques.;
, A person away from a group is better (a scout or sniper) than a cluster, because - obviously - one person can only look in one direction while more people can watch more areas.

, The amount of time you have to observe them varies directly with how much the target is moving. For example, if the target is a sniper that is sitting perfectly still, not moving a muscle while they overlook the battlefield, you will have ample time to observe them. However, if they are a scout or commando heading towards your base, you may have less than thirty seconds to assess them.

, Move silently and control your breath until you are within an arms length or less from them. This step takes much practice, as moving silently is not as easy as it seems. A creaking floor, a snapped twig, a crunched leaf, all of these can give you away. Another thing to remember is that if you move too fast, you will create a small movement of wind that will alert them to your presence, depending on how alert they are.

, Note: Do not use these in real life. These are meant for friendly games, and can cause real damage if used with malicious intent.


A choke hold is one method that requires no equipment. Step in close enough that your body is almost touching their back, then stomp or kick (use discretion if this is used in a game) the back of their knee, while at the same time pulling their head up. This will expose their throat. Loop your arm around their neck so that their throat is in the crook of your arm. With the hand of the choking arm, grab your other bicep, then clap your free hand over their mouth. If done properly, they will be unconscious in 5-10 seconds. After they go limp, release immediately.
Take them hostage. Using the same methods as described above,kick the back of their knee, but instead of putting them in a choke hold, place one hand over their mouth and your paintball marker or airsoft gun in their back. They can then be 'interrogated' to reveal their teams plans. Not applicable with Manhunt.

Get an electric gun that costs $70 or more.,
Buy as much (highly polished,high-grade,) ammo as possible.,
Buy spare mid-cap mags(although hi-cap means you can shoot longer at the price of self-winding the magazines and making rattling noises when moving), a good tactical vest, and a red dot sight.,
.23 gram and .25 gram bbs are more effective than .12s and .20s, but have a lower FPS(feet per second).,
Accuracy and consistency are more important than FPS.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Gather an even number of friends and play and possibly make a team.,Get to know your opponents and their strengths and weaknesses.",How to Be an Airsoft Frontman," Cheaper guns are often unreliable and less effective. Note: A multi-shot shotgun is fine as long as you can cock and shoot it effectively. Getting a single shot shotgun is usually a pretty bad idea, as you are shooting an often inaccurate spring rifle.;
, There is three common weights of bbs. .25; .20 and .12. Try to get seamless bbs, non seamless bbs can potentially break inside your airsoft gun, causing it to malfunction. Any weight is good, depending on your airsoft guns fps. If it has high fps, meaning its stronger; heavier bbs are good for you. But weaker airsoft guns, will need lighter bbs. If a strong airsoft gun shoots .12 bbs, the bbs will often be inaccurate and the distance is decreased.

, Many real optics can be mounted as well, though these tend to cost much more than the airsoft replica versions.

, They will in fact reach the target faster (because of the increased momentum, which helps to counter air resistance). Again, stay away from .12g BBs for any good gun. .12g BBs are also much more inaccurate than any of the other ammo types.
, Heavier rounds will have lower FPS at the barrel, but will reach the target faster, and will give you more effective range (FPS does not equal range!).

, You must be a part of your gun. Familiarization and skill with your weapons of choice is absolutely critical, and anything less will be that much more risk of you being on the losing end of things.

, 4-8+ is generally a good group size for playing. This means you can play 2on2 or 4on4 etc. Never play in the public eye or in your backyard if easily visible to others. Also, do not play inside your own home!

Launch the grenade.",How to Make a Paintball Grenade," Using regular scissors or a knife, slice the 3/8 inch latex tube. Each grenade will require at least a 6-inch long tube. You can use longer tubes for larger grenades if you prefer. Measure each section prior to cutting for consistency.


Go ahead and tie one end of the 6-inch tube into a knot.;
, Using a measuring cup, measure ¼ cup of flour and ¼ cup of corn starch. This will be used to make the paint. Grab the food coloring and set aside. You can add this directly to the mix so it doesn’t need to be measured out.


You can use non-toxic, washable kids’ paint as well if you want to save more time.

, A medium sized pot will be needed to create the grenade filling. Make sure you also have a syringe or spray bottle, cotter pins or bobby pins, a clamp and several washers before getting started.


If these items aren’t readily available at home, they can be picked up at a local hardware store.

, You will only need to fill it about half way. Let this come to a simmer, not a boil. Once the water is ready, slowly pour in a bit of the flour/starch mixture and stir. Avoid making the mix too thick. It should have the consistency of cake batter. Add about 4 drops of food coloring to the mix. Consider wearing gloves and goggles while performing this task. Some of the mixture may splatter accidentally.
Choose a bright color that can be seen on the paintball field. Add more drops to produce a brighter color.
Let the mixture cool before filling the tubes. It should be at room temperature before proceeding.

, Place the open-end part of the tube snug around the spray bottle snout or syringe. If using a spray bottle, simply squirt the mixture into the tube. When using a syringe, push the mixture into the tube slowly.


If you are concerned about leaking, tie a rubber band around the spout to make it more secure.
If not using a rubber band, hold the tube onto the spout or syringe with your free hand for extra security. The tube should be pretty tight on its on though, when using the correct size.

, Once the tube is filled (3-4 inches in diameter) you can slowly remove the rubber band and the spray bottle or syringe.Twisting the open end several times will also achieve the same results.

, Fold the open end down about an inch. Remove the clamp once you have a good grip. Slide a washer down the folded side. Take a 1/8 inch cotter pin and slide it through the rubber tube, on top of the washer. , Make sure you and those around you are wearing the proper attire to launch paintball grenades. If thrown with enough force, they may cause bruising so cover up. Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, as well as goggles.

, To achieve the best results, it’s a good idea to aim for a bunker at the paintball field or a fort.The impact will increase the spray radius. Plus you will be able to eliminate more players.

, When ready, remove the cotter pin from the tube but leave the washer in place. Toss the grenade at the intended target. Once the washer hits the ground or other hard surface, the tube will burst open causing paint to splatter for several feet. When pulling the pin, if paint starts to leak, throw it immediately or you will be covered with your own bomb!
For optimum results, throw the grenade high into the air so it has maximum impact hitting the ground.

Start with a basic AEG, but remember you get what you pay for so expect to spend no less than $100 on one.,
Find your nearest sanctioned Airsoft field.,
Besides a rifle one of the most important pieces of equipment you need is eye protection.,
Treat your Airsoft gun like a real firearm, at all times.,
Take care of your equipment, at all times.,
Use good BBs at all times.",How to Be an Airsoft Rifleman," Never waste your money on a spring rifle and hold off on starting with a sniper rifle. Trustworthy companies for beginners (and also for most airsofters) include CYMA, G&G, JG, G&P, and VFC. An M4 or an M16 variant will most likely treat you best.;
, In other words if the property doesn't have paintball insurance you should not be playing there. Often local groups and organizations exist in your state. Its these groups of people you want to play with.

, Many organizations and Airsoft fields require full seal but even if shooting glasses are an option NEVER use them. Always wear full seal ANSI rated goggles. Options include, Bolle tactical, Revision eyewear, and others as well as Save Phace and other paintball masks. Gear is much less important. When you first start just jeans and a sweatshirt will do you just fine. As you play more you can pick up gear and camouflage as needed.

, Always have the muzzle in a safe direction, know your target and beyond, keep your finger off the trigger until ready to fire, safety can and do fail, and do not point the weapon at something you do not intend to shoot.

, Keep your goggles in a case or a provided bag so they don't get scratched. This is very important not only for safety reasons, but for cleaning as well. If cleaned after each use the rifle will last you much longer.

, Avoid BBs you may find at stores like Walmart of Big 5, such as Crosman BBs. The best brands are Excel, G&G, Goldenball, and KSC. For weight, use no less than 0.20g. 0.25g is recommended for most AEGs.

Organize the team movements.,
If you are currently engaging an enemy unit, there are a few safer options available:


Leapfrogging (one person providing cover fire while the other moves, this can be used to advance, fall back, and flank the enemy),
Run and gun (providing cover fire for yourself while moving, the inverse ""gun and run"" can also be used to move from cover; fire a few bursts then run like hell), and
Lastly crawling (you don't get far fast but in a prone position you are less likely to get hit if you are 50+ feet away and have shrubs for low cover, do not attempt this in close quarters and this should only be used if the enemy is a big fan of spray and pray, as they would likely shoot towards you, not at you).,
Deal with combat situations.,
Deal with the ambush and creating a superior firing position.",How to Arrange Combat Movement (for Airsoft)," When your team is moving as a group, you can advance in a few different ways:


A loose diamond (one person eyes front, one left, one right, and one checking flanks and 6:00),
Staggered columns (the image for this is slightly off, picture the left column a mirror image of the right) (two eyes front, Middle(s) right and left, and rear: flanks and 6:00). Those are for general movement in a non-combat situation.;
, when a team is moving while engaging move one person at a time so you can provide cover for each-other.

,


When you are superior (in this situation steadily advance on the enemy's position but be cautious you can still lose a team member even if you outnumber them, also be ready for an ambush).
When the enemy is superior (It is advisable to fall back to a better position, either get to high ground, good cover, or get entrenched and use your skill to take control of the situation if you take out a few of their members even when you are outnumbered the enemy may become demoralized and fall back, that is your opportunity to strike.

Advancing; (when you advance on an enemy make sure to know were their entire unit is, going after one person instead of after a territory can easily lead to an ambush or being flanked and surrounded, even with the upper hand make sure you have a clean exit route in case something comes up)
Falling back (when you are out-gunned or become separated from your team you need to fall back to a safer position, don't try to shoot your way out, move fast and low, and stick to cover whenever possible, try to randomize your movement so they can't let you run into their fire, it's always better to fall back with your team then to try to be a hero and hold them off)
Flanking (flanking can provide a huge tactical advantage, treat the enemy a a single point that you are going to circle around and entrap, the best way to get behind an enemy position is to have half the team provide heavy fire on their front or provide some other distraction so the rest of the team can get around them and hit their sides or 6.



, Ambushes can take out and entire team if done properly, when ambushing an enemy lure them into a spot by either having a team member be bait (a lonely ill equipped soldier looks like a tempting target) or in a capture the flag scenario have the flag be the bait, the bait should be in a position either in a low point or with no cover so when the enemy arrives they have no cover as well, place your team in a position to flank the enemy and prevent their retreat.


Superior firing positions can be a great advantage, when scouting out an area for a firing position look for waist high cover, high ground, trenches, and have environmental factors on your side, put the sun in their eyes the wind at your back and the rain over their head. since every battleground is different there is no one solution but use your head and try to make it harder for the enemy to hit you than you to hit them.

Keep doing pyramid sets and vary your rests.,
Only lift a few times a week.,
Heat down after you cool down to deal with the soreness.",How to Lift Correctly," It's important to oxygenate your bloodstream, loosening up your muscles, warming them up, and getting them ready for heavy lifting. If you want to build muscles and avoid injuries, warming up is essential.


Start with some basic push ups and sit ups, a few sets of each with a brief rest period between. Do a few sets, gradually increasing the number of reps in each set. You might start with 10 of each and work up to 50.;
, It is important that you dynamic stretches and not static stretches. Dynamic stretches are moving stretches, whereas static stretches you hold a stretch in place. Studies have shown dynamic stretches to improve strength for workouts and reduce susceptibility to injury, while static stretches before a workout have been shown to weaken the muscles. An example of a dynamic stretch is arm swings. Swinging your arms up and down the full range of movement stretches the deltoids (shoulders), this would be ideal to do before say, shoulder press.

, Ideally, you want to lift the most amount of weight you can manage for the amount reps that you intend to do. It is important to prioritize achieving the required rep count rather than sacrificing more than 3 reps so you can show off lifting heavier weights. This is known in gym culture as leaving the ego at the door. Having the discipline to resist going too heavy is a skill, and if you resist and stick to doing as much weight as you can for the amount of reps you need, you will make progress faster, because the number of reps you do determines how your muscles adapt.


Trial a moderate amount of weight and make sure you have the form/movement correct. If you feel you can do more for the amount of reps you are aiming to do, go heavier. Once you find the maximum amount you can manage for the amount of reps, stick with that. Next workout try adding a bit more weight.
Lifting weights that are too heavy to achieve the rep range you need is a bad idea, and you will look silly and like you trying hard to impress to any experienced lifters in the gym, so don't bother. Ideally you should not attempt weights that are too heavy for you to finish the reps by yourself/without a spotter. If you need a spotter to help with a couple of reps, it means you picked a weight which is too heavy for you to finish the reps, and you need to lower it until a time where you are strong enough to manage the higher weight without assistance. Lifting weights that are too heavy is also one of the most common causes of injury in the gym, and there's plenty of compilations videos on the internet to give you an idea. Lifting weights that are too heavy can also serious strain and even damage your joints/cartilage. Joint/cartilage take longer to build/strengthen/adapt to training than muscles.

, Different goals demand different amounts of reps.


For strength, you should be aiming for 4-6 repetitions.
For muscle hypertrophy (building bigger muscles) you should aim for 8-12 reps.
For muscle endurance you should aim for 15-20 repetitions.
Different rep ranges also changes the energy system the body uses to supply the muscles. Lower rep sets use the adenosine triphosphate/phosphocreatine (ATP/PC) system. Higher reps use the aerobic energy system.
Performing a One Rep Max, or lifting the max amount of weight you can for a single repetition, can be invigorating and fun to show off, but should be used only as a point of measurement. In weightlifting, weights are often noted as a percentage of your 1RM (One Rep Maximum). For example if you could perform 100kg as your maximum for one repetition of bench press, then you lifted 75kg for 8-12 reps, you would be lifting 75% of your 1RM.

, The proper lifting technique for each exercise differs slightly--you wouldn't use the same form for a bench press as you would for a dead lift--but what each lift has in common is that you need to extend and complete the motion all the way before you lockout. A bench press needs to come all the way down to your chest, and needs to extend to just before your elbows lockout.


Do not lockout in any exercise. Firstly because, depending on the exercise, locking out can severely damage the joint(s) being used, especially with heavier weights, because it shifts the weight from the muscles the joint(s) For example with leg press, leg press will use one of the biggest amounts of weight of any exercise. If you full extend and lockout your knees, all the weight is shifting from the muscles to the knee joint. So you can see how that is damaging. Secondly, when you lockout you are taking the the strain off the muscles and putting it onto the joint, meaning your muscles are getting rest and making easier to do the exercise. Resisting from locking out will result in the exercise working the muscles much better. For example in a standing bicep curl, do not bring you hands all the way down, bring almost all the way then go back up, this prevent your biceps from getting unnecessary rest between reps.

, Determine how much time your reps should take for your goals. Different amounts of time for reps are used for different aims. For strength, the concentric phase (muscle contraction) should be explosive and push up in 1 second, and the eccentric phase (muscle lengthening) should be slow, about 3 seconds. For muscle hypertrophy (growing bigger muscles) It should be 3 seconds concentric and 3 seconds eccentric. More time under tension breaks more muscle fibers, which is what you want if you are trying to gain muscle size. For muscle endurance, obvious a faster rater is used, about 1 second concentric and 1 second eccentric.


To clarify what is meant by concentric and eccentric, this is the two phases of lift, where muscles contract/short, then lengthen. For example in a bicep curl, the concentric phase is when you lift up and shorten the bicep. In a tricep rope pull down, the concentric phase is when you pull down and shorten the tricep.

Strength: 1 second explosive contraction - 3 seconds eccentric
Muscle Hypertrophy: 3 seconds concentric - 3 seconds eccentric
Muscle endurance: 1 second concentric - 1 second eccentric.
Do not pause during a set, keep the tension on the muscles and don't lockout the joint being used.



, You need to supply your muscles with oxygen just like you would if you were going running. For any weightlifting, you should breath out on the concentric phase, and breath in on the eccentric phase. So for example in a bench press, you would breathe out as you push the weight up, then breathe in as you lowered the weight back down. In a barbell row, you would breath out as you pulled the weight up, and breath out as you lowered it back down. Breathing properly is extra important with heavier lifts and with lifts that use the legs (because the leg muscles demand a lot of oxygen) For example in deadlifts and in squats, proper breathing is essential, not doing so can lead to lightheadedness, palpitations, dizziness, and even fainting. , Different goals also require different rest times:


Strength: rest 2-4 minutes between sets
Hypertrophy: rest 1-2 minutes between sets
Endurance: rest 30-60 seconds between sets
Between exercises where you are using the same muscle(s), rest at least 3 minutes. 2 minutes rest is sufficient if moving to an exercise using different muscles. More rest may be needed for the more demanding lifts like squats and deadlifts in order to allow your Central Nervous System to recuperate. If you find you are starting to get dizzy/palpitations/lightheaded progressively after sets of squats or deadlifts, try resting a bit longer, for at least 2 minutes.

, If you don't have a friend to help re-rack the weight at the end of a set, for example benchpress, you may struggle to push up and re-rack the weight. If you don't have a spotter there then you'll be in trouble, it will be dangerous and embarrassing. Never exercise alone in general, if you run into complications you need to have someone around to help/get help if needed. If you come to an empty gym, either don't train, or be extra safe during your workout and don't push too hard, and use assisted racks for exercises like bench press and squats so you can easily re-rack the weights without help.

, As a cool down, you might have a specific activity or exercise that you like to do. Doing some static stretches and letting your body finish exercise slowly will make it much less likely that you'll be sore the next day, decreasing the possibility of injury or pulled muscles.

, The pectoral muscles, the muscles that extend from the top of the shoulders across the chest, can be exercised by lifting free weights or flyweights in a flat or inclined ""push up"" motion.


The bench press is the most famous lift for a reason: laying on your back, usually on a weightlifting bench, you want to grab the bar shoulder-width apart. Plant your feet on either side of the bench, unpack the bar and position it (with the help of a spotter, as always) over your chest, keeping your muscles tight. Lower the weight slowly until it touches your chest, then push up forcefully, driving back and extending into the ""top"" or ""up"" position.Dumbbell presses involve a similar technique to the bench press, but use individual dumbbells in each hand.

Chest curls are likewise similar, though you'll keep your arms straight and extend them outward, like a bird flapping wings.

, Using free-weights is an excellent way to strengthen your back, resulting in a toned physique and over-all strength and definition. Working out your shoulders and back muscles is essential in any total lifting routine.



Do deadlifts. Deadlifts are a more advanced lift, and should only be completed with the aid of a spotter or a trainer who can assist you. It can be quite dangerous to deadlift if you don't know what you're doing, because it involves lifting the bar up from the ground, and powering it into an upright position. In some forms, you'll lift it to your chin, or up above your head.

Do dumbbell rows. Working one arm at a time, from a kneeling position on a weight bench, lift one dumbbell from the ground up to your chest before lowering it to complete the rep, then alternate sides.

, If you want to cash in your tickets to the gun show, start lifting to target your biceps and get them both bigger and stronger.



Do bicep curls to build your biceps, either from a standing or seated position. Letting an appropriately-weighted dumbbell hang at your side, bring them to your chest by flexing your bicep. Alternate arms to complete the workout.

, Don't neglect your legs, which make up a large and easy-to-neglect muscle group that you can work with free-weights. To do squats, you'll take the bar at a squat-station onto your shoulders, holding it securely behind your head, and squat down, keeping your back very straight and then driving back up.

, If you do nothing but bench presses all week, you're not lifting correctly. Create a routine that varies the muscles you'll work on throughout the week, shaking it up while still highlighting the muscle groups that you're targeting and strengthening with your good technique. A weekly regimen might look something like this:


Monday: Work on pecs
Tuesday: Work on legs
Wednesday: Aerobics and running
Thursday: Work out torso and back
Friday: Work out abdominals.
Weekend: Rest

, With the proper technique, you should start to notice your regular routine get a little easier, which means you're getting stronger and starting to build muscle. Lifters call this a ""plateau"" and use it as a sign that it's time to start adding weight and varying the routine, to avoid flattening out.


To add weight, use weights which are still comfortable, but heavy enough to make those last few reps more difficult, finding that sweet spot, where the muscles almost fail.

, To really start varying your work out and introduce a cardio element into the workout, you can mess with the amount of time you take to rest between your sets. If you're giving yourself a full minute between sets for your arm, cut it down to 15 or 30 and notice how much more difficult it becomes.


Listen to your body and don't rush yourself. Jumping straight into another set when you're exhausted is a good way to make a mistake and cause an injury. Be careful and train at your own pace.

, It's a common mistake that rookies in the gym think lifting out three times a day is the quickest way to build strength and definition. This is not the case. Over-training can result in injury, keeping you sidelined from being able to work out properly for weeks or even months at a time. Lift correctly a few times and you'll start building muscle more quickly than you will lifting too often., After you finish your work out, always take a hot shower or bath. Steam-rooms are also popular after-workout routines, letting your muscles stay warm and ""cool down"" at their own pace. You'll notice your muscles will be less sore with the proper after-workout care.

Have lots of ammo.,
Choose a good partner.,
Be in shape for the battle.,
Train in your backyard with your gear on.,
Equip your gun with a red dot sight of your choice.,
Don't be intimidated.,
Shoot your opponent more than once if possible if you are at more than 80 feet (24.4 m) away.,
Be stealthy.",How to Be a Good Airsoft Assault Soldier," Be able to load your gun quickly. It can not be stressed enough how important it is to have more than just your standard 30 round low capacity magazine, you need more than that. For example you could have 5 Magazines for a Tokyo-Marui AEG, with around 300 shots available in Magazines. If you want to go an easier route then get a mid cap. They hold 80-200 rounds, and are very quiet. If you want you can get a 200-400 rnd. HiCap, but you have to wind them, and they rattle.;
, This tactic has ups and downs. The ups are that you can work as a team, saying that you can cover your partner while they reload or vice versa. You also have twice the rounds being shot so you can easily take down more opponents than if you were alone. Downs to this tactic are that if there is a gunner with a ""SAW"" or some sort of heavy fire machine gun, then you're both pretty much hosed. Also having a second person can often lead to being spotted easier because you make more noise and there is a larger mass of people moving. A good Sniper-Spotter partnership is very valuable, because the average death of a sniper is because they are being sneaked up on, however if you have a spotter with an automatic rifle, then that really cuts down on that issue.

, If you run from your house to your neighbors house and you are out of breath, well then you will not be very successful in your matches because there are a lot of hot situations where a lot of running is required to fall back and retreat, quickly getting to a good position is also important, so run there, don't drink your coffee and walk along talking to the guy next to you about how you wish you had this or that.

, This way, it'll be more natural when you're in a real match. Hide behind a wall or tree and set up targets, and then have a friend time you on how fast you can peg those targets. This will increase your reaction time and eventually make it to where you can turn, aim, and shoot before your enemy can acknowledge what's happening. (Only do this is you have an enclosed backyard that is away from public view or your neighborhood is aware and okay with you doing it.)

, Scopes are for DMRS, Gunners and Snipers. Red dots are very useful for those shots where it really matters if you hit them the first time! (Always Zero your sight)

, One of the most adrenaline pumping scenarios is when the match starts and then, 20 seconds later, all you can hear is AEG sounding like humming birds on stimulants. Run into a good position and take cover. Remember the enemy also has a limited amount of ammunition so let them take those shots that they think will go through the concrete wall you're hiding behind.

, If you don't, you run the risk of them not saying they didn't feel shot, whether or not this is true. If they cheat, don't overshoot or ""light them up."" Confront them or a game organizer afterward.

, This way, you can sometimes get behind enemy lines and shoot them. Also, play a game called rabbit where you have a 2v.1 and you are the 1. One person chases you ten seconds after you start running and the 2nd person helps the person chasing you (note: you are DISARMED). Avoid their shots and go to a certain location where your gun is. If you get hit the game is over. The way I play with my friends is when their mag is empty the game is over. In other words they can (but should not) light you up!

If you are over exercising you'll see a decrease in energy and an increase in the amount of time you need to recover from certain exercises.If you're noticing an overall lack of energy or inability to complete your normal workouts, this is a sign you need a rest.
Also, if you notice continued muscle soreness (past the 72 hour mark), this is a signal your muscles have not recovered or repaired themselves. You'll need to continue with rest until the soreness resolves completely.If you have increased injuries or an injury that won't heal, take a rest and definitely go see a doctor to diagnose the issue.
If you notice muscle pain while you are exercising, you may not have gotten enough rest in between exercise days.;
, One obvious sign of exercising too much is a disrupted sleep pattern. This is one of the first signs you may notice. Either sleeping too much or experiencing insomnia is a sign that you might be pushing yourself too much.First, start by figuring out how much sleep you typically get on a ""good night."" Do you sleep eight hours or a little more or less? This will be your norm and the basis for you to judge whether or not your sleep habits have changed.
Many people start to notice they're having difficulty sleeping or they're experiencing some insomnia.Insomnia is defined as having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.Studies have shown that too much exercise may increase stress hormones in your body preventing you from falling or staying asleep.On the other hand, you may notice that you experience increased fatigue and increased desire to sleep longer or more often during the day. If you're staying in bed for nine, 10 or more hours, you may be exercising too much.

, You may not realize how your mood, mental state or motivation is affected by over exercising. Any changes to your typical personality may also be a sign you've put in too much time at the gym.Changes in mood or feeling depressed are associated with overtraining. If you notice you've been snappy more often, feeling ""blue"" or have just been more irritable, take a look at how much you've been exercising.Another thing to track along with mood is your feelings about working out. Are you losing your motivation or usual excitement for your regular workouts? A sudden drop in motivation or excitement about your workout is a sign to give it a rest., If you're an exercise aficionado, you may take joy in measuring your heart rate during exercise, during your daily activities and during rest. Seeing an increase in resting heart rate is a sure sign you're overdoing it.Resting heart rate is when you're being calm, still and lying down. It's when your body needs the least amount of blood to be pumped through your body because you're at rest. Typically it's anywhere from 60-100 beats per minute. Athletes may have resting heart rates even lower at 40 beats per minute.If you have a heart rate monitor, or check your pulse regularly, try to monitor your resting heart rate more closely. If your normal rate is around 45 beats per minute and then jumps to 60 beats per minute, this is a sign you're definitely overdoing it.This indicates excessive stress on the body.
If you don't currently measure your resting heart rate, start doing so. It's best to measure first thing in the morning while you're still laying down or after you've been in a bed a bit at night. Track this in your exercise journal so you can see any trends or changes.

, Over exercising can lead to a lack of monthly periods, as it can interfere with hormone production. This is called Exercise Induced Amenorrhea.You may stop having your period altogether or it may become irregular, though perhaps relating to how intensely you are exercising at the time.The interference with your hormones can have a negative affect on your bone mass, putting you at higher risk for sprains, breaks, and osteoporosis.See your doctor immediately if this happens.

, Many avid exercisers and athletes will track their progress and performance. Whether it's strength or endurance, you should know what your goals are and how you typically perform day to day.


Pay attention to your overall performance. If your typical workouts feel harder to complete or you're running out of energy before the end of your workout, this could signal your body can't keep up this level of exercise.
Also, if you're trying to increase muscle mass, strength or endurance and your progress has completed halted (or regressed) this is a signal you're pushing yourself too much.Be careful not to continue to overdo it. You may think this progress stall is a signal to work harder, but that can be dangerous.
Weight is another way to check in with your body. If you've been trying to lose weight but your weight has plateaued for several weeks, it may be due to too much exercise and not enough fuel., Although exercise is definitely a healthy thing to do, many people exercise for the wrong reasons. If exercise has become compulsive, or to help reach an extremely low body weight, you may need to give up working out and work on positive body image instead.


Some people may exercise excessively and over train because they are using intense and frequent quantities of exercise as a method of ""purging"" after eating large meals or high calorie foods. Exercise bulimia is a mental health problem and if you believe (or others have mentioned to you) that you have exercise bulimia see a therapist and your doctor immediately.Many other people over train in the hopes of reaching the ""perfect body"" or ""perfect weight."" If you feel like you're using exercise to change your body and you're dissatisfied with yourself, you may want to consider seeking help to improve your body image.
If your friends or loved ones have expressed concern on the amount and intensity of physical activity you're doing take a step back to look at your routine. Keep an objective view and use your support group to decide whether or not you should seek mental health help and discontinue with activity.

, If you think you've been overtraining or over exercising, its time for a break and a visit to the doctor. This is especially true if you're experiencing any symptoms of overtraining or are eager to restart an exercise routine.


If you think you may be overdoing it or want to know what is safe and appropriate for your health and fitness level, think about talking to your doctor. She will be able to guide you on what's best.
Always see a doctor immediately if you start to notice any symptoms of overtraining. They usually worsen as you continue to push yourself which can be dangerous.

, It's great to be active regularly and get in a lot of physical activity — especially cardiovascular exercises (like jogging, swimming or using the elliptical machine). However, try to stick to the typical recommended amounts to avoid exercising too much.


Most health professionals recommended completing at least 150 minutes of cardio exercises each week. That's equivalent to five 30 minute sessions per week.If you want to do more exercise, it's safe to even participate in up to 300 minutes per week or about 60 minutes five to six days a week.There is no additional benefit of including more cardio exercise exceeding 300 minutes or an hour daily. Although you may be able to sustain this for a while, it could lead to over exercising.

, In addition to cardiovascular exercises, it's also recommended to do a few days of strength training as well. Like cardio, you do not need to do large amounts to get results.


Most health professionals only recommend doing strength training about one to two days a week. It's important to work every major muscle group and spend at least 20 minutes per session.If you're looking to significantly increase muscle mass, muscle strength or muscle definition, you'll most likely want to do more strength training than two 20 minute sessions each week. You can spend more time doing activities, but discontinue once you feel your muscles begin to fatigue.
However, you can see decent results without spending two hours in the weight room. Most people are able to see changes in muscle strength and definition with two or three 20 or 30 minute weight sessions., Light exercise before and after your workout may help you recover faster. The goal is to perform at least five to 10 minutes of light cardio exercise before and after your workout, such as walking. This helps increase heat and circulation to the body and helps prevent injury.

, If you want to be more active and be more fit, it's not always wise to just continue to add minutes to your cardio or strength routine. Mix it up by incorporating more lifestyle activity to maintain or improve your fitness levels.


Lifestyle activity doesn't include your exercises at the gym or your morning runs. Lifestyle activity are the exercises you do as part of your daily routine. It could be sweeping the floor, taking the stairs to your office or walking outside to get the newspaper.Lifestyle activities do not burn many calories by themselves. However, they can make a big difference by the end of an entire day.
Studies have even shown that those who participate in a lot of lifestyle activity see similar health benefits compared to those who only do structured exercise (like going for a 45 minute run).If you want to keep your body active, burn calories, support your metabolism and see some health benefits without over exercising, consider increasing your lifestyle activity. Try: parking farther away, taking the stairs more often, walking or biking to work, standing instead of sitting while you watch TV or taking a 10 minute walk break on your lunch.

, A great thing to have handy (for a whole host of reasons) is an exercise journal. This allows you to have a detailed log of the types, amounts and frequency of exercises you've done over the last several weeks. Use this to see if you've pushed yourself too much and when you need to take a break from exercise.


Keep a paper dairy or use an online app to track all of your exercise. Make sure to track what days you're exercising, what types of exercises you're performing, how long you're doing them and at what intensity.
Also track any symptoms as well. For example, you did your normal weight lifting routine, but had difficulty finishing the last set of reps. Or you did your normal five mile jog, but couldn't finish the last mile.
If you're already noticing some signs and symptoms of overtraining, try to backtrack and log exercises you've done in the last several weeks. Try to fill in as many days as you can so you can get an accurate look of what you've been doing.

, If you think it's time for a break from your normal exercise routine, don't think you have to stop being active completely. Instead, indulge in low intensity and restorative exercises.


Low intensity and restorative exercises allow your body to be active, but are easy on your muscles, joints, heart and mind. Many exercises fall into this category and can help keep you active without further damaging your body.
Restorative yoga is a great practice to start. You may even want to include this once a week to make sure you don't over train in the future. This type of yoga only includes five to six poses and typically use props to help your body relax. It's only light twisting. There aren't any muscle straining or strengthening exercises.You may also want to consider doing a few different types of low intensity exercises. You might want to go for a 20 minute walk, do some light swimming or do a slow pace on the elliptical.

, You may not realize it, but taking some rest days each week is equally important to your overall health and fitness ability. In addition, you may see little to no progress without adequate rest days.Rest days are important for a whole variety of reasons. First, it's during rest that your muscles recover. Therefore, it's actually during rest that they grow in strength and size.Adequate rest is also important mentally. Give your mind a break from intense exercise so you can relax and enjoy your time away from the gym.
Take at least one day of rest, maybe two each week. You can skip exercise all together or take some time for more restorative exercises.
It is recommended that you take at least 48 hours rest between workouts for the same body part. However, this is not fixed for everybody. If you find yourself overtraining, you may require up to 72 hours of rest before you exercise the same body part. Pay attention to recovery, mood and pain to assess how long your rest should be.

Guide the horse with your body.,
Talk to your horse.",How to Ride a Gaited Horse," Be aware that there are many types of gaited horses that vary considerably. Here are just a few of the most popular:


American Saddlebred - known for stylish presence and gentleness
Missouri Fox Trotter - known for its stamina, useful for trail riding or ranch work
Paso Fino - varies by kind, but can be favored for shows or trail rides
Tennessee Walker - has a flashy movement, but calm disposition;
, Once you've decided what kind of gaited horse you'd like to ride, find someone that offers lessons with the specific kind of horse you've chosen.


Taking lessons from an instructor can help you become more comfortable with your horse, safer on the trails, and a better rider in general. Don't assume that lessons only teach show tricks., At the stables, look for a gaited horse that is gentle, already trained to carry a rider, and has been used for trails.


Pick a horse that you connect with and you won't regret it. A happy horse won't try to throw its rider or impatiently mouth the bit at all times. Riding should be an enjoyable experience for horse and rider.

, Some gaited horses tend to have high withers so you might need to purchase a saddle with a high swell on the front. It can be very uncomfortable for any horse to wear an improperly fitting saddle.


The ridge between the horse's shoulder blades is the withers. Set the saddle slightly forward over the withers, then let slip it back till it seems to come to a natural stop. Your horse should not mind wearing the saddle; if it shows discomfort, readjust the saddle., Choose gear that is the most comfortable for your individual horse. Don't choose a bit based on breed or gait.Get advice from a professional or ask the previous owners what bit they used. Try a few different ones till you discover what your horse prefers.
If you're taking lessons or just riding at a stable, chances are you won't need to worry about the headstall, bit, or saddle. They'll already be chosen and the horse will be used to the equipment.

, Stand next to your horse or on your mounting block and hold the reins in your left hand. Place your left foot in the stirrup and swing your right leg over the horse. Gently lower yourself into the saddle.


If someone is giving you a leg-up, place your left foot into the stirrup and hold the front of the saddle, or pommel. Pull yourself up and swing your leg over before gently lowering yourself into the saddle.

, Avoid the urge to grip your horse with your legs. This will send confusing messages to your horse. Your legs should gently touch the horse's sides while your knees are bent and your heels are lower than your toes.If you find yourself continuing to grip the sides of the horse with your legs, check to make sure your stirrups are properly adjusted.

, This will evenly distribute your weight, making it easier for your horse to carry you. You should be able to imagine a straight line running from your ear, shoulder, hip, and heel.If you are out of alignment, your horse will find it difficult to carry you for long. You may notice your horse becoming uncomfortable or changing his gait to accommodate you.

, While your back should be straight, make sure not to arch your spine. The curved spine will make you sit too far forward which can tire you and your horse.An arched spine can lead to overall tension.


When you're tense, your horse will become tense as well. This can cause it to speed up or run off and make you unnecessarily tired and sore., This may seem like a strange way to begin riding, but realize that your horse will pick up on any tension or anxiety. When you're relaxed, your horse will relax too, allowing its joints and muscles to become more flexible.

, This lets your horse know that you're there. Be sure not to pull tightly on the reins, though. The horse will need space in order to move its head.


Use gentle hands to communicate through the reins. Work with a bit of slack in the reins. Your horse will pick up on the slight vibrations in the reins.If you constantly pull on your horse, it will become desensitized.

, Use your pelvic muscles to suggest a direction to your horse. Drive your pelvis forward or backward to encourage your horse in those directions.Developing these cues will take time and practice. Keep working with your horse to create this intuitive method of instruction.

, Use simple verbal cues to back up physical cues. For example, you can encourage your horse to move and stop by saying, ""walk,"" ""whoa,"" or ""ho.""


Be consistent in giving verbal directions. You should also give positive encouragement and support when your horse follows through with a direction. You can say, ""good horse/boy/girl,"" or rub its neck.

Stretch your hips.,
Stretch your hamstrings.,
Do turnout exercises.,
Stretch your leg against a wall.",How to Raise Your Leg up to Your Head1," The hips are ball and socket joints that help your legs move. Focusing on hip stretching can give you better range of motion in your legs. There are a number of hip stretches, including the hip flexor stretch, the hip rotator stretch, the floor hip stretch and the hip abductor stretch. To do the hip flexor stretch:Kneel on your right knee and put your opposite foot on the floor. Your opposite hip and knee should rest at a 90 degree angle.
Push your right hip forward until it is over your right knee. Keep your hands on your hips. Keep your back straight and your chest pushing forward.
Breathe into the stretch until you feel some tension in your hips. Hold the stretch for 15-60 seconds. Release the stretch switch to the other side. Repeat stretches on each side for a total of 5 times. Do these sets a couple of times every day.;
, The hamstrings are the muscles along the backside of your thighs. There are a number of ways to stretch these muscles; these exercises usually require some resistance or support surface to enable a good stretch, such as a doorway and wall, a table, a ballet barre, or the floor. To do a doorway stretch:Lie on the floor next to a doorway. Rest one leg flat on the floor through a doorway. Rest the other leg against the wall next to the doorway.
Start inching your body slowly toward the wall so that your leg is pushed against the wall. You should start to feel some tension in your hamstring muscle.
Hold the stretch for 15-60 seconds. Release the stretch switch to the other side. Repeat stretches on each side for a total of 5 times. Do these sets a couple of times every day.
Once you are able to do this stretch, try other hamstring stretches that require you to move your leg up higher or stretch it further, such as stretching your leg onto a table or sitting on the floor and stretching your hamstrings.

, Turnout exercises, also known as “butterfly” or “froggie” stretches, require that your legs bend out to the sides of your body, rotating at the hips. Turndowns are often performed by ballet dancers, but they are also useful for climbers and other athletes. They can help improve your leg flexibility. To do a turnout exercise:Sit on the floor with the soles of your feet together so that your legs form a diamond shape in front of you.
Hold onto your ankles and rest your elbows on your legs. Gently press down on your thighs with your elbows. Make sure that your arms are not resting on your knees at all; you can risk knee injury doing that.
Stretch until you feel mild tension in your inner thigh and groin area. Hold the position for 10-20 seconds and release. Stretch again for a slightly longer stretch, this time for 20-30 seconds.
Lie back so that your back rests on the floor. Keep your legs in their position. Let your knees fall down towards the ground. Make sure the soles of your feet are still together. Hold this pose for 30-60 seconds. Repeat this set a few times every day.

, After you have improved your flexibility to move your leg upwards, start stretching it against a wall. Put your foot against a wall and inch your body closer to the wall so that your leg moves upward little by little. Hold onto a chair or table for balance.


Have bare feet during this exercise, as socks may make your feet a little too slippery. You can risk injury if your foot slips up too quickly.
Practice with the other leg as well, so that you will be equally flexible on each side of your body.

Evaluate your core strength.,
Do plank exercises.,
Do side plank exercises.,
Do leg lifts.,
Do side leg lifts.,
Train using a kettleball.",How to Raise Your Leg up to Your Head2," Your core is the area of muscles in the trunk of your body. The core stabilizes your body, and a strong core allows you to perform many other exercises much more effectively.To determine your core strength:


Lay on the floor on your stomach. Place a long pipe, dowel, or ruler along your back. Place hour hands on the floor, shoulder-width apart. Do a push up with your legs straightened. If your chest and stomach leave the ground at the same time, then you have a stronger core.

, The plank is one of the fundamental core-building activities, working many muscles in your trunk at the same time.To do the plank:


Lie on the floor on your stomach and place your forearms on the ground shoulder-width apart.
Push up with your arms into a push-up position, keeping your elbows and forearms resting on the floor. Keep your body straight and tighten your core muscles to help alleviate strain on your arms.
Breathe evenly and hold for 60 seconds.
Relax for 60 seconds and then repeat 1-3 times every day.

, Once you’ve mastered the plank, it may become too easy for you. Try a more challenging version of the plank with the side plank. To do a side plank, start in the regular plank position. Then place one forearm on the ground with your elbow directly under your shoulder. Stack your feet on top of each other, twisting your body so that one side is on the ground. Push your body up while keeping your body straight., Leg lifts will help strengthen your lower back and abdominal muscles. To do a regular leg lift, lie on your back with your arms to your sides. Alternating legs, lift one leg about 12 inches straight off the ground, slowly and steadily. Hold for about 10 seconds and then lower it slowly to the floor. Do not bend your knee.Do 10 repetitions of these for each leg. Repeat 1-3 times every day.


To do a more challenging version, try lifting both legs off the ground at the same time. Raise them slowly and steadily until they are about 12 inches off the ground. Hold them steady for a count of ten and then slowly lower them to the floor.

, Stand tall with your feet together. Put your hands on your hips. Slowly and steadily, lift one leg straight out to the side until it is about 6 inches off the floor. Lower your leg slowly. Do not let your body lean to one side. Keep your body straight up and down. Repeat 10 times on this side. Do the same exercise for the other leg. Repeat 1-3 times every day.Tighten your core muscles and gluteus muscles (buttocks) to keep your body stable.
As you get stronger, lift your leg up higher. Alternately, try lifting your leg straight out in front of you. Work to be able to lift your leg up a little higher every day. Be sure to hold onto something for balance support.

, A kettleball is a small iron weight with a handle. By lifting a kettleball, you are forced to use your core to maintain your balance.To strengthen your core, start with a 10-pound kettleball and work through various exercises, such as the half-kneeling halo.


Half-kneeling halo: Kneel on one leg. Hold the kettleball in both hands in front of your chest. Lift the weight up to your right shoulder. Next, bring the weight around to the back of your head. Third, bring the weight to your left shoulder. Finally, bring the weight back to your chest. Repeat going in the opposite direction. Complete this set 5 times and then kneel on your other leg and do another 5 sets.Do kettleball exercises 3-4 times each week.

Balance on one foot.,
Try the one-legged clock with arms.,
Do trunk turns.,
Do a single-leg dead lift.",How to Raise Your Leg up to Your Head3," Balancing on one foot, especially while moving parts of your body at the same time, will helps you continually adjust to keep your body weight balanced.


Stand with both feet together. Raise one foot a few inches off the ground. Stand like this for a few seconds with your eyes open. Then close your eyes and continue to hold the pose. Repeat on the other side. Do this set about 5 times every day., For this move, your arms will swing around like the hands of a clock while you balance on one leg. Stand on one leg and look straight ahead. Put your hands on your hips. Raise one arm up to the 12 o’clock position, then start to move your arm around to the 3, downward to the 6, and over to the 9. Repeat with the other leg and arm.Try to move as little as possible except for your arms. Breathe evenly and concentrate on keeping your body still.

, Your trunk is the core of your body, and practicing balance with a focus on your trunk will help you stabilize your body and improve your balance. To do trunk turns, stand with your feet just more than shoulder-width apart. Stand on a mini trampoline or other surface that is somewhat squishy or malleable. Hold a heavy item in your hands, such as an exercise ball, a weight, or something similar. Turn your body at your waist to one side and then the other about 10 times.Make the movement a smooth and deliberate motion, but don’t swing back and forth. You want your body to work for every twist of your trunk. Don’t use the momentum of the twist to propel you into another twist.

, This exercise requires your legs to be very strong and able to balance while you lift a weight upwards. To do this exercise, balance on your left foot and keep your left knee slightly bent. Bend forward at the hips and touch the ground with your right hand. Hold onto a 5-pound weight with that hand. Raise your right leg behind you. Move smoothly back to an upright position. Repeat with the other leg. Do up to 5 sets of this exercise a few times a week.Practice doing this movement in one clean, smooth motion. Try not to wobble around. Breathe evenly and focus on engaging your core and leg muscles to keep your movement deliberate.

Eat nutrient-rich foods.,
Stay hydrated.,
Get lots of sleep.,
Avoid smoking.",How to Raise Your Leg up to Your Head5," Eating good foods and staying away from refined carbohydrates and refined sugars can help give you the energy you need to exercise efficiently and effectively. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and protein-rich foods.

, Being dehydrated can contribute to weakened athletic performance, even if you are just stretching your body. Drink lots of plain water every day. You can also increase your intake of water-based foods, such as watermelon, celery, and soups, to get some additional fluids.


When you exercise, be sure to increase your intake of water. About an hour before your workout, drink 25-30 ounces of water. During your workout, drink 8 ounces of water every 15 minutes.Avoid alcohol and caffeine, both of which can dehydrate your body.

, Getting 7-8 hours of sleep every night will help you be well rested. This will improve your ability to exercise and focus on your goal of raising your leg over your head.

, Staying away from smoking can help you maintain a healthy body. Inhaling smoke can contribute to weakened lung capacity, and it can dehydrate your body.

Place your treadmill in a safe location away from walls, windows, or mirrors that can cause extreme injuries if you fall down or off the treadmill.,
Remove any existing sharp objects or household goods away from the treadmill, such as pointy sculptures or furniture with sharp corners.

,
Place power cords or cables away from foot traffic surrounding the treadmill so you do not trip or fall as you step on and off the treadmill.

,
Store your treadmill in a locked room if you have children to prevent them from treating the treadmill as if it were a toy.

,
Place a television straight across the room in front of your treadmill so you can see it easily while you exercise.,
Wear proper athletic shoes that are secured to your feet instead of casual shoes such as flip-flops or high heels to prevent injuries.,
Place each of your feet outside of the rotating belt when you start the treadmill.,
Slow your pace down gradually before you stop the treadmill completely to prevent yourself from falling.

,
Pause or turn off your treadmill completely if you need to step away for a brief moment to prevent animals, children, or other family members from getting hurt while you are away.

,
Walk or run consistently in the center of the rotating belt.,
Push the ""Stop"" button to immediately decrease the speed of and stop the treadmill if an emergency occurs.,
Use the handrails only for a few minutes at the beginning of your workout or long enough to familiarize yourself with a specific pace or incline.,
Begin your treadmill workout by walking, jogging, or running at a slow pace around 3 miles (4.82 kilometers) per hour for between 5 and 10 minutes to loosen and warm up your joints and muscles.,
Increase your treadmill speeds and inclines gradually over several weeks as you continue to train your body and become more comfortable with using a treadmill.

,
End your treadmill workout by gradually reducing your incline and pace until your heart rate returns to a calmer level.,
Step down from the treadmill carefully and slowly after your workout to prevent yourself from experiencing sudden dizziness or vertigo.",How to Use a Treadmill Safely,";
,,,,


Position the television on stable furniture far enough away where you cannot fall into it and where it is not affected by any bouncing caused by the treadmill.

,


If your athletic shoes have laces, make the knots extremely tight so the shoelaces do not unravel or get caught in the treadmill's rotating belt.







,


This procedure is done as a safety precaution in the event your treadmill begins at an extremely fast pace.
This will also allow the motor to start up and adjust to your chosen speed without being hindered by your body weight.

,,,


If you are positioned too close to the rear of the treadmill, you risk falling off, whereas walking or running too close to the front of the treadmill may cause you to step or trip on the motor cover.







,


If you drop an item such as a mobile phone, portable music player, or free weight, push the ""Stop"" button before you retrieve your item to prevent injuries.

,


Using the handrails consistently throughout your workout may eventually strain or injure your ankles, shins, arms, elbows, and shoulders.
The handrails may also reduce the overall effectiveness of your workout because you must be able to swing your arms naturally and freely.

,


Performing a warm-up exercise prior to your treadmill workout will increase your blood flow and heart rate while lowering your risk for potential injuries.

,,


Some treadmills are equipped with heart-rate and cool-down features that will notify you of your current heart-rate and gradually reduce your pace and incline until the treadmill stops completely.







,


You may want to help steady yourself using the handrails when your treadmill workout is complete.

Do five high kicks.,
Deliver five kicks to the middle of the bag.,
Deliver a knee strike to the bag.",How to Use a Heavy Bag," Heavy bags come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They can weigh between 20 and 100 lbs (9 and 45 kgs). They can range from 2 feet (.6 meters) in diameter to 4 (1.2 meters) or more. Ultimately, you need to decide what type of bag is best for you. Some examples of bags include:


A conventional heavy bag. These are large bags that you can punch, kick, or run into.
Maize bags. These bags are tear shaped or round, filled with corn, and are great for practicing different types of punches.
An angle heavy bag. These bags are similar to a conventional bag, but the upper half of the bag has a larger diameter. These bags are good for uppercuts and other angled punches.;
, The location you pick should be one that will allow you to move around the bag. As a result, avoid picking a spot up against a wall or next to a column. The best place to hang your bag is in a large area, at least 10 feet by 10 feet (3 meters by 3 meters), and preferably larger.Ideal places to hang your bag are garages, large recreation rooms, or on a porch or patio.

, The place you choose to hang the bag should be able to support whatever weight bag you choose. It can either be a wooden or metal rafter, or a hook that is capable of supporting a lot of weight.


Install a hook into a support beam in your ceiling. You can purchase heavy bag ceiling hooks at sporting goods stores or online.
Tie your heavy bag to an exposed wooden or metal rafter or beam.
Purchase a freestanding hanger. The benefit of freestanding hangers is that you won’t need to install a hook into your ceiling or do anything invasive in your home. The downside is that you won’t be able to move completely around your bag.
Use a door jamb pull-up bar to hang your heavy bag., While you can punch your bag without gloves, it is best to use the opportunity to get used to how they feel. In addition, using gloves will soften the impact and possibly prevent hand injuries.Even if you don't box, you should use boxing gloves when punching a heavy bag.

, Your knees should be bent a little bit and your weight should rest on the balls of your feet. This will enable you to move around the bag quicker.


By bending your knees, you'll also be better able to safely absorb impact if and when you do box someone., Your feet should be separated by the width of your shoulders. If you don’t stand like this, you won’t be balanced and may fall. In addition, you won’t be able to direct as much power as you need into the punching bag.


The perfect stance may vary for some people. You may be more comfortable a few inches shorter or wider than your shoulder width. Experiment until you find the perfect way to stand., Your elbows should be tucked in tightly next to your body. This will make it easier for you to defend yourself if you ever box another person. Tucked elbows protect not only your arms but your torso., When hitting your bag, your default stance should be one when your fists are raised in front of you with one slightly higher than the other. When in this stance, your fists should not be tight and your thumbs should not be tucked in under other fingers.


Keep your fists relaxed until you go in for a punch., When connecting with the bag, your fists should be raised. Punch the bag and let your fist recoil back to you after it connects with the bag. Ideally, you want to let the rebound of the impact send your fist back toward your body., When punching, never fully extend your arms (or legs). This could cause tendon and ligament problems, fractured bones, or broken bones. Instead, allow your arms to remain bent slightly. If you need to get closer to the bag, do so.


Your elbows (or knees) should never lock completely.

, While it’s okay to do single punches, sometimes you may want to practice with a series of punches. To do this, throw one punch and quickly follow it with another punch or two. You can choose to punch with the same fist or to alternate.


To time your punches appropriately, think of three punches making a “rat-ta-tat” noise., After delivering a sequence of punches, pause briefly. Your pause can range from one to three seconds, but should not exceed three seconds., As you deliver single punches or sequences of punches, you should move around the bag in a relaxed manner. Punching in a relaxed manner will get you a better cardio workout and improve your agility.You can choose to move in a clockwise, counterclockwise, or back-and-forth pattern.

, Although you want to move around the bag, don’t run or jump around it. Running or jumping around the bag will waste energy and tire you out. In addition, you could learn bad habits, make missteps, and hurt yourself., Alternate hands and punch your bag twenty times. Break these up into sequences or deliver single punches -- whatever you prefer. The most important thing is that you use your routine to perfect single or sequenced punches.


Make sure to keep your guard up while delivering punches to the bag., Aim to hit the right side of your bag. Swing your left arm in a long-arched fashion to make the hit. Withdraw a few steps from the bag after delivering your punch. Then, complete four more left hooks., Take aim at the left side of your bag. Then, take your right arm, extend it in an arch, and hit the bag. Just like with the left hook, you should withdraw a few steps after delivering the punch. After you’ve completed one, reengage the bag and complete four more right hooks., Aim for the lower portion of the bag. Decide which foot you want to kick with, then turn slightly on your support hip so your kicking leg is closer to the bag. Then, turn your hip, raise your foot, and kick the bag.


Complete five repetitions with each leg., Aim for the top half of the heavy bag. Envision an opponent’s head. Raise your hands to guard your chin. Pivot slightly so your kicking leg is closer to the bag, raise your leg high, and make contact with the bag.


Complete five repetitions with each leg., Choose the leg you want to kick with. Then, pivot slightly on your hip and the ball of your foot. Lift your leg and deliver a blow to the middle section of the bag.Switch legs and do five more repetitions with the opposite leg.

, Stand one foot in front of the bag with your legs spread shoulder length. Dip your knees down slightly. Then, raise one knee and use it to strike the bag. You should make contact with the middle of the bag.


Complete five repetitions with each knee."

Pull the ring open with pliers.,
Remove the bead.,
Twist the ring.,
Position the ring inside your piercing.,
Fit the bead back onto the ring.",How to Put a Hoop Nose Ring in1," You might be able to do this by hand if the ring is fairly thin, but for 14 gauge rings and thicker, you might struggle to open and close the ring. If that happens, you can use captive ring opening/closing pliers. Softly pick up one side of the ring with your pliers and hold the other side with your hands, then bend and twist carefully., The bead or ball of a captive ring is held in place using nothing but pressure. When you release the pressure on both sides of the bead, it will fall out. Hold the ring on either side of the bead. With your hands or pliers, gently pull both sides of the ring in opposite directions, pulling them apart. Avoid stretching the ring open too far, since this could make it difficult to fit the ends back together.

, After you remove the bead, twist the ring into a semi-spiral shape, so you can easily fit it into your piercing. Turn one end clockwise and the other counterclockwise, but do this as little as needed. If you twist the ring ends too far apart, you might have difficulty twisting them back together again.

, Feed one end of the ring into the piercing hole on your nose. Gradually wind the ring further into the hole until the center rests inside the piercing and the opening lies directly below it.

, The bead should have small dimples on either side. Fit the ends of the ring into these dimples by placing one side of the bead onto one end of the ring. Carefully twist the two ends toward each other again until they line up evenly. Then, push the second end onto the other side of the bead. Once the bead is snug and secure, the nose ring is set in place.

Prepare for the round-off by standing with your feet together and your arms at your sides.,
Run several steps.,
Raise your arms toward the end of your run.,

Jump into the air with your arms raised after you land the round-off.,
Keep your back straight and your head facing forward.,
Land with your knees slightly bent if the round-off is your last move.",How to Do a Roundoff," It may help to visualize yourself doing the skill to completion before you get started.;
, Beginning with whatever foot is most comfortable, take a few running steps. Most gymnasts find it easiest to take a quick hop with their weakest leg and their first running step with their stronger leg.Run just enough steps to reach speed necessary to complete the round-off and propel yourself into whatever move comes next, keeping in mind the space you need to complete your forward routine.


For best results, you should use the same number of steps each time you practice and perform a round-off.

, You are preparing to put your hands on the ground for the round-off.

, A hurdle is completed when you skip into your last step before you put your hands on the ground.









In gymnastics, a hurdle is the transitional motion between a run and setting up for a skill.Remember to hurdle out, not up.
Bend the knee you will use to step into the lunge and propel yourself into the round-off.

, Bend your stronger leg so that if you were standing still you would be standing in a lunge position with your arms over your head. Then propel your body forward with the bent leg.









In gymnastics, a lunge is the position used to initiate a tumbling or control skill.The lunge is recognizable because the front leg is bent and the back leg is straight.Keep your toes pointed straight ahead. If you toes are pointed left or right, your round-off will go in the opposite direction.

, This will help to make your round off better and more powerful.

, Lifting your head will disturb your balance and momentum and tucking it too close to your body will cause you to over-rotate your round-off.

, When making a round-off, the first hand goes down just like in a cartwheel, but the second hand is placed down almost perpendicular to the first, so that it can propel your body 180 degrees.


Imagine a sideways ""T"" when placing your hands on the floor. The first hand you put down should be horizontal and the second hand vertical to achieve this ""T.""
Make sure you don't leap into the round off. Your second foot should not leave the floor before the first hand contacts the floor., If your body represents a clock, you would bring your legs together in the 1 o'clock position.


Snap your legs together as quickly as you can, but do not smack your heels together. Smashing your heels together could cause a points deduction in competition.

, If you got a good running start and brought your legs together as you began coming down from the round-off, you will have the momentum necessary to push off the ground.








, This means you will bend at the waist, and your feet will be slightly lower than your hips.









Many people make the mistake of piking or tucking their legs and letting their feet touch the ground while their hands are still on it. Push off hard with your hands, keeping your body banana shaped with feet before your hips, before your feet hit the ground., This will prepare you for any tumbling skills you want to connect with your round-off.


Both legs should finish at the same time, positioned together with your feet facing backward from their starting position.

, This is the rebound, and the height you achieve will come from the power in your round-off.









If transitioning to another move, the rebound will propel you into it., The roundoff will often transition directly into a back handspring or a back tuck., If you have to take more than one backward step, you are off balance and need to work on your control.









Don't land too deeply by taking too large a step backward, but a small step may help you absorb the landing so you do not hyper-extend and damage your knees.
For maximum points, stick your landing with your knees bent, arms up covering your ears and arch your back with your chest up and butt in.

Bring both feet together, standing tall.",How to Do a Needle in Cheerleading," Everyone's body has tight areas and looser areas.


Stretching early and often helps keep you limber. Remember, you will become less flexible as you get older, so start early.;
, Do you know where your Gluteus Maximus is? Probably! What about your Iliopsoas or your Semitendinosus? These muscles are important to your needle! You have to overextend your back, torso and leg muscles to do a needle. Learning the muscles' names and how they work within your body will make stretching for this position easier.
Tighter muscles are typical around the back and torso. These areas will need extra stretching., Muscles have a long memory. If you have injured a muscle, it might be tighter than the rest. Give it extra love and attention, and extra stretching to prevent future harm.


Muscle tears can occur. If they do, they can reduce your motor skills, as well as create scar tissue. Be careful! , Do jumping jacks, brisk walking or jogging to warm up your muscles.


Don't stretch with cold muscles. Working on a needle with cold muscles can hurt your posture and form, which may result in injury., A routine is important for preparing your body for exertion and contortions involved in doing a needle. Stretching prepares your body for the needle posture. Also, stretching triggers your muscle memory and believe it or not, can remember what to do! Remember, stretching is not itself a warm-up.
Start with major muscle groups. Shoulders, torso, gluts, thighs, and back.

, Breathing is key to the optimal performance of your mind and body.In the middle of a routine, you're exerting all of your energy and breathing is essential.With time, the resistance and tightness will release. Keep breathing!

, It can take time to perfect the splits while on the floor. It can take even longer to do it with both legs! But, it's important to the needle posture, so don't rush this step.


Most people have one leg that is more flexible than the other. But, stretch both legs equally.
Your more flexible leg might end up being your supporting leg. If so, this is another reason to stretch both legs equally.
Alternately point and flex your front leg's foot while in the splits.
Keep your back leg's knee rolled towards the ground, not twisted to the side., Once you are in the splits on the floor, you need to stretch your chest, shoulders and back muscles. To do this, reach backwards and hold your back leg with both hands.


Breathe calmly and regularly during this process.

, Once you're comfortable with the splits on the floor, you need to move onto to gently hyper-extending your splits.


Place your front leg ankle and heel on a few inches of gymnastic mat, rolled up yoga mat, yoga block, or even a rolled up towel, and descend into the split position.
Gradually increase the height of the mat, block or rolled towel until you have flexibility and no discomfort while hyperextended.

, This motion results in the posture that you'll have in the needle while standing up, except here you are supported by the ground.


Check in with your body and see if how it feels to move into this position slowly, and don't forget to be patient if you encounter tightness in your muscles.
Continue leaning backwards until you can do so without discomfort. Remember that this is the posture you must acquire to do a needle.

, This is the same posture you were in on the floor, but this time you are balancing while standing upright.


Use the doorframe as a buttress for your upper leg and body.
Depending on where you place your standing leg, you can increase or decrease the stretch and hyperextension.

, Do this with your hands overhead while in the splits.


Again, take it slowly here, since you are using different muscles when you're standing versus sitting on the floor.

, Sink into the splits, or the hyperextended splits, while holding onto your upper leg with both hands behind you.


This is the posture that most closely approximates the free-standing needle, so take your time in perfecting your balance and comfort.
Take your time and be patient!

, This is the correct posture for kicking into the needle and will minimize injury.


Do not transform a scorpion into a needle as the way to get into the needle position.
Though it may be easier for stretching, moving from a scorpion into a needle will twist and tweak your posture and balance, making injury more likely.
Going from a scorpion into a needle also takes longer and shifts your balance. This is not good when you're up in the air!

, Aligning your shoulders and hips is essential for elegant, energized posture in the needle.

, Kicking off of the ground with a strong punch sweeps your leg all the way towards the back of your head. It can be difficult to do this motion at the beginning. If it is, try holding your leg out in front of you at a forty-five degree angle and let gravity help you to get enough momentum to kick the leg higher and higher., Once you've caught your leg, re-point foot and toe, and smile!


Luckily you have two hands to catch this wild leg, so at first touch, grab on tight, expand your chest and drop your shoulders, and show them your smile!

, If you have more than a millisecond that you need to hold the needle, balance yourself, breathe, and relax into the position.

, Breathing deeply keeps you calm and centered in this difficult posture, and allows you to function optimally during the stunt., This is a tried and true tip from the ballet world, called ""spotting,"" which results in activating your core and refocusing your center of gravity while spinning or in the air.""Spotting"" prevents loss of balance and centers your posture.

, Remember that you'll be in the needle in unpredictable circumstances: perhaps you'll be moving sideways or dismount with a twist.

, Wearing different shoes, including shoes other than your cheerleading shoes, changes the placement of your toes, the ball of your foot and heel, which mimics the movement of your foot while it's in the hands of your bases.


Better to practice ahead of time so that you can handle all sorts of circumstances.

, Or, do both at the same time and grab a friend to video your technique.


Look over the footage together to see what looks good, what doesn't and tweak your performance so that your needle looks strong, elegant and flawless.

, Depending on your body, this posture will continue to challenge you, so don't stop challenging yourself while stretching.

, Practice, practice, practice, and repeat as many steps as necessary.

, This puts an exclamation point (!) on your impressive needle, and energizes your body for the release and dismount.

, There is no need to make this more forceful than it will already be.


Remember, you have tension and gravity to help you, so try to make your dismount elegant.

, Stand up tall, bring your hands down to your side, and extend and straighten leg as it descends.

, Remember how gymnasts who vault always have trouble sticking the landing? Take your performance to the next level by releasing the needle with control and certainty, bringing both feet together and standing tall, with a smile, of course!

Twist the ends of the ring with your hands.,
Fit the ring into the piercing.,
Twist the ends closed.",How to Put a Hoop Nose Ring in2," Captive ring pliers may distort the shape of this ring. Locate the split in the ring and grab the metal on either side with both hands. Move your right hand clockwise and your left hand counterclockwise so that the ends twist away from each other in a subtle spiral.Only twist the hoop open enough to create a gap around the pierced portion of your nose.
Do not pull the ends apart sideways, since it will be nearly impossible to squeeze the ends back together again.

, Glide one open end of the hoop into the piercing hole. Slide the rest of the ring through the hole, until the bottom of the hoop is centered in the piercing and the opening lies directly below it.

, Use your fingers to gently twist both ends of the ring back toward each other, until they are brought together. Make sure the ends are brought as close as possible. This will keep the hoop secure, and the edges of the ends from scraping your nose."

Push the segment to the side.,
Position the ring inside the piercing.,
Ease the segment back onto the ring.,
Snap the segment into place.,
Use pliers for thicker gauges.",How to Put a Hoop Nose Ring in3," The segment is held in place with prongs and pressure. By pushing it to the side, you ease the pressure off, freeing the prongs and making it easier to detach. Hold the hoop with the segment positioned on top. Grab the segment with your index finger and thumb of one hand, while steadying the bottom of the ring with the other hand. Gently push the segment to one side until it pops out.


Do not try to yank the segment straight out. If you try to remove the segment without releasing the pressure first, you may snap the prongs off.

, Feed one end of the main hoop through your nose piercing. Continue feeding the hoop through the hole, until the bottom is centered inside the piercing and the opening lies directly below it.

, Push one end of the segment onto one end of the ring, while gently twisting the other end of the ring to the side. Widen the gap as you twist. Once one end of the segment is secure, twist the unattached end of the ring back towards the segment.


Remember to make the opening a little larger. If not, you may not be able to snap the segment on completely or evenly.
Do not pull the ring apart sideways.
Do not twist the ends apart any further than necessary to snap the segment back in place.

, Push the prong in to completely secure the segment. Once this is done, the hoop should be safely tucked into the piercing and ready to wear.

, Placing the segment back on is much more difficult than taking it out. You might find it easier to use your hands with smaller gauges, like a 20 or 18 gauge. For 16, 14 and thicker gauges you may need to use opening/closing pliers.

Listen to your body when starting a new routine.",How to Work Out Naked," Basic pushups are simple to do at home, and can easily be done in the nude. This is a classic exercise that requires no equipment other than your own body.To start, lift your body off the ground with your hands flat on the floor and your fingertips facing forward. Keep your hands near your hips and your shoulders pulled back. Place your legs and feet in the plank position.
Lower your body downward slowly by bending your elbows. Keep lowering yourself until your chest or chin touch the floor.
Straighten your elbows until you're back in the start position. Then, repeat the exercise. Keep going until you've done as many pushups as you can.;
, Downward dog is a simple yoga position that can help build strength. It can easily be done in the nude. To start, stand on all fours. Have your hands under your elbows and your fingertips facing forward.Push your legs and feet backwards until you're in a plank position. Stand on your tiptoes to lift your body off the ground. Then, shift your weight backwards and raise your hips until your body forms a v-position. Keep your head aligned with your spine. Exhale as you move your body upward.
Then, inhale and return to the starting position. Do as many repetitions as are comfortable for you.

, To start, lie on your right side. Bend your knees and stack your legs on top of one another. Lift your body up by bending your right elbow and supporting your weight with your right arm. Keep your head aligned with your spine.Lift your hips off the ground as you exhale. Keep your head and spine aligned.
Return to the starting position as you inhale. Do as many repetitions that are comfortable to you, and then repeat on the other side.

, This activity requires a bit more movement, so it can help raise your heart rate slightly. To start, stand up straight with your feet hip length apart. Keep your arms at your side, with your shoulder blades pulled down slightly.Crouch downward by shifting your hips and back down and bending your knees. Keep lowering yourself until your heels nearly hit the floor.
Then, quickly launch yourself into the air. Strive to keep your feet level with each other as you jump.
Try to land softly, with your feet still level. Push your hips back slightly to absorb some of the impact. Then, repeat.

, To start, stand with your feet together and shoulders pulled back. Lift up one foot and briefly balance on one leg. Then, step forward and land on your raised foot.Lower your body until you feel discomfort. Try to get your thigh parallel to the floor.
Push off the ground with the leg you lifted. Return to the starting position. Repeat the movement with your other leg.

, As you likely do not want your neighbors peeking in on you exercising in the nude, keep any blinds or curtains in your home closed. This is especially important if you live in a home where it's difficult to avoid windows.Curtains generally shut out more than blinds. If possible, exercise in an area of your home near curtains.
If you have a spot in your home away from windows altogether, like a basement, opt to exercise there.

, If you have somewhat flimsy blinds, you may want some extra coverage from prying eyes. Plant life can help shut out the outside view. If there's a window near a tree, shrub, or other type of foliage, opt to exercise here.The bigger and bushier the plants, the more privacy you will get.

, If you have a courtyard or backyard in your home, you may want to exercise by a window looking over this space. You're less likely to get random people walking through a courtyard or backyard than the street.However, if you live in an apartment complex, your neighbors may frequently walk through the courtyard. In this case, it may be better to work out elsewhere.

, If your home is surrounded by fences or walls, opt to workout near windows overlooking such obstructions. This will limit people walking by from seeing into your home., As yoga is a fairly low intensity activity, many areas offer nude yoga classes. Many people enjoy such classes as they get used to being naked in the presence of others, helping with body acceptance, and they also have an instructor guide them through a routine.You can look online for nude classes in your area. If there are any gyms or spas that are clothing-optional, you may find nude yoga classes here.
If you can't find a nude class, you can always do a yoga routine from your home while naked.

, There may be spas in your area that are clothing optional. Many spas have exercise classes, such as yoga, and may also have gyms and gym equipment. If you want to go somewhere to work out naked, look into a day pass at a nude spa.Spas may have rules regarding how to use equipment when naked, so make sure you follow all rules. You may, for example, not be allowed to use certain workout equipment while naked.

, If you want to do something like water aerobics, there may be a nude beach near you. There are many nude beaches in the United States and other countries. This can be a great place to work out nude.In the United States, there are nude beaches in many states. Texas, Oregon, California, and Hawaii, for example, are all home to nude beaches.

, Working on naked requires the same basic workout safety as any other exercise routine. Prior to working out, warm up. After you're done, cool down.A warm up is generally some light activity prior to a workout routine. You can pace for about 10 minutes in your home, or do 10 minutes of light stretching.
To cool down, repeat the same process. Do about 10 minutes of lighter activity.

, Sports bras can help support your breasts during a workout routine. They help keep your weight supported, allowing for better posture during a workout. If your breasts are sensitive due to pregnancy or breastfeeding, a sport bra may be necessary.If working out nude is important to you, you don't have to wear a sports bra. For lower intensity activities, like yoga or Pilates, a sports bra is probably not necessary.
However, if you're doing more vigorous cardio, your body may benefit from the support of a sports bra. If your breasts start to feel sore during a workout, you may want to throw on at least a sports bra for your routine.

, Jockstraps and athletic underwear support sensitive areas of the body, serving a similar function to sports bras. You may need the support of athletic underwear or a jockstrap if you're engaging in vigorous activity in the nude. If you start to feel sore, buy underwear or a jockstrap., When working out in the nude, you should remain in tune with your body. Overexertion can lead to injury. With a new workout routine, pay attention to signs your body needs to rest and recuperate.If you feel faint after a workout, cut back the next day.
If a workout leaves you with aches and pains that persist for days, you need to cut back slightly on the intensity.

Get your supplies.,
Prepare.,
Numb it (optional).,
Pull the bottom part of your nose down and put the clamp where it feels good to pierce.,
After pulling out the needle quickly insert the jewelry.,
You're done.

",How to Pierce Your Septum," You will need: A needle (pre sterile!), alcohol swabs, a curved barbell, and the correct type of clamp.;
, The needle should be sterile. Cannula needles (most often used in piercing parlours in the UK and in hospitals) usually arrive in an autoclave pouch. There is no safe way to sterilise needles or equipment at home without an autoclave, so only order autoclaved materials. Get an alcohol wipe and clean the inside of the nose on the cartilage you will pierce. Find the 'soft spot' which is located near the tip of the nose and where the cartilage is thinner.

, Unless you have a high pain tolerance you will need to numb your nose or else it will hurt more. Using ice is not an appropriate way to numb a septum, and using a hospital-grade numbing spray has a tendency to not work on septum piercings, even if held on the area for a long time.

, Septums are considered one of the most painful piercings, and if you hold the clamp down hard enough you may be able to numb some of the pain. With the clamp in place, put the needle through one side of the nose, and in one smooth and quick motion, push it through. If you used a cannula needle, remove the needle and keep the cannula inside the piercing, and trim to size. Hopefully you used a good needle, which is hollow. Place the jewellery inside the piercing however you have to depending on the needle you used.

, If you used a hollow point needle or cannula, as you pull the needle out you should have the one side of the barbell in your nose. Attach the other ball to the barbell immediately.

Visit your doctor.,
Keep it clean.,
Do not remove your nose stud.",How to Treat an Infected Nose Piercing1," If you have just had your nose pierced, it's totally normal to have redness and some pain around the site of the piercing. However, look out for any of these symptoms:


Red, inflamed streaks or marks on the skin that radiate out from the piercing site.
Increased pain, redness, swelling, heat, or tenderness around the piercing site.
Yellow-green pus-like discharge coming from the piercing site. It's normal to see a bit of oozing or bleeding from the pierce, but be alert for pus combined with swelling and redness.
Swollen or tender lymph glands above or below the piercing.
Fever. If you're otherwise healthy (no cold or flu), and you develop a fever, this is cause for concern.;
, If you have any of the above symptoms and you have an infection, it's important to take care of it properly. Most infections of this nature are caused by Staphylococcusand can be quite dangerous if not addressed.


They will likely prescribe an antibiotic cream or tablets. Apply the cream topically or take the prescribed medication, usually for about ten days to two weeks.
Take the full course of antibiotics to prevent a recurrence of the infection.

, Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and antibacterial soap, scrub under your nails to remove any dirt and air-dry your hands.


Using a towel could cause your hands to be come un-hygienic again, even if the towel looks clean.

, This might seem like a good idea but there is the possibility you'll cause an abscess. Always leave the stud in unless your physician recommends you take it out.


Note that if you are having an allergic reaction rather than an infection, you'll want to remove the stud immediately. Signs of an allergic reaction include a burning sensation on the skin, an expanding wound, and/or a clear yellow discharge.

You want to go to a place that has a good standing reputation with experienced piercers. If you take the time and effort to visit a professional, your piercing has a much better chance of healing correctly and faster. Also, professional piercers will offer expert advice to help you take care of your piercing after you leave. Some things to ensure you have a safe piercing include:


A hollow piercing needle. Professional body piercers use these needles because they're hygienic and easy to control, for straight and properly-placed piercings that heal quickly.Avoid piercing guns. Using a nose piercing gun is likely to cause more pain and aren't normally used for nose piercings because they can be less accurate. Besides, since piercing guns are sometimes harder to clean, they can easily transfer blood-borne infections.;
, You want to wash your hands with anti-bacterial soap anytime you touch and handle your piercing. Your face already has oils on it, and those oils, along with the secretions coming from your freshly pierced nose (clear fluids, sometimes blood), and dirt on your hands, can lead to an infection.

, Once you are pierced, you shouldn't remove the jewelry from your nose for at least 6-8 weeks, which is considered the normal healing time. The only time you should remove the original jewelry, is if there is something wrong with the size or material of the jewelry.If you want to change your jewelry while your piercing is still healing stage (6-8 weeks after the initial piercing), you should contact your piercer and have them do it for you.

, You want to be gentle with your new piercing. First, your should use a cotton ball or q-tip with water to wipe off any built up crust that may have formed. While initially you might think cleaning with alcohol or peroxide would kill all of the bacterial cells, they also happen to kill the healing cells in and on your nose, so don't use those harsh cleaners. A safe and easy way to clean a new piercing is by using a saline solution. Sea salt dissolved in water is a gentle and effective saline solution. You can soak a cotton ball or q-tip in the saline solution, or you can soak your nose piercing in a bigger bowl of the saline solution. If you soak your nose piercing, you should soak it for 5-10 minutes at least once a day.After your soak, you can rinse your nose with clean water to remove any leftover saline solution. To make this saline solution at home you will need:


1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized (iodine-free) sea salt.
1 cup (8 oz.) of warm distilled or bottled water.

, Sometime a piercing will obviously be infected. Other times, the infection might not be so easy to identify. When you first get a piercing done, there might be some initial bleeding, swelling around the piercing site, sensitivity, bruising, itchy irritation, and a whitish-yellow discharge (which is not pus) coming from the piercing. This discharge can form some crust on the jewelry, but that crust formation is okay and normal. Knowing the difference between normal side effects after having a piercing done, and infection side effects, can help you treat your infection better. Some of the most common signs that your piercing is infected is:


Persistent itchiness and/or redness that continues after the normal healing period.
Persistent soreness and tenderness that continues after the normal healing period.
A hot, burning sensation.
Yellow-green seepage of liquid, such as pus or blood, from the hole.
Bad smells coming from the piercing site., An infection and an allergic reaction have similar symptoms, so the best way to distinguish between the two is to know how they differ from one another: An allergic reaction is different from an infection, in that an allergic reaction includes a a severe burning feeling, a bigger hole from the initial piercing (as if the skin is trying to move away from the metal stem of the piercing), and a clearish-yellow discharge rather than a discharge that is yellow-greenish. If you think you are experiencing an allergic reaction, you should have your piercer change out the piercing jewelry immediately, and visit a doctor.Some metals can cause an allergic reaction, so it is best to use quality metal studs made from things like surgical steel, titanium, platinum, niobium, and gold if it is 14k or higher., Continuing to clean your piercing with soap and water or a saline solution will help to wash out the bacteria causing the infection. A nose piercing infection can be caused by a number of things such as the entry of outside pathogens (bacteria and fungi), wearing very tight jewelry, or unhygienic ways of living. Just be sure to keep cleaning your piercing regularly until it fully heals, (normally 6-8 weeks after getting it pierced).

, If your infection site doesn't seem to be too bad, you can try curing it yourself at home before you visit the doctor. You can try things like:



Warm saline compresses promote blood flow to the infected area (more blood means more infection fighting cells) which can promote healing the infection quicker.Cold compresses can help reduce swelling, aches, and pains near the infected piercing. Just like when you bang your knee on the corner of a coffee table, a cold compress can also help reduce bruising. Be sure to never apply ice directly to the site of your piercing. Direct contact with ice can cause skin damage. Be sure to always wrap a paper towel or some sort of cloth around the cold compress before putting it on the piercing area.Chamomile tea bag compress. Make a chamomile tea compress by dipping a chamomile tea bag into warm water. Let the bag steep in the water for about 20 seconds, and then apply the tea bag to the area of your piercing. Hold it there as a compress for about 10 minutes, or until the bag cools. Once the tea bag cools, dip the tea bag back into the warm water, and apply it as a compress again.Aspirin paste. Place a some aspirin into a glass (about 4-6 tablets) with very little water and allow some time for the aspirin to dissolve in the water and turn into a paste. Apply the aspirin paste onto the infection site before you go to bed every night, and look for signs of improvement with the infection. Since aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug, it can reduce the swelling, help heal your infection without much of a risk for irritation, and it still lets the infection site drain fluids., With regular cleaning you want to avoid harsh cleansers, but even more so with an infected piercing. People who have infected piercings should steer clear from substances like alcohol, tea tree oil, betadine, hydrogen peroxide and methylated spirits, because scar and bumps are more like to form around the infected piercing site with the use of these substances.The chemical strength of these substances can cause even more discomfort with burning sensations, and they kill off the good cells trying to fight the infection.
Other anti-bacterial ointments can possibly prevent air flow from getting to the infected area and slow down healing, so if you use them, use them sparingly., If your infection doesn't clean up or get any better within a few days (a week maximum), the best thing you can do for your infected piercing is to take the details of your problem to a doctor. Dermatologists and general-practice physicians are your best choice; however, if you can't afford to visit a doctor's office or clinic, speaking to the person who did your piercing is your next best choice., Be careful when getting dressed and undressed. It can be very painful to catch a new piercing on your clothes when you're putting them on or taking them off. Give yourself an extra couple of minutes to get dressed so you can take your time, move carefully, and avoid snagging your nose ring on your clothes.


Some people try to sleep on their opposite side of where their nose piercing is, or use a neck pillow so they don't irritate it in their sleep.

, While your piercing is trying to heal, be sure to stay away from using lotions, makeup, or any face washes that could get into, and build up in the piercing hole. If you do get any products in the piercing, rinse the piercing with warm salt water or a saline solution., Water sources like lakes, public or private swimming pools, and hot tubs are all areas that could contain contaminants that can develop an infection for a newly pierced nose. If your nose piercing must come in contact with these potentially dangerous water sources, try to use a bandage that is fully water-proof, and completely seals the piercing. Bandages like these can be found at any local drugstore."

Consider not treating yourself.,
Use an antiseptic.,
Stick your nose in it.,
Use natural antibiotics.",How to Treat an Infected Nose Piercing2," While you may be able to clear your infection using home remedies, staph infections can be virulent and dangerous. However, if you are unable to see a doctor, here's what you can try instead:

, Wipe your nose, inside and out, with a natural antiseptic such as sea salt and warm water. Soak a cotton swab with the mix, and allow it to go into the piercing hole. This will help kill any bacteria.

, Try soaking your nose in a glass of saltwater for as long as you can bear to. This won't be comfortable, but it will thoroughly clean the piercing.

, Tea tree oil is a natural antibiotic that you can buy from just about any store.


Dip a cotton swab into the tea tree oil, rub it on the infected area for a few seconds, and let dry. Repeat at night. In about a week or two the infection should be gone.

Talk to your doctor and a physical therapist.,
Learn how exercise helps prevent falls.,
Take it slow.,
Follow a well-rounded program.,
Exercise multiple times a week.",How to Reduce Your Fall Risk with Exercise1," When you are deciding to start an exercise program, you should talk to your doctor and/or a physical therapist about your plans. This is particularly important if you have mobility issues or trouble with physical activity, as your doctor can help you determine what is safe for you. No matter what your physical fitness level is, you can be more active and get on a program to strengthen your body.A physical therapist can help you come up with an exercise plan to help reduce your risk of falling.Your physical therapist may also assess your walking gait, which is the way you walk. He may provide exercises for you to perform to help your gait.Your physical therapist can also help you come up with activities to strengthen your lower body and improve your balance.;
, Studies have found that exercise is successful in helping prevent falls.The more you exercise, the more effective it will be.When you exercise, you strengthen your muscles and bones. Strong muscles will support you during your daily activities (from going up the stairs to getting up from a seated position), and stronger bones make it less likely you will suffer a break or fracture if you do fall.
Exercising helps improve your balance, your coordination, and can improve your flexibility if you include stretching., You don’t have to do high-intensity exercises like running to see improvement in your bones and muscles or your balance and coordination. Many exercises to help strengthen your body can be done in your living room and don't require you to be super fit. Ease into exercise and only do what you're comfortable with or feel safe doing.


You can do many of these exercises even if you have a cane, a walker, or a disability.

, When deciding to use exercise to help with fall prevention, you should come up with a well-rounded workout regimen. This means not just doing cardio or balance exercises. You should do multiple kinds of exercise to give your body an overall workout.


Try including strength training and flexibility exercises once or twice a week. Talk to your doctor about the possibility of walking gait training, which is usually done with the guidance of a physical therapist.Studies have shown a well-rounded plan helps with reaction time, walking gait, muscle strength, coordination, cognitive functions, and physical ability. Strengthening all these areas helps prevent falls.
A sample program might look something like:

Monday — Tai Chi class 45 minutes
Tuesday — 20 minutes walking with range of motion warm up, plus stretches after
Wednesday — Balance exercises 10 minutes, alternating upper and lower body work, alternating large muscle and small muscle groups
Thursday — Stationary bike, followed by stretching
Friday — Balance exercises 10 minutes, walking 15 minutes, stretching five to 10 minutes
Saturday — Pool exercises, stretching in the hot tub, upper and lower body (especially hip flexors, chest, anterior delts, hamstrings, calves)
Sunday — Rest



, For these exercises to build your strength, balance, and coordination, you should do the exercises two or more days a week. Talk to your doctor and decide how many days you should start off exercising.Most physicians suggest getting 30 minutes of cardio exercise at least four or five times a week, though you can work out every day. You may need to start with only two days of exercise a week and gradually work up to more. Discuss the frequency and length of your exercises with your physician."

Your legs should be straight back behind you. When ready, tighten your core and lift your arms and legs off the floor by arching your back. Once here, you have two options:



Easier: Slowly return down to the floor, repeat for three sets of ten.

Harder: Hold this position for one minute, rest one minute, then repeat.;
, Lay on the ground on your stomach. Push yourself up on your toes (soles of your shoes rather than laces) and hands. You should be in ""push-up position;"" arms should be shoulder-width apart and feet can be anywhere from shoulder-width apart to almost together (whatever works best for you). Your back should be flat, making a fairly even platform (or plank) from your shoulders to your heels; in other words, you back should not be arched or slumped towards the ground. This will help to keep your abs and back muscles engaged. A modification to this is, rather than staying up on your hands, drop down onto your elbows. Hold this position for 30-60 seconds.

, Lay on your back with your arms relaxed at your side, knees bent and feet on the ground, about hip-width apart, heels directly beneath your knees. Focusing on using your lower back, bring your hips up until they create an even platform from your shoulders to your knees. This should be a slow controlled movement. Resist the urge to push with your legs and focus on pulling with your back and glutes. Hold at this spot for a few seconds before slowly lowering back down.


Do three sets of eight to ten reps.

, Lie down across the stability ball facing the floor, with your hips placed over the ball and legs extended. Place your hands on the floor in front of you, shoulder-width apart. Lift your legs upward, both at the same time, as far as you can without pain and hold the position for three seconds. Then slowly lower yourself back down to the ground and repeat.


Repeat the motion for eight to ten repetitions.

, The classic pull-up is one of the best back exercises you can do. Use the wide grip (palms facing away from you, hands wider than shoulder width) to focus more on your back muscles and less on your chest and biceps. While difficult, there are few better exercises to do for you back. Do as many as possible, starting with one to three reps per set, and work your way up to three sets of ten reps., Tie the resistance band onto a sturdy object that is about the height of your elbows. You can sit in a chair or on the floor, but your legs must be fully extended in front of you and your spine straight. Grasp both ends of the band with your arms extended towards your feet, then pull the band close to your chest, keeping your back straight.


If you are sitting on the floor you can wrap the band around your feet.
Try to do three sets of 12-20 reps. Tie off more of the band if they are too easy.

, Place a stability ball in front of you and kneel down in front of it. Place your forearms on top of the ball shoulder-width apart. Roll the ball with your forearms slowly away from you, allowing your body to drop towards the floor, as far as you are able to extend. Hold the position for three seconds, and then roll the ball towards your body to return to the starting position.Repeat the movement for eight to ten repetitions.

, Place two chairs next to each other, with enough space for you to fit in between them. Put a hand on each chair, extending your legs and keeping your arms bent so that you are only touching the ground with your heels and holding most of your weight with your hands. Press your body upwards, extending your arms while keeping your legs parallel to the floor, then slowly lower yourself back down.


Try three sets of eight to ten reps.

Wash your hands, your nose, and the nose stud!,
Insert your L-shaped nose stud.,
Check that it's in properly.,
Remove your L-shaped nose stud.",How to Take Your Nose Stud in and out of Your Nose1," Whenever changing any piercing start by washing your hands. You don't want bacteria or infections getting into a piercing. Wash the area around your nose stud, whether you have a stud in or not. Also wash the nose stud itself.


It is really important to clean the piece of metal that you are sticking into your body. Germs on the stud could transfer straight to your nose, so make sure the stud is clean.
It's a good idea to use a saline solution or a mild antiseptic solution to make sure the area is really clean but you can use hydrogen peroxide or plain soap too. Either way, make sure that the cleaner is washed off and the stud is dry before inserting it.;
, An L-shaped stud is a simple piece of metal with a decorative end and a 90 degree angle at the other end. To insert it you will first need to find the hole in your nose. Push the end of the stud, the opposite end of the decorative end, in the hole making sure to be gentle and that the stud is going straight through to the other side of the hole. When you're sure that the end of the stud is through to the other side (you can feel the inside of your nose to make sure that it is) gently push the rest of the stud in, angling the stud to get the bent part of the stud through the hole.


Feel free to do this slowly, pushing only a little bit at a time.
The L-shaped nose stud is fully in when the decorative end of the stud is up against the outside of your nose.

, To make sure that you've put in your nose stud correctly, lift up your nostril a bit and look in the mirror. You should be able to see the end of the L-shaped stud inside your nose. The end that is inside your nose should be pointing straight up or down, depending on your preference, and you shouldn't be able to feel it. If you can feel it or its just uncomfortable, readjust it's position.


L-shaped nose studs are easy to insert but that also means that they can come out of your nose pretty easily. Be aware of this and take care that it doesn't fall out or your piercing might close up. , Taking out your L-shaped nose stud is simple if you remember that inside your nose the stud is bent at a 90 degree angle. This means that as you pull it out of your nose, while holding onto the decorative end, you will need to angle it down to get the bent portion through your piercing hole. Once the bent portion is through, you can just remove your nose stud.


Remember to take your time, as a nose piercing can be sensitive to pressure and force.
Once again, make sure your hands and the area around the piercing are clean before handling your nose stud!

Consider tapes that have the ability to absorb moisture, as this will prevent your hands from slipping when you use the bat. There are many kinds of tapes, including electrical tape, grip tape, bat tape, and tennis tape.Avoid using plastic tapes because they do not absorb moisture.
Avoid using shiny electrical tape because it is illegal for most league play.;
, There’s no point in going to the store to buy new materials for taping your bat if you or your family already has them. Save yourself some money and take a look around your house to determine if you already have the following materials:


a utility knife or scissors
fine-grit sandpaper or residue remover
electrical tape, bat tape or tennis tape
a magic marker
latex gloves (optional), You’ll have to purchase or borrow the materials if you didn’t find them around your house. Take a look at your budget to determine how to best acquire what you need.


Go to your local hardware store or sporting goods store to purchase any materials that you don’t already have.Ask a team member or coach if they have extra supplies you can borrow if you’re short on money.
Choose less expensive materials if you cannot afford them or improvise based on what materials you have on hand.

, Peel off any old tape that’s on your bat. Make sure you take all the tape off.It’s important to start with fresh tape, especially for the lower layers. You want the tape to adhere to your bat as much as possible.

, Use a piece of fine-grit sandpaper to get rid of any remaining tape residue if you are using a wooden bat. Try to remove as little wood as possible and make sure your sandpapering is even.Use a specialized residue remover like Goo Gone or CleanUp Batter if you are using an aluminum bat. Both solvents can be used by pouring a small amount onto a rag and rubbing the area of your bat where you want to remove residue. You can wear latex gloves for this step if you like.

, Check the rules of your league to confirm how high you’re allowed to tape your bat. Some leagues are very specific and you could be disqualified if you don’t adhere to league rules.
