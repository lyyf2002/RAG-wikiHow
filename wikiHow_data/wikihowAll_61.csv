Consider the problem.,
Look for patterns in your neighbors' nosy behavior.,
Consider why your neighbors are being so nosy.,
Talk to the nosy neighbor.,
Decide how to handle the situation.",How to Deal With Nosy Neighbors1," In order to deal with with nosy neighbors, you need to fully understand the situation. Ask yourself the following questions:


How long has this been going on?
How many of your neighbors are nosy?
Do you live in a nosy neighborhood?
How long do you plan to stay in that area?;
, Are they often nosy at certain times? They might by nosiest during weekends, weekdays, or evenings. Perhaps their nosiness stems from something that is going on in their lives. Perhaps they are curious about something that;s going on in your life. Maybe they are nosy about your children, or about your guests, or about the work you're doing in your yard.

, Try to understand their motives. If you think that they're being nosy, then they're probably violating your privacy in some way—but there must be a reason that they are so curious about your life and habits. Your neighbors might just be very nosy people, but they also might have a genuine reason for asking questions.


Are they new and just trying to understand the culture of the neighborhood?
Are they just looking for entertainment at your expense?
Are you doing something (suspicious, exciting, or intriguing) to make them curious?

, Try to learn as much about them as possible without getting too involved. This will help you to identify if there is any malice in their questions, if they are just being nosy to pass the time, or if they are new and need help making friends.

, You may want to confront your neighbors, you may want to avoid them, or you may want to befriend them.


If your neighbors seem lonely and bored—like they're just nosing because they want to connect with someone—try talking to them, introducing them to other neighbors, and suggesting fun things for them to do.
If your neighbors are nosy, but you don't want to confront them directly, try finding ways to avoid their snooping. If your neighbors are always watching you, then put up a fence or conduct your business indoors; if your neighbors are always confronting you and asking you personal questions, then consider how you can avoid talking to them.
If your neighbors are snooping around looking for trouble—whether that means stealing your things or reporting you for illegal activities—then consider upping your security. Ask them to stop intruding. If the situation becomes dangerous for your family or your property, don't hesitate to contact the authorities.

"
"
Try a local authority.,
Understand that laws vary.,
Call the police.",How to Deal with an Exhibitionist Neighbor2," That is, before you run off to the police, start with someone who has authority over the property. For instance, the apartment manager or the homeowner's association will likely be willing to intervene on your behalf.Discuss the issue with the association or manager by saying, ""One of my neighbors seems to have an exhibitionist problem. He stands naked at his window every day for at least 10 minutes at a time, where my kids can see. Is there anything you can do to intervene?""

, Every U.S. state has laws about indecent exposure in public places. However, what counts as a public place varies by state. In some states, an area visible from a public place, such as a road, counts, while in other places, it doesn't. In other words, in some states, what happens in the home is the home owner's business, while in other states, that goes against the law.If you live in another country, be sure to check the laws in your area.

, If you're not sure if the person is violating local laws, consider calling the police on a non-emergency number. They can help you determine if your neighbor is violating local laws, and then they can let you know what they can do to help in your situation."
"
Close your curtains.,
Go inside.,
Consider building a fence.,
Talk to your kids.",How to Deal with an Exhibitionist Neighbor3," While this approach maybe isn't as proactive as you'd like, it may be your only option if local laws aren't on your side. You may just need to close your curtains when you notice the exhibitionism is happening, and look away when you're outside. As an added bonus, if your neighbor gets a thrill out of you looking, maybe they'll be less thrilled if nobody is watching., Another option is to go inside when you notice the person is exposing themselves while you're outdoors. This step is especially effective if you're outside with your kids. You can keep them from seeing what's going on next door by removing them from the area.

, Another option is to build a fence tall enough so that you can't see your neighbor's house. Of course, that's more difficult if your neighbor has a two-story house, but it can be effective for one-story houses. Also, a high fence around your backyard can keep your kids from seeing what's going on nearby.

, If your kids are exposed to your neighbor, you need to have a talk with them. Explain that what the person is doing is seen as something that should be kept private, and it's best not to look, as that will only encourage the person more.You could say, ""That person has a problem. They are showing something publicly that we know should be kept private. We can't change what that person is doing, but we can control how we react. The best reaction is to ignore the person and try not to look.""

"
"
Be the stronger person.,
Pretend that you're listening to music.,
Pretend to take a phone call.,
Do not hang out in plain sight of your neighbors.,
Act like you're aren't doing anything.,
Tighten up your security.,
Make a code name for them whenever you see them.,
Build a fence.,
Be elusive and disarming.",How to Deal With Nosy Neighbors2," Do not stoop to their level. Just get on with your business, nonchalantly and happily. Do not be rude or threatening. If they have nothing better to do than watch you all day, then they have wasted their own time, not yours.

, If you're busy and you don't have time to tolerate nosiness, pretend to listen to songs on your phone or iPod. Keep your headphones in your ears while passing through common areas like corridors, lifts, and parks—anywhere you might encounter your neighbor. This discourages any unnecessary contact: nosy neighbors will see that you are unavailable, and they may look for an easier target.


It helps if the headphones are big enough to be seen from afar. If someone walks up to you before noticing the earphones, chances are they will say what they came to say.
Some people refuse to take a hint, and might still have the audacity to ask prying questions despite the earphones.

, To do this you need to put your phone on silent and vibration in silent should be off. Whenever they approach you, put your phone to your ear and pretend to be in an important conversation. Don't forget to smile and nod at them when on the phone: this will add to the act that you aren't trying to avoid them, but your workload is just too much. Say things like:


""Yes, yes it will be done—will send it over to you by tomorrow.""
""How is the report coming along? I heard there were complications.""
""There has been a bug that we were trying to fix.""
""Or you can simply alternate between ""Yes, yes..."", ""Hmm? Mhm,"" and ""Oh, okay,"" on your fake phone call. This may be the best choice if you are not confident in your ability to make up convincing material on the spot.

, Move to your backyard, or choose another spot where they can't see you. This works for some activities—you can just as easily host a cookout or play catch with your son in the backyard as you can in the front—but it is not a permanent fix. It is an avoidance technique.


If your neighbor is extremely nosy, he or she might find ways to snoop around despite your efforts to avoid it. Hiding in the backyard might work once or twice, but be prepared for more nosy times ahead.
If you live your life trying to avoid your neighbors, you are letting them rule you. If the problem is this bad, consider confronting or ignoring your neighbors. It can be exhausting to expend all of your mental energy on simply trying to escape someone.

, That gives them less reason to watch. If your neighbors are always asking questions about what you're doing and why you're doing it, an easy solution can be to simply do nothing. Try your best to seem uninteresting. Resume your activities when your neighbors go away.


Bear in mind that if you look like you have nothing to do, some neighbors make take it as license to come strike up a conversation. When in doubt, it is probably best to avoid or confront your neighbors rather than wait for them to leave.

, This may be a wise choice if you think your neighbors are snooping around on your property. Keep your house locked. If you go on vacation, install a security system or video cameras. Ask another neighbor to keep an eye on your property while you're away, in case the nosy neighbor starts snooping around. Consider getting a guard dog.


Bear in mind that depending on the neighbor situation, this approach may be bordering on paranoia. Perhaps your neighbors are actually sneaking onto your property while you're away; perhaps you are just giving them a bad rap.
If you truly suspect your neighbors of entering your property without your consent, confront them and firmly ask them to stop. Warn them that the next time they do this, you will not hesitate to call the police.

, For example, ""activity"" or ""spiders."" This will cue your family to behave accordingly, whether you all agree to retreat to the backyard or begin making loud noises.

, If you want your neighbors to stop peeking, consider putting up a fence between your properties. Check local by-laws on fencing. If the fence lies between your properties, you may need to ask your neighbors' permission to construct it. Make sure that you don't build onto their property, or else you may give them even more reason to intrude.


Dogs or small children make a great excuse to build a large fence around your property. Simply say that you didn't want the dog running loose.
If you don't like the idea of a fence, consider planting a hedge, a bush, or a stand of trees. Bear in mind that these barriers will take years to grow into place.
Consider whether you want to feel penned in just because your neighbors are nosy. Building a fence may solve your problem, but it may just inspire your nosy neighbors to get creative.

, If they go outside, go back in and come out in 5 minutes. Wave at them vigorously and say ""hi, how are you?"" Ask them if you can borrow a cup of sugar or their lawnmower. If you keep asking for things, your neighbors may start hiding from you.

"
"
Shut down their nosy questions.,
Catch them in the act.,
Give them a small piece of information, and then ask about them.,
Be equally obnoxious toward your neighbors until they leave you alone.,
Consider informing the authorities.",How to Deal With Nosy Neighbors3," If your neighbors ask you a lot of personal questions, tell them that it makes you uncomfortable. The next time they do it, give them a straight answer, like ""That's not something I would like to share with you."" Stare them down, and make it clear that you mean business. Then walk away. They'll hopefully get the message and back off.


This approach is blunt and straightforward. It may get the point across, but it may also offend your neighbor's pride.
Bear in mind that nosy neighbors aren't always trying to be obnoxious. He or she might be asking questions out of genuine curiosity. He or she may not have the tact or the social skills to know which questions are too personal. Be empathetic, but do not put up with anything that violates your space.
If you tell your neighbor to stop asking questions, but he or she continues, you may need to take more serious steps to address the problem.

, If your neighbors like to spy on you, catch them and say something that will embarrass them. Discreetly inform everyone who is with you, and then out of nowhere say something like, ""Hey Mrs. Jones, having fun there?"" Watch as their face turns red. If they deny it, then just ignore them, and give them a cold shoulder. If they do it again, get them alone and ask them nicely to stop.


Make jokes about them nosing. Say things like, ""Now don't you go spying on me!"" and they may realize that they are being too nosy. It might even make them stop.

, If they say, ""So, Frank, buddy, what's up?"" ninety-seven times a day, it wouldn't hurt to respond once, ""Oh, just walking the dog,"" or ""I'm good."" This isn't the most exciting reply, and it makes it hard to think up further questions. Then ask, ""How about you?"" This can unsettle nosy people who don't like the feeling that you are nosing on them. If they aren't nosy and it's in your head, this is a great conversation starter.

, Make loud clapping noises in the backyard, play loud music, or flash your lights outside. If they keep snooping around in your business, these activities may irritate them and send them back indoors.


Be careful what you start. Escalating the situation may not drive the neighbors away—instead, it may prompt them to escalate things even further. Think before you act, and consider whether your neighbors are the type to react competitively. Remember: you need to live next to these people.
Bear in mind that if you begin to harass your neighbors, especially if you make loud noises, you are giving them grounds to call the police on you. If the police show up, it may not matter who ""started it"".

, If your neighbors get too nosy, you may find that your only option is to contact the local police or neighborhood watch force. If the neighbor just won't leave you alone, you may want to apply for a restraining order. If you find your neighbors snooping around on your property, stealing your things, or trying to break into your home, try calling the police so that you don't need to handle the situation on your own.

Resist the urge to avoid them.,
Look outside before exiting.,
Tell them you’re in a rush and can’t chat.,
Excuse yourself politely to exit conversations.,
Reschedule chats to a more convenient time.",How to Deal with an Overly Friendly Neighbor1," While it may seem easiest just to avoid your neighbor — say by peeking out your window to make sure they aren't around when you leave the house or by pretending you're not home when they knock — this is simply prolonging the issue and may, in fact, cause their behavior to escalate. Instead of avoiding your neighbor, you can set boundaries in a very non-confrontational way.
, The easiest way to avoid your overly friendly neighbor is to look outside before walking out the door. Peer through your peephole or window and, if you see them, wait a few minutes before opening the door. If you exit your apartment and hear them around the corner, avoid an awkward encounter by waiting for them to leave the building or enter their apartment., You might not have time in your schedule to wait for them to leave the scene, or they might see you head out and bombard you. Stop a long-winded conversation before it starts. Smile, wave or say hello, and keep walking.Say something like, “Hi there! I’m in a rush and can’t chat. Catch up with you later!”
With any luck, they’ll take the hint after you do this a couple of times.

, A friendly, neighborly conversation starts to get stale after about four minutes.If they start to gab and you’ve reached your limit, find a way to gracefully end the conversation.Try saying, “Well, I’m running late for an appointment. Have a good one!” Other excuses could be a lunch or dinner date, work, or meeting your workout partner.
If you’re entering your home, you could say, “I have to start dinner,” or “I have piles of laundry (or another chore) to do.” You could always just leave it vague and say, “I just noticed the time - I have to run!”

, If your neighbor is at your door, you are not required to answer, especially if you don't feel safe doing so. If, however, you feel comfortable answering the door, you can quickly set a boundary by saying, ""Now is really not a great time for me to talk."" If you wish to have a relationship with your neighbor, suggest an alternate time that you can talk. Say, ""Are you free tomorrow afternoon, around four? I'll be free then and would love to take a walk and catch up.""


If you don't like them dropping by unannounced, you can also tell them politely, “It’s really best to call or set something up instead of popping in.”

Find or purchase a medium sized wicker basket.,
Buy things to fill the basket.,
Purchase a housewarming card.,
Decorate the basket by tying a decorative ribbon onto the handle.

,
Bake them some cookies or a nice dessert the day or day before you give them the basket.",How to Make a Housewarming Basket for New Neighbours," Line the bottom of it with a blanket or some decorative paper.;
, New neighbors are usually running short of practical things such as instant coffee and sugar, so it might be a good idea to put those kind of things in. Put in a bottle of wine, or a box of chocolates as a luxury to welcome them to the neighborhood. Put in some cups and mugs. This is a good idea as crockery sometimes gets broken during house moves. Try to stay away from buying personal things, such as clothes and toothpaste.

, Find out your new neighbor's name(s), and write a little welcome message inside. Tell them if they need anything, you're happy to help. Place the card in the top of the basket so it doesn't get damaged.

,, Put the food in a Tupperware box. Warm homemade food is a nice treat when you're busy moving home as you have little time to make hot food yourself. Your neighbors may also be touched by this thoughtful gesture.

Investigate the situation.,
Enlist the help of a higher power.,
Shift your focus from your sloppy neighbor to a strategic marketing plan.,
Consult a licensed real estate agent who specializes in your area.",How to Deal With a Sloppy Neighbor," According to one California based real estate agent, ""Neglected properties likely belong to one of two types of people: those physically or financially unable to keep up with the work and those who purposely buck social norms."" In some situations, your neighbor may be facing a major life change like a divorce or sickness. Gently bringing your concern to their attention and/or offering to help with their exterior restoration might do the trick. The idea is to focus on your neighbor and not make it about your hopeful sale. Some branches of the National Association of Realtors have funds set aside to assist older or immobile homeowners with maintaining the outside of their homes. Talk to a local, licensed real estate professional and see if their branch supports this program.;
, If your attempts to reason with your sloppy neighbor fail, you may need to review municipal laws managed by your local building or health departments. Laws will vary, but some areas charge large fines for things like keeping piles of wood around that may attract animals, while others areas enforce strict anti-rooster ordinances. Consult your city's website to see if your situation is listed. Keep in mind that getting the attention of your local government can be a tricky, drawn-out situation. However, if your neighbor's neglect has reached dramatic proportions, it's certainly worth a shot.

, Special situations call for special buyers. Your sloppy neighbor won't budge and they're not quite infringing on any municipal laws. Now what? Carefully audit the area you live in. Promote the ""uniqueness"" of your community. Check with your city's building department and see if any exciting projects, like the creation of a new sports park, are in the queue. Along with professional photos of your well-kept home and details of its cared for amenities, include a positive spin on your area's neglected spots and you just might attract the kind of buyer willing to overlook your sloppy neighbor.

, A professional opinion counts, no matter what tactic you use to deal with the eyesore next store. Many agents have experienced this situation and can guide you as to your best course of action. They will also have the right connections to the kinds of open-minded buyers you'll need in order to move on.

Call the police in an emergency.,
Be aware that you do not have all the information.,
Act proactively.,
Be friendly.,
Connect with the parent.,
Engage the child.,
Distract the child.",How to Handle Neighbors Who Shout at Their Kids1," If you see a violent act or believe that a child is in danger, call the police immediately. Calling a child abuse hotline will not result in immediate action, which may be necessary in a severe case. Once you call, a police officer will investigate the situation and make a report.


Call 911 to reach emergency services if you are in the United States or Canada.
Call 999 if you are in the United Kingdom.
Call 000 if you are in Australia.
Follow up this call to emergency services with a hotline call to child protective services. Every call that is made to child protective services is documented and used as a reference for further ongoing investigation.Police and child protective services often work very closely together. If there are reports made both with the police and with child protective services, there is a better trail for them to follow to help save more lives.;
, If a child is in immediate danger, then do not hesitate to act. Otherwise, however, it is important to think about what you are witnessing and consider all the facts you have — and don't have. Consider that what you are witnessing is a fraction of someone's life and you do not know or understand everything that is happening in the lives of your neighbors.


If it seems like the parent is stressed out and lashing out at the child, think about what might be the most appropriate way to approach the parent. Make sure you approach them with compassion and and are open to hearing the full story of what is going on.
If you feel this is a situation of possible verbal, mental, or psychological abuse, it might be best not to intervene personally. Instead, contact the police and/or child protective services. This is for your own safety, as well as the safety of the children.

, When you overhear you neighbor yelling at their kid, it may be appropriate to make an effort to do something at the time. If you can, try to intervene in the moment and defuse the tense situation. If you cannot, make a point to talk to your neighbor in the future. Try not to be accusatory and let them know that you are willing to help them out if they are feeling overwhelmed.


You might say something like, “Hey Doris, I heard things get a little heated with Tim the other day. Kids are great, but they can be difficult at times.”
Avoid approaching your neighbor in a confrontational manner. This will likely cause them to shut you out and limit your ability to intervene in the future.

, If you observe your neighbor yelling at their child, slowly approach the two of them. In a friendly tone, strike up a conversation with the parent and try to defuse the tension. If they are performing a task like bringing in the groceries, offer to help them out. Although the situation may be tense, try to keep a smile on your face and maintain a friendly tone.For example, if the parent is trying to bring in the groceries, you might say something like “Hey Jim! Want some help with those groceries?”
You might also try to defuse the situation by saying something like “Hey! How are you guys doing?” or “What are you guys up to today?”

, You can also ease some of the tension out of the situation by connecting with the parent. Make eye contact with them and say something that is positive and connects the two of you. Try to make the situation feel as non-confrontational as possible.You might say something like “Isn’t parenting hard sometimes?” or, “You must be so stressed. Kids are great, but they kind of seem like a handful sometimes.”
Remember that you are do not know what is going on in your neighbor's lives or what events were leading up to the yelling. As concerned as you may be, it is important to try and gather all the facts before you intervene (unless the child is clearly in danger).
If, however, you constantly hear the parent bullying or being verbally aggressive with the child, then it may be helpful to try to connect with the parent to try to find out what is going on — it may be completely unrelated to their child and they are unknowingly taking their stress out on the child. Feeling into the world of another parent and trying to work with them to problem solve will take some time.

, After talking to the parent, say something nice to the child. It is important that you convey to the child that you are not there to join in on the berating. Try to make a comment that is specific to the child and positiveYou might say something like “Hey Todd! That’s a pretty cool shirt you’re wearing!” or “Julie, you played awesome in that basketball game the other day.”

, If a parent has lost their temper at a small child, you might try distracting the child with a toy or trick. Once you approach the parent, try being friendly and playful with the small child. If you are familiar enough with parent, you might offer to hold the child for a bit.For example, you might play peek-a-boo or make funny faces at the small child to help them calm down.

Get a glass.,
Scout for the clearest spots.,
Place the rim of the glass against the wall.",How to Hear Through Walls1," So you’ve decided to go for it. How do you get started spying? One method is a simple glass held against the wall. The reason this works is that you create an “acoustic coupling” between the wall and the glass, allowing sound waves to travel from one side to the other.A soda or beer glass works best. Some eavesdroppers also swear by Dixie cups, but glass seems to conduct sounds better than other kinds.


Experiment with different types and shapes of glasses to see which one works best for your purposes.
If you have an iPhone, you can download the Amplitude Pro app and hold the iPhone to the glass against the wall. This app allows you to hear distant sounds much more clearly, but it also records and saves the amplified noise.;
, Some places on a wall will transmit sound more clearly than others for reasons of structure or distance from the source of the sound. Experiment to test the sound quality, until you find the best place. Sometimes this can be difficult if the sound is coming from the ceiling. If you're too far away from the sound on the wall, you won't hear things very clearly.

, Remember, in order for it to work you have to couple the wall and glass acoustically. Do this by placing the glass flat, rim down, against the wall. Now sound waves will go from the wall into the glass and make it easier for you to detect them.


Once the glass is in place, put your ear to the bottom of the glass. Continue to move the glass on the wall if you can’t hear well.

Consider how long you’ll be neighbors.,
Confront them sooner rather than later.,
Be firm and honest about how they make you feel.,
Act as a united front if you’re married or have a roommate.,
Explain the kind of neighborly relationship you desire.,
Confront your neighbor who gossips.,
Stop your neighbor from bringing over food.",How to Deal with an Overly Friendly Neighbor2," If you’re a renter or selling your home, and you know you’ll be leaving the neighborhood soon, you might just want to set boundaries (for instance by telling your neighbor ""Sorry, I don't have time to chat!"") and not actually get into a discussion about their behavior. Matters are a bit more complicated if you and your neighbor are both homeowners or long-term renters. You should confront them about your discomfort instead of trying to spare their feelings or let tensions mount., If you’ve politely given hints or tried to avoid them with no luck, you might have to have a face-to-face conversation with them. You should make your feelings clear as soon as you notice an issue developing. Delaying a calm, firm conversation will only encourage their intrusive behavior.You might feel the urge to just be nice and spare their feelings, but letting tensions mount could result in a bigger issue in the future. Further, if you lead them to believe their behavior is fine, you’ll end up hurting their feelings more when you finally make your feelings known.

, You should be clear and honest with your neighbors about any issues. Be respectful and polite, but try not to sugarcoat your point too much.Try saying, “You are a warm, nice person. I know you’re being friendly, and I hope you don’t find me rude, but I’m just not very social.”
If you’d like, you could add something like, “My schedule is just so tight right now, and I have so many responsibilities to juggle. I find our chats pleasant, but they always seem to make me run late!”  

, If you live with a spouse or roommate, talk to them about how to handle your overly friendly neighbor. Come up with a strategy and make sure you both follow through with it.In any case, make sure you and your spouse or roommate are a united front. Sending mixed signals will only aggravate the situation. For example, if your neighbor follows you to your door and tries to come in, you could say, “My roommate and I have a 'call ahead' policy — we really don't like people dropping by.”

, Try explaining to them that, in your experience, good fences make good neighbors. Tell them that you’d like to have an amicable relationship and look out for each other’s property, but aren’t comfortable with anything more.Try saying, “I’ve become close with neighbors in the past, but ended up having a terrible disagreement that’s made me wary of getting too close to my neighbors. I hope you aren’t insulted, and I mean no offense, but I think it’s best to keep some boundaries.”

, You might like that your friendly neighborhood gossip lets you know about fascinating local news. However, keep your conversations brief, and stick to inoffensive topics. You should ask them not to talk badly about your other neighbors if they start to make things too personal.If they start putting someone down, try changing the subject or find an excuse to leave. If they ask you about your business or for your opinion on someone else, just let them know you’re not friendly enough with them to share your or anyone else’s secrets. Calmly say, “I really don’t like talking badly about other people, especially neighbors.”

, It’s nice when a neighbor bakes you a pie every now and then, but an overly friendly neighbor might try to make it a daily or weekly ritual. They might also try to make you feel obligated to return the favor. If it becomes a problem, express your gratitude, but make it clear you want them to stop.Suppose your neighbor starts bringing over food every few days, and you’re tired of it. Tell them, “You know, I really have to start making my own food! I just can’t accept any more of yours.”
You could try to be polite and say, “I don’t want to put you out or burden you.” If they persist, respond by saying, “I really hate to say it, but it’ll probably just go to waste. I really appreciate it, but we don’t eat many sweets (or whichever items they prepare).”
You could also try suggesting a local charity, like a religious organization or soup kitchen,  that would welcome their baking or cooking skills.

Deal with a neighbor who doesn’t respect your space.,
Contact authorities if you feel unsafe.,
Ask your property manager about relocating.",How to Deal with an Overly Friendly Neighbor3," In more extreme cases, an overly friendly neighbor might insist on touching you or otherwise intruding your personal space. Even if they believe touching your shoulder when they greet you is harmless, you should tell them to stop if it makes you uncomfortable.Look them in the eye, stand up straight, and do your best to project confidence. Calmly and assertively say, “I don’t feel comfortable with being touched like that.”
There’s no need to make excuses for them or apologize, but you can gauge your response based on your level of discomfort. If your neighbor touches your shoulder, and it’s annoying but you don’t find it threatening, politely tell them to stop. If they touch you in way you feel is inappropriate, tell them their action is harassment, and don’t hesitate to notify authorities if they persist.

, In rare cases, an overly friendly neighbor might be unstable or threaten your safety. You should get help if they respond in a threatening way to the hints you've dropped or conversations you've had about your space.First, contact your property manager or homeowner's association. They can help mediate the situation before it escalates. If you believe you're in immediate danger, call the police or emergency services.

, If you live in an apartment complex or building, relocating to another floor or section of the complex might be an option worth exploring. That way, you'll avoid daily interactions with your intrusive neighbor without having to go through the burden of moving to another complex.Describe your situation to your property manager. Ask them, ""Are there any available apartments on another floor or in a building on the other side of the complex?""
Be sure to ask them to waive security deposits and other fees, since you're an existing resident relocating due to an issue that's out of your control.

Talk to your neighbor.,
Ignore it.,
Talk to your kids about it.",How to Handle Neighbors Who Shout at Their Kids2," If your neighbor’s shouting is loud or annoying, you might talk with them about it. Find a time to talk with your neighbor and ask them if they would consider keeping it down. They might not be aware of how loud they are and appreciate you letting them know.You might say something like “Hey Dianne. You were pretty loud the other day. Do you think you could keep it down?” or “Hey Jim. I heard you getting on Todd’s case the other day. It kind of upset my kids. Could you maybe be a little quieter?”
Do not send your neighbor a text or write them a note and leave it on their door or in their mailbox. If you are going to talk to them, you need to do it face to face.

, If your neighbor has a tendency to lose their temper on their kids, but the yelling is not abusive, you might consider simply ignoring it. Getting involved, especially if there is not any abuse occurring, might damage your relationship with your neighbor. Play it by ear and, if you do not think the yelling is severe, ignoring it may be the best response., If the yelling is upsetting your kids, you might want to have a discussion with them about what is going on. Let them know that sometimes parents get a little frustrated with their children and lose their tempers. However, you should also explain to them that yelling at your kids is not the best way to deal with your frustration.


You might say something like “I’m sorry that is upsetting you. That yelling is bothering me too.”
If the yelling is that bad, consider leaving the house for a while to go do something fun with your children. Or do something to distract them from the disturbance — put on some music and play a game or dance around.

Get to know your neighbors.,
Offer to help.,
Talk to your other neighbors.,
Be an active member of your community.",How to Handle Neighbors Who Shout at Their Kids3," Try to build a relationship with your neighbors and get to know them personally. Let them know that you are there for their family. Knowing that support is near may help them feel less overwhelmed and, therefore, less likely to lash out at their children.Invite your neighbors over for barbeques and parties. Try to host activities where you get to know the kids and their parents.

, If you neighbor seems overwhelmed, offer to help them out. Limiting the parent’s anxiety will minimize the likelihood of them lashing out against their child. You might help them do chores or even offer to watch the kid for a bit.You might say something like “Let me watch Sara for a bit while you relax” or “How about I pick up the kids after school today?”

, Although you should avoid gossiping about your neighbor, it may be helpful to talk with other people in the neighborhood. Your other neighbors may have some insights on the situation that you do not. They may also be willing to help support your neighbor or intervene in the future.


Consider getting together for coffee with neighbors that you trust and feel comfortable with.

, Volunteer at the different community organizations that support children and their parents. This will give you the opportunity to get to know your neighbors and their kids. It will also allow you to provide some community support for your neighbors that need it.If you have children, you can volunteer at their school or their athletic programs. You might also consider helping out at community or faith-based organizations or social service programs.

Know the different types of abuse and neglect.,
Recognize the signs of abuse and neglect.,
Look for patterns of abuse.,
Report child abuse.",How to Handle Neighbors Who Shout at Their Kids4," There are several different types of child abuse, including neglect. This can help you know what to look for if you are concerned about your neighbor's children.


Physical abuse: This refers to a physical injury that is not caused by an accident. This includes hitting, shaking, throwing, biting, choking, kicking, burning and so on. In the US, this behavior is considered abuse regardless of the intention. It should be noted that physical discipline, such as spanking, is not considered physical abuse if it does not cause bodily injury and there is reasonable cause to spank the child.
Verbal abuse: This may include verbal, psychological, or mental forms of abuse. The child may be bullied and devalued. The abuser may name call, make accusations, or even ignore the child. Because this type of abuse leaves no obvious physical marks, it may be difficult to identify.
Neglect: This occurs when a parent or caregiver is not providing for a child's basic needs, such as food, shelter, clothing, medical care, education, and so on. It may also include a parent who is inattentive to a child's needs or allows drug and alcohol use.
Sexual abuse: Like verbal or emotional abuse, this can be difficult to identify, as it doesn't necessarily leave an obvious physical mark and happens behind closed doors. This includes touching and non-touching activity, such as committing sexual acts with the child or forcing them to commit sexual acts, showing them pornography, taking pornographic photos or videos of the child.

, If your neighbor’s actions appear severe, you should keep an eye open for signs of abuse. There are many different signs and symptoms to look for — note that the following are only some of the signs.However, some red flags are:


Your neighbor’s kids quit hanging out with the other kids in the neighborhood.
They show serious behaviorally changes, like increased aggression, anger, hostility, or hyperactivity.
The kid appears depressed, anxious, unusually fearful, or suddenly loses their self-confidence.
They frequently miss school and school-related events.
They are reluctant to go home.
The child has a constant medical or physical condition that has not been treated.
They are increasingly watchful and look fearful. They are concerned that something bad could happen at any moment.
The child is frequently left alone at an inappropriate age.

, Once you begin noticing some red flags, pay attention to see if these things are recurring. A regular pattern that repeats over a long period may be a good indication of problems. For example, if your neighbor’s kid is reluctant to go home every now and then, there may be a good reason for this behavior. However, if they refuse to go home every time they visit, they may be cause for concern., If you believe that your neighbor is abusing their child, you should report them. Call the police or your local child abuse hotline. When you call, make a detailed report that includes the child’s information, your relationship to them, the abuser's information, their address, and the type of abuse that is occurring.If your neighbor is regularly yelling at the child, they are experiencing emotional abuse.

Drill a tiny hole.,
Cover the hole with a thin membrane.,
Listen away.",How to Hear Through Walls2," Another way to hear through a wall is with a hole and plastic membrane, a method recently discovered by scientists in Japan and South Korea. First, drill a very small hole all the way through the wall. A power drill with a small, long bit will work best to do this. Don’t expect to hear too much through the hole alone. In fact, a plain hole in a wall seriously hinders sound transmission.
Try to pick a time when your neighbor is out to drill through the wall. Otherwise, they may well notice the sound or debris from the drilling.

, This is what should make the method work really well. You see, studies show that when you cover the hole with a thin membrane on one side the transmission becomes almost as if there is no wall, because the membrane equalizes the pressure on both sides of the hole and funnels sound through.


Try using a common household item, namely plastic wrap. In fact, the scientists who conducted the initial study used plastic wrap themselves., Once you have your hole and plastic wrap in place, listen away! If executed properly, you should be able to hear what is happening in the opposite room quite clearly.


For even better results, try this method in conjunction with the first. Put a glass over the top of the hole and plastic membrane.
Be aware that drilling a hole in the wall has very clear disadvantages, especially as regards secrecy. Your neighbor might hear the drilling; she might see the hole; or she might notice the drill debris on the floor and become suspicious. Use with care!

Collect your materials.,
Disassemble the microphones.,
Disassemble and reassemble the stethoscope earpieces.,
Hook the stethoscope to MP3 player.,
Start listening.",How to Hear Through Walls3," We’re now getting into more sophisticated listening equipment. You can either make a listening stethoscope on your own or buy one. Premade models will save you time but can cost several hundred dollars. Unlike a premade model, however, making your own stethoscope will probably cost around or under $25, provided that you already have a fairly good MP3 player.


You can typically find a stethoscope at your local drugstore for about $10. The quality of the stethoscope is unlikely to make much of a difference.You will also need microphones. Stereo multimedia microphones are preferable, as they are cheap (around $15) but have fairly good sound specifications. That is, you should be able to pick up sound with them pretty easily and with fair quality.Finally, you will need to have an MP3 player to record sound as well as a 3.5mm (mini) Stereo Y-adapter cable. The cable will be quite cheap, about $3 or $4 dollars. The MP3 player will be the most expensive item if you do not already own one. Keep in mind that it must be able to record, which probably means that you will need a newer model (many older ones do not record but only play music)., You will need to cut down the middle of the microphones in order to get to the wiring, remove the tops or headers, and release the microphones. You will then insert the exposed microphones into the stethoscope earpieces.A good tool for doing this is an X-Acto knife. It will make a clean cut through the outer parts of the microphone and let you get to the innards. You should be left with 2 mics and 3.5 mm connectors (the cabling).

, Remove the earpieces from the stethoscope. This is fairly easy and they should just pop right off. Don't get rid of them, however, as you'll need to attach them to the microphones.


Next, gently drill shallow holes into each of the plastic earpieces to a diameter that matches that of the microphone housings. The size of these holes needs to be exact, as the microphones must fit squarely inside of them. A power drill or grinder can give you the desired precision.Glue the microphones inside the earpieces. Put a dab of glue around the edges of the microphone housings and then insert them into the holes that you have just drilled in the stethoscope earpieces. Reattach the earpieces back to the stethoscope and let the glue dry.

, Last, attach the stethoscope and microphones to the MP3 player. Use the Y-adapter cable to connect the microphones to the MP3 player. The sound that you pick up through the wall will now be collected and amplified by the microphones, transmitted to the MP3 player, and recorded or saved.Plug the single stereo connecter in to an MP3 player. Your spy stethoscope should be ready to go now.

, Practice first with your stethoscope. As with an ordinary glass, you may have to experiment a bit to find a good placement on the wall or to get the hang of recording. However, unless the walls are double-glazed or have thick insulation, you should be able to hear what is being said on the opposite side.

Ask yourself: do you really want or need to spy?,
Be aware of eavesdropping laws.,
Consider all negative consequences.",How to Hear Through Walls4," By listening through a wall, you are about to spy on another person and violate private conversations. This raises big legal and ethical problems. Before acting, seriously ask yourself if you want to do it. Is it worth the risk?


The situation is important. In England, for instance, a man rescued his elderly neighbor from a robbery by listening through the wall with a glass.In his situation, spying was definitely justified.
Things are rarely so clear cut, however. You should probably not act if you have any doubts about the situation. If you decide to go ahead, make sure that you know the possible consequences of your actions.

, Eavesdropping means to overhear, record, magnify, or transmit any part of a private conversation without the consent of at least one person involved. Be aware that states have laws against eavesdropping. By spying you may well be breaking the law; you might even be violating the law by possessing a device for spying.Your state may have a “one party consent” or “two party consent” law. One party consent means that it is illegal to eavesdrop unless you have the consent of at least one of the people engaged in a private conversation. In two party consent you must have permission from both parties to listen, record, or amplify their communication.Take the state of Michigan. Michigan has a two party consent law – you must have permission from all parties in order to “overhear, record, amplify, or transmit any part of a private discourse.” This applies even in your own home. Eavesdropping there is also a felony., What happens if you eavesdrop and someone finds out? What could happen to you? This is a good question and you should consider all of the possible outcomes, which in many cases are severe.


In Michigan, the penalties for illegal eavesdropping are up to 2 years in prison, up to $2,000 in fines, or both.In California, eavesdropping is either a misdemeanor or felony. As a misdemeanor you face up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine; as a felony, you could spend up to three years in prison and a $2,500 fine.Of course, a criminal penalty is not the only bad outcome. You also open yourself to a civil lawsuit for violating someone’s privacy, which could be costly and run into the thousands of dollars. Even if you escape legal consequences, you could have a very angry person on your hands.

Keep track of criminal behavior.,
Report violent or serious crimes.,
Avoid confrontation with the drug addict.,
Organize a neighborhood watch.",How to Cope Living Near Drug Addicts1," Mark down dates and times when potential criminal activity occurs in a journal or on your computer. You don’t necessarily need to report their activity, unless they begin endangering themselves and others while they are using.


Public intoxication
Drug dealing in the neighborhood
Public drug use;
, If you witness the drug addict engaging in criminal activity, you should contact the police. Even if you just suspect that a serious crime has occurred, it’s always better to protect yourself and your loved ones, by calling the police. You can report the activity anonymously if you are concerned about retaliation from your neighbors.


Providing or selling drugs to minors
Using or brandishing firearms
Driving under the influence
Public drug use or dealing, Do not allow the drug dealer to draw you into their situation. Never physically or verbally fight with a user. Drug users can have uncommon strength under the influence as well as lowered inhibitions, which makes fighting with them extremely dangerous. Remove yourself from the situation, and contact emergency personnel immediately., If you know other neighbors who are concerned about the drug use in the area, ask them to be part of a neighborhood watch program. The goals of this program should include keeping an eye out for any criminal behaviors, watching out for young residents of the community who may be at risk, and making sure the addicts do not damage or steal property in the neighborhood. You are there to watch not to act. Report observed criminal behavior to the proper authorities.


Depending on the number of people involved, schedule specific times to monitor. This may be most important in the mornings and afternoons, when children are on their way to and from school, and in the evenings when the drug behavior is most likely to occur.
If you already have a crime watch in your neighborhood, contact them to make sure they’re aware of the drug situation, and offer to volunteer."

Lock your doors.,
Remove yourself from unsafe environments.,
Stay out of conflicts.,
Keep valuables inside the home.",How to Cope Living Near Drug Addicts2," It may sound simple, but this is the barrier between you, your family, and potential harm. Keep your doors locked even when you’re at home, and don’t open the door unless you know who’s there.

, If you ever feel scared or like your life may be in danger, leave immediately. Don’t make the mistake of confronting an addict who is using or trying to make them see reason. Get to a safe place, call the authorities, and readdress the situation at a later time., If you notice the drug addict fighting or arguing with someone, do not intervene. Instead, call the authorities. You don’t want to unintentionally place yourself in danger.

, Don’t leave expensive items in your car or outside. While drug addicts are not necessarily thieves, many will take expensive or resalable items in order to get money for drugs.

Make a list of unacceptable behaviors.,
Discuss these behaviors with the addict.,
Agree to consequences for crossed boundaries.,
Stick to the consequences.,
Avoid enabling.,
Make time for yourself.",How to Cope Living Near Drug Addicts3," It’s important for you to evaluate the behaviors the addict engages in while using that are dangerous, unpleasant, or otherwise make living with them more difficult. Your list could include things like using in the home, driving while under the influence, and not paying bills., Once you have a list of the behaviors you consider to be unacceptable, it’s time to discuss the list with the addict. You should try to have this discussion as soon as possible, after noticing the drug use or deciding to live with the addict. Explain why you have a problem with each of the behaviors, and ask them if they can agree to abstain from these behaviors while you’re sharing a home.


To start the conversation, be straightforward. Say something like, “I’ve noticed you’re using drugs on a regular basis, and I am not here to judge you. However, we do share this space, so I think we should discuss how your drug use affects that.”
This will not be an easy conversation for either of you. Use nonjudgmental language, but be firm. Try something like, “I want us both to be happy sharing this home, and I won’t feel safe knowing you’re using in the house.”
Give yourself permission to leave. If the drug addict becomes violent or refuses to consider your concerns, you may have to move., If the addict agrees to abstain from these unacceptable behaviors while you’re cohabitating, it’s essential that you create agreed upon consequences. Boundary lines without consequences for crossing them will not be helpful for you or the addict, since engaging in these unacceptable behaviors will not actually negatively effect the addict.


Set “punishments that fit the crime.” Don’t kick the addict out the first time they slip up, or for a minor infraction. Create fair consequences to help the addict feel like they can succeed.
Give the addict opportunities to succeed by allowing them to make up for unacceptable behavior by helping out around the house or completing other small tasks.

, Even if you’re worried the addict may end up homeless, lose their job, or got to jail, follow through on the agreed upon consequences. Don’t let the addict make you feel guilty for their mistakes. Be firm, and insist the addict keep their end of the agreed upon arrangement.Avoid direct confrontation and never engage the addict in physical violence. If they cross one of the agreed upon boundary lines, address the issue calmly and remind them of the consequences.
Wait to address the crossed boundaries when the addict is sober., This is often the most difficult thing for friends and family members of addicts, but doing anything to make it easier for the addict to use is detrimental to them in the long run. Sometimes, it may be difficult to recognize enabling behaviors for what they are, but it’s important to regularly evaluate the way you interact with the addict to ensure you’re not engaging in enabling behaviors.


Don’t make excuses for the addict to friends or family members. Insist that you will always tell the truth, and will not be made to cover for the addict.
Don’t do work for the addict, so they don’t suffer consequences from work, family, or other loved ones.
Never supply the addict directly or indirectly with drugs. It is easy to avoid directly supplying them with drugs, but covering their half of the rent, paying for their meals, and providing money for other necessary items may make it easier for them to purchase drugs., Don’t give up your hobbies or compromise other relationships because you’re concerned about the behavior of addicts. Dedicate at least an hour a day to doing something you enjoy without letting the addict interfere."
"
Remove any drugs, alcohol, or tobacco from the home.,
Celebrate victories.,
Talk openly about the situation.,
Use positive language.,
Keep yourself and others away from negative behaviors.,
Seek support from professionals.,
Treat the addict like any other sick person.,
Accept that you are not responsible.",How to Cope Living Near Drug Addicts4," This can be difficult if you’re a regular smoker or drink socially, but if you’re going to share space with an addict, you need to remove all addictive substances from the home. Removing these temptations is essential to ensure your own safety and that of the addict in the home., If the addict is able to go for a significant period of time without using, celebrate. If the addict maintains all of the agreed upon boundaries for a month or a year, celebrate. Positive reinforcement reminds the addict that there are good things in life apart from drug use., Don’t keep secrets, sugar coat, or gloss over the situation. Be honest with others and with yourself. If you make excuses or minimize the addicts behavior, it makes it easier for them to do the same., Don’t insult, judge, or criticize the addict. These sorts of verbal confrontations may trigger the addict’s desire to use. If the addict tries to push you to fight with them, remove yourself from the situation., Addicts are manipulative. They are willing to make those closest to them feel guilty, if they are able to get access to drugs more easily or make excuses for themselves to use.


Addicts often threaten things such as, “I’m going to use, if you don’t let me borrow the car.” Don’t buy into that. You are not in control of their drug use.
Don’t apologize for saying no. You should not be sorry for standing up for yourself and your loved ones.
Leave if the addict’s behavior is dangerous or the addict refuses to stop behaving in an unacceptable way., This help is for you. Not the addict. Attend meetings with others who are coping with having an addict in their lives, or schedule regular appointments with a therapist or counselor. Living with or near an addict can be stressful, it’s important to get the support you need., Addiction is a disease. People who are addicted to drugs need the help of professionals. However, you can’t force them to get that help. Do what you can to be part of the cure, but remember, you are not responsible for the addict’s actions., Remembering the three “C”s of living with an addict is a common edict espoused by support groups and counselors who work with the family and friends of addicts. Remember you did not Cause the addiction, you cannot Control the addiction, and you cannot Cure the addiction.you"

Know when to wear your medals.,
Consider the options.,
Wear official medals on the left, using a metal bar.,
Only wear your own medals.,
Limit the number of medals.,
Keep the length of ribbons in check, as needed.,
Wear your medals with standard black tie attire.In this case, black tie attire could also be referred to as dinner attire.,
Arrange the medals appropriately for white tie attire.,
Know the proper way to arrange medals on morning dress attire.,
Understand the differences between cultures.",How to Wear Medals on Civilian Clothes," Veterans, retirees, and active service members can wear military medals and awards on their civilian clothes during events and gatherings with a military theme.This can include military-oriented days of celebration, like Veterans Day and Memorial Day in the United States or Remembrance Day in Canada.
Other ceremonial events that you can wear medals at include parades, military presentations, general veterans or military meetings, and funerals.
You should only wear medals on civilian clothes when those clothes are still formal attire. Do not wear medals on casual civilian clothes, even during a military event.;
, You can wear your full size medals, miniature medals, or lapel pins. Each option can be appropriate.Enameled lapel pins represent a single medal or decoration. In the United States, there are lapel pins that represent every medal and many award ribbons. Usually, you only wear one lapel pin, and that pin can represent either your highest award or an award that has special meaning to you.
Lapel pins are only worn on the lapel of a blazer. For more formal attire, full size or miniature medals are usually more appropriate.
Each full size medal has an equivalent miniature medal. Miniature medals create a less cluttered appearance, but the choice between full size and miniature medals is entirely a personal one.
While it is not a rule, miniature medals are usually worn during very formal events, especially those held in the evening and requiring full evening dress or dinner dress. Full size medals are most typically worn on morning dress or formal daytime attire.

, Your medals should be worn over the left lapel or the left breast pocket of a formal jacket or coat. Medals are mounted on a metal holding bar or bar brooch, and that bar is attached to the lapel.


The center of the holding bar should be parallel to the ground.
The most senior medal should be on the right side of the bar in the position furthest away from the left shoulder. The remaining medals should be worn in order of seniority, with the least senior medal on the left side of the bar, nearest the left shoulder.
Commemorative or nonofficial awards, when worn, should be placed on the right side.
You can only wear one row of medals. The row should not extend past the center of the body or the seam of the left arm sleeve.
Note that you should not wear a pocket handkerchief when wearing your medals.

, Regardless of the occasion, you should only wear medals that were awarded to you. Never wear medals or awards that were granted to another person, even if that person was a close relative., There is no strict rule governing the number of medals to be worn, but as a general guideline, you should try to limit the number to an amount that can be placed on the holding bar without overlapping.


Typically, this means wearing no more than five medals side-by-side.If you have more medals than you are permitted to wear based on the guidelines outlined for each specific style of dress, wear the orders and decorations that are the most senior or advanced.
On rare occasions, you may need to wear more medals and may need to let them overlap. When overlapping medals, the furthest medal on the left should be at the bottom, with each medal to the right progressively and slightly overlapping the one before it. The right medal, which is also the most senior, should be completely visible.

, The length of the ribbons attached to your medals will need to vary for each medal since each medal is of a different height. The overall length when measured from the top of the ribbon to the bottom of the medal should be 4 inches (10 cm), however.


The bottom edge of each medal should be aligned with the other medals.
Run the medal ribbon through the ring or clasp on the medal. This clasp should be in the middle of the ribbon. Place the doubled ribbon over the top of the mounting bar, then back down through the slot. Sew the back portion of the ribbon to the bar using the stitch holes provided.

, It's the type of formal attire used for most ceremonies and events, and you can wear most of your medals with this type of attire.


Place any medals, badges of orders, or decorations on a metal bar placed over the left lapel of your jacket.
You can wear one star on the left breast of the jacket, as well.
If you have one, you can wear one neck badge suspended by a miniature ribbon. The badge should fall out just below a bow tie or below the knot of a long tie.

, White tie apparel, also known as evening dress, is the most formal of civilian attire. Since this attire is only worn for very special occasions, you can wear more of your medals with it than you can with standard black tie attire.


Wear up to four stars on the left breast of your tailcoat.
Wear any miniature medals, decorations, and badges of orders on a metal bar positioned on the left lapel of the coat.
If desired, you can wear one neck badge suspended on a miniature ribbon of an order below your bow tie.
If you have a broad riband sash or shortened riband, wear it over the appropriate shoulder designated by the type of sash. Keep it in between the waistcoat and tailcoat.

, Morning dress is the most casual civilian attire you can wear your medals with. This dress style includes any suit or clothing you would wear to formal daytime events. Medals are rarely worn with morning dress, but there are times when the person organizing a daytime event will specify that you should wear your medals.


As with other styles of dress, wear your medals, decorations, and badges of orders on a metal bar placed over the left lapel of your jacket.
You can place up to four stars on the left breast of the jacket, as well.
When applicable, you can suspend one neck badge on a full-width ribbon. The ribbon should be worn under the shirt collar.

, Most English-speaking countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, follow the guidelines presented here. Be aware that protocol can vary in different countries or cultures, though.


Always check with an official veterans' affairs resource in your country to verify specific dress procedures, especially if you have any doubt or special concerns.
Evening, dinner, and morning attire are formal enough throughout North America and the United Kingdom, but in other parts of Europe, only full evening attire (white tie) offers a formal enough occasion to wear your medals. This is typically true in Italy, France, Germany, and Spain.

Practice walking with a book on your head to improve your poise and posture.",How to Walk Like a Lady," This is usually about six inches apart from instep to instep. Don’t let your toes point out or in, but rather straight forward.;
, Loosen them up slightly, like you are getting ready to walk.

, Pull your lower abdominal muscles inward. This will also shrink your waist and make it easier to stand up straight.

, Keep your arms at your sides.

, Drop your shoulders away from your ears.

, You should grow in length by about an inch as you stretch out your spine and activate the muscles in your core.

, To help keep a balanced figure, try balancing a book on your head while you hold proper posture.

, Try squatting for thirty seconds, and then do the butterfly stretch or the pigeon pose from yoga for a minute. The butterfly stretch is when you sit on the ground and bring the soles of your feet together, letting your legs fan out.


The pigeon pose from yoga is also a great hip opener. Swing your leg forward and turn the shin at a 90-degree angle to your leg. Reach your back leg behind you. Shift the weight in your hip so that you are evenly balanced and hold the pose for at least one minute before doing the opposite side. , Hold your standing posture. Keep in mind that this will often make your walk more feminine, but it will also accentuate the curve of your back and lock your knees, which will be harmful to your back in the long run.

, Lift your thigh slightly on your dominant leg and set the foot down in front of you from heel to toe. Your step should be approximately the length of your foot.

, Allow your hips to sway slightly in the direction of the leading foot. Women have a lower center of gravity and the hips naturally sway, especially when you are wearing heels.

, Don’t lead with your head, chin, shoulders or chest. Your legs should lead the walk, taking advantage of strong legs and hips and a lower center of gravity.

, Remember that walking like a lady involves swaying the hips slightly, but not the shoulders. Don’t try to take steps that are too large, or it will look unnatural.

Plan your trip accordingly before arriving.,
Use the appropriate dress codes.,
Have a ""family-friendly"" mind-set when going to theme parks.,
Have control over your children.,
Treat the pathway like a road.,
Turn your camera flash off.,
Use proper hygiene.,
Avoid complaining about prices.,
Stay with your group in queue lines.",How to Use Theme Park Etiquette," Download and print out maps of the park so you can plot out your route and choose which rides to go on. Planning beforehand will save you loads of time and lessen the amount of time standing around in the path of others.

Several parks, such as Disney, offers special admission opportunities, such as having the ability to enter the park an hour earlier than the general public. These can be received if you decide to purchase a specialty pass or stay at their exclusive hotel.
Install queue apps on your mobile device. There's many apps available that updates you on how long a queue is at that specific time and can be very useful for popular rides.;
, Most theme parks have a dress codes and standards, including wearing footwear at all times and ensuring clothing has non-offensive messages. If a theme park has water rides, be sure to carry or have an extra shirt around if you don't want to walk around in wet clothes. If you are drenched, ensure that you are dry before getting on a non-water ride to avoid getting seats wet. There's nothing worse than waiting in line and sitting on a moist seat, because the person before you was wet., Most theme parks have developed over the years to aim to accommodate families and people of all ages. Know what you will enjoy and be considerate of those enjoying anything that you might be too mature for.


Control your language around others. While having fun with friends, your mind might ""lock into"" laid-back and every day conversations. Limit or avoid the usage of profanity in queue lines, as kids can pick up words easily.
Research if the park has exclusive smoking areas. Just being in the open air doesn't mean you are allowed to light a cigarette whenever you want to. Secondhand smoke exposure not only creates potentially serious health issues to others, but it is a top park annoyance.

, Theme parks can be super exciting place for young ones, but it is not their personal playground.

Teach your child to wait patiently in lines or give them something little to kill time. Play hand games with them, play ""I Spy"", or have them check out any decorations you find in the queue line. Never allow your child to swing from the posts, kick thrust their feet (which might trip other people in the next lane), or to run around others.
Hold their hand at all times. While walking from ride to ride, children may want to walk on their own. Safety precautions must be taken into account to avoid bumping into the elderly, strollers, adults, as well as avoid getting lost and going too far away from their parents.

, Paying attention is crucial and can make or break someone's enjoyment, especially in large crowds.

Veer to the extreme side if you need to stop in a pathway. Abruptly stopping to look at a map, take a picture, or to look behind you to find family members or friends is another top annoyance.
Avoid using the entire pathway for your family. It's very common and recommended to hold each other's hands, but if you are in a large group, prepare to break up into small groups so others can get through properly.
Avoid looking at your phone while walking. Not knowing where you are walking is guaranteed to make you bump into others.
Don't make mad rushes or dashes to your favorite ride. Accidentally swinging arms or trampling over someone because you want to make it into a queue line before others is disrespectful.

, Flashes are not only a huge annoyance to other visitors, but to employees or workers whom are performing in an event. There are lots of rides that prohibit flash photography, and people will be advised of the rules before getting on. When using flash photography in dark rides, one might expose machinery or other hidden items. Sporadic flashes also takes the fun out of rides., In hot conditions, body odors in a crowd come out and it can be nauseous to many. If you are planning to stay at a nearby hotel, plan on going back in the middle of the day to take a shower and change clothes so you feel and smell refreshed later on. Avoid using excessive perfumes or body sprays, as this also makes people nauseous., Parks tend to have high prices for items, such as souvenirs, food, and drinks. Many parks allow you to bring your own water bottle. Think about dining at outside food establishments or restaurants before entering the park. Don't be enticed to purchase items at kiosks or gift shops just because something catches your eye; you might find that item or something better while shopping online or at another store., Line cutting or line saving gives a negative impact on people behind whom have waiting in line themselves. There's a huge difference between ""saving"" a space for someone whom physically can't stand on their feet for a long duration and ""saving"" a space for people who naturally want to join their friends and family."

Change the subject.,
Set boundaries.,
Promote ""I"" statements.,
Deal with an elderly person who complains often.,
Cope with a complaining child.,
Spend time in groups.",How to Deal With People Who Always Complain1," It can be draining to listen to complaints. It can also make the conversation socially awkward. The next time a friend starts complaining, shift the focus.Maybe your aunt complains about your uncle's busy work schedule. Try saying, ""I understand you've been busy, too. Tell me all about your new book club!""
When you redirect the conversation, you are demonstrating that you would like to talk about something else. Just make sure to change the subject to something more neutral.
Avoid potentially negative topics. For example, if you have a friend who constantly complains about work, don't bring up the subject. Instead, talk about a book you both recently finished.;
, Maybe your friends constantly use you as a sounding board. If people regularly complain to you, that means they see you as someone who can be trusted. But it can also be emotionally exhausting for you.Let your friends know that you need to set some boundaries. Try saying, ""Sara, I'm always here for you. But sometimes I'd like to talk about my own life when I'm with you.""
Maybe your friend has problems that make you uncomfortable. Don't be afraid to make that clear.
For example, maybe your friend regularly complains about her disappointing sex life. Try saying, ""Sheryl, would you mind if we change the subject? That kind of personal detail makes me uncomfortable.""

, It is important to explain to your friends and family that it hurts you when they complain all of the time. You can use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and you can also ask the person who is complaining to rephrase his or her feelings using ""I"" statements.An ""I"" statement focuses on the feelings or ideas of the person talking, rather than the person who it listening. Promoting ""I"" statements in your interactions with others may help you to feel less stressed by the complaints that you hear.
When you live with someone who is constantly complaining, it can make you feel like he or she is blaming you for everything that is wrong in the house. Instead of stating, ""I'm sick of hearing you complaining,"" state, ""It feels like I'm getting blamed for everything that is wrong in the house.""
You might also consider saying something like, ""Always listening to the negative is very frustrating for me"" instead of ""You are such an awful complainer!""
You can also ask others to rephrase their complaints using ""I"" statements. For example, ask your sister to say, ""I feel like our holiday gatherings are very stressful"" instead of saying, ""Christmas at your house is horrible!""
Try to use ""I"" statements yourself whenever you are communicating with someone who often complains. This will help you to demonstrate how useful ""I"" statements can be.

, Elderly people can offer up a lot of complaints. Your family gatherings might suffer if you count an aging family member who complains to your relatives. There are ways that you can learn to deal with this specific situation.Take a minute to listen. Elderly people are often lonely and just want someone to talk to. Change the topic to something cheerful and enjoy a chat.
Offer to help. Many elderly people find themselves unable to cope with life's daily challenges.
If your grandmother complains about traffic, offer a solution. Tell her you'll be happy to pick up some groceries for her so that she has to spend less time in the car.

, If you have kids, you've probably heard more complaints than you ever imagined. Pre-teens and teens in particular often complain a lot. You can choose how to respond to complaints made by a child.Try brainstorming. If your teen complains of boredom, ask him to list some things he would like to do. This will help him learn to find his own solutions.
Be patient. Remember that kids are going through a lot of changes.
Many times, the complaints of a child are based on anxiety, or even tiredness. Take care to locate the root of the problem.
Be non-judgmental. Try not to criticize your child for complaining. For example, if your child complains that dinner is ""gross"", try saying, ""It's unfortunate that you feel that way."" If complaining does not earn your child a lot of attention, then he or she will be more likely to find positive things to say.

, When you are in a social situation, it can be awkward to listen to someone who constantly complains. If you have friends or family members who seem to enjoy whining, it can take the fun out of many situations. Try to avoid spending alone time with someone who complains a lot if it bothers you.People are less likely to complain if there are several people around. You don't have to avoid having a coffee date with your complaining cousin. Just ask others to join you.
The next time your cousin asks you for coffee, just say, ""That sounds great, but I already have plans with a couple of friends. You don't mind if they join us, do you?""
You will feel less pressure to respond to the complaints if you are in a group. If your friend complains that she hates the pizza that's being served, you don't even have to respond if there are others sitting close by. Just allow other group members to carry on the conversation.

Show empathy.,
Offer to help.,
Ask questions.,
Be honest.,
Take control of the conversation.",How to Deal With People Who Always Complain2," Dealing with a complaining co-worker is a frustrating situation. Not only is it awkward, it can also make you less productive. If you regularly cope with complaining colleagues, take steps to handle the situation constructively. Try to be kind. Sometimes people just need to vent.
If your co-worker regularly complains of overwork, try saying, ""I'm in the same boat. Maybe we could take turns going on caffeine runs for each other.""
You can also try complimenting the complainer. Try saying, ""Wow, you have been putting in a lot of hours. At least it paid off. I heard your presentation was fantastic."" This puts a more positive spin on the situation.

, Remember that complaints are sometimes legitimate. It is possible that the complainer has a real problem. If you can, try to offer your assistance.For example, maybe someone in your office constantly complains about the frigid temperature. If you agree, try suggesting that the two of you talk to your boss about the situation together.
Maybe your colleague feels that she is being treated unfairly by your boss. Try saying, ""Have you considered talking to HR about the situation?""
By offering advice, you are showing that you heard the complaint. You are also demonstrating that the problem can be fixed. Hopefully, the person who is complaining will heed your words.

, You might find yourself tuning out every time to talk to someone who regularly complains. But try listening. You might find that by asking questions and participating in the conversation, you can make your interactions more positive.Start with a simple question. Try saying, ""What do you think you can do to solve the problem?""
That puts the responsibility of finding a solution on them, not you. But it also indicates that you are listening.
If the person says they don't know what to do, try asking more questions. You could say, ""Why don't you spend some time thinking about it? How about we talk again next week if the problem is still happening?""
Make an effort to understand the situation. If the person who is complaining says vague things like, ""I hate it here"", you can try saying, ""Why?""
This response is non-committal, but will allow you to determine if the complaint is valid. Then you can decide whether to devote more of your attention to the situation.

, It can be fun to socialize with your co-workers. Maybe you have a group from your office who regularly gets together for happy hour. But if someone who often complains tags along, that can ruin the whole evening.Kindly but firmly voice your opinion. Try saying something like, ""I really don't feel like discussing work after hours.""
You can also try gently taking the person aside. You can say, ""I know it's helpful to vent, but maybe we could save the work problems for work, ok?""
You can also simply turn to someone else and start a different conversation. Others will likely follow your lead and talk about more pleasant topics.
Using ""I"" statements, explain your point of view. You can say, ""I feel stressed when you talk about how unhappy you are at work.""

, Your might feel anxious every time a negative co-worker approaches you. Instead of inwardly rolling your eyes, take control of the situation. You can choose how to direct the conversation.End the complaints before they start. When your co-worker approaches, immediately say something positive.
For example, you could say, ""Hey, Betty! I heard you ran a 5k this weekend. Good job!"" By starting the conversation on a positive note, you might be able to head off complaints.
If the other person starts to complain, you can end the conversation. Say, ""Wow, that sounds frustrating. But I'm on a deadline, so I'm going to have to get back to work right now.""

Remove the negativity from your life.,
Practice positive thinking.,
Commit to self-care.,
Reduce your stress.",How to Deal With People Who Always Complain3," Other people's problems can be emotionally draining. If you feel that being around someone is negatively affecting your life, consider removing yourself from the situation. Be mindful of the amount of time that you spend with negative people.You can't always completely cut people out of your life. For example, the person who complains a lot might be a family member.
You can, however, take the pressure off of yourself to attend every gathering. If Uncle Greg really stresses you out, it's okay to take a pass on the next family gathering. Just plead a prior commitment.
If you have a friend who is really draining your energy, you might want to limit your time together. You can try saying, ""John, I'm focusing on making some changes in my life and I'm going to have to stop meeting you for dinner each Tuesday.""

, Keeping a positive attitude can make a major difference in your life. Remember, you can't control how other people behave. But you can choose how to react.Make a conscious effort to remain positive. For example, the next time you are listening to complaints, try thinking to yourself, ""Wow, my life seems pretty great in comparison.""
Positive thinking doesn't mean that you have to ignore problems. It just means that you can choose to focus on finding solutions and other, more positive issues.
Positive thinking can help reduce your stress. This can benefit your physical and mental health.

, Remaining positive can help you feel better able to cope with constant complaints. In order to keep a positive attitude, you need to take care of yourself. Make sure to make self-care a priority.Self-care means making sure that you are meeting both your physical and emotional needs. Take time to check in with yourself each day.
Ask yourself, ""How am I doing? Do I need a break?"" If the answer is yes, then take one.
A simple five minute walk around the block can do wonders for your mental health. Or you can try taking a relaxing bubble bath.

, If you reduce your overall stress level, you will be better able to cope with people who complain often. Try to find ways to ease your tension. There are many steps you can take to do this.Eat a healthy diet. Fast food can feel good in the moment, but a lot of sugars and fats can actually worsen your mood. Try to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables.
Get moving. Physical exercise is a proven mood booster. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week.
Rest up. If you are tired, you will find complaints more aggravating. Try to get at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night to help reduce your stress levels.

Remember that you do not have to try to cheer them up, solve their problems, or have a solution.,
Provide support.,
Do not engage in the negativity.,
Use appreciative inquiry.,
Steer the conversation.,
Attempt to disrupt negative ruminations.,
Help the person see how they might take control of the situation.,
Help the person accept negative events.,
Set boundaries.",How to Deal With Negative People1," It is laudable to try to turn things around for them. However, keep in mind you may not be able to succeed, and it is not typically your job to do so. In dealing with negative people, it is also important to have good boundaries for yourself.

Sometimes the best way to deal with negative people is for you to remain positive and ignore their negativity.
Unsolicited advice is rarely taken. Wait until the person tells you they would like to hear your ideas.
Sometimes there is good reason for a person to be in a negative state; honor where they are. The best way to annoy a person in a bad mood is to tell them they should not be. While that may be true, it will not be helpful.
Be a good example in being positive. Sometimes the best thing to do is to simply take a positive stance. Simply being positive and remaining positive in a sea of gloom will have an effect.;
, The first time you encounter someone you know being negative, provide a listening, compassionate ear. Try to help if he or she requests it. Everyone has a bad day or needs a hand with something on occasion. Just being a helpful, compassionate person can go a long way to spreading positivity.


If the person continues to harp on the same negative topics, you feel emotionally exhausted after you socialize with them, and they overwhelmingly use negative words and phrases (I can’t, they didn’t, I hate, etc.), that’s when it's time to try to disarm their negativity.

, It's really easy when confronted with a negative person to get sucked into their spiral of negativity. Choosing not to engage doesn't mean ignoring them, but it does mean maintaining your emotional distance.


Avoid trying to argue about why the person should not be negative. In an attempt to make negative people change their tune, the first instinct is to try to argue why the person should not be. Unfortunately, this tends not to work. People in a funk tend to have a lot of rationale why, and will typically have a lot of defenses to keep them there. You will likely spend a lot of time and effort for nothing, and maybe even get sucked into the dark cloud yourself.
Negative people tend to exaggerate, focus on their negativity, and ignore the positive. Instead of trying to make them see how they're being negative (which usually only leads to confrontation and reinforcement of their ideas that everyone is against them), try giving noncommittal answers that neither encourage or condemn the negativity. This shows active listening without stating you agree.

Noncommittal comments include: ""Okay,"" or ""I see"".
You can follow up with your own positive take, but try not to contradict the person: ""I see. It is really hard when customers seem unappreciative like that. I try not to take it personally.""



, If the person demonstrates negativity on certain events or subjects, you can have a conversation with them using a technique called “appreciative inquiry.” Appreciative inquiry is a process of asking questions to help the person envision a more positive future. If they are complaining about a past event, you can ask questions focusing on the positive aspects of their experiences or pose questions about the future.These questions might include, “What do you hope would happen next time?” or “What turned out to be positive about that experience?”
This question should lead to a story about what a brighter future would look like and how to achieve that future.

, If appreciative inquiry does not lead to a productive, positive conversation, then gently turn the conversation toward something more innocuous.For example, you might say, “I understand that you’re upset about your coworker. That must have been hard. So, tell me more about your plans for this weekend.” Or, “Wow, that sounds like an ordeal. So, did you see that new documentary?”

, Rumination (going over the same negative thoughts over and over) only reinforces negativity. It is also associated with higher levels of depression.If the person tends to ruminate, see if you can disrupt this spiral by leading the person to focus on something else.


While steering the conversation can include leading the person to a happier topic within the same subject, disrupting negative rumination likely means changing the subject entirely. If the person is ruminating over a work interaction, try bringing up his or her favorite TV show, the person’s beloved pet, or something else likely to result in a more-positive conversation.

, Negative people tend to blame all external factors rather than themselves. People who blame their problems on outside factors tend to have poorer emotional well-being than those who take a different perspective.Try supporting the negative person in developing a plan for how to handle negative events.Venting about a negative situation isn’t necessarily an unhealthy response. We often work through problems and develop a course of action to deal with the problem during this phase. Try to help the person channel the negative energy in a constructive way. You can ask, for instance, what the person can do to change an unfavorable situation at work.

, In addition to talking the person through how to react to a negative event, you can also help the person with ultimately accepting negative events.For example, imagine a friend was reprimanded at work for coming in late. She complains to you at lunch, lamenting the fact that she has to take the bus, complaining that her boss has it out for her, etc. You can try saying several things in this situation, such as:


“Well, the reprimand has already been filed, and that won’t change but it will be taken off your record in six months. You can show your boss that you are committed to being on time from now on.”
“What if you rode your bike to work instead? Then you wouldn’t have to rely on the bus being on time, and you could leave your house a little later.”
""You're really upset by that, I can tell. I'm really sorry that happened. If you'd like some help getting organized in the morning, I find that's really helpful in getting out on time. Let me know if you'd like me to do that.""

, When dealing with negative people, set boundaries for how you deal with them. Someone else's negativity is not your responsibility to deal with. If they're bringing you down too much, you need to spend time away from them.


If the negative person is a work colleague, cut short their negative spiral by telling them you have to get back to work. Do it nicely, otherwise it will feed their negativity further.
If the negative person is a family member (especially one that you live with), try taking a break from them as much as possible. Go out to a library or nearby coffee shop or simply don't answer the phone every time they call.

Do something unexpectedly sweet on occasion.,

Take responsibility for your own happiness.,
Evaluate the person’s role in your life.,
Avoid the person.",How to Deal With Negative People2," Part of dealing with a negative person in the long term is to pinpoint whether or not they are negative or simply someone who's had a bad day.Negative people often become that way as a result of being constantly disappointed and hurt, and the anger that is associated with these circumstances.
Negative people tend to blame all external factors rather than themselves. Of course, there are those people who are totally negative about themselves, and that can be just as draining for a listener.

, Long-term friendships or work relationships with negative people can drain your patience just as much as your time and energy, but it’s important to avoid lecturing or preaching at the person.Even the most positive among us aren’t great at accepting criticism, and a negative person is more likely to see it as evidence that you’re also against her or him rather than taking the feedback constructively.


Even if “getting it off your chest” will help you to vent, it ultimately won’t help the situation.If you must vent about the negative person, do it to someone else you trust in your support group besides the negative person.

, One way to help both yourself and the person mired in negativity is to do nice things for the negative individual that aren’t triggered by a specific situation or conversation. Rejection from other people will always reinforce a negative worldview, so an act of acceptance can make a difference.People can naturally take for granted the support they receive when they’re already in a negative mindset. Show the person a positive action in his or her direction even when it’s not prompted by a negative situation. You may have a larger impact on the person’s interactions with you by doing so.
For example, if you occasionally make excuses for why you can’t see the negative person while he or she is ruminating over a negative situation, try instead calling the person up to hang out when they’re not in a bad or ruminating mood.

, Remind the person of a fun time you spent together or a funny situation. Give him or her a compliment for something that you thought they did well. It reminds the person that someone is invested in them and helps bring a measure of positivity to the person’s day.For example, ”Good job with that essay. I was really impressed by all the research that you did.""

, This act can be anything from chores for a day to inviting the person to watch a movie with you or even taking a walk together. This is a good way to affirm positivity to the negative person without turning it into a lecture on their attitude, which few people take well.

, Sometimes the best way to deal with a negative person (especially if they are part of your friend circle) is to organize group events so that their negativity is diffused among all the different people.However, you must take care to ensure these situations don’t end in the group ganging up on the negative person.


This step works best when everyone in the group shows the same empathy for the negative person and uses the same strategies to try to help the person overcome the negativity.

, Being social creatures, human happiness is often dependent on the quality of your relationships with other people. However, you and only you are responsible for your positivity and your happiness.Being happy in spite of the circumstances means gaining control over your emotional response rather than over the situation. For example, if you're dealing with a negative friend, you can either allow the friend to drain you of your own positivity, or you can shore yourself up with reminders of positive things before and after dealing with the friend.
Governing your own emotional response is like working a muscle. You have to practice being in control of your emotions in response to outside situations, such as dealing with a negative person.

, In the end, sometimes the best way to deal with a negative person is to remove him or her from your life completely. There are times when their negativity brings you down too much to offer you a fulfilling and mutually enjoyable relationship.


You'll need to examine the pros and cons of removing someone from your life. This might be hard to do if the person is part of a mutual circle of friends. It might even be impossible to do, such as when the person is a coworker or a superior.
Take an honest inventory regarding what you get from your relationship with the person, and don’t rely too heavily on the way the relationship “used to be” if the person has become negative over recent months or years.

, If you can't get rid of the person entirely, avoiding the person will be your best option. Remember, you have to take care of yourself. You don’t owe anyone your time and energy, especially if the person drains you of it with negativity.

Remember all of the non-snobs who make you feel good.",How to Deal With Snobby People," You may think that fighting fire with fire is the best approach when it comes to snobs, but the worst thing you can do is try to stoop down to their level. If a snobby person in your circle is going on and on about his fancy vacation to Milan, there’s no point in trying to point out that you’ve been there, too, or that you prefer France over Italy. This will only make the snob more determined to prove you wrong and to show that his way of life is far superior to yours. Instead, hear the person out without feeling the need to show that what you’re doing is superior or that you’re also pretty cool in some other way.


Though it can be tempting to point out how expensive your handbag, wine, or painting are, it’s just not worth it. The snob can never be out-snobbed, and you’ll only be making yourself look bad while alienating the non-snobs around you in the process.;
, You may feel like it’s easier for you to breathe underwater than it is to be nice to a snobby person. Still, when you’re faced with a mean, sour-faced, and generally unpleasant person, sometimes the best thing you can do is to smile and say, “Hi, how are you?” The snob may even be taken aback because he’s not used to being treated so nicely and may surprise you by being kind back. If being nice to the snob doesn’t yield a nice result, then you can at least tell yourself that you tried everything before deciding that the person really is stuck-up.


If the snob insists on acting like you don’t exist, you can even cheerily say, “Hi!” followed by the snob’s name when he walks by. This will catch him off guard — and hey, it may make you chuckle.

, Don’t let a snob make you feel inferior or like you don’t know anything about anything. If you waver in your ideas or doubt yourself, that will only fuel the fire and give the snob free reign to make you feel terrible about yourself. If you’re insecure, slow to respond, or talk softly because you’re afraid of sharing your ideas, then the snob will latch right onto that and will only make you feel worse. Instead, speak in a steady, even voice and use facts to back up your ideas, showing that you’re not afraid to state your ideas.


It’s one thing if you really aren’t an expert on something and the snob tries to gently educate you, but another if you’re talking about something you feel confident about. Don’t let a snob make you doubt how many championships the Lakers have if you’re positive you know the answer; however, if a snob who spent ten years making wine tells you something you didn’t know about pinot noir, it’s okay to listen if you’re not being condescended to.

, Remember that part about not stooping to their level? The thing about snobs is that they not only have really strong opinions, but that they don’t like to have them challenged. Sinking to their level will only make them more sure about their own opinions, and will make them simply annoyed that you would engage with them. Since they’re used to arguing and being snobby, they’ll fight back and will make fun of your taste twice as hard, and that’s something you want to avoid.


Instead of saying that the snob has terrible taste, you can just mention something you like instead in a kind fashion. You can say something like, “Well, I haven’t seen Sherlock, but I really love True Detective. Have you checked it out?” This works far better than saying something like, “That show is for losers. True Detective is the best show out there and everyone knows it.”

, If you’re forced to spend a lot of time with a snobby person, or even call one of these people a friend because you like other things about him or her, then it may be time to bring up the behavior to see if the person is capable of changing. You shouldn’t come right out and say that the person is a snob, but you can try saying something like, “You know, you tend to make it sound like you think your way of doing things is always the right way. It hurts my feelings.” Though this won’t be easy to say, this may help the person change, if he’s willing to do so.


If you’re afraid of using yourself as an example, you can say something like, “You really hurt Ashley’s feelings when you told her her shoes looked cheap. I don’t think comments like that are very helpful.”

, Another way to deal with snobby people is simply to show them that you’re impervious to their insults. If they make fun of you, call something of yours inferior, or just clearly go out of their way to make you and the people around you feel small, then you should make sure not to flinch or respond when they’re being mean, or even to roll your eyes if necessary. If the snob wants to start a fight about craft beers, just shrug and disengage. Show that you’re happy with who you are and that no snob can change that.


If you find yourself on the brink of tears, just excuse yourself and step out for a minute or say you have to take a quick phone call. Don’t let them see how upset you are.
Don’t waste your time complaining about them to others, either. It’ll get back to them and will only give them power.

, One way to win over a snob is to find something that you do agree with or something you do have in common. Maybe it turns out you were both born and raised in Poughkeepsie, New York. Maybe you’re both die-hard Maria Sharapova fans. Maybe you both love making your own pasta. As you spend more time with the snob, dig around conversationally to see if there’s something you can bond over. The snob will begin to see you as a person he shares interests with and will come to think of you as a person of good taste.


If you really do find something you have in common, then you can even impress the snob with your knowledge of the subject.
It may take a little digging if you really feel like you and the snob have nothing in common. If you have a mutual acquaintance, see if that person can give you something to work with. Then the next time you see the snob, you can say something like, “I didn’t know you were a Celtics fan, too. Are you from Boston?”

, Snobs like to stereotype people in order to help them believe that their views are superior. They may have a certain idea about you because you grew up in a working-class neighborhood, went to Harvard, or teach yoga. Though you don’t have anything to prove, if you want to be able to deal with snobby people, sometimes the best thing you can do is to show them that you’re not who they think. It takes time for you to challenge a person’s expectations, but it’ll be worth it.As you help them get to know you, you may find that they’re not who you think, either. Maybe you had a certain idea of the snobby person as being stuck-up, when you’ll learn that the person is really just insecure and afraid of new people.

, Though it may not be easy, one way to win over a snob is to turn him on to something you know he’ll like. Maybe the person is a pastry snob and you know exactly which boulangerie he’ll like the most; maybe she’s only into indie rock and you make her a CD of Stones hits that you know will do the trick. Make an effort to show the snob that there are other exciting things out there that are worth exploring.It’s all in the delivery. You should avoid making it sound like you’re offering a superior opinion. Instead, say something like, “Hey, if you like Vampire Weekend, then I think you’ll actually really like this Velvet Underground album.”

, There are some subjects that will really get a snob going, and they are best to be avoided at all costs. Of course, it depends on the snob you’re dealing with; if you have a wine snob, don’t talk about how you think Napa Chardonnay is the best in the world, unless you want to get a lecture on French viticulture. However, if the snob doesn’t mind talking about fashion, sports, or even current events, then you can turn the conversation in that direction. Every person, even a snob, has a soft spot, and you should focus on discussing subjects that are less likely to be controversial when dealing with your snob.


If the snob is really set in his ways about certain subject, then there’s no point in trying to fight him on the point. You can talk to other people who care about your love for The Beatles or yoga.

, Of course, there will just be some people you don’t click with. If these people are snobs, though, you can think about what makes the snob you’re dealing with angry in particular. If the snob grew up in a working class neighborhood and is suspicious of wealthy people and you have a bit of money, then maybe he’s not the person to chat with about your sailboat and ritzy vacations. If he’s a huge foodie, then maybe he’s not the person to invite to make a daily run to Chipotle. If you avoid bringing up topics that are sure to annoy or offend the snob, then you’ll be more likely to win him or her over.


Though you don’t have to change what you talk about completely to win the snob over, keeping his own prejudices and experiences in mind when you talk will make for more positive conversation.

, The worst thing you can do is to be stuck up right back to the snob. If everything fails, you can just ignore the snob, but there’s no need to be stuck up right back. Don’t bother making fun of the snob’s taste, turning up your nose at the person, not being friendly, or just demeaning everything. That won’t be much fun for you or anyone in your orbit, and you don’t want the snob to drag you down with him.

, If all else fails, you can approach the situation from an empathetic perspective. If you’ve tried to be nice to the snob, tried to change his expectations, and even made a point of introducing him to a new restaurant, brand of coffee, or clothing line that you thought he’d like and have gotten nothing but cruelty in return, then the best thing you can do is accept defeat and feel sorry for the snob. Recognize that the person is deeply insecure, socially unaware, and so determined to prove that he knows best that in the end, his life is going to be sad, lonely, and pathetic. This can make you feel better about being a more reasonable person and for not being able to connect with the snob.


Think about it: isn’t your life so much easier because you’re able to have a conversation without making people feel bad? Think about the difficulty the snob faces in everyday interactions — even if it’s his fault, it still makes for a pretty miserable existence.

, Many people who are shy, socially awkward, or just insecure are often mistaken for being snobs. You may think the person is thinking he or she is better than you simply because he or she is reluctant to make conversation, seems cool socially, and acts stand-offish even when you try to be nice. Some people are just really, really shy and find it hard to connect with new people; this might come off as snobby, but in reality, the person may be as nice as can be. Make an effort to get to know the person better before you make a final judgment.


If the snob is close friends with a few people you think are normal and nice, then it really may be that he or she just opens up to very few people. Think it through before making a final call.

, Another tactic for not letting the snob get to you is to simply avoid being around him or her as much as you can. If you know the snob will be at a small party you were thinking of going to and that being around him will ruin your mood, then skip out. If you know the snob is likely to be hanging out in the kitchen at work, then go out for lunch. Of course, you shouldn’t let the snob win and stop doing what you love for the sake of avoiding him, but if being around the snob is really dragging you down, then avoidance may be your best option.


If you don’t want to let the snob affect your schedule, think of strategic ways to avoid him or her when you’re in the same room. You can pretend to look busy on your phone, actively engage in conversations with other people, or even move to a different conversational circle if you’re at a party.

, If you had to spend a lot of time around a snobby person either socially or at work, then you have to learn to let their comments move right past you instead of getting stuck in between your ears. No other human being should dictate your self-worth or make you feel inferior. You are only inferior if you make yourself out to be that way, and only you have the power to truly control your self-image. If a snobby person is bringing you down, it’s important to remind yourself about all of the things that make you great.


Make a list of all of the qualities you like about yourself, and all of the compliments other people have given you. Just because one person is being a jerk to you doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you — in fact, it’s much more likely that something is wrong with him or her.

, Though ignoring a person isn’t exactly the most mature route, if you tried everything and the snob is still being a real jerk, then that’s not very mature of him, either. If you’re forced to be around the person but no longer care about making a good impression, then the best thing you can do is roll your eyes and not engage with the snob. You don’t have to pretend like he’s not there, but you can mentally tell yourself that this person really doesn’t matter to you at all. This can help you avoid engaging with his snobby antics or trying to waste your energy on fighting back.


If you’re in a group with the snob, just don’t make eye contact or really engage with him. Focus on what other people are saying instead.

, If a snobby person in your life is getting you down, just remember all of the people you actually like, care for, and feel good around. Just because one person is making you feel ugly, poor, or stupid doesn’t mean that a single word of what he’s saying is true. Think of all the people in your life who value you and make you feel good, and don’t let one jerk get under your skin. Instead, spend time with all of the people you love and care about, and you’ll see that you’ll feel better about the world and yourself.


You can even hash out something the snob said with one of your close friends, if it’ll make you feel better. Though you shouldn’t give the snob too much power by talking about him too much, if you just want to confirm that the snob is annoying with one of your close friends, then you can talk about it. Your friend will assure you that you’re awesome and that the snob has nothing to feel superior about!

, You can check that email afterwards. Just open up some non-personal site and pretend to be looking at it. If what you are doing is not very important close your computer and get some fresh air, it will even help you think. If it is very important ask the person to leave because your job depends on it or something of that sort


Better still, open up some boring Wikipedia article and start reading.The person will soon clear off, but if they don't, start doing something very annoying but do not make it obvious (like whistling or humming out of tune) they will be annoyed and hopefully leave you.

, Don't encourage them or smile at them. Keep a really mean and unapproachable face, turn your back on them and try to block the computer as much as possible without making it extremely obvious that you are trying to block their view and do the work, obviously the boring article!

, If they are a bit mature, tell them, ""I don't mean to be rude, but this is really some personal work, and it would be really appreciated if you move out for a minute. Thank you"" They will most probably move out.

, If they don't move out even after telling them and not even a boring article deters them, shut down your computer and talk with them (not about the snooping).

, If anyone bangs on the door, tell them that you are doing some work. If they persist, tell them that you'll open it in a few minutes. If they do not leave you should buy earplugs because they block almost all sound and are cheap!


If the snooper is a family member, you have to respect him/her, and do your work secretly, or you shouldn't open the door at all when you are browsing anything that you would not like to share with him/her.

Do not post anything that might compromise your privacy.,
Accept friends wisely.,
Keep information accurate.,
Manage personal photos.,
Speak properly.",How to Use Social Networking Like a Gentlemen or Lady," More than ever before, users on social networks are more prone to spill the beans on every detail regarding their lives; whether it be of a personal or private nature. A gentlemen or lady would not post anything that glimpses into their private life more than it should. The purpose of social networking is to update your affiliates and personal interconnections about you, but there is a border between public information and private. If you would not say it to them face to face, it’s best not to advertise it on such a far-reaching platform. Topics like your sex life, financial position, spouse or other family or friendship difficulties and information or pictures that have not been approved by those whom are associated, ought to be out of the question.;
, From followers to friends, your profile is on show for the world to see (if you let it). If you do have a profile on one or more social networking platforms, you would more than likely be old enough to know the basics of internet safety. To appear like a lady or gentlemen, it’s important to have people in your friends list that you know or at least have met once. Popular people have thousands of friends lurking their wall and digesting information about them, but sophisticated and composed individuals have a handful of friends. The advantage of this, is that you won’t have accumulations of unreliable posts from strangers relentlessly floating on your feed.

, There is nothing worse than attempting to find that friend from years ago when all their minor information is incorrect. As a gentlemen or lady, you would only add friends that know you, so it isn't too risky to have accurate facts about yourself. Simple identifiers like; full name, age and gender are usually all a person needs to know if they have not been acquainted with you on the site. Once they have, they are then able to access more about where you are in life. Avoid changing your date of birth, last name and other basic pointers repeatedly. Strive to keep a perpetual, yet sensible presence on your chosen social mediums.

, Like the old saying goes, ‘A photo speaks a thousand words’. Maintain your photos at the highest potential they can be whilst avoiding the temptation to post photos of weekend parties, egoistic images of you in a bathroom, pouting, or other obscene gestures with the hands or face that make one look childlike. As an alternative, upload pictures of you smiling with family and friends, vacations or adventures. This is a great medium to share your life, with those in your life.

, There is nothing worse than seeing yolo, swag, lol, lmao and other imprudent idioms that really just verify a person’s intellectual capacity and maturity as undeveloped. Just as it is important to speak properly in person, the same goes for your online presence. Remember to edit out any spelling or grammatical errors in your updates. When using a messaging function on the social networking site, try to respond to the person in clear detail and avoid using too much slam.

Change your perspective.,

Check your own ego.,
Manage your employee’s need for control.",How to Deal With Egomaniacs1," You do not need to constantly engage with this person. The situation can be tricky when the egomaniac is your colleague, but by remaining calm and diplomatic, you can stay reasonable and active.


When you feel an avalanche of self-praise coming on, subtly stop the conversation by avoiding eye contact, withdrawing verbal affirmation, and acting disinterested or bored.;
, Remember, just because the egomaniac claims (s)he can walk on water, that doesn’t mean it’s true. You will have an easier time dealing with their self-apprasal if you remind yourself that you are capable and successful.


If your boss is the egotist, (s)he will probably have a hard time giving you the support and encouragement you need, so look elsewhere for a mentor., The egomaniac is actually very insecure and craves affirmation and attention. Don’t be the person (s)he relies on for proof of their worth. Instead make a slight pitiful pat on the shoulder, let them know its okay, this should take them a step back and confirm your confidence.

, When confronted with another person’s constant assertion of self-worth, your own insecurities or pride can get the best of you. Is this person really worth your time and energy?


Don’t let them lure you into an argument or long-winded conversation about their latest deeds., If you are the boss, and one of your employees is the egomaniac, offering your subordinate options might mitigate their need to assert herself or challenge you. Focus on the positive, and keep them focused on solutions.


You might try killing them with kindness, so to speak. Strategic use of praise and compliments can be a great motivator for a narcissistic employee."

Recognize toxic friendships.,

Flip the script and focus on yourself when you find yourself married to an egomaniac.,
Get help if you find yourself in a controlling, manipulative, or physically abusive relationship.,
Create a healthy sense of self within a narcissistic family.",How to Deal With Egomaniacs2," If you’ve been friends for a long time, it might be hard to see that the egomaniac isn’t really an exciting, larger than life personality. (S)he is just obsessed with themself. Egomaniacs can often be the life of the party, so many people are, at least initially, drawn to them.


If your friend isn’t interested in you, or never gives you a chance to talk, it might be time for a change.

, Let the know that their behavior is hurting you and that you’d like to make some space in the relationship for your needs and feelings. You might say, “I care about you and our friendship, but I feel like we spend a lot of time talking about your feelings. I would like to share some of my experiences with you, but I’ll need you to listen.”There is a range of egotistical personalities, some more fixable than others, so pointing out a friend’s bad behavior might fix the problem.

, You are not required to maintain friendships that are detrimental to your happiness and well being. If the relationship seems truly toxic, cut ties and try not to feel guilty.

, Narcissism in intimate relationships can be especially difficult. Egomaniacs lack empathy, so a romantic partner can feel unloved and lonely.


Think about what needs you are fulfilling by partnering with an egoist. Often, it is a lack of self-worth or co-dependency.Review your own childhood. A narcissistic parent might have trained you to deny your own needs in favor of someone else.
Take control of the situation by respecting yourself and working on your own sense of self-esteem.Do some activities that you are interested in, whether it's reading, gardening, or watching your favorite movie. Remember that you matter, too.
When your partner begins another self-centered outburst, calmly say something like, ""I understand that that you are really excited about your idea, but I've been listening to you talk for a while. I'd like you listen to some things that I have to share."" Or, ""It makes me feel like you don't care about me when you talk over me and ignore the things that I say. I need you to listen more.""
Approach your partner as an equal, not a superior.Couples counseling might be a good option.

, Some egoism amounts to selfishness or arrogance, which is annoying and obnoxious. But a small number of people are extreme in their narcissism and actually have a personality disorder (called narcissistic personality disorder, NPD).


True narcissism can be part of an overall abusive personality. It’s important to recognize this for what it is and get help., An egomaniac affects everyone around them, particularly within a household. Spouses suffer, and children grow up feeling inadequate, and often end up narcissistic themselves.


Counseling might be appropriate when an egotistical parent is wreaking havoc on the self-worth of the rest of the family. While it may be difficult to get the offender onto the therapist’s couch, other family members can get help.
Work to establish healthy boundaries for yourself and your children.
Don’t expect the egomaniac to change without professional help, so set realistic expectations.
Offer sincere positive recognition when appropriate. Focus on the characteristics that you truly admire."

It's perfectly natural to feel incredibly upset and pained, so acknowledge it and accept your pain.


Don't be ashamed to cry or otherwise express your feelings. This doesn't necessarily mean doing so in public. Though, letting out your emotions are healthier than suppressing them.
However, avoid lashing out at others. For instance, if you did not get the promotion, writing a bitter e-mail to your supervisor will not only deteriorate the situation, you might get fired.;
, In the immediate aftermath of a disappointment, it's often really difficult to see the aftermath as anything but an unmitigated disaster.


Ask yourself, Will this matter one year from now? A week? One month? A lot of times, asking this question will bring you back to reality. It's terrible that you dented your car, but will it be fixed in a week? You failed a quiz, but will that matter when the semester ends with a passing grade? You have an injury, and cannot finish out your spring sport, which is unfortunate, but you can play next year.
Talk to a rational, calm, sympathetic friend or relative about your situation -- preferably someone older who has had plenty of setbacks and can offer some more insight.
Writing your feelings and thoughts down can help express frustration, anger, fear, and other negative feelings, too. This can be helpful if you can't immediately talk to a sympathetic ear. While you're at it writing your "" grief list "", the mere fact of your writing it, kindly takes the focus out your deep-felt present disappointment what with your resilience and your up-bringing start suggesting alternatives that somehow, in a very delicate and sensible way, will let you see some light and hopes.
Identify a real ""disaster"" versus something less dire. Real disasters do happen to people: losing a home to a fire, getting a diagnosis of leukemia, your town is overrun by an invading army....those are disasters. Failing an exam is not on this scale. It's easy to fall into the trap of ""nothing this bad has ever happened to me!"" without realizing that people deal with problems far, far worse than what you are dealing with.
Be careful writing about your disappointment on social media. It can be helpful to hear feedback and support from friends in times of disappointment. But be careful of the particular situation. For instance: your employer could find out you are grousing about work, or your angry comments about your ex-girlfriend could cause her friends to become angry at you.

, You may be thinking, Grateful??? How can I be grateful at a time like this? -- which is precisely why you should stop moping about whatever it is that went wrong and start thinking about all of the things that are ""going right"" in your life. Chances are you have a lot to be thankful for: a nice home, a great support network, a promising career, your health, or even your favorite pet. You might be focused on the things you don't have that you haven't had a moment to step back and feel blessed for the things that you do have.


Count your blessings. Make a list of all of the things you have to be thankful for. You'll see that there is a lot more good in your life than bad. And, typically, what you have is more important to you than whatever disappointment you are facing.
Be grateful for your problems. Turn your frustration inside-out. Sure, it's disappointing that you did not get into your first-choice college...but you have the opportunity to go to college and not everyone has that. Maybe you didn't get that job you interviewed for...but that opens the door to apply to other jobs that you may have overlooked. Finding out you have diabetes is unfortunate...but you have the opportunity to live a healthy life thanks to modern medicine, something a person 100 years ago did not have.

, It's great to let your feelings out and to acknowledge that you're feeling sad and disappointed. However, wallowing in self-pity cannot be a long-term plan. There is no particular guideline on how long this should take; but the sooner you start thinking positively, the sooner you'll be able to make a plan for success.


Take some time to care for yourself physically. You may feel a lot better after taking a long walk and getting some sun.
You may need some time to yourself to ""lick your wounds""; that is natural. But don't isolate yourself for very long, as prolonged moping will not do you any good, either.
Listen to music. Music can help work through feelings, depending on your needs. One person may find comfort in angst-filled heavy metal, another in gospel music, another in Tibetan folk music...whatever works for you.
Express yourself artistically. Artists throughout history have drawn inspiration from disappointment. So compose a song, draw anime, paint a self-portrait...you may feel better and create something beautiful as well.

, Disappointment is an emotion occurring when what you want to have happen, doesn't happen. Sometimes it's simply bad luck, but more often than not our plans or expectations need adjustment.


Was your expectation unrealistic? For instance, your 15-year old girlfriend was probably not going to be the person you were going spend the rest of your life with...teenage relationships typically do not last that long. It still hurts to have a break-up, but realizing you weren't married and that you will date many, many people in your life may help soften the blow.
What can I do better next time? You did awful on your SAT. Fortunately, there are many programs, books, and other resources available to do better next time. Plus, you have the experience to know what to expect next time. Finally, you typically have many chances to shine.
Avoid dwelling on blame. Okay, so maybe you messed up - or maybe life is just unfair. Even if you did have something to do with it, give up the regret and move forward. And if you don't have anything to do with it -- you're working your butt off and your boss still won't give you a raise -- then take a step back and see that it's the world that is a little unfair right now, but that you've done everything in your power to move ahead.

, Plenty of would-be actors flood Hollywood hoping for stardom, and rarely do they achieve success without a lot of disappointment. That is, if they find work at all. Actors who ""make it"" typically work relentlessly to find roles, get told ""no"" over and over again, get very minor roles at best, and yet remain optimistic. A person who thinks getting a leading movie role will be easy, gets frustrated every time they don't get picked for a call-back, and is not willing to keep trying will likely never make it in Tinsel-town.


Ask yourself, am I impatient? Becoming good at something generally takes an extremely long time, and this is something generally not depicted well on television or movies, for instance: a 5 minute ""training montage"" compresses a character's efforts that would have actually taken weeks or years.

, You may think that there's absolutely nothing positive in the situation, but that is rarely the case. So you broke up with the person who you thought was the love of your life. Were you really so perfect for each other? So you lost your job. Was it really the best fit for you anyway? One door may have closed, but maybe a window will open, and the whole experience can lead to something even better for you.


Trying to find the good in the situation will help you think positively. And if you want to move forward from your disappointment, then that's a must.

, Okay, so you got fired. You got dumped. You injured your leg. Does this mean you should look for a new job, join OkCupid, or start training for a marathon ASAP? Of course not. Give your situation a little bit of time until you feel calm enough to make a rational decision. Obviously, you should start looking for new work sooner than you should start training for a race with an injured leg, but you get the picture. If you try to solve the problem directly after the setback, you're likely to make a decision out of desperation and despair, not from a rational standpoint.


Watch the entire first season of The Killing. Take a long walk every day for a week. Don't do anything that would make you wallow or be upset, but clear your mind, do something different, and start to heal.

, This is another important part of dealing with disappointment. You can't keep thinking that the world is completely unfair, and that what happened to you was completely horrible. Okay, so maybe it was, but it happened, and there's nothing you can do to make it un-happen. It was in the past, and this is your present. And if you want to have a better future, then you have to accept the past for what it was, however unpleasant it may be.


Obviously, you need to ""practice"" acceptance because it won't happen overnight. Let's say your husband cheated on you -- are you going to ""accept"" that overnight? Obviously not, but you can come to a place where thinking about it no longer leaves you feeling completely angry and bitter.

, Sure, hanging out with Mom or your best friend Mindy might not help you improve your career or find a new place to live, but it can make you feel better about the process. You'll see that you have so many great relationships in your life, and that you have an awesome support system that can help you through it all. Though you don't have to rehash the disappointment with everyone, just having them there will make you feel like you're not so alone with your pain.


Don't force yourself into loud social outings if you're not feeling up to it; hang out with your friends and family in low-key settings.

, The old plan didn't work out for you, did it? That's perfectly okay. Ships have to change courses in the middle of the night all the time to avoid unforeseen obstacles, and so will you. Find a new way to get to that dream career, to find that perfect man, or to make your dream charity come to life. Maybe you've had a setback in your health and won't be able to walk for a few months. Work with a physical therapist to make a plan for success.


Take a look at your life in a new way. How can you still follow your dreams, make yourself happy, but move things around?

, Talk to people who know what they're doing. If you're a teacher who is struggling with your job, talk to the principal. If you're trying to make it as an artist, see if there are other artists in your city who will be willing to offer some insight. Call a family friend who knows something about having to relocate to an unpleasant location for a job. Talk to your mom about what it was like when she went through her divorce. Though every situation is different, getting advice from different people (provided that you trust them), will give you more direction and will make you see that plenty of other people are struggling, too.

, So you may not become director of the writing program at your small college. But there's a new reading series that opened up and they want you to be in charge. Dash at the opportunity to do something new that can give you experience, help you work with a variety of people, and give you more confidence about achieving your goals. If you only want to do thing A, B, or C, then you'll be turning a blind eye when opportunity Z, the best opportunity of all, struts right by you.


A new person can be a new opportunity, too. Don't close off and hang out with the same circle of friends; a new friend can bring new momentum and energy to your life.
Maybe you've only looked for work as a high school teacher and just can't get a break. Why not try something different but related, like teaching community college? It can still be a great opportunity that will give you the experience you need.

, The Nobel-Prize-winning author, Alice Munro, didn't publish a book until she was 37 (!!!), Steve Jobs was a college dropout, and Matthew McConaughey cleaned chicken coops before he became a star. Look at the lives of other people who dealt with major disappointments before coming out the other end with more guts and more appreciation for what they have. If success was served up on a silver platter, then it wouldn't be worth the struggle, would it?

, So you've had a disappointment. Does that mean that all it did was set you back a few years and ruin your mood? Of course not. There's something that you can learn from any situation, whether it's that you should do your research more, not be so trusting, or not jump into something that you feel a little uncertain about. Though it's no fun to learn your lesson the hard way, think of all the positive things this knowledge can do for you in the future.


If you never fall down, you'll never learn to get back up. It's all part of the learning experience.

, Maybe you have a good opportunity in the works. You've been dating a guy for six weeks but have this feeling that he's ""the one."" An agent asked to see your novel manuscript and you have a feeling she might ask you to sign a contract. Your boss mentioned a new exciting position and you think you'll be picked for the job. Well, you can share your feelings with a close friend or two, but if you tell your twenty best friends or acquaintances about what might happen, then you will be more upset when it doesn't happen and you have to give everyone the bad news.


In the future, be cautiously optimistic but private, and share your joy and success after it happens.

, Staying hopeful is the key to a happy and fulfilling life, no matter how disappointed you may be. Stay optimistic, keep things positive, and always have something to look forward to in your life, no matter how small it may be. If you're hopeful about the future and all of the good it can bring, then you will be much more likely to succeed. Hopeful people make meaningful connections and go for unlikely opportunities that more ""realistic"" people would scoff at. Keep your head up and only good things can happen to you.


Hanging out with people who are hopeful and optimistic is a great way to keep up your own sense of hope. If everyone around you is bringing you down, then how can you have hope?

, Remember that you're a valuable person who can bring a lot to the table, whether it's because you're a superb mother, a talented animator, or an incredible listener who is invaluable to your friends. Maybe you're also a great writer, a keen observer, and a computer whizz. Remind yourself of all of your good qualities and keep giving the world what you have, because the world needs it -- even if it may not feel that way after a set back.


Make a list of the five best things about yourself. How can you use these traits to your advantage?
If you think you're worth nothing, then prospective employers, significant others, friends, etc, will think so too.

, What does fun have to do with making a new plan, achieving your goals, and avoiding future disappointments? Nothing and everything. If you're so focused on achieving your goals and overcoming your setbacks, then you will never be able to stop, breathe, and relax. Having fun is just as important as sending out your resume to twenty companies because it allows you to get grounded, sit back and appreciate what you have, and take down your stress levels a few notches.

Choose your battles wisely.,
Pause for a moment.,
State your needs clearly with assertive communication.,
Continue being polite.,
Stick to the facts.,
Minimize your interactions.,
Talk to allies.",How to Deal With Difficult People1," When butting heads with a difficult person, decide when it is worth your efforts to discuss the problem.Not every fight needs to be fought. The sooner you realize this the happier your life will become. Ideally, you and this difficult person would be able to set aside your differences and compromise. Sometimes, this is impossible.


Ask yourself if the situation is causing you enough distress that it must be addressed.
Consider your relationship to this person. If it's your boss or another authority figure, you have to accept some things you don't like (unless it's abusive behavior).If it's a friend or family member, think about whether choosing not to engage is enabling bad behavior or simply saving you time and grief.
Can you even win this fight? You might really, really, want to take on someone that irks you. But you may have to size up the situation, and consider if it really is one that you can reach your goal. Or, the timing is bad. Or you may have to decide if you need to really formulate a plan, get help, or consider your options.;
, Take a deep breath before responding to collect your thoughts and calm your emotions. If your conflict is happening via email or texting, try to avoid sending digital text messages when upset. Take a bit of time to let your stress level decrease. Then you will be able to approach the person more reasonably.If possible, discuss your issue somewhere neutral or in a place with an activity. For example, you could talk while walking. This can limit negative face-to-face interactions., Don't give the person the opportunity to manipulate you or twist your words.Aim to use “I” statements rather than “you” accusations. For example:


”I understand that you are frustrated by my lateness. I would feel the same way. Unfortunately, the subway line was down this morning and we were stuck in the station. I am very sorry for making you wait!”
Do not say: “You are unreasonable for expecting me to be punctual when the subway system was broken down. If you really cared, you could have googled my line and checked.”

, No matter the response of the other person, keep your cool. Do not resort to name-calling. Take breaths before your responses. The key is to not let yourself sink to the other person’s level. Also, the calmer you remain, the more likely the other person will notice and reflect on his or her behavior., Keep a short clear narrative that is not bogged down with too much detail or emotion. It is very possible you won’t be able to get the person to see your point of view and you don’t need to try to convince them. State what happened and don't feel you need to explain yourself.Avoid trigger topics.For example, if you always fight about holidays with your sister-in-law, don’t discuss them! Have someone else do the mediating.
Avoid being defensive.You might want to argue your point but with difficult people, it is best to bypass these kinds of arguments. Do not waste your time trying to prove that you are right. Instead, keep the situation as neutral as possible.

, Although hopefully you can deal with your problem person, if not, limit your time with her. If you must interact, try to keep things short by excusing yourself from the conversation or bringing a third party into the conversation. Stay as positive as possible and make sure to calm down afterwards.Accept that this person will likely never become the friend, colleague, or sibling you want., If you are not making headway with someone and need to do so, speak with a potential mediator. Perhaps your boss can help improve the situation. If your conflict is within the family, find a mutual party who can negotiate. Strive to share complaints only with people you trust.

Choose to forgive.,
Start to build back your confidence.,
Decide what to do next.",How to Deal With a Control Freak," People afflicted with this tendency have a need to control outcomes and often other people. They feel out of control and seek to control someone else. They are terrified of failure, particularly their own and of being unable to fathom the consequences when things go wrong. There is a core of fearfulness or anxiety about their own limitations (often unexplored), a worry about not being respected and a distrust in the ability of others to do what they ask of them.


The control freak cannot trust that anyone will do a better job than they will. And in an age when we are constantly told what to do without being fully told why (think of all the rules, regrets and warnings we live by daily), the control freak likes to step into the gap and appear as the sole authority figure around, whether or not they have a proper grasp on the facts (and sadly, they often do not).
Core qualities of a controlling or bossy person include a lack of trust in others, a need to criticize, a sense of superiority (arrogance) and a liking for power. They can also feel that they deserve things that other people might not deserve, and feel that they do not need to spend time with or show respect for others.;
, Sometimes, a person is just a control freak, but there are times when the need for control goes beyond being an annoying personality trait. Controlling or bossy people may suffer from a personality disorder (possibly Narcissistic Personality Disorder or Antisocial Personality Disorder) that stems from childhood/early adulthood experiences that they have not been able to resolve with any clarity. If the bossy person has a true personality disorder, then the best way to deal with it is for the person to get help.


If you suspect that this is the case, then the exact disorder would need to be identified by a professional. However, you should be aware that getting someone who likes to be in control to accept that he or she needs such assessment will be difficult. Ultimately, this person has to realize their controlling tendencies and want to do something about them. Most people who are controlling and bossy prefer to blame other people for their issues.
Additionally, you may not always be in the position to suggest professional help to the bossy person. If the person, for example, is a boss or an older adult in your family, you may not be in the best position to suggest such a thing.

, Bossy or controlling people sound like a perennially uncompromising parent. They might use terms such as ""Do it now!"", ""I am the boss, do what I say"", or ""Get on with it!"", without asking nicely or using any other form of manners. If you always feel childlike around this person, it's a fair bet that this person is seeking to control you and/or the situation. This person may ignore your skills, experiences and rights, preferring to impress their abilities over yours. The controlling type tends to think that they are entitled to boss others around and to be in charge. This helps them to feel better about themselves.


Even in situations where this person does have authority over you (such as a teacher, enforcement officer or boss), controlling tendencies are revealed through the manner of their use of power. If they are disrespectful, arrogant in tone, pushy and dictatorial, this is a good sign that the person is controlling rather than requesting, negotiating and respecting. People in positions of authority make good leaders or managers only if they respect others under their guidance. This includes directing by example or suggestion, trusting you and delegating responsibility to you.

, This is the personality type that ""nags"", insisting that ""if you don't do X, the sky will fall down""; this may be said to you sweetly, with the expectation that you'll be grateful for the nagging reminders. They may present themselves as the voice of reason, letting you know that you are extremely unreasonable. If you find yourself at the receiving end of decisions being made without your input ""for your own good"" and you're expected to be pleased, then you may be at the receiving end of a benign dictator.


Many a controlling person lacks empathy and is often rather unaware (or uncaring) about the impact of their bossy words and actions on others. This may be a result of insecurity (manifesting as superiority and power) and unhappiness. It could also signal outright arrogance.

, You should always see yourself as an equal of the controlling person, even if his or her behavior suggests otherwise. This is crucial for your well-being. The control freak, especially if he or she is a family member, can really change your self-esteem for the worse. No matter how awful the person may make you feel at times, remind yourself that his or her controlling nature is his problem, not yours. If you let the control freak get inside your head, then he or she wins.


Remember that you're the one who is rational and has reasonable expectations for what a person can and can't do. Don't let another person's unreasonable desires lead you to feel deficient in any way.

, This will not be easy if you're not used to doing it but it's a skill you can practice and your bossy person is as good a practice target as any. It is important that the controlling person is aware that you won't tolerate being bossed about; the longer you let it slide, the more it becomes the established pattern and it's assumed you're accepting of it.


Approach the controlling person in private to explain your concerns. Do not make a public affair out of this.
Keep the conversation focused on how the controlling behavior is affecting you; do not insult the person by calling him or her bossy. For example, if you felt your boss was always telling you what to do without acknowledging your skills, you might say something like: ""I have worked in this capacity for five years and I am good at this job. However, when you tell me to give you the results so that you can rework everything, I feel as if my qualifications are being overlooked and that my input is not valued. Basically, I don't feel that I am trusted to come up with what I am well trained to do and that I am not respected. I would like to be spoken to and treated with respect.""


, It's important to behave calmly and patiently with a control freak, even if you feel like screaming on the inside. Getting angry just doesn't work. It can also be helpful to give the person a wide berth when it's clear that they are tired, stressed out or unwell. If you start to get aggravated, the bossy person's behavior will only become more intense. It's important to take deep breaths, avoid aggressive language, and to keep your voice steady and even.


If you seem obviously aggravated or upset, then the person will see that he or she has really gotten to you, which will only fuel the behavior.
Getting upset or angry will also make the bossy person view you as weak and even more easy to control. You don't want to give off this impression, or it will make you even more of a target.

, Sometimes, the best thing you can do is just to avoid the behavior. Though talking to the person about the behavior and how it's making you feel can help the person understand his behavior and to move towards a plan that will help you work together and get along more easily, sometimes you may feel that the only thing you have left to do is to remove yourself from the situation. Of course, it depends on the person you're trying to avoid, but here are some things to keep in mind:


If it is someone in your family, just try to stay out of their way. Sometimes it may seem there is just no pleasing the control freak. This person will criticize you on everything and it is very hard not to take it personally. It can make you furious and may hurt your feelings. The worst thing you can do is fight with such a person because it just wastes your time. They will not, and cannot, change without help. Remind yourself that this controlling behavior is their coping mechanism and is not a devaluation of you––it their deep-seated problem, not yours.
If a personal relationship becomes abusive as a result of the person's controlling behavior, then you should get out and leave. Tell this person you need a break from him or her for now and move on in your life. People who resort to using violence or abusive tactics will not get better until they seek long term therapy.
If you're a teen, try to be agreeable and keep very busy all the time. You can stay away and get out of the house by doing sports or studying and getting really good grades. Tell them you would love to hang out or talk but you are busy with studying, playing, volunteering, etc. Make up good excuses. Then go out and find really nice people who make you feel good about yourself. Set high but realistic goals and achieve them just for you.

, A control freak has no coping skills when he or she is stressed and that is when they run over people. They believe that no one can do as good of a job at something as they will. They will get bogged down because they have taken too much on for themselves and then they strike out. Try to be alert to the mood change and be on your toes. If you're aware of the bossy person's anxiety levels rising, then you'll know that he or she will be more likely to be controlling.


Actively noticing that this person seems to be spiraling out of control and offering to help take something off their plate may be enough to quell bossiness. For example, you might notice that when your boyfriend is stressed, he gets very snappy and controlling. On a day when he seems stressed to the max about an upcoming work presentation, try giving him a morale boost by acknowledging how tired or stressed he seems and reassure him that he'll do a great job. Don't overplay it and be aware that he may still snap, but do be aware that this small reassurance can help to relieve some of the anxiety pressure.

, This may seem impossible but it can be a very useful way for you to regain control, especially where you have no choice but to keep dealing with this person daily. You might think, ""My boss is really controlling and demanding but on the plus side, she is charming with clients and brings in a lot of business. She is also very capable at X, just so long as we manage to keep her away from Y."" Look for ways to manage around the negative aspects, as well as finding ways that you can get done what you need to do.


Looking on the bright side may require creativity but you'll find that a bossy person who understands you have got their measure and keep trumpeting their positive attributes will cease to see you as a threat in their anxiety-driven mind.

, Notice when the controlling person shows displays of trust. If the bossy person shows you trust, respect or gives away a little responsibility, pounce on it and praise it. By noticing the good and acknowledging it openly, your controlling nemesis may just feel good enough inside to want to do it again.


For example, say something like: ""Thanks for trusting me with that task."" This will make the controlling person feel good and may help him or her ease up on the reigns a bit.

, If you are an ideas person, a creative person or a solver, working with a controlling person can grind you down. It may seem that you suggest ideas, solutions or warn of possible consequences, only to be openly ignored or even put down. Then lo and behold, your idea or solution is presented as ""his or her"" achievement, weeks or months later. Somehow, what you said did filter in; you just weren't acknowledged. This frustrating behavior is sadly all too common when it comes to control freaks. If this happens to you, here are some ways to cope:


Recognize this for what it is. Sometimes it is better to float the idea or solution than to not have it happen at all. In this case, grin and bear it for the good of your group, organization or company. Be supportive of the outcome and don't take it personally.
Call the person out on it. This can be risky and will depend on the context, the group dynamics and the person involved. If it is very important for you to clarify that you thought of it first, you should try to use hard facts, such as ""Oh, that was the idea we discussed back in May 2012 and I still have the prototype drawings on file. My understanding was that our team would be involved in its development and I am pretty sure we noted that. I'm a little disappointed that the first we hear of it is when it's already in the testing phase. But, that said, since it's already here, we're free to help test it.""

Keep very good records. If you really do need to prove that you came up with the idea first, keep sound records that could be used in your defense if it ever comes to that.
Stop suggesting new ideas in the workplace if your input continues to be ignored or taken away from you. Just keep agreeing, so as to keep the peace, and try to keep the control freak from getting worried about your end. You may need to reassure them constantly that they are the ""boss"" and that you value your job. If possible, start looking for a new job.

, Sometimes you may be at the receiving end of bossing or nagging due to things you've done. This isn't to excuse any manipulatively controlling behavior. Rather, it's about keeping things in perspective and acknowledging that there may be times when you have exasperated someone! Be honest in your self-assessment if you really want to get to the heart of the bossing. Here are some things to consider:


Have you done anything (or failed to do something) that may have provoked the controlling attitude? For example, if you fail to meet deadlines regularly or you never clean up your room, you shouldn't be surprised if someone responsible either for your upbringing or your pay-check gets a little bossy with you.
Bossy people can often ramp up their bossiness in face of what they perceive as unhelpful. In particular, bossy people find passive-aggressive behavior similar to a red rag to a bull — it simply causes them to become even more controlling because they're frustrated at the underhanded response. It is better to be open with your discontent and to assert yourself than to seek the undermine the bossy person.

, Nobody is a saint when it comes to being bossy — each of us has a tendency to boss others around at different times in life. It may be when you know something in great detail, it may be because you're in a position of authority, or you may just feel a little pushier than usual due to anxiety or pressure, but there will be times in your life when you get bossy. Use your memory of this experience to help you understand the constantly bossy person a little better and perhaps see the reason behind their behavior.


Try to be more sensitive to other people when you feel the bossy trigger — notice their reactions. In doing so, you learn a lot about handling the emotions controlling people feel a lot of the time.

, You can possibly do this by discussing the matter (privately) with a third, uninvolved party. Be sure to choose someone who can be trusted with the information, who understands how to deal with similar situations, and who knows you well enough to give you accurate feedback. No one is all-good or all-bad; everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. When you know the truth about yourself (good or bad), you won't be fooled by the control freak's emotional whims and tactics.


Having a better sense of how you come off, whether it's in the workplace or in a relationship, can give you a better sense of how reasonable the bossy person's expectations really are. If you have another person back you up, then you'll see that you have nothing to be paranoid about and that the controlling person is really being unreasonable.

, There are always other jobs and other people to have healthy relationships with. If the situation is intolerable, don't torture yourself; instead, find a way out. No one should be given the power to ""control"" your life. It is your life. Don't forget it. Even if you think you'll never be able to find another job, if you're in a toxic work environment, then it's better to leave for your own mental health.


For teens who have to wait until they are old enough to get away, seek volunteer work, sports activities, a job or other things that get you out of the home environment. Ask your parents to pay for college if they have the money, then apply to colleges that are out of state. If they argue about it, explain that the college you want to go to is the only one offering ""X"" (find something realistic and reasonable).

, Control freaks are riddled with fears and insecurities that leave them always unsatisfied and unhappy. They demand perfection from themselves, something both difficult and often impossible to achieve. Their inability to understand that failure is part of the cycle of life harms their ability to grow into fully competent human beings and stunts them emotionally; that's a fairly sad state to get stuck in. Whatever your own situation, you can leave and find happiness for yourself but unless they make a choice to change their thinking habits, they may never find peace in their lives.


Finding happiness does not always mean leaving. You could take up a time-consuming hobby, you could even find religion, to spend less time with the control freak. Remember that their opinion of you does not need to lower your self-esteem. Focus on you and remember that you are not responsible for the controlling person's transformation.

, It has most likely taken a hit. Be kind to yourself. If you are under the thumb of a control freak, he or she might have convinced you that you are worthless; he or she does this as a way to stop you from moving on and leaving him or her. Don't believe this devaluing talk for one minute. Control freaks like to make people feel insecure about themselves. Don't fall for their tricks. Start to distance yourself slowly. Believe in your worth; it is within you.


You can go a long way in building back your confidence just by spending time with people who make you feel good about yourself and who don't feel the need to control you.
Do things that make you feel valued and capable. It's likely that the control freak made you feel like you couldn't do anything right. Make time to do tasks you're confident doing, whether you're doing yoga or writing an annual report.

, In this case, design a plan to either stay and continue the work/romantic relationship or leave but set a time limit so you will feel you have some control over the matter. If you are living with a control freak, try to resolve things strategically and carefully. Do not fuel arguments; share what you feel effectively and calmly. You do not have to be under control; remember that you have a right to do as you please.


Ultimately, sometimes leaving is all that you can do, especially when trying to assert yourself and cope does not result in things being better for you.

Understand the person's true motives.,
Look for the grain of truth.,
Remember that words can never hurt you.,
Stay confident.,
Keep doing what you're doing.",How to Deal With Criticism," This is the first step to being able to deal with criticism. You have to know where the feedback is coming from and understand the intentions of the person who is giving it to you. If it's a teacher or a superior, then chances are the person only wants you to perform better; but when it's coming from a supposed friend, a frenemy, or even an enemy, then you have to wonder whether or not the person has your best interest in mind.


If you're sure that the criticism is completely invalid, totally off, and only meant to hurt you, then you can skip down to the second section to learn how to deal with destructive criticism.
Constructive criticism is, ideally, meant to help you. Destructive criticism is only intended to cause hurt.
Try to focus on the message as well as the delivery. It's hard to see that a person really is telling you something legitimate that you can work on if he or she is yelling at you or just acting like you're a nuisance.;
, This is a great way to deal with criticism. If you want to be able to take a little bit of feedback, then you can't keep thinking that you can do no wrong. Nobody's perfect, so if you think you're perfect, then you're nobody. (Har, har.) Okay, but seriously: every person has flaws, and if you don't see any of yours, then you're not analyzing yourself as closely as you should.


Make a list of your 10 biggest flaws. That's right. 10! Can you think of 10 things that need improvement? How about 15? This exercise isn't meant to make you feel bad about yourself; it's only meant to make you see that you have room for improvement.
Think about all of the people you know. Can you name a single one who is perfect who isn't a movie star? And remember that even most movie stars have some flaws, however visibly small they may be.

, If you want to know how to best deal with criticism, then you can't take it personally. If your boss says you've been a little less productive than usual lately, it's not because he thinks you're fat and lazy; it's because he wants you, his employee, to step up your game. If your best friend says that you have a tendency to zone out when she's talking to you, don't think that she's calling you a horrible friend and a zombie; she just wants you to communicate a little better.


If the criticism is constructive, then it's intended to guide you and to help you improve as a person, not to bring you down and make you feel inadequate.
If your teacher has given you rather critical feedback on a paper, it's not because she thinks you're stupid or annoying in class; it's because she thinks you have some work to do when it comes to making an argument.

, If you always find yourself crying, getting defensive, and feeling generally upset when someone gives you what was supposed to be helpful feedback, then you have to start thickening your skin. Work on accepting your flaws and being able to hear about some areas where you can improve. If you never improve, then you'll be flat-lining, and you don't want that, do you? Try to focus on the message and its intention to help you instead of focusing on all of the ""mean"" or ""hurtful"" things that were said to you.


Think about where the message is coming from. Chances are, your boss didn't just send you a terse email to be a jerk or to make you feel bad. He just probably wants you to do your job better.
Control your emotions. You don't have to tear up every time someone says a negative word.
Work on your reputation. If people think you are sensitive, they will be less likely to tell you the truth, and you don't want people to feel like they're walking around on eggshells whenever they talk to you.

, If you want to deal with criticism, then you have to understand the message behind it. If you've determined that the criticism is meant to be constructive, then you have to break it down so you can start figuring out what to do next. Sometimes, you may be focused on the hurtful aspects of the feedback and your pride may be too wounded for you to see what is right in front of you.


Sure, you weren't happy with the ""C"" on your English paper. But was your teacher trying to tell you that you were stupid and a horrible writer? Probably not. She wanted to tell you to research your argument more, and to use more concrete evidence to back up your claims. It also wouldn't have hurt to actually meet the word limit, would it?
If your friend told you you're obsessed with yourself, sure that hurts. But could there be something helpful behind the message? Sure: your friend is telling you to be a little more empathetic, and to spend more time thinking about others and less time thinking about yourself.

, If the feedback is coming from a person who has your best interest in mind, then you have to consider the possibility that there really is some truth to those words. It's even more likely if you've heard similar comments before. If ten people told you you were selfish, or if your last three girlfriends told you you were emotionally distant, then they can't all be wrong, can they? Take a moment to consider the possibility that this person is really on to something.

, Okay, you've decided that your English teacher, boss, boyfriend, or best friend is completely right, or at least somewhat right. Now, you've got to write down the thing you need to work on, and make a plan for addressing it. This can take a long time, and it's never too late to start. Once you come up with a plan, a way of adjusting your expectations and actions, you can begin to address the criticism and become a better person.


If your English teacher is right about you needing to do more research, then make a point of spending twice as much time reading up on your sources before you come up with an argument next time.
If your boss tells you you're disorganized, work on organizing your desk, Inbox, and your spreadsheets until you feel more in control.
If your boyfriend tells you you're too needy, work on giving him some space by spending more time alone or with your girlfriends.

, If you have received some criticism that was delivered in a friendly and helpful way, or just in a way that was meant to be honest and clear, then take the time to thank the person and to say that you appreciate the fact that the person told you something that can make you an even better friend, girlfriend, student, or professional.


Thanking people who give you honest criticism is also a sign of maturity. Suck it up and say ""thank you"" even if you're gritting your teeth.

, If someone is giving you valid criticism, stop making excuses for why that person is completely wrong, especially if you know that there is some truth to what he or she is saying. If you get defensive and make excuses, then the person won't be able to finish telling you exactly what he or she means, and you won't get the information you need to really improve. It's natural that we feel defensive and get the feeling that we can do no wrong, but it's important to hear people out before you cut them off to prove you're perfect.


If someone is in the middle of telling you something you can do to improve, don't say, ""But actually, I already do that..."" unless you feel like the person is really off base.
If your teacher says you need to work harder, don't give her a lame excuse for why you've been slacking off. Instead, note the feedback and try to address it.
It takes maturity to stay quiet instead of making excuses for why the person is wrong when you're getting valid feedback.

, Sure, it's tough to deal with even the most well-meaning criticism, especially if you're convinced you're perfect and that you can do no wrong. But if you're so invested in being an awesome person, then remind yourself that being aware of your flaws and shortcomings and making a plan for addressing them will make you an even more amazing person.


The next time you hear some constructive criticism, embrace it! It's kind of like what Kelly Clarkson said: ""Whatever (criticism) doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""

, If you have recognized the criticism as completely destructive and hurtful, then you can think about why the person might have said such a thing to make yourself feel better. Maybe the girl was jealous of your new outfit and said you dress like a skank. Maybe a guy said you're not a good writer because he's jealous that you just published a story. Maybe the person was just in a bad mood and felt like taking it out on someone. Whatever the reason, remind yourself that it had little to do with who you are.


Put yourself in the person's shoes. Understand where he is really coming from. Though the words will still sting, it might make you feel better. If your coworker yelled at you for no reason, but you remember that he is going through a divorce, then you'll start to be a bit more understanding, won't you?

, Okay, so maybe the criticism was delivered in a way that was completely mean, unnecessary, and hurtful, and most of the things that were said were way off base. Maybe your co-worker said you were ""a complete mess"" or your friend said you were ""totally selfish"" for what you think was no reason at all. Take a minute to think about it, though: do you need to brush up on your organizational skills? Have you been known to be a little selfish from time to time? If so, then maybe you should reconsider your actions without getting hurt by the way the criticism was given.


Sure, it's very hard to take someone seriously if they are yelling at you, calling you names, or generally treating you with completely disrespect. This makes it nearly impossible to take a word they say seriously. But if you want to be the bigger person, try to find the underlying message if there is one.

, What was that thing your mother told you about ""sticks and stones"" not being able to break your bones? Sure, you thought it was stupid in third grade, but now, you're a lot older, and it's starting to make sense. In the end, destructive criticism isn't made up of bullets, swords, or atomic bombs -- it's just a series of words connected together in a way designed to make you feel terrible. So, remind yourself that criticism only consists of a bunch of words.


Criticism can't steal your money, slap you across the face, or crash your car. So don't let it get to you.

, The most important thing you can do is maintain your confidence. No matter what people are saying about you, you have to stay strong, remember who you are, and not let other people influence your own self-worth. Being confident doesn't mean thinking that you're flawless, but it does mean loving who you are and how you look. If you're truly confident, then you won't let haters get you down and make you think less of yourself.


If you're unhappy with who you are, ask yourself why. Make a list of a few things you don't like about yourself and figure out what you can change.
Being confident also means accepting the things you cannot change about yourself. So, you don't like that you're so tall. Do you plan on slouching for the rest of your life, or will you start to love your long legs after all?
Hanging out with people who make you feel good about yourself will also go a long way in making you feel more confident. If you're hanging with people who always bring you down, then yeah, you're not going to feel good about yourself.

, So...you've heard that someone said you're a brown-noser. Will you start participating less in class? Or your co-worker has told you you're too type A. Are you going to stop being who you are if it's working for you? Of course not. If you haven't received a valid criticism and know that what people are telling you is only only being said because of jealousy, anger, or mean-spiritedness, then there's no need to change your routine to please people.


If the criticism has no basis whatsoever, then the best thing you can do is to ignore it completely.

Don't feel bad if you're not able to push all of these negative words aside right away. It takes practice to stop caring about what people think.

Realize there will always be difficult people.,
Increase your frustration tolerance.,
Examine your own behavior.,
Be aware of your perceptions of others.",How to Deal With Difficult People2," No matter where you live or work, you will encounter people who seem like they are out to hurt others. The key is to learn how to deal with these sorts of people. Because they are impossible to avoid, it may help you to identify some of the different types of difficult people so you can decide the best way to interact with them. They include:“Hostile” people tend to react violently. They can be cynical, argumentative, and have trouble being in the wrong. These people thrive in power roles or as cyber bullies.
“Rejection-Sensitive” folk look for insults. In other words, it’s very easy to offend them. They often use textual means (email, texting) to express their dismay.
“Neurotic” types are yet another breed. They might be anxious or pessimistic and often are very critical of others.
“Egoists” prize their own interests first. They loathe compromise and also are hyper-sensitive to personal affronts.

, The other person's behavior is beyond your control, but you get to decide how you will react and whether or not to engage them. One way to do this is by increasing your frustration tolerance, which involves challenging irrational beliefs that may lead you to become stressed, angry, or lose your cool.


When interacting with someone difficult, you may be thinking, ""I can't deal with this person anymore!"" Before you react based on this irrational thought, take a deep breath and question it's validity.
The reality is that you can deal with it. You won't die or go insane because your mother-in-law is trying to micromanage Thanksgiving, or your boss is going on a rant. You are strong and you can take it. Your choice lies in how you take it: will you stress until your blood pressure begins to soar, or will you take some deep breaths and hand your mother-in-law some carrots to chop so she's occupied?
When you find yourself using words like ""must,"" ""can't,"" ""should,"" ""have to,"" ""always,"" or ""never,"" take a moment to reassess that thought.

, If people continually attack you, it could be that you are attracting the wrong types of people. For example, if you are overly negative, other pessimistic people might flock to you. Try to find friends who are engaged in positive behaviors.


When you had negative experiences in the past, what was your role? What were your actions in response to the behavior. For example, let’s say your friend Liz constantly picks on you. Do you respond to her? Do you stand up for yourself?
It’s helpful to recognize your own strengths and weaknesses. This way, when you confront difficult people in the future, you will be better equipped to handle them.

, One of your friends might seem difficult but she could be going through a rough time. Instead of judging others’ behaviors immediately, practice empathy by stepping back and reflecting on how you would feel in his or her place. If you are sensitive to personality differences, you will be better able to hand diverse conflicts.


Practice acceptance by taking a deep breath and looking at the person with as much compassion as possible. Say to yourself: ""I see that you are suffering. I accept that you are anxious and scared, even if I don’t understand why. I accept that you are making me anxious, too.""When you accept that something ""just is,"" acknowledging and accepting that the person is difficult, you release some of the tension created by resistance or trying to fight.Imagine a sympathetic reason for their behavior.You may not understand why a customer just blew up at you for no apparent reason. Instead of becoming angry yourself, consider that she might suffer from severe, chronic pain, which gives her an extremely short fuse. It doesn't matter if the reason is true or even very realistic – it helps you stay calm and not feed into the negativity."

Take a moment to evaluate the reasons you're having this attack.,
Cry.,
Write about it!,
Share your misery!,

Whatever or whomever your obsession is, someone out there feels the same way.;
, It sounds so cliché, but crying always helps! Cry and whine to your self about the fact that you wish you could just touch Justin Bieber's hair, rest your head on Austin Carlisle's chest, or smell Selena Gomez's perfume. One thing you NEVER should do, is share your feelings with someone who doesn't care, or will be negative about it. Surround yourself with positivity about your situation!

, There are fanfictions websites like Wattpad, or most celebrities have a forum page just for that purpose! Never hold your inner fangirl/fanboy in, because that just won't work! Embrace it and do something about it. Write a story about a boy/girl (don't lie, we all know you're going to pretend it's you.) who is living your dream with your obsession.

, Start an Instagram, Facebook, or Tumblr account and connect with other fans just like you! It's all free, and it certainly helps when you can post what ever you desire and speak freely about celebrities!

Find ways to get tickets to a concert of your favorite singers, or tickets to a meet and greet with your favorite actor! There's always way to handle these fangirl/fanboy attacks, and you better believe it, you are not the only one!

Remove yourself from the situation.,
Release what anger you have through a relaxing activity.,
Get your mind off the argument in an active way.,
Reflect.,
Attempt to reconcile.,
Agree to disagree respectfully if things can not be worked out on the subject matter.

,
Suggest doing something fun with the other person.",How to Cool Down After an Argument," This is perhaps the most important step, as it allows you to escape from what is causing these feelings. See other things, give yourself a change of scenery. Taking yourself away from where the simple sight of any little object can bring back a memory of an argument can help you calm yourself.;
, You can try:


Writing a journal entry.






Creating something artistic to represent your feelings.






Gardening. Even pulling weeds can refocus your attitude.






Ranting to your pet (make sure the other person isn't around to hear it).






Confide in a friend who won't tell the other person. If you don't want to make the other person look bad, try giving just the details of the situation and no names.







, When you are distracted from the argument that took place after releasing your anger, you are more likely to be in a better mood than if you had sulked over the argument. Some activities you can try are:


Going for a walk and enjoying everything around you.






Doing some housework or errands.






Taking a relaxing bath.






Watching your favorite movie or TV show.






Talking to friends about something fun. Not the argument.







, Think over what the argument was about after you have calmed down, but avoid getting angry again. Now that you have some distance and are more relaxed, you are more likely to look at things from an objective perspective, rather than an emotional perspective.

, See if you can work things out with the other person - but avoid negativity. If the other person is still angry, leave it be for the time being. It won't work if one is angry - one of you will probably get the other riled up all over again.

,, This will allow you to forget you even had the argument in the first place. A fun experience can dispel any lingering feelings of resentment, anger, or bitterness over the argument.

Trust your gut.,
Always have access to an exit.,
Avoid dealing with a violent person alone.,
Learn basic self-defense.,
Keep children away from the person.,
Have an emergency plan.",How to Deal With a Violent Person1," Your instincts are often better at recognizing danger than your rational mind is. If something about a situation seems off, or if you don’t have a good feeling about someone, listen to your gut and get to safety as soon as you can. It’s always better to be too cautious than to get into a dangerous situation.If you don’t know how to leave a situation, make up an excuse. Say that you have to let your dog out or pick up your friend whose car broke down.;
, If you’re inside with a potentially violent person, make sure you can get to the door easily. Don’t block the door, though. If the person feels trapped, they may be more dangerous to deal with.Get into the habit of noticing where the exits are everywhere you go.

, If possible, ask a colleague, friend, or family member to stay with you when you deal with someone who might turn violent. The presence of someone else might be enough to keep the violent person calm. If they do decide to use physical force, you’ll be safer with backup than without it.For instance, if you are a nurse treating a patient who has a history of violence, it’s a good idea to ask one of your colleagues to step into the room with you.

, Knowing some self-defense moves could save your life if you’re ever attacked. Search the internet for some simple techniques you can practice at home, or sign up for a beginners’ self-defense class.Ask a friend to help you practice the techniques you learn.

, If you know that someone with violent tendencies is frequently around children, make their safety your top priority. If they are your own kids, take them to stay at a safe place, like a family member’s house. If they are someone else’s, offer to look after them temporarily or help their parent find a place to take them.If you think that any children are in a dangerous or abusive home situation, let the appropriate authorities know immediately.
Kids can’t protect themselves, so they depend on adults to protect them. Don’t assume someone else will report a bad situation – report it yourself if you know something is wrong.

, Know what you will do if someone around you becomes violent. Ideally, you should leave the building and call the police. If you are at home and cannot leave, retreat to a safe room and lock the door before calling emergency services.If you live with a partner or children, come up with an emergency plan together. Make sure everyone understands what to do to stay safe in a crisis.

When you have to vomit, say you have to use the restroom, and go vomit in the toilet.,
If no restroom is available, ask to be excused.,
If you have warning, remove your shirt or dress to avoid a vomit spill mark.,
When you are done, wipe your mouth with tissues.

,
If you have water, swish some in your mouth then spit it in an inconspicuous place.

,
Try to use a breath mint, because the acid from vomit can reek.

,
If your date (or whoever you happen to be with) asks what happened, say you had to take a moment or make a phone call, then change the subject.

,
If you need to vomit, take a napkin and cover your mouth and vomit.",How to Vomit Politely," Then flush the toilet and wipe your mouth. If there is a water fountain nearby, you would probably want to get a drink.;
, Then, leave to find a bush, tree, rock or anything big that you can hide behind.

, The embarrassment of being seen without covering is less than having a ""vomit 'V'"" down your front.

,,,,, If it sinks through, say ""excuse me"" and escape to a restroom. If your friend follows you, run into a stall and begin vomiting freely.

Stay calm.,
Keep your voice down.,
Avoid telling the person to calm down.,
Reflect the person’s feelings.,
Use non-threatening body language.",How to Deal With a Violent Person2," Take a deep breath. Don’t take the other person’s anger personally. Avoid becoming agitated, raising your voice, or fighting with the person.Remember that anger is always rooted in someone’s personal pain. It’s not about you, even if the person is taking out their feelings on you.

, Even if the other person is shouting at you, respond to them as calmly as you can. If they are too worked up to communicate rationally, don’t say anything until they quiet down a little.If you raise your voice, you’ll only fuel the person’s anger. Don’t encourage them to fight.

, Saying something like “Settle down” or “Relax” will probably just make the person angrier. They may resent being told what to do and feel like you are brushing off their problem.Create a connection with the person by acknowledging their anger instead. Say something like, “It seems like this is really bothering you. Can we talk about it?”

, When the person tells you what’s wrong, empathize with them. Make them feel like you’re on their side, even if you don’t agree with them. They will be less likely to turn violent if they feel understood.For instance, you might say something like, “So you’re hurt that no one told you about the change of plans ahead of time, is that right? You feel like no one wanted to include you.”

, Maintain an open, relaxed posture. Make eye contact with the angry person, but keep your expression non-confrontational. Don’t make animated gestures, put your hands on your hips, or fold your arms. Move slowly and calmly.Give the angry person plenty of space. This also gives you some protection if they do become violent.

Consider the person’s past history of violence.,
Look for changes in the person’s behavior.,
Think about whether the person’s circumstances have changed lately.,
Find out whether the person is using drugs or alcohol.,
Know how to spot the signs of anger.",How to Deal With a Violent Person3," Previous violence is the biggest predicting factor for whether someone will become violent in the future. Getting into fights, committing violent crimes, being cruel to animals, and breaking things in fits of anger are all examples of violent behavior., If you know the person, be aware of whether their behavior seems different or off in any way. Notice whether they’re acting particularly confrontational, secretive, or irrational. Pay attention to changes in mood as well, such as angry outbursts or expressions of hopelessness.For instance, if the person you’re dating has started yelling at you over minor issues, proceed with caution – anger management problems can often escalate into violence.

, Ask yourself whether the person has recently lost a job, ended a relationship, or subscribed to an extreme belief system. Negative life changes can spur a person towards violent behaviors., Drugs and alcohol impair a person’s judgment and lower their inhibitions, making them more likely to act on violent urges. If someone you know shows red flags for potential violence and also uses substances frequently, be cautious around them.According to the NCADD, 40% of violent crimes involve alcohol use.

, Someone who is getting angry may look tense and unhappy. You might notice them trembling or flushing red. They might also pace back and forth, snap at people, speak sarcastically, or raise their voice.Anger is the precursor to violence. If you notice someone getting angry, leave or take action right away to calm them down.

Make sure you know her well enough to tackle her.,
Tackle in the right setting.,
Make your intentions clear.",How to Tackle a Girl1," You should never tackle a stranger, and you should avoid tackling someone that you've just met unless you're sure that she will be comfortable with it. If she is your sister, your relative, or your good friend, then she might feel more comfortable with you tackling her. Use your best judgment.;
, Tackling is a large part of many contact sports, including rugby and American football. If you are playing a contact sport with a mixed group of boys and girls, then the tackling issue will certainly come up. Consider playing flag football, two-hand touch football, or another less violent variation of the game. If you plan to tackle a girl in a non-sporting context, then you will need to be especially sure that she'll be okay with it.



Flag football or two-hand touch football can be a great way to avoid the issue of tackling a girl. In regular football, you stop someone from running the ball by tackling them to the ground. In touch football, you only need to touch them with two hands at once.In flag football, you pull a ""flag"" from the runner's belt to signify that you have stopped them.

, Check in to be sure that the girl is comfortable with being tackled. It's better to ask ahead of time than to risk making someone feel violated. Get consent and establish a common understanding of the rules.If you are playing a contact sport like rugby or tackle football, make sure that everyone playing understands that he or she might get tackled. Explain the rules before you begin. If anyone is uncomfortable with being tackled, consider playing a less violent variation.
If you are going to tackle a sibling, a romantic interest, or a female friend, then you should be physically comfortable with one another. It's okay to play rough, but you need to make sure that you are not violating her personal space.

"
"
Avoid touching sensitive areas.,
Tackle gently.,
Respect her agency to play.",How to Tackle a Girl2," Even if the girl doesn't mind being tackled, she might not be so comfortable with you touching her breasts or her pelvic region. The legs and the midriff are usually safe. Wrap your arms around her waist, or aim low for her knees.Try not to worry too much about inappropriate touching. Pretend that you are tackling a male friend, but be a bit gentler. If you obviously aren't aiming for her private areas, then there shouldn't be a problem.

, Once you wrap your arms around her for the tackle, try placing your arms on her back so that she won't be hurt when she hits the ground. If you make a diving tackle from a few steps behind, then you will tackle harder in your effort to catch up. If you are worried that you'll hurt her, try to catch up to her first, then bring her slowly to the ground – that is, if you can catch her!

, Girls are tough, too. If she wants to play tackle football with you, then that is her choice. It is not necessarily your place to treat her like a delicate doll. Be careful, certainly, and treat her with respect – but do not assume that she is weak just because she is a girl!

Select an empty location.,
Pee in the dark.,

Pee in the woods.,
Avoid peeing anywhere near children.,
Do not pee on public transportation.,
Keep antibacterial hand sanitizer with you.,
Look for a public restroom.,
Break the law out of necessity.,
Look for resources.,
Do not urinate publicly if you are bar hopping.,
Plan frequent bathroom stops depending on your needs.,
Respect the city and cultural norms of your surroundings.,
Do not pee in public as a dare from your friends.",How to Urinate Outside Discreetly," If you have been drinking heavily in a bar or club, you might be tempted to urinate on the nearest sidewalk or on the side wall of the bar. But you can be arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for doing this in all 50 states..That is why it is imperative you pick a quiet, isolated space to pee in which you won't be seen.


If you are a girl, there is no quick and convenient way to pee outside, especially if you are wearing pants. If you are wearing a skirt, you can try taking off your underwear before you squat. You can also try pulling your underwear to the side of your vagina, although it still might get soiled.;
, If you are out at night, you might be tempted to pee against a street lamp, but this will only make it easier for a police officer to spot you. Instead, pick a dark, shadowy alley or an unlit park.


If you are out with friends, make sure they know you are going into a dark spot to pee. They can make sure you are safe from a distance.

, Peeing against a brick wall or on a concrete sidewalk will sound louder than if you pee onto dirt or grass. If you are near a local park or a dirt road, then you should try to pee here as it is less likely that someone will hear you.

, If you are stuck in a traffic jam, try to find a wooded area near the highway where you can relieve yourself away from the sight of other drivers.


If you are hiking or camping, select a spot that is within an easy walk of your tent or fellow hikers, but that is not within easy sight. Pee behind a tree, away from anyone else on the path or at the site.
If you are stuck on the road and there are no trees to conceal you, get out of the car and open the driver's door and the passenger door behind it. This will block the view of the other cars from you while you pee. If there are cars in the lane next to you, turn away from them and pee toward your car.
If you are a girl and have to squat, try to get a fellow passenger to hold up a blanket or towel to hide you.

, Do not pee near a school, playground or other location with children. This can have serious legal consequences (as discussed below). You could also face the wrath of an irate parent, who will not hesitate to call the police on you.


Understand the consequences of being a sex offender. In 12 states, public urination could require you to register on a public sex offender list.Registering on a sex offender list could cost you everything from your job to your ability to live in a city (most sex offenders cannot live between 500 and 2,500 feet of schools, parks, day cares of school bus stops).
You may also be prohibited from attending any events with children, such as Little League games or school performances. While you might not care about this as a drunken undergrad, you will probably deeply regret never being able to attend your future child's football games or Christmas concerts.
In many states, peeing in public is labelled as ""public indecency."" Under this categorization, offenders are labelled as flashers., These spaces are technically ""public,"" and you could get arrested and fined for any damage you may cause to a train, bus, or subway. Other people are also highly likely to see you here and possibly turn you in.


Most of these locations also have video surveillance; while you might think no one can see you, you are probably being monitored from a distance.

, After you pee, apply a hand sanitizer (you can find travel sizes in most drug stores) or an antibacterial wipe to clean your hands. Wash your hands in the nearest washroom you come across.

, If at all possible, try to find a place to rest near a public restroom. These can often be found in parks, national monuments and historical sites, civic centers, libraries, bus or train stations, or public plazas..


If you cannot find a public restroom, try to follow some of the tips above. Pee in a quiet, isolated space where you are unlikely to be heard or disturb anyone.
If you cannot afford rent, but have some money saved up, try to buy a membership at a local gym or health center. A year's membership often costs less than a full month's rent and it will give you access to a shower, a locker room and a bathroom while it is open.

, Being homeless means you often have no choice but to break the law and urinate publicly. If you are fined or ticketed for this action, try to defend yourself legally by describing the necessity of your actions.


You may be required to appear in court if you cannot pay a fine or if you are charged with a more serious misdemeanor. If you have a court-appointed attorney to defend you, they must be able to prove that you had a reasonable and good faith necessity for the crime.Research legal resources or lawyers who do pro-bono work for homeless people in your area. Many lawyers and legal advocates for the homeless can help clear charges for low-level misdemeanors like public urination.
Some cities, such as Los Angeles, have offered deals in which minor crimes can be erased from a homeless person's record if that person agrees to accept certain services, such as job training or addiction treatment programs., If you have access to a computer at your public library, you can look up resources available for the homeless in your city and state. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides a state by state guide here: https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/.


Your city or state may offer resources such as shelters, grant programs to help you move into an apartment, job training programs, mental health services, etc., If you're heading to a new bar, just use the bathroom once you arrive there.


You can also generally use the restrooms in fast food restaurants and gas stations without having to buy anything there.
Areas with crowded bars and club will generally be filled with police.

, If you are on a long car ride, plan to stop every 2-3 hours to use the bathroom. Check your map to make sure you have nearby towns or cities where you can stop to use the bathroom.


If you are enjoying a long night out with friends, be sure to use the bathroom before you leave the bar or restaurant you are at.

, If you are in a foreign country, do not pee in public. Local inhabitants will not see it as just a moment of weakness on your part. Instead, they will see it as an act of disrespect from you and a broader reflection of your country.

, It is not worth risking the consequences.


Similarly, do not think that just because your friends have peed in public with no consequences that you will also go unpunished.

Even if they don't see you do your business, they may feel the sudden warmth and become suspicious. Move to the left or right, instead of deeper into the ocean.


Do not go so far away that you can no longer see or hear other people. You want to be within sight and hearing/shouting distance, in case something happens.;
, Lots of fish and other sea animals live there. Some of them could harm you, while others could be harmed by you., The further away you go from other people, the more likely you are to come across some sea critters. Stay clear any marine life, including other fish, sharks, and jellyfish. You may hurt them, or they may hurt you.

, While urinating in the ocean can be beneficial to the marine plants, it can be harmful to coral reefs. Urine helps marine plants grow—including algae. This can result in algae growing out of control on a coral reef and blocking out the sunlight it needs. This could suffocate and kill the coral reef., Try to keep a distance of at least 100 feet (30.48 meters) from these places. Both piers and jetties tend to be surrounded by rip currents, which are very dangerous.Rip currents are very strong ocean currents. They flow away from the shore.The last thing you'd want is to get caught in one.

, This will keep your private parts hidden from view.

, Never turn your back on the ocean. Even if the water seems calm and the waves small, a large wave can come up suddenly.


These sudden waves are known as rogue and sleeper waves. They can be very dangerous if they catch you unawares., This is so that you do not expose yourself. Don't worry, everything will rinse off in the water.

, This will help everything flow out easier. Pretend that you are enjoying the nice view. This will help people from suspecting what you are up to.

, There will still be some residue on you and your swimsuit. If you are wearing swim shorts, simply take hold of one of the legs and give them a little shake. If you are wearing a bikini or a one-piece swimsuit, take hold of the bottom part, right between the leg holes. Pull down on it for a moment, then let go.


Be sure to wash your swimsuit using warm water and soap when you get home. This will prevent bad smells.

, You want to be able to sit in the ocean without the water coming past your chest. Be sure to face the horizon and incoming waves.

, Even if you are only knee-deep in the water, you still need to keep an eye out for waves. Small waves can suddenly turn into large waves.

, Even if part of you is hidden in the water, it is still a good idea to keep your swimsuit on.

, Make sure that your thighs are not touching. Lean back slightly, and support your weight on your palms. Pretend that you are enjoying the water. You should still be facing the horizon.

, If you don't like the feeling of sand against your skin, you can try squatting or crouching instead. You may need to go a little bit deeper into the ocean for this. Do not go so deep that the water goes past your chest. Act like you are taking a rest, or people may begin to suspect.

, Once you are finished, continue sitting or crouching in the water for a little bit. If you stand up too soon, people may catch on to what you just did.

, You will need to shift forward to a crouching, squatting, or kneeling position. If you do not do this, you may get sand inside your swimsuit. Make sure that your waist and everything below is still underwater. If you are wearing swim shorts, take hold of one of the legs. Give it a few quick shakes, then let go. If you are wearing a one-piece swimsuit or a bikini, start by taking hold of the bottom—the swatch of fabric right between the two leg holes. Tug down gently and then let go after a few seconds.


Wash your swimsuit when you get home with some soap and warm water. This will help prevent any bad smells.

, Even though you are in water, there will still be some residue left over. If you are wearing swim shorts, grab hold of one of the legs by the cuff and shake it for a few seconds. If you are wearing a bikini or a one-piece swimsuit, take hold of the fabric between the leg holes. Pull down on it for a moment, then let go.


Remember to wash your swimsuit using soap and warm water when you get home. This will keep your swimsuit from getting smelly.

Breathe through your nose and exhale through your mouth.,
Drink a cool beverage.,
Eat chilled foods.,
Use a cold compress.",How to Stop a Yawn1," Some scientists theorize people yawn because of a lack of oxygen. Therefore, taking a few deep breaths when you feel a yawn coming on can help stop it before it starts.


You should breathe through your nose and out through your mouth. This allows the most oxygen to enter and channels the air into your diaphragm.Make sure, when you breath, you pull air into your lower abdomen and stomach rather than your chest.;
, Cooling the body can help suppress a yawn. If you feel a yawn coming on, try having a cold drink.


Try ice water, iced tea or coffee, or cool juice. Soda and carbonated beverages might stop a yawn but they can cause gas and other discomfort.If you're going into a meeting, class, or other activity where yawning would be rude consider bringing a drink with you if it's permitted. Having a bottle of cold water on hand can help you stop a yawn in case one comes on., Colder foods can prevent yawning much in the same way cold drinks can. Try to eat cold foods, like refrigerated fruits, veggies, cheeses, or yogurts. Sugary foods, like ice cream, could actually have the reverse effect as sugar tends to make the body tired. This can cause excess yawning. Stick to healthy choices when it comes to choosing cold foods., If water and food don't do the trick, try a cool compress. Run cool water over a wash cloth or towel and place it against your head. See if you yawn less afterwards."

Explore your own feelings.",How to Avoid Victim Blaming," Oftentimes, people want to believe that good things happen to good people, which can lead them to also believe that bad things only happen to bad people. It's important to recognize your tendency to rationalize suffering in this way and actively work to change it.Try to change the way you think about all kinds of misfortune, not just crime victims. For example, many people who blame the victims of sexual assault also blame people who are afflicted by poverty or disease. All of these kinds of blame stem from the same core belief that bad things only happen to people who deserve them.;
, Victim blaming is often used as a defense mechanism by people who want to believe that they could never become the victim of such a crime. This causes them to focus almost entirely on the characteristics and actions of the victims when assessing the reason for the attack. Distance yourself from this kind of thinking by reminding yourself that you are not that different from the victim and could just as easily have been the victim of a crime.Don't forget to think about outside circumstances. These are often things that the victim has no control over at all, and they are much more likely to contribute to the attack than anything the victim did.

, Many people make the false assumption that a victim consents to violence by failing to fight back or tell the perpetrator to stop, but this does not imply consent at all. You would not blame a robbery victim for failing to tell the robber to stop robbing them, so you should not blame the victim of sexual assault or domestic violence for not fighting back.

""Tolerating"" abusive treatment by not leaving an abusive partner does not constitute consent.
Having a previous consensual sexual encounter with the attacker does not imply consent for future sexual encounters.

, While there are some steps that individuals may be able to take to increase their personal safety, it's important to realize how unrealistic it is to expect victims to effectively prevent attacks. It is simply impossible to anticipate every bad thing that may happen, and just as impossible to protect oneself against all of these bad things.

Many risk reduction strategies are simply impractical. For example, staying inside and never socializing with other people may reduce a person's risk of being sexually assaulted, but this is not a reasonable thing to ask of a person. The more closely you examine other prevention strategies, the more problems you will likely identify with them.
Many other strategies may be completely ineffective, even if they are implemented correctly. Keep in mind that people may still be the victims of violent crimes even if they take all reasonable precautions to protect themselves.

, Many people effectively absolve perpetrators of responsibility by assuming that they were not in control of their actions at the time of the attack. No matter what the circumstances, remind yourself that the perpetrator actively chose to execute the attack.Even if it seems like the perpetrator is for some reason predisposed to violence, keep in mind that he or she had to make specific decisions in order to target the victim. If the behavior was truly uncontrollable, it would be displayed with no regard to victim, location, or time.

, People who commit violent acts against others often rationalize their behavior by making a variety of excuses, many of which attempt to place the blame wholly or partly on the shoulders of the victim. If you hear such a rationalization, remind yourself that there is no valid excuse for perpetrating a violent crime.Using alcohol or drugs is not an excuse for attacking another person.
Some excuses directly blame the victim. For example, the perpetrator may say that the victim antagonized the crime by insulting the perpetrator. Even if this is true, it is not a valid excuse.

, Just as the perpetrator is the only person who can choose to commit the crime, he or she is also the only person who could have prevented it. If you find yourself thinking about various steps that the victim could have taken to prevent the attack, remind yourself that the only thing that would have effectively prevented the attack would have been the perpetrator's deciding not to commit it.The victim of an attack could not have prevented the attack by dressing or behaving differently, but the perpetrator could have definitely prevented the attack by behaving differently.
If a survivor of domestic violence stays with an abuser after an initial attack, remind yourself that there are a variety of factors that may have caused the victim to stay. This may be difficult for a person who has never been in the situation to understand, but it is crucial not to judge., The language you use to describe the violence may unintentionally reflect tendencies of victim blaming. For example, if you phrase a sentence so that the victim is the subject of the sentence, you are unwittingly emphasizing the victim's role in the crime.Instead of saying, ""Mary was raped"" or, ""Mary is a battered woman,"" consider using the active voice to emphasize the perpetrator's agency. Saying something like, ""A rapist attacked Mary"" or, ""John abused Mary"" shifts the focus from the victim to the perpetrator.

, When you hear about an attack, try asking questions about the perpetrator's behavior instead of asking questions about the victim's behavior. Focusing too much on the victim may cause you to unintentionally blame him or her for the crime.In domestic violence situations, try to avoid asking questions like, ""Why did the wife stay if her husband was beating her?"" Instead ask, ""Why did the husband beat his wife?""
If you are speaking with victims, never ask them why they did or did not respond to the attacks in a specific way.It's important to be conscious not only of the questions that you ask others out loud, but also about the questions that you may keep to yourself. If you find yourself wondering what role the victim played in the crime, remind yourself that the perpetrator's actions are more important.

, Even though you may mean well by giving a person advice about safety and self-defense, you are unintentionally implying that the victim has the power to prevent an attack. In reality, only an attacker has the power to prevent an attack, so shifting this responsibility to victims can cause them to feel at fault if the tactics do not work., Witnesses to assaults are less likely to blame the victim if they take the time to write down their own emotional reactions to witnessing the attack. Whether you actually witnessed the attack or not, this strategy may be help increase your empathy by encouraging you to explore feelings that you may have otherwise suppressed by blaming the victim.The next time you hear about an assault, take out a piece of paper and write down exactly how the details of the attack make you feel. You may find that this helps you feel more connected to the victim, and thus less likely to blame him or her.

Practice diaphragm breathing.,
Keep a set schedule.,
Walk throughout the day.,
Adopt a healthier lifestyle.",How to Stop a Yawn2," Diaphragm breathing is a breathing ritual in which you practice breathing in a way that increases overall oxygen flow in your body. Doing diaphragm breathing exercises on a daily basis can help lessen excessive yawning.


Get into a comfortable position. Place one hand on your chest and one hand on your lower stomach.Breathe in through your nose. Breathe in such a way that the hand on your stomach rises while the hand on your chest remains stationary. Hold for four counts and then exhale through your mouth.
Repeat five to ten times. Try and engage in diaphragm breathing at least once a day., Your body runs on a 24 hour cycle known as the circadian rhythm. If you keep a somewhat set schedule, your body will be able to regulate itself so you feel energized when necessary and sleepy during bedtime.


Try to get up and fall asleep at roughly the same time each day, including weekends. Your body will adapt to this sleep/wake cycle and you'll feel more energized in the mornings. Also, aim for 7 to 8 hours of quality sleep a night.
Stick to a daily schedule. Take breaks around the same time each day. If you work out, do so around a certain time. Your body will adapt to the schedule you set and begin regulating your energy levels to suit your needs., Being too sedentary can increase feelings of fatigue. Try to take short breaks throughout the work day to walk around. Even if you're just getting up from your desk and running to the water cooler, this can help keep you alert. If possible, walk outside. Getting fresh air can sometimes be especially invigorating., Being healthier overall can reduce feelings of fatigue. If you're feeling excessively tired, try eating better and exercising.


Exercise. Studies show just 20 minutes of physical activity a few times a week can eventually pay off. In about six weeks, you'll begin to feel less fatigued.Eat healthier. Processed carbs and sugar can cause a dramatic dip in energy levels, leaving you suddenly exhausted. Work on eating more fresh fruits and veggies as well as whole wheats and grains."

You can keep erections from being obvious, and even keep them from occurring and sticking around, if you wear the right pants and underwear. Wear well-fitting boxer briefs and pants that fit your frame.


Very tight underwear briefs or tight pants can cause your erection to bulge more obviously, and make it more difficult to go away. It's also more difficult to move it around once it happens.
Very loose boxers and athletic shorts can likewise make it very difficult to cover erections when they occur, because they're too loose.;
, Dark pants show contrast less than lighter colored pants. So, if you get an erection and you're wearing white jeans, it'll be a lot more obvious than if you're wearing dark-colored pants. If you're worried about getting erections you won't be able to control, wear dark blue, black, or other dark colors in your bottom half.

, If you've got a shirt that sags a little lower than your waist band, it'll be easier to cover things up in an emergency. Oversized t-shirts, jackets, or jerseys can come in handy when you're struggling with your hormones.


Keep something in your backpack or your locker that you can use in an emergency. If you've got a throwback Jordan jersey in there, you can always throw it on over your t-shirt in an emergency.

, It's tough to do, but the more you can keep your mind out of the gutter, the less likely an unwanted erection will be. If you don't want an embarrassing bulge, avoid thinking about sex or looking at sexual imagery.


Again, it's difficult to avoid sexual stimulation sometimes, and erections don't always happen when you're stimulated by anything. Sometimes, your body just doesn't cooperate because your hormones are running wild. That's totally normal.

, Getting erections is perfectly normal, though it can be embarrassing when you're in public or in a delicate situation. If you feel one coming on, try to keep your mind off it and not get too excited. The most important thing to keep in mind while you're struggling is that there's nothing wrong with you and it's best to stay calm.

, If you're standing up and get an erection, it can be pretty obvious. If you want to cover it up, try sitting down and crossing your legs if necessary. This can help open up some room in your pants, if they're too tight, and make your situation less obvious. Shifting your knees up usually lets some space into your pants.


If you're in public, try to sit down anywhere, but a chair with arms would be ideal. Any kind of reclining chair that you can sink back into would be perfect. But anything will do in a pinch.
If you can, just head to a bathroom or your bedroom to do some rearranging. Both are as good a hiding spot as there could be.

, Depending on your body, it can be more or less comfortable to shift the evidence somewhere it will be less visible. If you can, try to move things around a bit with your hand, or by shifting your hips a little as quietly as possible.


Shift it to point up, or point down, along the line of your zipper. The zipper in your pants creates a natural kind of bulge anyway, so it'll be less obvious if you can tuck it in that direction.
If your erection is oriented sideways, that's often the most obvious and uncomfortable. Try to shift it up or down if you can.

, If your erection is still visible and you need to cover it up to save some embarrassment, just put something in front of your lap, or on top of your lap.


If you are in school, or a similar place and you get an erection, look at the clock. How much time do you have until you need to move?
If you're at the swimming pool, use your towel. Lay on a beach chair or in the sand until it goes away.

, try to get your mind off what's going on down under and think about something else while you wait it out. Even tenacious ones will go away after a couple of minutes, usually, without having to do anything about it.


If you can't get it to go away by waiting, go to the next section to learn some more techniques.

, If you want your erection to go away, start doing something physical. Go outside and get some exercise for a while, and that erection will go away pretty quickly, usually more quickly than waiting. Make your muscles burn and it'll go away, because your body will need that blood elsewhere.


Drop down and do ten pushups quickly, then try to do 30-40 sit-ups. This will usually do the trick. Go jogging, if you prefer.
Sometimes, just the act of focusing your attention on some sport or game can also do the trick. Keep exercising to get your body working and get rid of some of that frustration.
Swimsuit erections can be some of the most embarrassing. If one happens in the water, start doing some serious lap-swimming.

, Eating a meal will help your body focusing its attention elsewhere. Eating causes blood to flow to your digestive system, helping you to process your food and convert it into energy. Try eating some raw seeds, oatmeal, or citrus fruit to improve your blood flow and get your body busy in other ways., While a ""cold shower"" is the common advice for a horned-up teenager, cold temperatures can actually promote sperm production, while hot temperatures can actually make you less fertile for the time being.While that doesn't necessarily have any bearing on the erection you've got, it can help in the long term.A bath of any sort is a good idea.

, The old joke goes that a guy's only got enough blood in his body to run either his brain or his penis, but not both. There's some truth to it.If you can't do something active or out-wait your erection, try to out-wit it by doing any of the following things:


Think about the true nature of being. Decide what happens when you die.
Complete this problem in your head: (1567 x 34)(143 - 56)
Picture old people in nursing homes eating lunch.
Try to write a rhyming Petrarchan sonnet.
Imagine eating raw jellyfish.
Read Aristotle.
Do a sudoku or a crossword puzzle.
Remember the time you stepped in dog poop with bare feet.

, If you absolutely can't do anything else to get rid of your erection, you can try causing yourself an extremely gentle but noticeable amount of physical pain. Pinch your thigh firmly to cause a distracting sensation and get your attention to focus elsewhere. Only do it for a second or two, and then stop if it doesn't work, and try another method.


Never, under any circumstances, should you attempt to injure or cause pain to your genitals to get an erection to go away. It's a perfectly normal and natural thing to happen to your body. And it'll go away eventually.
If you have to give your body some sensation to get rid of an erection, there's nothing wrong with or unhealthy about occasional masturbation. It makes erections go away every time.

Know it’s normal.,
Try not to eat large meals before class.,
Avoid an empty stomach.,
Limit indigestible foods.,
Know your hunger cues.,
Eat slowly and chew properly.",How to Stop Your Stomach from Growling Loudly in Class1," Your stomach growling is caused by your digestive system doing what it’s supposed to do: mixing food, fluids, and gastric juices and pushing them through the intestinal tract. The rumbling occurs when the walls of your gastrointestinal tract contracts and relaxes to squeeze everything through the intestines. Even with a proper diet, growling is bound to happen sometimes and is no reason to be embarrassed., When you eat too much food, it will put your digestive system into overdrive. The growling can occur more often when this happens, because there is more to move through the intestines.

, When your stomach has been empty for two hours, the growling sounds louder. This is because there is little or nothing in the stomach to absorb or muffle the noise. When you go hours without eating, your body releases hormones that let the brain know it’s time to clear anything left in the stomach to make room for whatever food is to come.Have small snacks with you at all times.
Constantly feed yourself liquid—water, juice, tea, etc.

, Certain carbs are resistant to digestion. Don’t avoid carbs completely because they help supply you with energy and play a main role in the health of your digestive tract. Simply eat them in moderation to keep your stomach healthy but less likely to growl.Resistant starch: potatoes or pasta that has been cooled after cooking, sourdough bread, and unripe fruit.
Insoluble fiber: whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, cabbage, lettuce, and bell peppers
Sugar: apples, pears, and broccoli

, Remember that growling can happen both when you’ve just eaten and when you haven’t eaten in a while. To avoid over-eating and excessive stomach growling, know when you’re actually hungry. Learning the timing scheme your normal eating regimen is the best way to keep track and avoid mindless eating.

, People who swallow a lot of air usually experience more stomach growling than others. If you eat too fast or talk a lot while eating, you are likely swallowing a lot of air. Eat more slowly to avoid this."

It isn’t necessary to take some every time you eat, but try to remember it before you eat food that causes you to be overly gassy.

, Certain foods are known to cause gas because of the complexity in breaking them down. Avoiding an excess of these foods will help control your stomach growling.

Notice severe indigestion, also known as dyspepsia.",How to Stop Your Stomach from Growling Loudly in Class3," A sedentary lifestyle can lead you to stomach problems. These creates an excess of noise from your stomach. Not exercising will create a negative impact on your weight and physical tolerance to certain foods which will lead to a bloated stomach, gas, and extremely loud noises., If you are constantly nervous or anxious, your nerves send signals to your stomach. These signals cause gurgling sounds. If you notice that you experience stomach gurgling throughout the day, regardless of diet or lifestyle changes, you may have a nervous disorder that can be addressed by a doctor., Consuming certain food items can cause allergic reactions that cause an upset stomach and force stomach gurgling. If you notice stomach discomfort often after eating the same kinds of food—avoid that food. The most often kind of food intolerance is lactose-intolerance. This is when dairy products cause intense stomach irritation.

, Upper abdominal pain, excessive belching, nausea, feeling full after a small amount of food and swelling of the abdominals are all symptoms of a more serious indigestion problem. If you experience these consistently, seek medical attention. Dyspepsia is not a life-threatening problem but should be addressed."

Eat in a relaxing environment. Eating in a relaxing place, without stress, is known to limit the amount of burping and flatulence you experience.;
, Chew food completely before swallowing. Talking while you eat also means your mouth is open and you are therefore more likely to swallow air along with your food.

, Carbonated drinks contain carbon dioxide gas. If you do drink carbonation, take smaller sips over a longer period of time.

, Straws take in more air along with the beverage. Slow sips take in the least amount of air.

, These habits all result in extra air being swallowed into the stomach.


If you can, avoid big yawning motions with your mouth. If you feel the urge to yawn, try to keep your mouth closed more than usual and wait for the urge to pass.

, Baked beans, lentils, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, onions, chocolate, and fruits such as apples, peaches and pears can produce gas during digestion, resulting in burping, bloating, and flatulence.


Also, avoid foods that contain large amounts of air, such as mousses, souffles and whipped cream. The more air you put down, the more air has to eventually come back up.

, Heartburn may be the culprit if you burp a lot. The good news is that heartburn is made worse usually by certain foods and eating habits. That means that both heartburn and excessive burping may be reducible, if not correctable.Avoid eating big portions, as well as food right before bedtime. Stomach stretching after a big meal puts the LES, the muscle that keeps stomach acids from moving in the wrong direction, under lots of pressure.This often results in heartburn.
Avoid eating fatty foods. Fatty foods take longer to digest and sit around in the stomach longer. This causes the stomach to produce more stomach acid, and relaxes the LES.
Avoid overly acidic foods, like onions, tomatoes, coffee, salad dressings, red wine, and fruit drinks. Also avoid spicy foods, such as peppers, chili, and other spices.
Consider other factors relating to heartburn. Smoking, tight clothing, obesity, and lying down may all have a deleterious effect on heartburn.

, Some people gulp air as a nervous habit, even without realizing it. Have a friend keep an eye on you to see if you do this.

, You will gulp air along with it, resulting in chronic burping and possibly an upset stomach.

, Poorly-fitting dentures can result in swallowing air when you eat.

, This helps maintain their natural enzymes that aid in digestion.

, This can help break-up larger gas bubbles into smaller bubbles.


Try an enzyme supplement like Beano. This can help reduce the risk of unwanted burping as well as flatulence.

, Clothing that is tight around the waist can lead to abdominal discomfort and burping.

, Chamomile, raspberry, mint, ginger, and fennel may help reduce gas in the stomach.

, Excessive belching accompanied by indigestion, heartburn, nausea, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain can be symptoms of medical problems such as acid reflux, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastritis, ulcers, lactose intolerance or gluten intolerance, or gastroparesis. If you are already aware that you have one or more of these conditions, controlling them could also help reduce or eliminate the burping.

Releasing these viruses through sneezing and coughing is the main way these diseases are spread. Practicing respiratory etiquette (covering your mouth and nose, washing your hands, etc.) can help reduce the chances you'll get anyone else sick.


Make sure to dispose of your used tissues right away to help prevent them from spreading your germs.;
, If you don't have a tissue, the best way to catch your sneeze is to bend your elbow and hold it close to your face while sneezing.This works best if you are wearing long sleeves. The goal is to contain the sneeze with your clothing so it doesn't spread into the air., Even though your hands might contain the sneeze, think about how many things you will have to touch with them! You will only be spreading germs around as you touch things.While sneezing into your hands is not desirable, it is definitely preferable to not containing your sneeze at all.
If you have nothing else to sneeze into and sneeze into your hands, make sure you wash your hands immediately. You can also use hand sanitizer for this purpose as well.

, Whenever you sneeze, it is very important to get rid of any residual germs by washing your hands with soap and water right away. This is especially important if you sneezed into your hands or into a tissue.In order to ensure that you wash your hands thoroughly, the CDC recommends wetting your hands with clean water, applying and lathering soap all over your hands, scrubbing for 20 seconds, rinsing with clean water, and then drying your hands with a clean towel or letting them air dry., Sneezes can come on unexpectedly, and no one expects you to keep your distance from other people at all times just in case. If, however, you are sick and are sneezing a lot, do your best to give other people some space.This includes staying home from work or school when sick if at all possible. You may worry that this will negatively affect your work or school performance, but staying home when you are sick helps prevent other people from getting sick, too.

, Although stopping a sneeze may seem like the most polite thing to do, it's usually not the best option once a sneeze has already started. A sneeze is your body's natural way of expelling irritants from your nasal passage, so by holding your sneeze in, you're holding the irritants in as well.In rare instances people have even been injured by holding a sneeze in. Some of the most common injuries include ruptured blood vessels and broken ribs.

, Although you will still be holding on to irritants, suppressing the urge to sneeze is not as bad as trying to stop a sneeze that has already started. There are various things you can try to suppress the urge to sneeze as soon as you feel it:Try rubbing your nose
Try breathing heavily through your nose
Try rubbing the area between your upper lip and the bottom of your nose

, If you're around a lot of people and you feel a sneeze coming on, the most polite thing to do is to create as much distance between yourself and the other people as possible. If you can, politely excuse yourself and take a few steps away. If you don't have time for that, try turning your body away from everyone else.No matter how much distance you create, it's still important to contain your germs by sneezing into a tissue or into your sleeve.

, Research has found that most people have at least some control over the way they sneeze and are able to alter their sneezes to be quieter when in public. Try working on quieting your sneeze even when you aren't in public to see just how much control you do have.Sneezes do not necessarily need to be noisy. It has been found that that ""achoo"" sound that many English-speaking people make while sneezing is entirely cultural, not physiological. Deaf people do not make any such noise when sneezing. It might be possible to suppress the reflex to make a sound if you become more conscious of it.To practice sneezing more quietly, try clenching your teeth, but still allowing your lips to open, as you sneeze.Coughing at the same time as you sneeze might also help you suppress the reflex to make a loud noise."

We all ""have to go"", don't we?,
Simply excuse yourself and when you're in there enjoying the privacy of a locked door, lean over the sink letting a small stream of lukewarm warm water run into your nose as you use a fingertip to ""wash"" and soften the mucous.

Use your finger/hand also to control the amount of water that enters your nose.,
Using fresh water in the nose only, does not sting or harm you in any way, actually it feels comfortable.

After rinsing and softening the not-so-welcome contents of your nose, you can either gently blow into one of your hands and immediately rinse the hand with the running water OR use toilet paper/paper towel/hankie to blow and wipe your nose in the ordinary way.,

Consume ginger.,
Try fennel seeds.",How to Not Throw up when Drunk1," If you're prone to vomiting, you might want to alternate each alcoholic beverage with a glass of water during the night. In the event you get very drunk and perhaps a little nauseous, switch entirely to water. Drink water steadily, but never chug or drink water to excess, as this can upset your stomach.


Inexperienced drinkers sometimes drink too much water out of fear of becoming dehydrated. Drink water throughout the night, but not to uncomfortable excess.;
, Alcohol filters quickly into blood from the stomach, and most quickly from the small intestine to the stomach.If you don't have food in your stomach, the alcohol will absorb into your blood intoxicating you rapidly, which could leave your world spinning and your stomach heaving. A little food in your tummy can be the difference between a night on the town and vomit city.


Food high in fat content, like most bar food, takes a considerable time to digest in your stomach, making it the perfect choice for the start of your night out.Healthy pre-drinking foods include: nuts, avocados, and seeds., It is important to use a remedy that agrees with your system, so if chalky antacids don't usually calm your upset stomach, popping one of these might not be the best solution. If you have a default over the counter medicine you use for upset stomachs or nausea, take it preemptively when you begin feeling queasy., One of the biggest causes of both hangover and drinking related nausea is dehydration.Dehydration occurs when your body either doesn't have enough water in its system or else can't hold onto water because it doesn't have the right balance of electrolytes.As an important electrolyte, you might help your body retain water by eating a food high in potassium, like a banana.

, But be careful when considering a sports drink, as most sports drinks have modified formulas loaded with sugar, which are more palatable to the general population. These sugary drinks, however, could lead to more dehydration., Plenty of studies agree that ginger has powerful anti-nausea properties that you can enjoy when drinking ginger tea or ginger soda.You can add powdered ginger to food or drink, chew on a piece of raw ginger, or eat a ginger candy to enjoy ginger's stomach soothing influence., These have been found to aid digestion and lessen the effects of nausea. One tablespoon of crushed fennel seeds stepped in water for 10 minutes will create a sour stomach easing brew.


Chewing a teaspoon of fennel seeds, while maybe not the most appealing option, might also save you from throwing up.

, Moving to a crowded area means that when you fart in front of your girl, she’ll have no way of knowing it was you. Alternately, moving out-of-doors to a park, greenway, or large yard gives the gas space to dissipate.


Going out for a stroll together is not only romantic, but it also means you won't be hanging around the fragrance you've left behind.

, As you feel the gas about to escape, clench the muscles of your sphincter ani externus. These are the muscles which govern the opening of the anus. Since fart noises are caused by the vibration of intestinal gas moving across the anus, allowing only a fraction of the pent-up gas to escape will limit the sonic and spatial volume of your flatus.

, Activated charcoal can be integrated into underwear fabric to neutralize offensive smells. These undies will neutralize scents up to 200 times stronger than the average fart., The obvious option is to utilize cologne or perfume to mask the odor. You might also apply a scented hand lotionor light a scented candle. Burning incense works too.

Listen to your body.,
Apply accupressure to your wrist.,
Avoid excess motion.",How to Not Throw up when Drunk2," This often is a matter of trial and error, however make sure you learn from the errors. Generally, your limit will be linked to your weight and gender. Women, being generally smaller, weighing less, and having a naturally higher fat content, have a natural handicap when drinking alcohol.Generally, moderate (and likely nausea free) drinking entails:



Men

100 - 149 lbs: 1 - 2 drinks per hour
150 - 200+ lbs: 2 - 3 drinks per hourWomen

90 - 100 lbs: 1 drink per hour
101 - 180 lbs: 1 - 2 drinks per hour
181 - 200+ lbs: 2 - 3 drinks per hour, This is harder than it sounds, especially when friends are encouraging you to have another and your inhibitions are lowered by the alcohol you've already had.


A good defense is to say, ""If I have another I'll be sick."" This is especially useful if you're talking to the person that lives wherever you're drinking.

, Cooling yourself off is a big part of feeling better. Parties tend to get hot, and going outside will relieve you of this oppressive, potentially vomit-inducing atmosphere.As an added bonus, if you do vomit it won't be while you're surrounded by people, and throwing up outside requires less involved clean up.

, If you get close to vomiting, if you heave or gag, the best policy to ensure you do not vomit is to call it quits drinking for the night. Especially after you vomit, even if you feel much better, drinking more could lead to more vomiting and potentially something more serious, like alcohol poisoning., Though not definitively proven to help with nausea, most doctors don't see any harm in using accupressure to receive relief. Find the Neiguan (P-6) pressure point on your inner arm. Position your hand so that your palm is facing upwards. Place your middle three fingers across the wrist starting where the wrist meets your hand. The outside of the finger closest your body should mark this pressure point P-6. Now you can use your thumb to press this point, moving in a circular motion for a short period of time.You might gain additional relief by repeating this process on your other wrist.

, It may offer you relief if you rest in a sitting or lying on your left side, in a propped up position.Activity may worsen nausea and can even cause vomiting.

Cover the sound with other noises.,
Play the blame game.With enough background noise or a large enough group of people, it might be possible to shirk responsibility for passing gas.,
Own it.,
Make a joke of it.Ask her, “Was that you?” or “What did you eat?” in a mock-disgusted tone.,
Apologize if necessary.",How to Pass Gas in Front of a Girl2," If you are unable (or unwilling) to pass gas silently, you can cough,use music, conversation, or the well-timed slam of a loud door to mask the sound of your noisy fart.


If you have a phone, turn up the volume and play your ring tone while you break wind.
Moving to a noisy location like a city street or a crowded room will also provide opportunities for covering your flatulence.,


This method is especially effective if the fart is of a short duration. The longer you fart, the easier it is to identify you as the culprit.

, Don’t let a girl shame you just because you farted. Look directly into her eyes as you pass gas. If she gives you a hard time about it, tell her that farting is a perfectly natural biological process. Remind her that everyone toots, and holding in gas causes bloating and discomfort., Mention that you shouldn’t have eaten that fourth burrito at lunch.

, If she seems genuinely upset or offended, it might be best to back down. Be as sincere as possible when apologizing and promise her there will be no further incidents.

Eat a satisfying meal beforehand.,

Keep snacks on hand.,
Avoid coffee.,
Stay away from gassy foods.,
Avoid certain sugars.,
Know how existing conditions affect your stomach.,
Eat regularly.,
Press on your stomach.,
Take a deep breath.",How to Keep Your Stomach Quiet in Public," If there’s a particular time of day or a stretch of time where you know you’d like to avoid any and all awkward stomach noises, be sure to eat a filling meal roughly an hour before. The most common cause of stomach grumbles will be your stomach attempting to clear itself when already empty. Making sure it’s not empty when it counts is the simplest step to stopping pesky stomach noise.Be sure not to make your satisfying meal too satisfying--avoid over-eating. An overly full stomach will take to grumbling as it struggles to digest; keep the portion size comfortable to prevent causing the problem you hoped to avoid.
Be sure to make this satisfying meal one that is thoroughly stomach-friendly, or else you may not be preventing anything.;
, Beyond simply making sure you’ve had enough to eat, stopping disruptive stomach noises will be a matter of ensuring that your digestion is working as well as possible. Staying hydrated is critical to healthy, efficient digestion. One of the many things water does for your body is ease the work of digestion.Water won’t be a substitute for food, however. Don’t fill up on water to try and satiate an empty stomach. A belly full of only water is likely to grumble even more.
If possible, drink bottled water when looking to avoid stomach grumbles. Tap water sometimes includes some fluoride or chlorine which, while harmless, may upset your stomach just enough to cause some rumbling.
Be sure to stay hydrated regularly. It won’t do to drink a bunch of water right beforehand; you’ll need to keep hydrated so that your digestion can always work as well as it should.

, In addition to staying hydrated, you’ll want to be sure to choose foods that will ease digestion as well. Eating the wrong foods to keep hunger at bay won’t help if what you’ve eaten only upsets your stomach. Being sure to eat right will leave you with a stomach both satisfied and silent.Try plain rice. Use basmati rice or wild rice, which contain less fiber than other varieties; too much fiber may make the digestion too quick and disruptive, which you’ll want to avoid.
Use mint. If you’re someone who drinks smoothies or tea, consider throwing a few mint leaves in your next cup or mix. Mint calms the muscles of the digestive tract, making those grumbles much less likely.
Include potatoes in your diet. Specifically sweet or white potatoes, these contain filling starch which helps to settle the stomach. Be sure not to include too much spice or butter to keep from upsetting the stomach.
Eat non-dairy yogurt. Most commonly bought as Greek yogurt, yogurts made with soy or almond milk without sweeteners are excellent digestive aids. The bacteria which comprise yogurt have a calming effect on the stomach.

, Even with the best of preparation and planning, hunger may still sneak up on you when you least expect it. Make sure this hunger doesn’t turn into stomach grumbles by keeping some stomach-friendly snacks with you throughout the day. Even if it’s just something small before that next class or meeting, the right snack will be enough to ensure those belly grumbles will be put to rest.Pre-packaged nuts are a healthy and calorie-rich way to fill a rumbling stomach. Be sure to keep nuts that aren’t salted, as they may upset your stomach more than raw or plain roasted nuts would.
Fruits and vegetables that package well like bell peppers, apples and carrots make great snacks. Healthy and refreshing, fruits and vegetables also contain plenty of the vitamins which aid digestion.
For a mix of both of the above, look out for fruit and nut bars which have become popular in recent years. Be sure to finds ones low in fat and sugar, without too many additions (like chocolate) to the fruit and nuts.

, Unfortunately for those relying on coffee for an early morning jolt, many things about the caffeinated beverage spell dread for the digestive system. The most relevant here is the increase in acidity it promotes in your stomach; all the extra acid causes gas which will only add to the embarrassment of stomach grumbles. A slight laxative effect also disrupts digestion and makes stomach noise more likely.If you’ve got the taste for it, certain teas can make great alternatives to coffee. You can even keep the caffeinated kind on account of many of the other metabolic benefits tea provides.
At the very least you can cut down on your intake. If you’re a heavy coffee drinker, try to bring it down a couple of cups a day and see if it helps.

, While it’s important to keep hunger at bay, taking in the wrong foods may end up causing the problem you were hoping to avoid. You’re probably already well aware of food that makes your stomach upset. It’s important to limit these foods to those moments where stomach noises aren’t a concern.Foods which lead to flatulence like beans, broccoli, and asparagus (among others) will upset the stomach when you’re trying to calm it. Hopefully you’ll have a good understanding of what foods affect you in order to stay away.
Don’t chow down on anything too greasy or fatty. While not themselves a guarantor of stomach grumbles, they tax the process of digestion which might worsen other factors at work. Keep the hamburgers for those moments when you can afford the noise.

, Two common sugars, fructose and sorbitol, can contribute to stomach distress. In order to cover all of your culinary bases, you’ll want to look out for certain foods which contain either. Beyond only fructose and sorbitol, cutting down on sugary foods period is a step in a healthy direction, which can only help to cut down on stomach noise.Fructose is usually used as a sweetener in soda and fruit drinks. It occurs naturally, however, in foods such as onions, pears, and wheat.
Sorbitol is included as artificial sweetener in many diet foods and snacks labelled “sugar-free.” Like fructose, it does exist naturally in foods such as apples, peaches, and many other fruits.

, Anyone and everyone can (and almost certainly will) suffer from some stomach grumbles in their life. Unfortunately for some, many medical conditions may exacerbate the problem. Consider consulting with a physician if you think your stomach noises may be the fault of something medical.


Certain food intolerances, especially lactose intolerance, may be to blame for stomach troubles. Be extra diligent for foods your stomach can’t handle when eating for a quiet belly.
Any conditions affecting digestion, from irritable bowel syndrome to celiac disease or Crohn’s, will have an affect on when and why your stomach growls. Try to bring up stomach grumbles at your next doctor’s visit.

, The best thing you can do if you’d like to stop worrying about stomach grumbles is to eat so that you avoid hunger as best as possible. Whether it’s three sizable meals a day or six small ones, eating regularly makes sure your stomach is never so empty that it makes noise.


Regular meals unfortunately aren’t a catch-all prevention, you’ll still need to watch what you eat and keep snacks around just in case.
Regular here means regular not just in terms of time, but portions as well. Don’t have a nibble for breakfast with a large lunch planned and expect to be grumble-free in the AM.

, One thing you can try when stomach noise comes on despite all your prevention is to push on your stomach. Providing the stomach less space to move and contract will mean less room to do the things which make for stomach grumbles.Using a pencil (eraser-end first) or pen, press into your stomach with some force (don’t hurt yourself) when you feel your stomach begin to churn.
Be sure to target your stomach (near your navel, but not on it) and not higher up for best results.

, Filling your lungs with air will require some room in your torso, and in growing your lungs push down on your stomach, giving it less room for grumbles (as with the previous step). When you feel your stomach become upset and about to make noise, take a deep breath and hold it until the sensation passes.

Keep privacy in mind.,

Choose a soft ground, rather than a hard ground.,
Keep the wind in mind.,
Avoid slopes, if you can.,
Find a place that is at least 200 feet (60.96 meters) away from water, trails, and campsites.",How to Pee Outside as a Woman1," You may not mind if someone sees you while you go, but other people could be offended. Try to find a bush, large tree, or a boulder that you can stand behind. Avoid trekking into a large bush; plants often house insects and spiders.;
, Try to find a women's restroom. If you find a men's restroom a women's will be close by. Urinating in public places is against the law in most cities, and could earn you a citation or worse.


If you absolutely must, try to find a place behind lots of bushes where no one can see you. Another options is against a wall in an alleyway or behind a building. For safety reasons, try to have a friend with you, especially if it is nighttime, or if you are in an unsafe area.

, Soft surfaces, like grass and pine needles, absorb fluids more readily than hard surfaces. This will help reduce backsplash., If it is windy, make sure that you are facing away from the wind.This will help direct your urine away from you.

, If you do find yourself on a slope, turn so that you are facing downhill. This way, your urine will drain away from you, and not back towards you., If you go too close to any of these places, you risk contaminating the water supply and spreading illness."

Wait to see what they do.,
Respect personal boundaries in courtship.",How to Know if It Is Okay to Hug Someone1," Look at whether their feet are pointed towards or away from you. See if they are leaning back and distancing themselves from your or leaning in towards you. If their body language indicates a need for distance, you should not try to hug them. However, if they look like they want to hug you and you feel comfortable offering a hug, go ahead and give them a hug.If it is a client and they look like they want to hug, let them initiate it.
If it is a relative you rarely see, you could observe how other relatives relate to them and then follow their example. If other friends and family members seem to be hugging them and they lean in, you could go for the hug.;
, If your friend, family member or colleague looks very sad or has just received some bad news and you would like to comfort them, you could ask them if they would like a hug. If you are close to this person, they may appreciate the offer and take you up on it. Simply ask them and respond accordingly:“Do you need a hug?”
“I’m so sorry to hear you had to experience that. Can I give you a hug?”
“I’m here anytime you need a hug or a warm cup of tea. Just let me know.”

, If you are at a social event such as a conference, wedding or graduation, you could observe whether other people are hugging. For instance, if there is a line up of people offering congratulations to somebody who won an award, you could observe how people in front of you are relating to the winner. If they are hugging, it may be okay for you to also hug.If you are not sure, observe their body language or explicitly ask them.
If you are in the receiving line at a wedding, you may be expected to hug the bride and groom. See what people in front of you are doing., If you are just starting to make friends with someone, it is usually best to give them plenty of space. Once you have a better sense of the amount of personal space they like to maintain with other friends, you can make better decisions about when a hug is appropriate.If your new friend is quite obviously a hugger and you are fine with it, you may be able to move from handshakes to hugs very quickly.
If your new friend prefers to maintain a lot of personal space, you could stick to handshakes in most situations.

, If you are not sure whether to give a handshake or a hug at a social event, wait to see what the other person starts to do when they are walking towards you. If they start stretching out their hand, you can put out your hand for a handshake. However, if they lean to the side, they may expect a hug. Follow their body language to determine whether or not to hug., It can be hard to determine when a hug is okay during courtship. The most important thing is to talk and respect personal boundaries, including in relation to hugs. For instance, you could simply ask your date if they would like a hug.You could also observe their body language, which may indicate a desire for a hug if they come to you with open arms or lean to the side during a greeting.
If your first date went well, you could start your second date with a warm hug.A hug at the beginning of a date can relax both parties and help break down barriers."

Get enough exercise.,
Remember that passing gas is a normal part of life.",How to Hold in a Fart," Think of it this way: if there's no space between your butt-cheeks, then how can the fart get out? Though this can be a bit painful and can't be sustained for that long, if you clench your cheeks, you will prevent your fart from escaping. To do this, you really have to tighten your anus and have it stay that way; if you let go, you are more likely to release the fart. If you're lucky, doing this for long enough can help the fart get ""sucked up"" back in your body — just know that this isn't a permanent solution, and that the fart may return with more force than before.;
, Sometimes you may just need to wiggle around a bit to move that fart to a different part of your body. Just don't make any sudden movements or the fart may be more likely to come out. If you're sitting, try standing up. If you're standing, sit down. If you're sitting but can't get up, try shifting from one butt cheek to the other.

, This is another time-tested strategy. If you're sitting down and need to fart, place both hands on the arm rests, put your weight on your toes, and gently lean forward a bit, lifting your bum off the seat. This can sometimes help the urge to fart go away, as pointing your toes and leaning up can also help you clench your anus a bit.

, If you're sitting up or standing and need to fart, sometimes lying down can help you change positions and get rid of the urge to fart. If you're hanging out with friends, this can be hard to pull off, but if you're all sitting around watching TV, see if you can sprawl out on the couch or do something that helps you hold in your fart while looking pretty natural.

, If you're standing and have the urge to fart, improve your posture, try to move your head as high up as you can, and help your body become more erect. This can help the fart have more room to move around your body without releasing.

, If you're sitting and feel the urge to pass gas, one thing you can do is to delicately shift from cheek to cheek. Sometimes, this motion is all you need to make that farting feeling go away temporarily. This can also help you release the fart in a less noisy manner, if push comes to shove. The problem with this maneuver is that it can look a bit obvious, so you may want to make it look like you're suddenly fascinated by something to the right of you — and then to the left of you...

, Though holding in your farts can be a great short-term strategy, know that a fart rarely just ""disappears."" These strategies can help you minimize embarrassment, but eventually, your fart will come back — with more power than before., Though the jury is still out on whether holding in a fart is bad for your health, some doctors do agree that doing this routinely can cause bloating and cramps. So, if you're in a public situation, you can hold your fart in as much as possible, but as soon as you can, relax every part of your body, stand up, and let all systems go., If you're in public and have no escape route and know that the fart is coming on any second now, then your best bet is to slowly release it. Carefully and slowly unclench your butt cheeks, wiggle around a bit, and then let the fart slowly escape from your body. If you let it out all at once, it'll be more likely to make a loud noise.

, So this isn't the most ideal maneuver, but sometimes, you just know you have to fart, and you have no option but to make a loud noise or to cause a diversion when you know the time has come. Here are some things you can do:


Cough loudly
Laugh loudly
Drop a textbook
Turn on the radio
Set off a phone alarm

, This is the easiest way to fart and get away with it. If it's possible, then you should simply excuse yourself for a minute and then go and do your business. Here are the easiest things you can do:


Pretend to take a phone call
Go ""check something out"" on the other side of the room
Say you need some fresh air
Say you want to wash your hands
Use the bathroom

, Some foods that are rich in sulfur may make you pass gas more often — not to mention that they may make those farts smell even worse! Foods filled with carbohydrates are also more likely to make you pass gas, but every person has his own ""trigger foods"". Though you shouldn't avoid these foods entirely, you can cut back on them if you know you'll be going to a place where you may not want to fart. Foods that are known to cause gas include:


Vegetables such as beans, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts, onions, and mushrooms
Fruits such as apples, peaches, and pears
Bran and whole wheat products
Milk products such as cheese, yogurt, and ice cream
Eggs
Carbonated drinks, such as sodas

, Another reason why you may have gas is because you down your food or drinks too quickly and don't give your body time to properly digest your food. The next time you eat, make a conscious effort to slow down and to carefully chew your food until each bite is thoroughly digested. Stop eating on the run, if that's what you do, and make an effort to slow down and eat a few minutes earlier if you need to. If you like soda, make sure you sip it slowly instead of downing it in three gulps, or you're guaranteed to make the gas situation worse.

, The repeated motion that accompanies chewing gum or sucking on hard candy can actually make you fart more. This can especially be the case if you're doing this on an empty stomach. If you want to minimize your embarrassment, then cut back on the chewing gum and hard candy. Chewing rapidly causes you to swallow extra air, and leads down to the breakdown of food in your gut, which can cause farting., Though this isn't necessary and should only be used if you really have a problem with this, you can consider taking some over-the-counter medication to relieve your symptoms of flatulence. You can take something like Beano, Gas-X, Mylanta Gas, or even Lactase tablets. The medications tend to break down sugar in your body, making your food easier to digest. However, talking to your doctor before you make this a regular habit can help you have a better sense of what you really need.

, Sometimes people can fart more just because they aren't getting regular exercise or that they're sitting for prolonged periods of time — these two things tend to go hand in hand. If you make a goal of exercising for at least 30 minutes a day and moving around as much as you can throughout the day, then your body will be in better shape overall and you'll be less likely to pass gas. Exercise also helps you get rid of the extra air in your system., Everybody farts. This bodily function is perfectly natural and healthy. The average person farts between 14 and 21 times a day — even if he/she doesn't realize it. Don't think that there's something wrong with you just because you pass gas occasionally."

If you are wearing a skirt or a dress, pull it up by the hem until it is at waist level. If the dress or skirt is full, with a lot of fabric, bunch everything up in front of you. There should be no fabric hanging behind you.
If you are wearing shorts or pants, unbutton and unzip them first. Then, pull them half-way down your thighs. Do not let them go past your knees, or they may get wet.It may also be a good idea to roll up the cuffs of long pants.

, Place your feet a little more than shoulder-width apart and squat down. Keep your balance by leaning forward. This will put your privates behind your underwear and pants/shorts (if you are wearing any).

Exercise caution with workplace hugs.,
Exercise caution when hugging the opposite sex at work.",How to Know if It Is Okay to Hug Someone2," You should observe the culture of your current workplace. If it is a large company with many employees, hugging may be relatively rare. In contrast, if it is a small organization with many female employees, there may be relatively more hugging. See what your colleagues are doing and try to fit in., If a colleague or friend has just received great news such as a winning scholarship or winning the lottery, it could be appropriate to give them a hug. If you are close with them and it looks like they want to share the joy of their news, consider giving them a hug., If someone at work just received some very bad news such as a death in the family or serious financial loss, you could offer a hug. See if they need a hug. You could say:“I’m so sorry to hear the news. Do you need a hug?”

, You should generally follow a cautious approach with workplace hugs, especially if there is any sexual tension or if there are large power differences at play. If you are not sure whether to hug someone in a particular situation, it is safest not to hug., Generally, it is best to avoid hugging the opposite sex at work. However, if you have formed a professional relationship with a colleague and there is no risk of them confusing the intention of the hug, it can be fine to hug a colleague of the opposite sex."

Hugging is generally between friends, family members, lovers, colleagues or other people who know each other. However, if you are offered a hug by a complete stranger who is part of the “free hugs” campaign, you can decide whether to take them up on the offer.The “free hugs” campaign tries to increase communication and intimacy in society by offering hugs to strangers. You will see people with signs saying “free hugs” in public squares and streets. They may ask you if you want a free hug and you are free to accept or decline.

Try standing up to keep in your poop (or, alternatively, lying down).,
Tense your butt cheeks as much as you can.,
Try to encourage a bowel movement several hours before your event, and then stop eating.,
Try not to drink coffee.,
Don't overthink it.,
Distract yourself mentally so you’re not focusing on the poop so much.,
Get over the embarrassment, and just do it.,
Recognize the dangers of holding in your poop.,
See a doctor if you have a bowel control problem.,
Understand how people poop.",How to Hold in Your Poop in Embarrassing Situations," The worst possible position to be in if you are trying to hold your poop is to squat. Sitting isn’t as good for holding your poop in as standing or lying down is, either.


The reason for this is because squatting has long been defined by researchers as the ideal position for defecation. That’s because it applies pressure on the abdomen, encouraging release of the stool.
Standing will remove some of the pressure from the abdomen. So will lying down.
Even just shifting your position a bit can also help you keep the poop where you want it to stay inside your body until you have a chance to get to a toilet. If you must sit, shift your position in the chair. Pressing your buttocks against a hard area - like a metal chair bottom - might help.;
, Basically, what you are accomplishing here is to apply pressure on the upcoming poop to keep it inside the body. Yes, it's really the best way to do it!


Clenching your butt cheeks will tense your rectum, and, thus, it helps to keep the poop inside.
It’s harder to hold in poop if your muscles around your rectum are weak. If your nerves are damaged in that area, you might not even know a stool has come out. See a doctor in such cases. , Basically you want to poop before you end up at the place where it will be hard to poop. It’s a good idea to do this to activate the bowels so you empty them. Think ahead!For example, many long-distance runners face this issue. They feel like they have to poop during the race. Another way to avoid this embarrassing problem is to simply avoid foods high in fiber before the race or event because that causes the need to poop.
Gas-producing foods like beans, bran, fruit and salad also could also cause the need to have a bowel movement. Try to avoid eating any food within two hours of the event, though, or you will have another bowel movement.

, There are some studies that have linked coffee drinking to having to poop. Although this is by no means definitively proven, if you drink coffee while trying to hold in poop you will probably have to pee too.It will be harder to hold in poop if you’ve had no previous defecation that day. One study found that coffee provoked pooping more so in people who hadn’t already pooped.
The study also found that the effect was more pronounced in the morning.

, You have to be cool. If you're thinking about your bowel movements all the time, then it's just going to make it harder. Relax, and try to think about something else.


Stay still! Although standing up will help, if you start making abrupt movements or doing something that requires exertion (such as running), it’s going to be a lot tougher.
Above all, keep your dignity and stay calm. Make sure not to panic or hold your hand against your behind. It's all about applying mental will to the situation.

, Come up with distracting thoughts like a kitten loving and cuddling you. Nothing funny or you may have a real accident in your pants.


Find a phrase, and repeat it over and over again in your mind to focus your mind on something else. Another way to distract yourself is by striking up a conversation with someone.
Watch TV, read a book, or listen to music. Do anything to move your mind on to other thoughts for the time being. A mental task that requires concentration is best, such as playing a word game or writing down a to-do list., If there’s a bathroom nearby, and you’re just too embarrassed to use it at that moment (say, if you’re on a date), shake it off!


Pooping is a natural part of life, and everyone does it. The toxic effects on the body of routinely holding in poop make it not worth it.
You might feel better about it if you camouflage the smell. Spray a little perfume in the air of the bathroom after pooping, for example. Be prepared. Carry a mini air freshener with you., There’s a lot of research on this. It’s really not a good idea to hold in your poop, especially repeatedly and for a very long time.There was a case of a teenager from England who died after not pooping for eight weeks. Pooping is really just the practice of emptying your bowels. It’s essential for good health! If you don’t poop, your body will recirculate fecal water throughout the body. That’s pretty gross when you think about it.
If you want to poop but can’t, you should see a doctor. You could also try a stool softener or fiber pills. Then, again, that’s different from wanting to temporarily hold in your poop to avoid simple momentary embarrassment. Although experts say holding your poop briefly until you can find a socially acceptable time to do it is unlikely to cause you serious problems, they have found that people who do so regularly because of their profession might end up with issues like constipation (say teachers or truck drivers)., This is defined as you accidentally passing a stool from your rectum. If you can’t make it to the bathroom on time repeatedly, see a doctor.


Stool is the term used for solid waste that is passed as a bowel movement, more commonly called poop. Bowel control problems are fairly common, affecting about 18 million adults in the United States. They are more common in older people, but anyone can get them. Difficult childbirth, poor overall health, and disease or injury can be causes.

, People use a muscle called the puborectalis muscle to poop. This muscle is basically a sling for your rectum.


When you sit down on a toilet, the hold on your rectum is partially loosened. If you were to squat, the hold would be completely relaxed, making it easier to poop.
Poop is a combination of fiber, bacteria, other cells, and mucus. Soluble fibers like beans and nuts become part of your poop. Some foods are harder to digest, like corn or oat bran. "

Use straight baking soda.,
Purchase and use a commercial urine cleaner.,
Hire a carpet or upholstery-cleaning company.",How to Get Rid of Urine Smell3," Popular brands include Glade and Febreeze; these are available at any grocery, home supply, and drug stores. These odor eliminators come in spray bottles that you spray over your furniture until damp and then let air dry.


Using fabric odor eliminators will give your fabric a nice, fresh scent. However, they generally mask rather than treat and fully remove bad scents and stains. Consider this only as a temporary solution.

, There are several different options that require ingredients you probably already have in your home. Remember to do a test patch with any solution before applying it to the whole stained area - you don't want your furniture to get discolored in any way, which is always a potential risk when applying any solution to it.


Use baking soda and peroxide solution. Mix together 16 ounces of hydrogen peroxide, 1 teaspoon of dishwashing liquid and 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Apply onto urine stain until soaked. Leave on until completely dry. If a white residue appears, vacuum or brush off.
Make a 50-50 water and vinegar solution.Combine equal parts warm water and distilled white vinegar. Soak a clean cloth or rag with the solution, and then rub the stain in a circular motion. You should do this at least twice. Then, allow the spot to dry. You can use a hair dryer or fan to help it dry a little quicker. If the odor is still there, you could risk spraying the spot with straight vinegar. At this point, the persistence of the smell suggests that the urine has worked its way into the fabric's fibers, so spray enough vinegar to do the same.Try rubbing alcohol. Dampen the stain and then blot with a dry rag., Baking soda is a natural odor-fighter. Pour a large amount of baking soda - don't be skimpy here! - over the affected area until it is completely saturated. Use a scrub brush to push the baking soda into the fabric's fibers in a circular motion.Once the baking soda has been sufficiently worked into the fabric, vacuum up the baking soda. This will aid the soda’s natural odor-fighting properties get into fibers and also remove the excess powder.You may want to do this twice if the urine smell lingers or is especially strong., Look for enzymatic cleaners in particular. Enzymatic cleaners break down the urine stain and the odor-causing molecules. They contain bacteria-producing agents that facilitate the growth of bacteria that in turn breaks down the urine.The best-known brands are marketed for pet urine, but can also be used for human urine. These include Simple Solution, Nature's Miracle, Urine Off, and Complete Pet Stain and Odor Remover from 8in1.Follow any and all instructions on the product.

These machines work similarly to a vacuum cleaner but use water; they force clean water into your carpet and then force the dirty water back out.You should be able to rent extracting and wet vac machines pretty cheaply from your local hardware store.
Carefully follow any instructions that accompany the machines.
Don't use any additional chemicals or additives with these machines. They work best with plain water.Don't use a steam cleaner to clean urine odors from your carpets. The heat will permanently set the stain and the corresponding odor because it causes the protein in the urine to bind with the fibers in the fabric.You could also have a professional come in and clean your carpets or, if it's an area rug that's been stained, take it to a carpet cleaner's. However, this can be very expensive and it might be cheaper to just buy something new than to pay for these services.

Release the fart slowly.,
Cough loudly or make a loud noise.,
Walk as you fart.,
Leave the room or area.,
Spray air freshener.",How to Fart Quietly1," Rather than release the fart quickly, which will likely cause a loud fart noise, take your time and release the fart slowly.

, Before you fart, get up and try to vacate the area so you are not in a crowd or around a lot of people. That way, you can go into another room or area and fart to your heart’s content.If you are on a crowded train, for example, try to get over to an empty car before you release gas. If you are in a busy office, head to an empty meeting room or common area and fart there so no one can be offended by the sound or smell.

, You can mask the smell of your farts by spraying air freshener in the area or by using the scent of hand cream to ward off the smell. Rub scented hand cream on your hands after you have farted so the scent overpowers any stinky smells that may be lingering in the air."

It would be even better to walk outside if you know you are about to fart. If you can leave the room entirely after you fart inside it, that’s good too.;
, Do whatever you can to camouflage or reduce the smell if you’ve already farted in public.


Spritz yourself with perfume if you have some in your purse (or cologne if you’re a man). Some restaurant and hotel restrooms offer perfume for their customers. Spray deodorant works too.
Pull out scented hand moisturizer, and casually apply it to your hands. You will look less like the culprit if you’re busy doing something nonchalantly, and it will smell good too.
Even hairspray can help camouflage the smell if you don’t have any perfume or cologne that you can use.

, One of the best ways to camouflage a public fart, is to fart somewhere that already smells bad.


For example, let’s say you’re in the grocery store when you have to fart. Head for the seafood or fish aisle!
Another good location to fart is in the area around trash cans. People might mistake the smell as coming from the trash can, not you.
Bathrooms are the obvious place to fart if you’re in public and can control where it comes out. People don’t generally expect bathrooms to smell good.

, It’s harder to just walk away to fart if you’re with a significant other on a date. You may want to hide the fact you have to fart altogether.


Walk behind the person before you let it out. This is essentially the “crop dusting” technique, but it will disburse the smell behind and away from your partner.
Let it out before you open the car door for the person. That means the smell will be disbursed outside rather than inside the enclosed vehicle.
Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom. They will probably think you really have to go to the bathroom, not that you are leaving to fart.

, You might be able to weaken and silence your fart if you make the right moves with your butt when you feel it coming on. Sitting down will also help.Tighten your glute muscles as tightly as you can. If you do this maneuver long enough you should find the fart weakening. Fart into a pillow or something else soft to muffle the sound of the fart.
Pulling your butt cheeks slightly apart can also diffuse the strength of the fart. It would be hard to do this without someone seeing, but you might be able to pull it off quickly behind a wall or in the bathroom.
Letting a little bit of the fart out at a time will also make the fart smaller and less obvious. Do this every 30 seconds until the fart is out. Take care that you don't ""shart."" This means small involuntary defecation that occurs while farting. You can prevent it by evacuating your bowels fully each time you go to the bathroom."
"
Try to get up and go to the pencil sharpener, and while you are sharpening your pencil loudly, try to fart as silently as you can.,
Always get a seat with a ""puffy"" soft surface.,
Put your weight on one of your buttocks and lean in the same direction as your buttock (ex.,
Ask to use the restroom.,
Drop a textbook or another heavy object to generate a loud noise.,
Purchase a noise cancellation device, and arrange it in a comfortable position between the crack on your bottom and the seat of your trousers.",How to Flatulate Secretively (Teenagers)1," As soon as you flatulate, be sure to walk away fast because you don't want the fumes to get stuck to your clothes. But also make sure that the smell doesn't follow you.;
, Not like a wood chair but like your couch. Being in seats like that will reduce a lot the risk of a sounding fart. If you can't get a seat like that, sit on your sweater or jacket.

, put your weight on your right buttock and lean to the right). This separates your buttocks and makes your fart silent. You could also drop your pencil on the floor and reach for it so you don't look weird leaning to the left or right in your chair. CAUTION: The smell will go to the opposite direction you are leaning in, so aim your gasses to an empty area.

, The teacher may say yes, and then you can do it in the bathroom!

, Release your fart precisely as the object makes contact with the floor, as this will effectively cancel out the noise. (Warning: Be sure to time your release exactly right. If you fart too soon, the noise will still be heard. If you fart after the book is dropped, the book will draw attention to you and your fart will be noticed by more people.

, Make sure that it has a noise sensor, that is activated by the occurrence of a sound. It should be able to effectively cover up any noise released from your fart. (Note: does not necessarily account for the odor, so be cautious. In addition, practice several times at home before using it at school, in case something goes wrong).

"
Blame someone else.,
Stand by the right person.,
Own up.",How to Conceal Your Farting in Public2," You won’t be able to prove that someone else farted, but there are ways that you can raise suspicion that it was another person, not you.


Use the rule of three or more. This means that you should only let the fart out when you’re standing in a group of three or more people.
That’s because it will be easier to diffuse the blame and harder for people to tell who did it with a larger group. The key here is to let out the fart as silently as you can. You could blame someone directly or just indicate you’re disgusted by the smell and question who did it.
Don’t react until others start to do so, though. When you see them sniffing the area and starting to realize someone has farted, that’s your chance. Act disgusted by the smell, and point it out only after someone else has started to do so. If you blame another person too fast you might identify yourself as the farter following the old adage “whomever smelt it, dealt it.”

, This might sound terrible, but if you want people to think the farter was someone else, choose the right person to stand near.


For example, babies and toddlers can’t talk to deny they did it, and most people wouldn’t be surprised if a baby or toddler let out a little gas.
A person who is dressed in dirty clothing or who doesn’t always have the best hygiene would be another good choice.
Senior citizens and pets can also make good patsies, but it’s really not very nice to blame grandma for something you did.

, You might actually gain points if you just confess, and admit that you’re the one who stunk up the room.


Apologize and then act as if it’s a normal thing to do. People will probably laugh or act a little uncomfortable, and then they will forget it.
You could refer to a cartoon character like Peter Griffin in the Family Guy, who has been known to fart in public before.
Just say, “Yeah, yeah, it was me. I’m really sorry. I tried to stop it, but it clearly didn’t work.” Almost everyone can relate. We’ve all been there.

Fart in an elevator.,
Wait for something noisy.,
Make noise yourself.,
Reduce gas in the first place.",How to Conceal Your Farting in Public3," The worst possible place to fart (other than inside a car) is inside an elevator. If you feel the need, there are ways you can reduce the problem.


Hold it until the elevator door opens. The good part is that the elevator doors will make noise when they open and close.
Secondarily, new people will come into the elevator when the door opens, and other people will go out.
Thus, the new people might blame the farting on one of the people who just left the elevator (and you can blame them too without them being there to deny it). It’s often best, though, to just remain silent because there will be so many suspects no one will know whom to blame anyway.

, If you’re afraid the fart will be loud, wait for something naturally noisy before you let it rip.For example, if you’re in a movie theater, wait until there’s a particularly loud sound effect on the screen.
In a restaurant, wait for the clattering of dishes or the loud talking of a couple about to walk past your table.
At a family event, wait for the music or someone to make a loud toast or laughter from a joke.

, Rather than waiting for other people to make noise, you can make noise yourself right as you are about to fart.


Cough loudly right as you are about to fart. In fact, cough several times as if you are in a coughing fit, and then reach for a glass of water.
Move your chair loudly so that it rubs along the floor or makes noise. If you’re sitting on vinyl move your body so your legs create a rubbing sound on the chair. Pretend the fart is the sound of your chair squeaking.Start singing if the occasion allows for it, start talking a lot and loudly, sneeze, or rattle a dish.

, If you’re worried about public flatulence, there are steps you can take to reduce gas before you go out into public.


A dash of cayenne pepper sprinkled into a glass of water is supposed to reduce gas.Ginger can help too. Eating and drinking slowly, avoiding carbonated beverages, avoiding smoking, and using antacids can also help.Don’t chew gum. It can cause gas buildup. Avoid foods known for causing gas, such as beans. Gas is caused when your digestive system has a hard time breaking down certain foods into energy and waste.Milk and dairy products, starches like pasta and potatoes, some fruits (prunes, peaches, apricots), some vegetables (cauliflower, peas, Brussel sprouts, asparagus) and some grains (wheat and oat brain) cause flatulence.

Wait for the drop where everyone is screaming.",How to Flatulate Secretively (Teenagers)4," While everyone is loudly screaming, you may rip a tasty one. Also, no one will smell this because you are moving so fast.

"
"
Get your timing right.,
Be sure to emit only small bursts as floors are reached and the electronic indicator emits the beeping noise.,
Be sure to show subtle signs of disgust as if the people who have entered the elevator are those who are emitting a foul smell.,
If all else fails, get out of the elevator and take the stairs.

",How to Flatulate Secretively (Teenagers)5," Timing is critical in this situation.

, You may also be able to make use of the time during which the doors are opening and closing, depending on the condition of the elevator and how loud this function may be.

, This is only if you can smell your fart, however.

Go to an empty aisle and let it rip, then get out of there as fast as you can.

,
If you are near people, lean over as if you are going to grab an item on a lower shelf, let it rip, and then blame the nearest person.

Try an over-the-counter remedy.,
Try activated charcoal.,
Use a deodorizer.,
Embrace Mother Nature.,
Make the best out of an awkward situation.",How to Deal With Gas1," Digestive aids, such as Beano, are available and may help reduce gas production. Beano contains an enzyme called beta-galactosidase that breaks down certain sugars found in beans and vegetables like broccoli. Some scientific studies have shown reduced flatulence with the use of beta-galactosidase. , Activated charcoal is different than the charcoal that you use to grill. Activated charcoal can be bought in a pharmacy and may be used to reduce flatulence. Scientific studies on the effectiveness of activated charcoal in reducing gas are controversial. Some studies of oral administration of activated charcoal observed reductions in the amount of gas released from the colon, while other studies found no differences. These results suggest that activated charcoal may have a minor benefit in certain circumstances. It is possible that activated charcoal only beneficially reduces gas production due to some etiologies, but not others.

, Many different deodorizers can be used to disguise the scent of flatulence. Interestingly, charcoal-lined undergarments can be purchased that claim to deodorize the scent of gas. Their clinical effectiveness has not been examined.

, Passing gas is a natural phenomenon that is essential for the removal of gaseous waste from the body. Everyone does it. Although holding in gas may be appropriate in some situations, you may find if you continue to do this, you could experience abdominal cramping and discomfort.


Excuse yourself to the restroom to pass gas.
Wait to pass gas until you are alone or in a well-ventilated space.
If you pass gas in public, politely say excuse me.
Use your discretion. Passing gas in front of close friends or family may be appropriate and establishing these norms may help reduce the negative stigma of passing gas.

, If you noticeably pass gas in public, don’t be embarrassed. Make a joke about it, for example, by suggesting that you quickly move to a new location to escape the smell. Frankly, if it is especially odorous, most people will appreciate your candor and will gladly relocate with you. Making light of this potentially awkward situation may be especially helpful if this is a chronic problem.

Label your emails with a professional subject line.,
Have a professional email address.,
Use a formal salutation.,
Use professional language.,
Be aware of your tone.,
End the email properly.,
Proofread before you send.",How to Use Proper Business Email Etiquette1," The subject line of your email should be clear and to the point. The subject line should let the recipient know the purpose of the email. Instead of saying ""Need to talk,"" try saying ""discussion of X topic.The subject should be between six and eight words.If the email is being sent for a job application, include your name and the position you are applying for. If you were sending an email to a coworker, you would include the name of the project that the email is discussing.;
, If you use your personal email address for business purposes, your email address should communicate your name (i.e. mary.smith@ or MichaelJones@). Email addresses such as hotmama@, cutiepie@, or mustlovedogs@ are not appropriate for business emails. If you work for a company, you should always use your work email address., Your email should always begin with a professional salutation. ""Hey"" or ""What's up"" is not appropriate. ""Hi"" or ""Hello"" are preferable.If you are including the name of the recipient in your salutation, do not use a shortened version of their name (i.e. use ""William"" instead of ""Will"").


If someone has a gender neutral name, like Chris Smith, and you do not know whether the person is a Mr./Mrs./Etc., it is best to write ""Dear Chris Smith.""

, You should use formal English when writing business emails. Avoid slang and colloquialisms in your email. Abbreviations, emoticons, and text message language (e.g. Lol) should not be used.Your email should be concise. Not only is the reader a busy person, but he or she may be reading your email on a mobile device. A short, to-the-point email is much easier to read and respond to than a lengthy, confusing one.Try not to address more than one topic in an email. Emails are brief forms of communication.If you cannot address the topic in a brief manner, you may need to pick the phone and call the person.

, In addition to using clear and concise language, you should read the email out loud to make sure that your email comes across as you intended it to. You do not want to sound harsh or abrupt.Remember that your email must speak for itself. You are not there to convey the tone and intent for the reader. Emails do not come with body language and facial expressions. Also, humor does not translate well over email., It is important that you end an email just like you would end any other conversation. You should end your email by saying ""Thanks,"" ""Thank You,"" or ""Sincerely"" followed by your name. Your emails should also include a signature.Your signature lets the reader know how to contact you. It should include your name, company, address, phone, your email address, and a website link if you have one., You should read your email multiple times before you send it. Do not rely on spellcheck. People will notice grammatical errors and misspelled or missing words.Proofreading is particularly important when you are introducing yourself for the first time through email. You want to make a good impression and not be judged by your email mistakes.


When you are proofreading you should ask yourself: ""Am I being clear and concise?"" ""Did I include any unnecessary information?"" ""Is there anything I can take out?""You should also verify that you are sending the email to the correct recipient. It can be very embarrassing to send an email to the wrong person.

Consider the possible technology misuse problems.,
Remember that not only is it difficult to police but you really don't want a workplace where spying on employees is a necessity.,
Decide what is permissible.,
Decide what is not permissible.,
Balance work efficacy and employee satisfaction.,
Set up a structure for warnings.",How to Set Rules for Internet and Email Use in a Small Business," A number of problems can arise, including looking at inappropriate sites (such as pornographic images), carrying on a business surreptitiously (such as carrying on auction sales online), wasting time (anything from chatting to printing off recipes), downloading illegal items (such as pirated movies), and chewing up the costs of internet service provision when bandwidth is exceeded.;
, Instead, it is far better to make it clear from the outset what limitations you have set on internet and email usage and rely on trust. In general, misuse of technology does become clear when the employee makes a mistake, so it is far better to trust them and earn their loyalty and desire not to waste your time and money than to encourage rebellion through being miserly and mean-spirited about it all.

, Take a positive slant and let the employee know what they can do with the technology. Good examples include:


Allowing employees to use the internet for their own purpose during breaks and lunchtime, provided they do not breach the rules about what is not permissible
Local phone calls for personal matters are permissible but not cell phone calls or long distance calls unless they document and pay for these (and perhaps seek permission in advance)
Email for personal matters is permitted only during break time and only through the internet; no use of the business email account for personal mail
Allowing personal calls on a business cell phone provided they come within a certain price, or otherwise the employee must pay the extra amount, etc.

, Have clear rules that state what isn't allowed, period. Such things include:


Never visiting pornography sites, illegal sites, hate based sites, non-work related sites Not using the internet to promote their own business interests; either they're here for the job they're employed for, or they're somewhere else completely
No downloading of any software, movies, sound bytes, etc. without prior authorization from you or the person responsible for managing IT
No personal emails on the business account
No long distance calls or cell phone calls from business phones , When setting up the rules, be considerate of the needs of the employee and the need to actively trust those you have hired to be capable, competent, and trustworthy. Balance this with the costs to your business of any resulting misuse of technology – not only in dollar terms but also reputation and collegiality.

, It is vital that employees understand from the outset what breaching the rules means. Create a three warnings followed by dismissal policy and have the employee read and sign this upon joining the business. Always make sure that any updates to this policy are brought to the attention of employees and signed off. Evidencing that the employee knew the consequences is a vital part of covering yourself if the matter ends up in court.

Add your closing.,
Sign your name.,
Simplify your email if possible.,

Keep it professional.,
Send your email.",How to Write a Professional Email," Type the email address of your recipient into the To field. Use the To field if you want to email contacts while encouraging their response.This field is for people that the message directly affects. If you are expecting someone to do something in reaction to your email, they should be in the To field.
It's a good idea to include all of the people in your To field in the opening line of your email. This way, you engage everyone in the conversation from the start and inform everyone of who else is involved in the conversation.
If you have included more than four people in the To field, address the group as a whole by starting your email with something like, ""Hi Team, or ""Good Morning All,""
The To field can be used for as many addresses as you'd like. Remember, everyone who is directly involved and needs to take action should be included in the To field.;
, The Cc (or Carbon Copy) field is used as a way to keep others ""in the loop"" without an obligation or requirement to reply or take action on the matter.Think of the Cc field as an FYI to distribute relevant information or updates to a number of associates who need only look through them. To add addresses to the Cc field, simply click on the Cc field and type as many addresses inside as you'd like.


When Cc-ing multiple associates, each recipient will have access to the list of email Cc's.

, The main purpose of the Bcc field is to send an email to a group of contacts that don't know each other. The Bcc field (Blind Carbon Copy)allows you to send a message to several contacts without them knowing who else got the message. To add addresses to the Bcc field, just click on the field and type in each email you need to include.


Use the Bcc field to send an email to multiple associates who don't know each other. This protects the privacy of each recipient by keeping the list of recipients visible only to the sender and not to each recipient.
Use the Bcc field when sending an e-mail to hundreds of people.
Your contacts will be able to see anyone who the email was sent to in the To or Cc fields but not in the Bcc field., If you are included in a Cc email, you are likely part of a handful of other associates all included in the conversation as well, and the sender may not be looking for or expecting a reply from any of you. If you do need to reply, think about the nature of your response and who it applies to. You can chose to ""Reply to Sender"" if you just have a note for the original writer of the email, or you can ""Reply to All"" only if the information is relevant to all involved in the conversation.


Only when your comments are important to the entire group would you use the ""Reply to All"" field.
Be careful when choosing to reply to all recipients on the email. You should avoid flooding other people's inboxes with irrelevant information whenever possible., If you have been included on an email Bcc you will only have the option to reply to the sender of the email and will be unable to see the list of other recipients who also received a Bcc. Simply click on the Reply button to compose an email to the sender.

, Use as few words as possible to describe the topic or nature of your email. Try things like:


""Leadership Meeting Update""
""Issue Regarding Lunch Breaks""
""Meeting Overview for March 12th""

, When approaching a professional email, it's important to keep it clean, short, and clear. Say want needs to be said and keep it at that. You can develop your own structure that works best for you. Here is a basic structure to consider:


Your greeting
A pleasantry
Your purpose
A call to action
A closing message
Your signature

, Depending on your relationship with the recipient, you can address them as expected, either with their entire name and title, or just their first name.


If your relationship is very casual, you can even say, ""Hi Gabe"".
If you don't know the name of the recipient, you can use: ""To whom it may concern"" or ""Dear Sir/Madam"".
If you are composing an email to a group of recipients who you have included in the To field and require a response from, greet them as a group (if the number of recipients is four or greater) or include each of their names in the greeting.
If you are sending an email with Cc's, simply address the group as a whole if you have a great number of recipients, otherwise include each recipient's name in the greeting.
If you are sending an email with BCC's, address the group as a whole by opening with something like, ""Hi all"".
If you are emailing someone for the first time, keep introductions brief and let them know who you are in one sentence. For example: ""It was great to meet you at .""
If you are not sure if an introduction is necessary and you've contacted the recipient before, but you're not sure if they remember you, you can leave your credentials in your email signature.

, If you are initiating the line of communication, you are responsible for telling your recipients what the email is regarding. It is important to state your purpose early. Business associates will want to be able to read your email quickly and get to the point. Take a minute to ask yourself why you are writing it and why you need your recipient to see it. This will help you avoid idle chitchat and cut right to the chase for a more professional email. This is also a good time to ask yourself: ""Is this email really necessary?"" Again, only sending emails that are absolutely necessary shows respect for the person you're emailing. Once you are ready to compose your email, try starting with something like:


“I am writing to inquire about …”
“I am writing in reference to …”
""Please take the time to look over these changes and offer me your feedback...""

, If you are replying to a client's inquiry, or if someone has replied to one of your emails, you should begin with a line of thanks.For example:


""Thank you for getting back to me...""
""Thank you for your attention on this matter...""
""Thank you for contacting Ocean Safari Scuba...""
Thanking the reader is a great way to remain polite, professional, and on good terms with your recipient.

, With business emails, the less you include the better. Make each email you send out just about one thing. If you need to communicate about another project, compose another email.


Try communicating everything you need to in just five sentences. Say everything you need to say, and no more. Sometimes it will be impossible to limit your email to just five sentences. Don’t worry if you need to include more information.
In the body of your email, include all relevant information and anything you may require from your recipients.

, If you need your recipient to do something, don't just assume they will know what to do or when. Help them out by clearly outline what you need. Say something like:


""Could you send me those files by Thursday?""
""Could you write that up in the next two weeks?""
""Please write to Thomas about this, and let me know when you've done so.""
Structuring your request as a question encourages a reply. You can say, ""Let me know when you have done that.""

, To keep your emails professional, end your email with another thank you to your reader or a formal goodbye such as:


""Thank you for your patience and cooperation”
“Thank you for your consideration”
“If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to let me know”
“I look forward to hearing from you”.
End your email with a proper closing before your name, like “Best regards” or “Sincerely”
Avoid casual closings like “Cheers” unless you are good friends with the reader, as these types of closings are less professional.

, In a professional email, your signature should include the following:Your name.
Your job title.
A link to your website.
Links to social media accounts (optional).
Necessary contact information.

, Remember, your recipients are busy and they want to get to the meat of the email quick.Take a step back and evaluate your email. Here are some things to consider:


Use short sentences, words, and paragraphs. This helps make the email quick and easy to read and understand.
If it's possible to cut a word out, cut it out. Trim your sentences down to as short as possible.

, Professional emails require careful proofreading. Read your email aloud to yourself. This can help you catch a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes. Ask yourself:


Is my email clear?
Could my email be misunderstood?
How would it sound if I were the recipient?

, You don't need to show your personality in your professional email. If you'd like, you can let it show subtly through your writing style, but stay away from emoticons, chat abbreviations (such as LOL), or colorful fonts and backgrounds.The only time it is appropriate to use emoticons or chat abbreviations is when you're mirroring the email language of the person you're writing to.
Write like you speak. This can help you keep your email short, friendly, and personable.
Don't say anything in an email that you wouldn't say to your recipient in person.

, Once you have proofread you email and have included all the necessary information and added each recipient to the appropriate field, click the send button.

Reduce the amount of air swallowed.,
Keep a food journal.,
Avoid foods that are known to cause gas.,
Determine if you have food intolerances.,
Get checked out for a more serious problem.",How to Deal With Gas2," Sometimes excess gas can be caused by swallowing too much air. This can happen when you eat too fast or may be done unconsciously. Unconscious swallowing of air (aerophagia) is often associated with emotional stress and stress reduction techniques may prove beneficial.Eat slower. Rapid ingestion of food can lead to swallowing air, which can increase gas production. Focus on eating slower, perhaps by chewing food a certain number of times before swallowing. Not only will this reduce the amount of air swallowed during eating, but eating slower has been associated with decreased calorie intake. Stop chewing gum and smoking, both of which can increase the amount of air that is unconsciously swallowed.

, Every body is different and you may find that your body is more sensitive to some foods than others. Keeping a record of what you ate and your symptoms may help you identify different foods that may be causing increased gas production.


Once you have identified which foods cause you problems, start eliminating them from your diet one at a time. You can also try eliminating all the foods that may cause gas, then slowly reintroduce them into your diet., Some foods are more apt to cause gas than others. This may be due to the body’s inability to properly digest certain foods, such as those containing short chain carbohydrates, called FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols).Additionally, starch and soluble fiber can contribute to increased gas.Below is a list of foods to avoid to reduce gas:


Beans
Fruit
Legumes, oat bran
Potatoes
Corn
Pasta
Broccoli
Brussels sprouts
Cauliflower
Lettuce
Dairy
Carbonated beverages (soda and beer)
Sugar alcohols (sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol)

, Some individuals are incapable of digesting certain foods, which can lead to increased gas production. A medical professional can help you determine if you have a food intolerance and help you plan a well-balanced diet that accommodates your dietary restrictions.


Lactose intolerance is a common occurrence and results from a deficiency in the lactose-digesting enzyme, lactase. To determine if you are lactose-intolerant, follow these guidelines. Some individuals with lactose intolerance find it helpful to take lactase supplements, such as Lactaid, when eating dairy products. Supplementation with lactase should help your body digest lactose and reduce gas.
Other carbohydrate malabsorption conditions can result in increased gas production.For example, if you frequently experience increased gas after eating foods containing high fructose corn syrup, you may have fructose malabsorption.Keeping a journal, as mentioned above, will help you to identify which foods result in increased gas production.

, Rarely, increased gas may be a sign of a more serious medical problem. Increased intestinal gas can be a sign of celiac disease (gluten intolerance),irritable bowel syndrome,or a bacterial infection. Consult your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms:


Diarrhea
Changes in the color or frequency of stools
Bloody stools
Severe abdominal pain
Unexplained weight loss

Know when to use Reply and Reply All.,
Know the difference between Bcc and Cc.,
Recognize when a phone call may be better.,
Know when to start a new conversation.",How to Use Proper Business Email Etiquette2," When you choose ""Reply,"" you are sending the email back to the original sender. When you hit ""Reply All,"" you are sending the email to all of the original recipients. Use ""Reply All"" sparingly and only when it is absolutely necessary to share your response with all of the original recipients., You should use ""Bcc"" when the privacy of the email recipients is important. This may be useful in group emails or large distribution lists. You should use ""Cc"" when you need to include other people in the conversation and privacy is not an issue. ""Cc"" is helpful when you just want to keep someone in the loop about what is going on.It is very important that you use these two functions properly. ""Bcc"" should not be used to secretly pass along private information or to trap people. For example, you should not send an email to your coworker about a mistake they made and ""Bcc"" your supervisor.

, It may be quicker to pick up the phone instead of sending countless emails back and forth. It may be helpful to use the three email rule. If an issue has not been resolved within three emails, you should pick up the phone and call the person. There are times when the phone is more efficient than exchanging multiple emails.Keep in mind that this rule is not set in stone. You should use your discretion when deciding it is time to pick up the phone.

, If you need to discuss a different topic with the same recipient, you should start a new email. This will make it easier to keep track of conversations and will keep you from looking lazy.For example, if you have been emailing someone about an upcoming meeting, you need to start a new conversation if you wanted to discuss the outcomes of a project that is being worked on.

Be timely!,
Dress appropriately.,
Know how to present business cards.,
Take notes.,
Try not to disrespect anyone, even a mutual competitor.",How to Practice Proper Business Etiquette in Japan," Japanese companies run on tight schedules which are strictly adhered to. Call one to two hours beforehand to say you are on your way. If you will be late, call as far in advance as possible; giving less than a one hour notice is bad form.


The same goes for the ending of meetings. If it is scheduled to end by 4 o'clock, try your best to finish on time, leaving enough time to say goodbye. Show you will work to adhere to your agreed schedule.;
, Japanese business attire will look very familiar to U.S. and European businessmen. For men, the exact color of a suit depends on time of year; October through April, wear a dark suit (navy or black), and May through September, wear a grey suit. Under the suit, one should wear a white button down shirt and subdued tie, with no bright colors or patterns. For women, attire should match men in color. Avoid short skirts, low-cut tops, and tight clothing (that is the attire of an ""office-girl""). Style is very important for women in Japan, so Prada, Channel, etc. is common in the workplace. Pantsuits are a good alternative to skirts.


For men, do not wear a black suit with a white shirt and black tie. That attire is exclusively for funerals in Japan, and should never be worn to any other occasion.
Be well groomed. If you are a man with long hair, there must be no loose hair, or hair covering any part of your face; a ponytail is acceptable. Personal grooming is not something to be witnessed by others.

, When you first greet your business associates, have enough business cards in your hand for everyone. Not giving someone a card would be rude, and if your hosts bring someone with them to the meeting, then they deserve your respect, even if it is a lowly personal assistant.


Hold your card in both hands, one on each side. Reach your arms forward and bow slightly (they should be able to see the top of your head), while offering your card, name out, to the highest ranking member of the company there. Then accept his card and repeat down the line by authority.
He will prompt his staff to introduce themselves, or he may introduce them himself. Introduce your staff the same way. They should also have their own business cards; make sure to treat each business card respectfully.
Accept one from everyone who offers. Do not hand them to your assistant. Also, never bend, tear, drop, or write on someone else's business card. Use it as an example of how you will treat the person. Don't crush them into your pocket.

, Note taking is how you show you are listening. You will see your Japanese counterparts taking many notes, which they will keep and file. You will be expected to remember everything your write down, so do not lose that pad. You can be sure they will keep every note on everything you say. Also, do not write on any other paper or documents during the meeting.


Be as honest as possible when speaking. They will keep all the notes they take and review them, so if you promise a certain price five years from now, they will expect you to remember. If you forget, they will have all their notes from that meeting ready and will expect you to honor your original statement. If you can't guarantee something, don't. Explain why you can't, instead, and apologize.

, It is always bad form in all contexts. This includes your own company and employees. If someone from your team messes up, apologize for them and insist they apologize as well. Here are a few Japanese customs to watch out for:


Allow your hosts to seat you. There is a specific way to seat everyone for Japanese business meetings. Do not take your own seat; if you do, get up and apologize.
Make eye contact. If someone is speaking to you, you should be looking at them. Similarly, it is rude to look away while speaking to someone, so finish your sentence before looking at someone else.
Don't get too close. Japanese people generally stand father apart when speaking. Normal speaking distance in America is very intimate for Japanese people, and will make them uncomfortable. Keep at least 10 feet (3.0 m) between you at all times unless they are the first to close the distance.
Do not offer a handshake. Let them be the first to do so. If they do not, bow, and do not mention it. Never pat a Japanese business man on the back.
Never ask personal questions of any kind; you may, however, ask about the company they work for. And again, never lose, damage, write on, hand off, or forget a Japanese business person's card.

Keep it professional.,
Focus on the conversation.,
Always identify yourself.,
Answer with an appropriate level of decorum.,
Listen carefully.,
Be wary of information-gathering calls.",How to Answer the Phone Politely1," When you're answering the phone at your office, you don't always know who's on the other end of the conversation. It could be your boss, a customer, one of your colleagues, or even a wrong number. Answering the phone professionally will start whatever conversation you are about to have get off on the right foot.


Even if you have caller ID, it could be your boss calling from a colleague's phone! Answering the phone with ""Yeah, what?"" will give people an impression of you that you don't want them to have.;
, Stop whatever you might be doing and take a brief moment to prepare. Wear the face you want to project before picking up the phone. It makes a difference: whether you're smiling, frowning, or bored to tears, your caller will hear that in your tone.

, In business situations, it is appropriate to answer the phone with your name and company: ""Good morning, thank you for calling XYZ. This is Joan. How may I help you?""


If it's an internal call, and you know it, you can answer with your department and name: ""Hello, this is WebDev, Jordan speaking. How can I help you today?"" This will let your caller know they've reached the right person, and that you are ready to assist them. Keeping a friendly, personable tone will make the call much more pleasant for everybody.
In many office situations, there are guidelines for answering the phone that all employees must follow. Always project sincerity, no matter how silly the canned lines might seem—the customer will be able to tell the difference if you are enthusiastic, versus just reading the cue card: ""Thanks for calling ChknLckn, the FngrLckn best!"" will sound totally ridiculous if you don't say it with conviction!

, Try not to speak too informally until you know who the caller is.


If the speaker does not introduce themselves, say, ""May I ask who's calling?"" This is an accepted practice that not only lets the caller know they are being treated personally, it also lets you make a note should you need to contact that person again, or transfer them to another line.Don't ask the speaker rudely.Or He/She might get displeased with you.
Do not delve into gossiping or personal conversations. Unless you're chatting with a colleague or friend, there's no room for this in an office situation.

, Find out the reason the person is calling and respond appropriately.


If the person they are trying to reach is not at home or is not available to speak, tell the caller, ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Simpson, Mr. Burns is not available right now. May I take a message?""
Be sure to record the person's name, phone number, and purpose of call. This way, if it is an important call, the issue can be dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible.

, If the caller requests details about you or others, consider carefully before responding. Even if the caller gives a name and identifies his or her company, you should be wary unless they are a trusted contact.


In a business situation, state ""I'm sorry, sir/madam. Company policy is that I am not permitted to give out that information. May I have more details on why it is required?"" and make your assessment from there.

"
"
Be yourself.,
Say hello!",How to Answer the Phone Politely2," Your home is your castle, as they say, and while phone etiquette is still the best practice, the formality of the office is not usually necessary.

, It's a universal greeting known around the world: ""Hello?"" Say it with a smile, and people will usually respond accordingly.


If, based on caller ID and experience, you know who's calling, feel free saying ""Hi, Tom! How are you today?""
If you have caller ID and do not recognize the caller, or the call is either listed as ""unknown,"" or ""blocked,"" answering the phone is discretionary.
If you do choose to answer, be aware that the person on the other end of the line is probably in a business frame of mind, and answer accordingly. Be wary of giving out your name to strangers, however. A simple ""Hello?"" will suffice.
If they ask for you or another member of your household, ask them for their name and organization before you tell them anything—the last thing you want to do is give telemarketers too much information! If they're cagey or won't say who they are, remember—you're under no obligation to continue speaking to them.

Record your greeting.,
Keep it professional in the office.,
At home, keep it simple, friendly, and direct.",How to Answer the Phone Politely3," Not all calls get through, and when they don't, answering machines and voice mail are there to take the calls we miss. Because you don't know who might reach your machine, using proper phone etiquette is important.

, Your answering machine greeting at work should be handled much like you would handle a ""live"" call: ""Hello, you've reached the office of Mr. Burns. Please leave a message, including your name, phone number, and time you called. If this is an emergency, please contact my assistant at 415-555-1234.""

, You can say ""Hi, this is Steve. I can't pick up the phone at the moment, but leave your name and number, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.""


If you want to be more anonymous, you can say ""Hi, you've reached 415-555-1234. There's nobody available to take your call, but leave your name and number and we'll get back to you.""
Family options are flexible. You can answer for your whole family: ""Hi, this is the Simpson family. Sorry we can't come to the phone right now, but leave a message and we'll call you back as soon as we can!""
You can also have the whole family speak (either as a chorus, or individually), but the essence should be the same: sorry we missed your call, we're not able to answer at the moment, please leave a message.
Whatever you do, avoid saying ""We're not home right now,"" especially if you're not home! This lets potential troublemakers know they won't be disturbed as they ""borrow"" your TV, stereo, and jewelry.

Men should wear coat or jacket and a tie, until advised to dress more casually. Follow the lead of those with whom you are meeting.
Men may find in a very casual business office that a short sleeve shirt and no tie would be appropriate.
Jeans may be worn for very casual occasions, but never shorts for men or women. Even though the climate is warm and humid, proper attire, even for very casual occasions, will always dictate your choice of clothing. Shorts are not considered proper attire.
Women should wear long-sleeve blouses and skirts that cover the knee.
Women meeting in a more formal office should wear a suit with hosiery.
Women are limited to clothing colors that are muted or dark. Leave brightly colored clothing for at home.
Women must always cover their upper arms when wearing a casual blouse, so no sleeveless tops.;
,, Do not put your hands into your pockets when talking with someone.


Do not crook your index finger to call someone over. This gesture is offensive.
No physical contact between men and women is made in public, except a possible handshake.

, Meetings traditionally start late, and your Indonesian business associates will probably arrive late. However, you are expected on time, and should never make any comment about the meeting starting late or any person arriving late.

, Always rise when your host or hostess enters the room.

,


Leaving food on your plate signifies you are impolite, so eat all the food you are served.
Only use your right hand for eating, when touching someone, or handling money/papers.
Never eat while walking in public, or chew on a toothpick.

, Never show the soles of your feet/shoes in any way. (Don't cross your legs so that the bottom of your shoe shows and don't prop your feet on anything) or touch anything with your foot.

,


Never touch another person's head, this includes a child's head (such as a pat on the head).
Yawning in public is inappropriate (cover your mouth if you must yawn).

, Religion/culture dictates specific rules for appropriate gifts. Muslim, Hindus, and the Chinese culture each have rules regarding food, alcohol and other items. Make sure that your gift is not offensive to the recipient.


Gifts are not opened when given. This practice shows the recipient is gracious, not greedy.
Do not give a gift that numbers four or shows a crane or stork. In selecting the gift and the gift wrapping paper stay away from the colors white, black, or blue (Chinese).
A gift of an umbrella means you do not want to see that person again.

, The handshake must be limp and lasts 10 to 15 seconds.


For religious reasons (Muslim and Hindu), men and women do not touch in public in this culture.
Women, do not offer a handshake to an Indonesian man. However, should a man extend his hand, always shake hands. Some Indonesian men may follow western business rules in a business setting.
Men - do not offer a handshake to an Indonesian woman. Reciprocate, however, if she initiates.

, Greetings are not to be rushed; they carry importance and formality. A person's name is very important. Develop a habit of paying close attention during introduction.

, Presenting your business card follows introductions.


Present a business card to each person you are meeting. Offer your card with the printing positioned so the recipient can read it. Your right hand holds the card, with your left hand supporting your right wrist. Your card will be received with both hands.

Be a good listener.,
Empathize with the customer.,
Remember that other people are watching the interaction.,
Speak slowly and lower your voice.,
Apologize.,
Notify your supervisor.,
Make a promise you can keep.,
End the interaction on a positive note.,
Know when enough is enough.,
Set aside your ego.,
View difficult customers as potential opportunities.,
Do not take complaints personally.",How to Defuse a Situation With a Difficult Customer1," Difficult customers don't expect perfection but want to know that their problems are being taken seriously. Be attentive and listen calmly and completely to the customer's problem. Maintain eye contact, and don't smile or grimace. Nod when the customer makes a point you find valid., Most bad customer interactions escalate because the customer feels like you're not making an effort to understand his or her concerns. Communicating that you empathize with the customer can set the tone for the interaction as a whole, and establish you as an ally who wants to fix the problem.Say ""I understand completely, and I'm so sorry you've been upset. Let's find a way to work this out."" Saying ""let's"" casts you and the customer as a team working together to find a solution.
If the customer reiterates the complaint, turn up the empathy another notch. Respond with something like, ""That sounds incredibly frustrating"" or ""I'd feel exactly the same way in your shoes.""
Keep in mind that empathizing doesn't necessarily mean giving the customer whatever he or she wants. Instead of it being the customer versus you and the company, it's you and the customer versus the company.

, Imagining that an audience is observing the interaction can help you to stay calm. You never want customers to see you behaving badly.Assume that the customer is going to tell other people about the interaction they had with you.Your dealings with customers should never hurt your company, but be an example of the quality service that your company provides.

, Emotions are infectious. Lowering your tone and speaking slowly will demonstrate that you are in control and calm. This is especially important if the customer is very angry and talking loudly. You do not want to do anything to aggravate the situation., An apology is within every employee's capacity, no matter what his or her role in the company is. Look the customer right in the eyes and make sure your expression and tone of voice are sincere. Say that, on behalf of the company, you're sorry the customer wasn't satisfied and that you want to do whatever you can to help.Never be patronizing. Avoid apologizing in a way that seems like you're belittling the customer. A good rule is to apologize for your own actions and the actions of your company, never for the way your customer feels or is acting. For instance, instead of saying, ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but I can't offer you a refund."" Try saying, ""I'm sorry we can't satisfy you with a refund. Is there anything else we can do for you?""

, The customer might ask you to do this anyway, but even if he or she doesn't, it's a good idea. Your supervisor has more authority to resolve issued with the customer, whether that means a discount, comped merchandise, or some other concession. Additionally, it transfers the responsibility of pleasing the customer to someone who's higher up the chain of command than you are, which customers can find reassuring.


If you need to keep the customer waiting while you fetch your supervisor, provide them with somewhere comfortable to wait. If you're authorized to offer refreshments such as water, then offer it. Being treated kindly may calm down a customer.

, Offering a solution or a promise that you cannot follow through with is one of the worse things you can do. This will make the customer more frustrated. If you are unsure about something, ask your supervisor. Do not make a rash decision under pressure.You can always tell the customer, ""That may be possible, let me check with someone.""

, Even if you addressed the problem exactly as the customer wanted and he or she is still mad, try not to let him or her leave in a huff. Instead, express gratitude for his or her patience, and promise you'll do everything possible to make sure the next experience goes smoothly. For example, you might say, ""Thanks so much for being patient while we sorted this issue out. I'd be more than happy to personally oversee your transaction next time you're here so that I can ensure it goes smoothly - please don't hesitate to ask for me.""


If you were unable to satisfy your customer, still try to generate a positive memory a he or she leaves by being kind and professional. The customer may leave thinking, ""Well, they couldn't help me, but at least that salesperson was really nice.""

, If the customer is engaged in violent behavior or shows no signs of calming down, call store or mall security or emergency services and ask the police to resolve it. If your customer is making a scene, verbally abusing you or other employees, or being physically intimidating, you have gone as far as you should, both for your sake, and for the sake of your other customers.


If a customer is drunk or under the influence of drugs, don't waste time trying to reason; call security immediately for the sake of everyone's safety and well-being.

, Be prepared to satisfy the customer even if you believe that he or she is wrong. You may have to humble yourself before the customer or apologize for something that you don't think is a big deal. Never be too proud to do your best to satisfy a difficult customer.


Think of the old retail stand-by, ""The customer is always right."" This doesn't mean that, objectively speaking, the customer's complaint is just and correct. Handling the interaction with a positive spin that satisfies the customer isn't meant to humiliate you as an employee, it's meant to maintain that customer's patronage.

, Keep in mind that a happy customer means better business. A satisfied customer might spread the word about having a good experience, but an unsatisfied one will almost certainly complain to other people. This means less money and less business for your company. As you attempt to cool your customers' nerves, think of your interaction as an opportunity to save future business that might otherwise be lost.

, Remember that whatever is happening has no bearing on who you are as a person. Complaints from customers shouldn't be taken as personal insults, even if the customer insults you as a person. Put aside pride and the desire to put your ego before the customer's experience. While it is tempting to convince the customer that you are right and they are wrong, resist this temptation.Difficult customers are a natural part of working in customer service. Think of these situations as a regular part of your job."

There is no ceremony to give your business card to someone, but make sure you present your card with your right hand always.",How to Practice Business Etiquette in India," Hinduism is the dominant religion in this country despite of a significant number of Muslims, Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. Onto this religious diversity is grafted a layer of British formality and good manners resulting across the country in a disposition that is as polite as is distinctive. Indians love bargaining and derive immense pleasure out of it.;
, Indians are very formal upon the first meeting. Elders are respected and deferred to, even in the matters of business. Caste rankings still exist amongst some, though they are not as pervasive as they were before. You may even find one Indian bowing to another which is a sign of respect of age or for someone who is higher in rank

, This is a sign of informality in the traditional Hindu culture and some might even be offended much to your dismay. So always use last names especially if you are meeting them for the first time. And only call them something else when they insist or allow you to.

, India is overall a hot and humid country so the clothing has to be casual and comfortable. As a result, suits are rarely worn. A light jacket with shirt and pant is considered a formal outfit for businessmen. Women wear blazers over their shirt and trousers or clean, crisp saris (unstitched cloths draped over the body). Wear a sari only if you think you can carry it off well or else go the safe way of blazers and trousers.

, Business lunches are becoming very common in India. Dinners at Indian homes are bounteous and delicious. It is not necessary to show up on time, but don't be more than 30 minutes late. If you are visiting the house for the second or third time, do take some sweets/fruits/eatables along with you. This is not exactly business, but a little politeness does no harm.

, If you want to impress the person or client you are with, you could also use your hand to eat. But be sure you don't mess it up. One's left hand should never be used on the dining table while eating. It is considered messy only if you dirty your fingers beyond the second knuckle. Also, do not thank your host after the meal is over. Thanking is considered as a fake gesture by several. Weird, but it's true.

, Also do not use your feet to touch someone or point towards something. It is a sign of disrespect in the Hindu culture to use the feet during conversations of any kind.

, It shows a sign of respect, confidence and sensitivity.

Evaluate your client's performance objectively.,
Determine whether the problem stems from your client's expectations of you.,
Decide if the client is living up to your expectations of them.,
Make sure that you are in the right.,
Check whether the client is influential in the company.,
Prepare a good explanation.,
Treat disrespectful client behavior with a great deal of care.,
Fire over the phone or in person.,
Decide what your deal breakers are going forward.",How to Fire a Client," There can be several key reasons why a client isn't working out for your business, but it's rarely in your best interest to end a business relationship just because the client is demanding or overbearing. Reputation is one thing that you can't buy, so make sure to guard your reputation by only letting clients go when the situation objectively demands it., If the client has unrealistic expectations of what your business can do, it can cause them to place unreasonable demands on you. Maybe the client always expects free additional services. Maybe they just make demands on you that aren't worth what they pay. Should this be the case, try and manage their expectations on what you can and are willing to do before you need to sever the relationship entirely., If the client is failing to provide your business the expected services or products--or isn't providing them in a timely fashion--it can cause your whole business to suffer. It's best to meet this kind of problem head on, before an acrimonious split becomes inevitable. Speak frankly with the client about their shortcomings, but most importantly, explain what impact their failures have on you., Since reputation is so important, if you feel that you must end the business relationship, it behooves you to make a few discreet inquiries to see if others agree that the relationship is unsalvageable. Talk to a few employers or partners in the company and ask them what they think. There might be things they can do to change or rectify an unacceptable situation. They might even be able to come to your rescue in unexpected ways. For instance, maybe another partner will want to keep the client for themselves.Tally up the amount of money that this client brings in. Sometimes a client simply isn't bringing in enough revenue to justify they trouble that you have to go through to get it. If you can justify ending or modifying the relationship on that basis, all the better.

, Does this client have many other clients as friends in your company or other companies you associate with? If handled improperly, firing one client can make you lose half of your other clients as well. There is a saying in business: ""Do not shoot off your foot over a bad toe."" Be cognizant of the possible chain reaction that might follow the firing of one client.

, Even if you plan on ending the relationship in a face-to-face meeting, it's a good idea to have a script to work from. Use the documentation to explain to your client why you're unhappy with the services they're providing, the input they're giving, or their expectations from your business. Better yet, depersonalize the reasons for letting the client go. Show how your own business has changed over time and how it is no longer able to meet the needs that the client has.Always seek professional business advice if they are a client that has stakes in the company.

, If the client is paying for services or goods from your company, they may feel that they had a right to be pushy, bossy or intimidating. If you're paying for their services as a consultant or a contractor, they may feel that being frank and bold was a good thing, while you simply found it confronting and rude. Although these are perfectly legitimate reasons to end your relationship with a client, in the interests of reputation, you should avoid laying the blame on the client directly, especially in this kind of situation. You already know that this particular client is prickly, difficult, and perhaps even impulsive or hot tempered. Therefore, you should give them as little reason as possible to badmouth you around town., You can follow up with an email or letter to finalize things after the discussion. It is recommended that:


You provide at least three reasons why you must let them go.
Explain that you have more clients than you can handle, and that you need to pare down your workload. This has the virtue of always being true--even if you would be able to handle more good clients, this particular bad client is more than you can handle.
Be respectful and listen to their point of view, but don't argue. If they become too aggressive, just explain that you value their input, but that your decision is final.
Offer a new service company or another service worker that will be able to work with them instead of you.
Be honest about why you are letting them go so they can change the way they act or help them change their attitude for the future.
Be polite and act concerned about what they think. However, be firm about your decision and let them go.

, As a businessperson, you certainly don't want to get into a situation where you are firing clients right and left. Therefore, you need to formally write out the types of client behaviors so detrimental to your business' well being that it will give you cause to end the relationship. Even if you don't share this list with your new clients, it will help you objectively evaluate each new situation as it arises. "

Ask before borrowing.,
Always say please and thank you.,
Don't consistently interrupt people.,
Refrain from being loud.,
Be sensitive to others’ need for privacy.,
Avoid being a source of odors.,
Keep your work area tidy.",How to Practice Office Etiquette," While the term ""office etiquette"" may conjure up images of stiffness and formality, it is in actual fact very simple. Office etiquette is about observing a simple set of rules for getting along with other people in an organizational context. Just as living in a society requires us to follow a set of conventions (unwritten but well understood expectations) and rules, observing appropriate social behavior within the work context ensures congeniality, team respect and an enjoyable day-to-day working experience.


While most etiquette remains unwritten, just because it isn't down in black and white and pinned to the noticeboard doesn't excuse lack of observance. There will always be a larger proportion of any social group expecting that the unwritten conventions of etiquette be observed regularly, with few exceptions and no matter how quirky, rebellious or authentic you feel like being, there will always be boundaries of respect for others that you need to heed, as will be made clear in the remainder of this article.

, Being punctual is very important, especially if you have an appointment. It shows that you respect the time of your colleagues and in turn it will compel them to respect your time too. The popular saying that would fit in this situation is that ‘Time and tide wait for no one’. Lead by an example and everything else will fall into place.


Avoid turning up later than your boss when you're a junior. At the entry stage of a job, sending a clear message that you're eager and already working is vital.

, Most offices have a predefined dress code that has to be followed strictly. However, if you do have the privilege of working at a place which does not define a dress code, then it's up to you to dress appropriately. Remember that the office is not a party place and you will have to dress in a way that commands respect both from your colleagues and clients. The dress code has a strong influence in establishing the trust that your client places in your abilities in giving them their money’s worth. Dress professionally, or in the manner expected at your particular work site. Do not wear ultra-casual, provocative or evening attire.


Obviously there are always exceptions, such as offices that allow a more relaxed dress code or dress-down days to raise money for charity, etc. However, even for people whose office is normally fairly relaxed, a suit or other professional outfit should be used when interacting with clients, seeking important deals and other highly professional situations.

, Office gossip might not make or break your career but it can cause a lot of unnecessary stress which should be avoided at all costs. You would not want someone to gossip about you and neither will the next person. In some cases, if the source of some malicious gossip can be traced back to you, then your job can be in jeopardy. Limit your comments about coworkers to positive ones only. Office grapevines can be faster than the speed of lightning; anything negative you say will get around and may reflect poorly on you, or possibly label you as the company gossip.


You may overhear the conversations of others. Be good and forget you ever heard them and apply the ""so what"" rule. Don't refer to what you've overheard and definitely don't add your own advice!

, If you're at good terms with your colleague, then it may appear all right if you borrowed a stapler or a marker from their desk without asking. Well, the fact of the matter is that it is not all right. It is imperative that you ask first and then borrow. This attitude of yours will ensure that people also treat your things with the same respect and your things are not missing (read borrowed) when you get back to your seat after a meeting.


If there are some items that are always needed, have a central common pool for such items so that desk-nabbing ceases to occur. For example, a central spot for stapling, sticking and enveloping is a good idea as nobody owns the items there and they always remain within the pool.

, A few nice words can keep the mood of the office uplifting or at least keep the mood from turning foul. When you pass co-workers in the hallway and this person isn't particularly your friend, smile or nod. Acknowledge that they are there. You don't have to run over and hug them but just say hello. Think about what kind of message you send when you look the other way to purposely avoid contact.



Say hello to people in your vicinity when you come in every morning. A vicious habit can creep in when people let this well mannered greeting slip and just slink into their seats without saying a word. It's rude and it's not going to garner you any favors with others. Even if they don't make the effort, be the example for everyone else to let them know it's not only okay but expected.
Watch your language. When interacting with others at the office remember that profanity offends some people. Also avoid innuendos or jokes at the expense of other people.

, Doing so will suggest that your time or opinion is more important than theirs. If your co-worker is on the phone but you need to ask a question, don't linger. Tap them on the shoulder and whisper that you need them for a minute (or leave a quick note in front of them) and ask them to call or see you when they are done. If your co-worker is having a work related conversation don't interrupt - just wait for them to finish or ask them to see you when they are through.

, For those without an office door to close, the most frequent complaint made is about noise from other people in the work environment. Keeping your voice down should be a priority in all work interactions:


Whether you're on the phone or talking to a colleague, avoid being loud.
Use your handset or headset--not a speakerphone--to take all calls, unless you're behind closed doors.
If you have a received a call on your cell phone, it's a good idea to take a walk down to the corridor or to find a room with a door you can shut to take the rest of the call if you're likely to disturb others. This is especially recommended if it's a personal call or one that's likely to take some time.
Avoid speaking in a loud or belligerent manner. Aggressive or increasingly loud vocalizations upset people and even those who are not the target of the aggression will be left with a sense of unease and discomfort.
Turn off your personal cell phone during business hours; use its vibrating feature if you need to leave it on. Avoid making personal calls at your workstation; your coworker need not know that your spouse needs to pick up a pound of ham.
If you listen to a radio or stream music, keep it low or wear a headset.
Be especially quiet in areas where coworkers are on business calls or in conversations with other coworkers. Don't engage in long conversations in shared office space; if a topic requires more than a couple minutes' discussion, find a conference room to avoid distracting your co-workers.
Be considerate around meeting rooms, even if you're not sure whether or not a meeting is in progress – always assume there is one and be on the safe side.

, Don’t read someone else’s faxes, emails, mail or computer screens. Only share personal things at work that you wouldn’t mind reading in next week’s newspaper. And remember that when you send emails, never write anything that would be a problem if forwarded; simply by virtue of the fact that anyone can forward an email, you need to be alert to this potential.


If you need to discuss anything sensitive or private with another colleague, find a room where you can shut the door and nobody else can overhear you. Personal issues and work performance reviews are not for the ears of anyone other than the recipient.
Only use a speaker phone behind closed doors. When working in open areas, use your handset or headset for all calls.

, Eating odorous food at your desk, removing your shoes or spritzing perfume or air freshener during the day can upset those sensitive to odors. Nobody wants a whiff of smelly feet no matter how much you think you can't smell them and the odor of lunch is a very personal thing, so don't assume it's as delightful to someone else's nose as it is to yours. Besides, just what are you doing eating at your desk anyway? Go out and get some fresh air!


If you don't know if something you're doing, wearing or eating is strong in odor, assume that it is. Our olfactory system can play tricks on us when we're habituated to an odor that others aren't familiar with, downplaying its strength to our own nose while others might be gagging. This isn't a time for standing up for your ""rights""; you are likely to be causing genuine distress to other people.
If someone else in the office is guilty as charged, read How to Deal with a Work Colleague Who Has Stinky Lunches.

, Try not to be messy. A messy cubicle or desk shows how confused and careless you are, and that you're not clear about yourself. Also, it can reflect your personality or personal life at home. So don't let people think that you're always an unorganized person. Keep your cubicle tidy and decorative (with relevant material only, for example, some charts or articles etc.).


If you like adding a personal touch, such as photos or trinkets, choose only a few decent ones. Don't overload the space as if it's a collector's corner. Not only does having too many personal effects make it appear that you're rather territorial and sentimental but it can make it hard for others to take you as seriously in the work context. Moreover, if you're shifted frequently, it's just more stuff to keep moving about with you.
If you have a communal kitchen area keeping it clean is vitally important. If you spill it, wipe it clean. If you drop it, pick it up. Your mom is not there to follow behind you to clean a trail of mess that you made. Don't expect your co-workers to do it either.

Deal with an angry customer.,
Satisfy an unhappy customers.,
Helping an indecisive customer.,
Working with an overbearing customer.,
Deal with a rude or inconsiderate customer.,
Handle talkative customers.",How to Defuse a Situation With a Difficult Customer2," Angry customers can be especially difficult. You need to sort through their emotions to get to the root of the anger. Stay positive throughout the interaction, acknowledge the the customer's feelings, show that you're willing to help, and work with the customer to develop a solution.Tell the customer, ""I know that you are upset, and I would like to help you. Can you explain to me what happened?"" Never say something like, ""There's no reason for you to be upset.""Remain calm and objective throughout the interaction. Do not make any promises that you cannot keep. Tell the customer, ""I will do my best to get this resolved as quickly as possible,"" instead of promising that something can be done in a specific time period. A good rule of thumb is to under promise and over deliver.Avoid interrupting the customer when they are explaining things to you, this may make the customer more agitated. Never say, ""Yes, but..."" when the customer is talking to you.
Always follow-up with the customer to make sure he or she is satisfied with the outcome.

, You may encounter a dissatisfied customer after he or she has had a negative experience with another person in your organization. For example, you may be a manger at restaurant, and a customer is unhappy with the service the waiter has provided. Greet the customer with a smile, tell him or her your name, and offer your assistance. As the customer is speaking with you, make sure that you do not make excuses for the bad service he or she has received. Ask open-ended questions, verify information, and make a decision that will satisfy the customer.Ask the customer, ""Can you explain what happened?""
In the restaurant example, after the customer has explained the issue, try saying ""I understand what you're saying. Anyone in your position would feel the same way. We have found that _______ is a way that we can resolve this problem. What do you think about this?""

, Some customers have a difficult time making a decision to purchase a product. These customers can take up a lot of your time and keep you from helping other customers. Be patient, ask open ended questions, listen, offer alternatives, and try to guide the decision making process.Try to gather has much information as you can so that you can help the customer make a decision.
Many stores have return and/or exchange policies. If the customer was deciding between two different items, you might say, ""If you find that X does not work for you, you have 30 days to return the item."" This can encourage the customer to make a purchase.

, Some customers can be pushy and controlling. You have to balance being courteous and helpful without letting the customer walk all over you. Be professional, show the customer respect, be assertive and fair, and let the customer know what you are allowed to do to accommodate them.Be prepared for the customer to raise his or her voice or resort to name calling.
Always make eye contact with the customer, apologize when necessary, and remind the customer that his or her needs are important you. Try saying, "" Mr. X, we value you as a customer and want to work with you to figure this out. Do you have any suggestions?""
If the customer makes a doable suggestion, say ""That's a great suggestion Mr. X, and I think we are able to do that this time."" If the suggestion is something that you are not able to do, be honest with the customer. Try saying, ""Thank you for that suggestion Mr. X, but I can't do that because of our company policies. Can we try ____ instead?""
Having a good knowledge of your organization and policies can help you negotiate with this type of customer and offer viable solutions to his or her problems., These type of customers may use profanity, cut in line, or demand your attention when you are helping someone else. It is important that you remain professional and never try to even the score.If a customer interrupts you while you are already helping another customer, smile and say, ""I'll be with you as soon as I am finished with this customer.""
Always keep your cool and remember that you are a professional and represent your company.

, Some customers will start conversations with you and monopolize your time. They may want to discuss current events, the weather, or personal experiences. You want to remain polite and cordial, but still be able to control the situation. Talkative customers can take time away from your other work duties or from interacting with other customers. Show genuine interest in what the customer is saying. You do not want to come off as rude.
If the customer asks you a personal question, answer the question and then say, ""Is there anything else I can help you with today?""
Do not continue to ask the customer questions that encourage them to continue the conversation. Stick to ""yes"" or ""no"" questions.

Understand that people in Italy place high value on personal relations.,
Spend some time developing relations.,
Be open.",How to Practice Business Etiquette in Italy1," It is more likely for Italian business people to trust you if they know you personally. Whenever possible, try to let someone who knows the person introduce you as this will reduce any apprehension the other person may have about you being unknown and therefore uncertain.;
, Italians prefer face-to-face contact for doing business.If you are doing a lot of business with Italian organizations, it is advisable to actually visit Italy and develop your relations in person, so that they know who you are on that next Skype call or email.

, It helps if business contacts know something about you personally, perhaps little things about your family, your prior roles in life and what you like to do in your spare time. Knowing the personal details will increase trust and Italian business people are more likely to conduct business with you, increasing the chances of a more successful outcome.


It is highly recommended that you divide time between socializing to get to know your Italian business partners and time for the actual business meetings. Being too personal during meetings is not appropriate; however, by knowing one another well before attending the meeting, everyone will feel a lot more comfortable. As such, try to meet them for a social occasion before sitting down to negotiations; set such hospitality up yourself, including covering its costs.

Fuel your burp.,
Stand up.,
Move around.,
When you feel your burp coming, open your mouth and tilt your head back.,
As you burp, squeeze with your stomach muscles.",How to Burp1," Any good burp starts with a good meal. For huge burps, you'll need to make your stomach very active. Eat and drink your meal as quickly as possible, taking big bites - you'll swallow more air.Soda water, Coca-Cola, beer, or any other carbonated beverage with lots of fizz are great choices. The bubbles in these drinks release carbon dioxide gas. The faster you drink, the more rapidly the carbon dioxide will hit your stomach. For even better results, drink through a straw - you won't lose any carbon dioxide to the air.
If you're up for it, ""shotgun"" a beverage - that is, drink the entire thing in one gulp. See How to Shotgun a Beer for good instructions on shotgunning a drink in an aluminum can.
The gas from a huge burp will contain gas from the food you've eaten. For truly horrifying odor combinations, experiment with different foods!;
, If you can't, at least sit up. If you're not upright, the contents of your stomach won't be oriented with the your gas at the top of your stomach, so it will be less likely to be released through your throat.

, Jump up and down or do a few jumping jacks. This will agitate the gas in your stomach. If you've had any carbonated beverages, it'll make them fizz and release gas as if you're shaking a can of soda.


Be aware that exercising on a full stomach can cause nausea. Don't go too crazy with your jumping - belches are funny, but projectile vomit is not.

, Get your abdominal muscles ready - in the next step, you'll be using them. Get ready!


Keeping your mouth open does two things. First, it makes you look grosser. Second, the cavern-like acoustics of a wide open mouth will make a burp louder (see: How to Burp Loudly).

, This may take some practice. The goal is to squeeze your stomach like a bellows to force the burp out in one loud push. Use your diaphragm and abdominal muscles to firmly (but not violently) push. If done correctly, you'll get a loud ""bark."" Practice until you're comfortable with this step.


For longer burps, try to release your burp gradually, with less force. It can be challenging to strike a precise balance. Push too hard, and your burp will be too short. Push too softly, and your burp will die out.

"
"
Choose a carbonated beverage.,
Drink the beverage as fast as you can.,
Wait for 3 seconds to let the drink settle.,
Stand up or sit up straight.,
Release the burp.,
Squeeze your abdominal muscles as you burp.",How to Burp Loudly1," A freshly opened canned beverage will provide the most carbonation. To burp loudly you will want to drink the beverage as fast as possible. Choose something that you like, so you’ll want to drink fast. Be careful that it’s not too sweet, or it may upset your stomach.


Pick a drink that is cold but not so cold that it hurts to drink quickly.
Avoid drinks that have gone flat and have been open for a long time.;
, The more carbonation you are able to take in, the larger the burp you can release will be. Take large back to back gulps of the drink, and try to finish it in one attempt.


You don’t need to take large mouthfuls, smaller sips will introduce more air as you swallow.
Resist the urge to let out small burps as you drink.

, Make sure that all of the beverage is at the bottom of your stomach and the gas bubbles have had a chance to rise., Make a straight pathway from your stomach to your mouth by extending your shoulders upward and stretching your back. You want to allow the gas travel as smoothly as possible from your stomach out in order to produce the loudest burp.

, Let the accumulated gas go all at once. The sound of your burp will reflect the amount of air you are releasing from your stomach.


Open your mouth.
Squeeze your stomach muscles similar to the feeling of vomiting.
Let the air escape your stomach.

, Amplify your burp by pushing more air out faster. Use your abdominal and stomach muscles to squeeze your stomach to push out a larger volume of air.

Present a well-groomed appearance.",How to Practice Business Etiquette in Italy2," Italians judge people by their appearance and form impressions based on how well you are dressed. No amount of wishing this weren't so will change it, so make it easy on yourself by conforming; after all, good clothes will give you confidence in a business setting, so it will help you too. Make sure you are adequately dressed up for any business occasion in which you're interacting with Italians. Some basic suggestions include:


For men: wear dark colored conservative business suits.
For women: Wear conservative clothes.
Accessorize yourself. Keep this simple but elegant. One expensive piece says more about you than lots of jangling cheap baubles.
Wear perfect shoes in excellent condition. Shoes are something that will be noticed and will form part of the overall impression of you.

"
"
Build relationships by asking personal but not probing questions.,
Don't be afraid to use gestures as well as facial expressions when proving a point.",How to Practice Business Etiquette in Italy3," It is important that the questions are not too intrusive or do not make the other person uncomfortable. However, general questions about family, social events happening at the time and interest in hobbies are usually fairly safe things to get the interacting underway successfully.


Be conscious that if you ask something too intimate, it can backfire. Be prepared to apologize for crossing any line and always aim to be very careful when asking personal questions. Unfortunately, it's a fine balancing act that you'll just have to practice to get used to!

, Being loud and expressive is encouraged in Italian conversational exchanges, while at the same time being careful not to be too annoying or to seem anywhere near aggressive. Think passion and follow your heart when expressing your company or business interests!

"
"
Make appointments two to three weeks in advance.,
Be punctual.,
Have all printed material available in both English and Italian.,
Use an interpreter if you are not fluent in Italian.",How to Practice Business Etiquette in Italy4," Try to put any business appointment in writing (most preferably in Italian), so you have something to show if things don't work out according to plan. It is also helpful to confirm the meeting by a call, email or a fax––anything that results in reminding those attending the meeting that it's still happening.


Try not to schedule meetings in August unless those meeting with you make it clear they'll be available. Many businesses are closed during these period and people are on holiday; it could be awkward if someone feels compelled to fly back to Rome just to meet with you.

, Italian business, particularly in the northern regions, value the punctuality of others. Prompt attendance at a meeting also says a lot about your reliability and enthusiasm, so it's best to be five minutes early than five minutes late.


Should those you are meeting turn up late (Italian business people outside of the northern regions are less concerned with their own punctuality than perhaps with yours), do not make an issue out of it. Accept apologies and move on as if nothing untoward has happened. You can surmise whatever you want from it after the meeting but during the meeting it is best to appear unruffled and ready to make deals.

, This helps you colleagues; moreover, it also makes them appreciate your effort. It will help them to see that you are serious about doing business with them.

, This will ensure that the conversation runs more smoothly and that there are no misunderstandings. Do not rely on the ability of the other business people to speak English; that is too much of a burden for you to place upon them. It also leaves you at risk of not understanding what you really need to know.

"
"
Don't be aggravated if someone is loud during a meeting.,
Be ready for less structure than you may be used to.,
Prepare for negotiation.",How to Practice Business Etiquette in Italy5," It is simply a reflection of the accepted Italian way of discussing and sharing information, which includes speaking a lot and making a point loudly to ensure it is actually getting across.Italian business people will be loud to be heard over others and it isn't considered rude or demeaning.


Avoid seeming too reserved or detached; a lack of enthusiasm may be interpreted by any unwillingness to engage excitedly in the discussions., Italian meetings are not dominated by the agenda; indeed, there may not even be an agenda.It can feel rather chaotic to you if you're used to itemizing meetings but it works for the Italians, so you need to go with the flow.


Interruptions are normal, as is expecting anyone around the table to have a say in the meeting as they wish.
Side conversations are commonplace, so are comings and goings.

, Italian business people will negotiate price and delivery times. Make sure you are up to the task and will manage to get a good deal. As with any business, knowing what you want from the meeting before attending it, sets you in the best stead.


Most decisions will be based on how you present ideas rather than facts. Make sure that your delivery of ideas is perfect. If you need to practice this beforehand, then do so. And visual aids can also help, such as graphs, diagrams, photos, short films, etc. but don't make anything too formal, as that is not the Italian way.
Be prepared to be persuasive. Persuading and debating are art forms in Italian culture and are considered to be part of the business dealings."

Begin by filling your lungs with air.,
Close your mouth and plug your nostrils.,
Exhale into your mouth, then swallow the exhaled air with saliva.,
Repeat the exhale-swallow step several times.,
As you burp, squeeze with your stomach muscles.",How to Burp2," You don't need to take an enormous breath - simply breathe in normally. Instead of swallowing air with your food, in this method, you'll swallow air directly from your lungs.

, You want to make sure that you cannot inhale any additional air. Don't suffocate yourself - if at any point you're desperate to breathe, do it. Do you really want to be remembered as a person who passed out from trying to burp?

, This will probably require some practice. Try to swallow as if you're eating a piece of food. Feel for the mouthfuls of air traveling down your esophagus. In effect, you are transferring air from your lungs into your stomach, at which point it can escape your body through the throat as a burp.

, As you try to swallow, position the tip of tongue at the back of mouth, you will swallow greater quantity of air. Then, try to burp normally. This part can be difficult for beginners. When you're starting, it may be necessary to ""force"" your burps out. Practice your air-swallowing until you get a good feel for the technique. Soon, you'll be able to mortify your peers on command.

, This may take some practice. The goal is to squeeze your stomach like a bellows to force the burp out in one loud push. Use your diaphragm and abdominal muscles to firmly (but not violently) push. If done correctly, you'll get a loud ""bark."" Practice until you're comfortable with this step.

Eat a dainty meal.,
When you need to burp, close your mouth.,
Let the gas come out through your nose.,
Hold your hand up to your nose so that the air released dissipates against it.,
As an alternative, try burping into your closed mouth.",How to Burp3," This burping technique is used when you have to burp, but want to do it as silently as possible - a must for fancy,high-class dinners. This step is preventative - smaller amounts of food and drink mean smaller burps.


See also: How to Burp Without People Noticing.


, Even if you perform this method incorrectly, a closed mouth will muffle the sound of an otherwise loud burp.

, Burps that escape through the nose are almost completely silent. This is because they don't vibrate the upper esophageal sphincter, like a mouth burp. The sound produced will be like that of a normal exhalation through the nose, though any odor may remain.


Try to have clear sinuses beforehand - otherwise, your burp will have nowhere to go.

, Doing this will help your burp be as subtle as possible— unless the scent causes you pass out.

, Covering your mouth with your hands or a closed fist will further muffle any sound from the burp. When you've made your burp, open your mouth to allow the gas to dissipate.


Pretending to yawn can be a great excuse to open your mouth. Just make sure you don't have any extra burps before you do it!

Imagine you have a large bite of food in your mouth.,
Contract your throat like you are swallowing.,
Swallow several gulps of air.,
Contract your stomach to combine the air bubbles.,
Open your mouth to release the burp.,
Force the burp out of your stomach.",How to Burp Loudly2," To swallow air, you need to go through the motions of swallowing without food. Think of the feeling of having a mouthful of food.

, Go through the motions of swallowing without food in your mouth. Each swallow will draw more air into your mouth.Pull the air in your mouth to the back of your throat.
Swallow a gulp of air.

, Repeat the process of swallowing air several times to build up a bubble in your stomach. The more air you are able to get into your stomach, the larger and louder your burp will be., Squeeze your abdominal muscles to push all the air together in your stomach.


Prepare for the upcoming burp by pushing all the air into one bubble.
Hold the burp in for a moment to build up pressure.

, Give the air a way to escape your stomach by opening your mouth. An open mouth allows the air to resonate and creates a louder sound.

, Wretch your stomach and diaphragm muscles to squeeze the air out of your stomach and force the burp to emerge. Keep your throat and mouth open to allow as much air to escape as possible.


A longer burp will generate louder sounds.
Contract your diaphragm muscles towards the end of your burp to squeeze any remaining air out.
Keep your mouth open during the burp so the sound is not muffled.

Figure out the underlying cause.,
Determine how much you want to risk in the relationship.,
Decide what you want from the argument.,
Check your facts before jumping into the argument.,
Listen to what they have to say.,
Ask questions to get a better understanding.,
Agree, and then provide your counter point of view.,
Make your argument non-threatening.,
Move the conversation away from direct confrontations.,
Don't escalate.,
Uncross your arms.,
Open your mind to their side.,
Know when--and how!--to walk away.",How to Argue With Someone Who Thinks They Are Always Right," Know-it-alls generally fall in one of two categories (or a combination of the two). Some know-it-alls have a deep sense of insecurity, and they try to cover it up by knowing as much as they can. Others actually do think they know it all, so they feel compelled to offer their knowledge to others. Knowing where the person's argumentativeness stems from can help you better deal with situation.When an insecure know-it-all is told they are wrong about something, it plays into their insecurity, and their defenses go up. Try leading questions instead, which work well with this type of person.
With the second type of know-it-alls, it's often best to let them have their say, and then try to offer up another opinion.;
, Before diving into an argument with a know-it-all, it's important to think about what you're willing to lose. That is, think about how important the relationship is to you and how important the argument is to you. No matter how careful you are, engaging in an argument can damage a relationship.For instance, if your boss is a know-it-all, it may be best just to let them think what they're going to think most of the time, so you don't put your job in jeopardy.
If the person is someone you're close to, such as a partner or close friend, decide if the argument is really worth the potential hurt.

, In any argument, you should have an ultimate goal. Maybe you just want them to see your side, or maybe you want them to acknowledge your hurt feelings. Whatever it is, you need to know what it is before you jump into the argument., If the argument is about something that is fact-based, always check your facts first. If you can, bring evidence to the conversation to back up your side. However, when researching, make sure to stick to unbiased sources, instead of ones that just tell you what you want to hear., Even if the person always thinks they're right, they still deserve to be heard, just like you deserve to be heard. Listen to their point of view first, taking the time to really hear what they're saying.To show you're listening, you can nod along to the conversation, and provide short summaries, such as ""So what I hear you saying is... ""

, The person may not be particularly forthcoming about what's going underneath the surface. Plus, asking questions can help you understand exactly what they're talking about when it comes to the subject and how they feel on the topic.Even simple questions, such as ""Why?"" or ""How come you think that?,"" can help you figure out what's under the surface.

, One way to argue with someone who thinks they know everything is to first side with them, or at least admit you understand their side. After you agree, you can present a counterargument.For instance, you might say, ""I understand what you're saying. It's an interesting point, but here's what I think...""
You could also say something like, ""Thanks for helping me understand your side. I can see where you're coming from. My point of view is a bit different...""

, If you say your points in a threatening way, the other person will likely shut down. However, if you present your side by couching it in less threatening language, the other person is more likely to listen.For example, instead of saying, ""I am definitely right,"" you could say, ""Well, what I've read is this... ""
Instead of saying, ""Here's the right point of view...,"" you might say, ""Maybe there's another side to the story...""

, Sometimes, when you confront a person with direct advice in an argument, they just shut down and don't listen, just like when you make an argument in a threatening way. In this case, you may be offering advice or a solution, only the person can't hear what you're saying.You may find that asking a person leading questions is a better way to get them thinking in a different direction than a direct confrontation.
For instance, you might say, ""Oh, what makes you think that?"" instead of ""That sounds wrong to me.""
Instead of ""That's not right at all,"" you could say, ""Have you ever thought about...?""

, It can be tempting in any argument to escalate. Emotions get in the way, and you both get angry. You let your tempers get the best of you, and the argument devolves into throwing insults back and forth or yelling at each other. Escalation is a particular problem when arguing with a know-it-all because it's likely to get on your last nerve. However, if you're going to get anywhere, you have to keep your head.If you feel yourself getting heated, take a moment to take a deep breath. It's even a good idea to ask to come back to the discussion later, so you can continue when you're both calm and collected.

, Your body language says as much about what you're feeling as what you're saying. If your body language says your closed off to discussion, the person you're talking with isn't going to feel as comfortable engaging with you.Uncross your arms and legs, and face the person with your body. Also, be sure to make eye contact, so the person knows you're listening.

, That is, even know-it-alls have to be right sometimes. When you're engaging in an argument, you have to be willing to admit you're wrong sometimes. Otherwise, the argument won't get anywhere., Sometimes, you'll realize that no one is going to ""win"" the argument. At that point, it's best to just end it. However, you still want to appear non-threatening, or else the other person will still want to keep arguing.You could end with, ""Well, I can see we're not getting anywhere. I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.""
You could also say, ""I'm sorry to see we're not getting any closer to agreeing on this subject. Maybe we can try again some other time.""

Clean out your nose.,
Address your allergies.,
Eliminate nose hair.",How to Stop Picking Your Nose1," Regularly blow your nose to remove mucus and debris. This will minimize the urge to pick debris out of your nose. You can also use water or saline solutions to clean your nose. These often come in the form of nasal sprays., If you have any allergies, you will need to take care of them. Talk to your doctor about a daily allergy medication for ongoing allergies. For a single exposure to an allergen (like your mom’s cat), take an over the counter antihistamine.Even for over the counter medications, consult your doctor ahead of time.

, Excessive nose hair will trap debris in the air. Things like dust and pollen can get tangled in the hairs and leave you feeling like your nose needs cleared out. This leads to an urge to pick your nose. Use a nose hair trimmer to keep your nose hair trimmed."
"
Keep your hands busy.,
Wear gloves.,
Track triggers.,
Reward yourself for a job well done.,
Be patient.",How to Stop Picking Your Nose2," If your hands are busy, then picking your nose is more difficult. You are less likely to automatically pick your nose if you have something else to do with your hands. Write things down, doodle on a piece of paper, or just keep something to fidget with to keep your hands busy., Wearing gloves makes it difficult to pick your nose. Before picking, you would have to take the gloves off, and this provides a barrier that stops you from unconsciously doing it. You can even wear stylish gloves that match a coat or outfit to keep your nose picking habit under the radar., Nose picking is often done in response to anxiety or some other emotion. These emotions can be triggered by your environment. Pay attention to when and where you have an urge to pick your nose. If you notice any patterns, try to avoid those triggers.For example, you might pick your nose when you are impatiently standing in a long line. If this is the case, try to avoid the lines or bring something else to do with your hands.

, When you can resist the urge to pick your nose, reward yourself. Set up a reward system that gives you rewards for going an entire day, week, or longer without picking your nose. When you succeed, treat yourself to the reward., Changing any behavior takes time and effort. You are likely to make mistakes along the way. Forgive yourself and move forward. With time, you will be able to stop picking your nose."

Make them wash their hands every time they pick their nose.,
Occupy their fingers.,
See a doctor.,
Ignore it.",How to Stop Picking Your Nose3," In addition to being sanitary, this technique will serve as a nose picking deterrent. If your child is constantly having to stop their play to wash their hands, it will make them think twice about picking their nose. That said, you have to be consistent, even in public., Children will often pick their nose out of boredom. Make sure that they have an activity to do with their hands. Coloring and drawing are always good fall back activities. You can also keep a toy handy for them to fidget with any time they have to sit still. This will keep their hands occupied and away from their nose., There could be an underlying medical cause for your child’s nose picking. Take them to their pediatrician to discuss things such as allergies and dehydration. If the pediatrician sees any signs of such issues, they can advise you on how to deal with the problems., Sometimes kids do things just for attention. If the pediatrician is not concerned about the nose picking and nothing seems to work, just ignore it. Over time, most children will lose interest in picking their nose and stop naturally once the attention is removed from it."
"
Confide in a trusted friend or family member.,
Make a counseling appointment.,
Go see your doctor.",How to Stop Picking Your Nose4," Telling someone you trust about your problem can help hold you accountable. If someone else knows that you are trying to stop, they can ask you about it and you will have to face whether you have stopped or not. This person can also weigh in on whether the problem is severe, or just a minor issue., If you feel that there is an underlying emotional or psychological cause for picking your nose, you will need to see a mental health professional. You can get a referral from your doctor, or in some cases just make a counseling appointment. Discuss the nose picking with the professional and develop a treatment plan., Picking your nose can sometimes lead to medical issues. If this happens, you will need to see your doctor immediately. Make an appointment to have your nose examined, and your doctor will prescribe the appropriate treatment.For example, you could have scratches or openings in your nose from picking that get infected with bacteria.

Extract yourself.,
Sit away from classmates if possible.,
Wait for the right moment.,
Have plenty of tissue at hand.,
Wash your hands after blowing.",How to Blow Your Nose in Class1," If possible, excuse yourself to go outside or to the restroom. Physically removing yourself from the presence of other people not only saves you embarrassment, but can help keep everyone else healthy, particularly if you have a cold or sinus infection.


Anyone within three feet of you can be affected by the germs spread by sneezing or blowing your nose. Classrooms are full of people in close proximity, so for your sake and everyone else’s it’s best to step outside.
Let the teacher know if you’re needing to blow your nose or sneeze frequently on a particular day, or if you’re experiencing a chronic issue. That way they will know that you may need to excuse yourself intermittently, and won’t think you’re trying to be disruptive or to get out of class.;
, If you’re having a particularly sneezy day, try to lessen the effect of your sneezes by sitting at the back of the class (or at least positioning yourself out of range of your crush).

, When the class is listening attentively to an important announcement might not be the best time to let loose a loud honk. Wait till everyone is talking and you can discreetly turn and blow your nose with minimal disruption.

, You can muffle your sneezes if you have a good handful of tissue. The more material mucus has to go into, the less your classmates are likely to see or feel it- and the less likely you are to experience the embarrassment of flinging a glob of snot at a cute boy or girl.


Avoid using cloth handkerchiefs; not only do they trap mucus that then stays in your pocket, turning your pockets into a breeding ground for germs and infectious bacteria, they are actually frowned on culturally in some parts of the world. Dispose properly of your tissues. Put each tissue you use directly into the wastebasket-no one wants to see a pile of used tissues on your desk.

, When you’re in class, it’s not always possible to immediately wash your hands, but do so at the earliest opportunity to help prevent the spread of germs. You can also carry sanitized hand wipes or a small bottle of hand sanitizer with you.

"
"
Blow consciously (and conscientiously).,
Blow “correctly”.,
Blow light, more often.",How to Blow Your Nose in Class2," You shouldn’t be afraid to blow your nose in class if you do it in a considerate manner. Every single human being blows their nose, and guess what? You shouldn’t be embarrassed to do it too.


Be sure to turn away from others when you blow. Facing a direction other than at someone else is a fundamental rule to remember when blowing your nose in the presence of others.

, Blowing your nose overly hard not only makes it louder and therefore more embarrassing, it can also have detrimental effects, especially if you have a cold or excessive bacteria in your nasal passages. Don’t blow too hard. Blowing too hard can cause excessive pressure which may force mucus back into your sinuses and ear canals.
Instead of blowing through both nostrils, place a finger over your tissue and one nostril and close it off, blowing through the other nostril, then switching nostrils.

, Instead of trying to clear all of the mucus from your nasal passages at once, blow your nose with more frequency and less force-this will also keep the noise to a minimum.


When you have a cold or runny nose, the mucus will continue to develop, so you won’t be able to simply clear it all at once.
Avoid “honking”- remember, blowing with excessive force can actually prolong the symptoms and in the long run cause you to need to blow your nose more rather than less. "

Use medications.,
Eat local honey.,
Be aware of lifestyle choices.",How to Blow Your Nose in Class3," Taking allergy pills, sprays, drops, and shots are preventative measures that millions of people in the U.S. engage in. Fifty-five percent of Americans test positive for sensitivity to one or more allergens, so that’s no surprise. As with any medication, using allergy drugs wisely is crucial to maintaining a healthy benefit.


Do not use medications in excess. Drugs should always be used as a temporary solution. Chronic overuse of drugs can lead to dependence and can harm your health. Allergy medications are available in various forms, such as pills, drops, sprays, creams, and injections. Some are over the counter, some are available only as prescriptions.
See your doctor to find out which allergy drugs may be right for you.
Use antihistamines and decongestants carefully for temporary relief of runny nose and sneezing. Many of these can cause drowsiness and lethargy, possibly impairing motor skills, and if used excessively may cause organ damage. , Consuming local honey, especially raw, has been an anecdotal remedy for years, which many swear by. While there is no clinical evidence that honey reduces allergies, there is some possibility that it may help. Local honey can contain traces of local pollens, which can be allergens- and one way of treating allergies is repeated exposure to small doses of allergens.
Eating local honey may also be beneficial for immune systems.
Honey has been studied for possible cough-suppressing qualities.
Never feed honey to children of less than one year- they may be at risk from botulism, which can be found in honey. , Sometimes allergies and runny noses can be avoided, or at least the risk somewhat mitigated, by making wise decisions in your day to day life.


Don’t smoke. Smoking can exacerbate symptoms of allergies. Stay away from classmates who smoke- their secondhand smoke and even the odor on their clothes while in class may trigger nasal allergies.
Get plenty of exercise. Exercising won’t directly relieve your nasal congestion, but will help you feel your best, and may help your immune system retaliate against allergies, lessening the need to honk in class. "

Create a buffer between yourself and others.,
Listen to your iPod.,
Stop talking.,
Wait until you’re alone.,
Plan ahead.,
Flush the toilet.",How to Be Comfortable Urinating in Front of People1," If you’re uncomfortable peeing in public one easy way to at least trick yourself into believing you’re alone is to keep an empty stall or urinal between yourself and any other bathroom users.If you’re uncomfortable peeing in front of your partner, this may simply mean that you close the door while your in the bathroom, or wait until your partner is in another part of your home.;
, Sometimes the thing that bothers people most is the sound of peeing. But if you aren’t able to hear your own peeing, you might not be so embarrassed. When in a public washroom, put your headphones on and listen to some music. Turn it up loud enough so you can’t hear anything else going on in the washroom.Consider putting a radio or Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom at home. Make it a habit of turning it on whenever you go into the bathroom. The music will help distract you from the sound of your peeing and possibly prevent your partner from hearing it.

, When some people walk into a public washroom they sometimes continue to have conversations. This tends to continue more often when men pee at urinals. If you’d prefer to do your business in private, use a stall instead of a urinal.The opposite might be possible if you’re at home with your partner. Continuing your conversation while you go to the bathroom might make the whole process seem for comfortable and ‘normal’.

, If you’re at work or a restaurant and can wait to go to the washroom, watch the bathroom door until you’re certain no one is in there and then go to the washroom. Even if it’s a public washroom you might feel more comfortable if no one else is in there. If necessary, walk out of the washroom and come back later if it’s occupied.If you don’t want to wait and come back later, take your time adjusting your clothes or make-up in the mirror, or washing your hands, until the washroom is empty.

, Many large event locations (e.g. arenas, stadiums, conference centres, malls, etc.) have maps of their buildings online that include the location of the washrooms. And some cities even have maps of all public washrooms available in city buildings, parks, etc. Before going out, research where the public washrooms are so you can be proactive about using them rather than waiting for it to be an emergency.You can also keep track of the public washrooms you use and always go back to your favourites. Some washrooms that are easier to use are those that have partitions all the way to the floor, or are single person washrooms.

, While not the most environmentally-friendly option, if you’re nervous about the sound of your peeing in a public washroom, flush the toilet while you’re going. The sound of the flush will usually drown out the sound of the peeing.Alternatively, wait until someone else has flushed a toilet or is running a tap to wash their hands.

Have a little snack.,
Drink some water.,
Don't overdo it on fluids.",How to Avoid Embarrassing Gut Noises1," In the short-term, one of the best things you can do to stop the gut-grumbling is to have a small snack. Sometimes, you gut will make noises because you are hungry.


It may seem odd, but your gut is actually most active when it's empty! Food in your system slows the normal movement of your gut, which can cut down on the symphony of gurgles.Avoid going into a meeting, an exam, or a big date on an empty stomach. This may cut down on embarrassing noises.;
, Clean water can also help cut down on the gurgling, if you drink it in moderation.Pair your snack with a small glass of water for best results.


Ideally, the water should be filtered, distilled, boiled, or otherwise purified. Some tap water contains chlorine and/or bacteria that can irritate a sensitive gut.

, On the flip side, don't drink too much water, or any other liquid. This also can produce gurgling sounds as the water moves through your system.This can be especially problematic if you have to be very active. A stomach full of water can make some pretty noisy sounds if you have to move around much.

"
Don't react to it.,
Go about your business.,
Cast aspersions.,
Blame the dog.",How to Act Like You Didn't Fart1," This is rule number 1. The surest way to let everyone know it was you is to immediately look worried or ashamed. If you're around others and one gets loose, don't overreact—in fact, don't react at all. This is the opposite of what most people do when they accidentally leak one, so a strong display of ignorance will point people's suspicions another way.


If the fart is too loud or smells too bad to realistically ignore, you may have to orchestrate an escape plan. Look perplexed, create a distraction and get out of there.;
, Not only should you not look embarrassed if you accidentally fart, you should carry on with whatever activity you were seeing to as though nothing happened. If you don't actively ""pause"" the moment by showing surprise, others may not notice at all, and if they do, they'll probably have the dignity not to question who the culprit was.It's not uncommon to detect strange noises without knowing the source, and there will be no reason for anyone to assume that the sound they heard was a fart, or that it came from you in particular.

, Maybe you've successfully stifled a violent eruption, but the stench is starting to creep in: what now? Don't quietly accept the blame. Look around and feign disgust or confusion to let everyone know it could have been any one of them. Most people will be too concerned about others thinking they did it to be motivated to get to the bottom of things.


Be sure not to directly accuse a particular person of the indiscretion. Since you're trying to sidestep embarrassment yourself, pinning it on someone else is a dishonorable move.
Some light laughter can help alleviate the awkwardness of the situation whether others suspect it was you or not.

, If it isn't broken, why fix it? Just blame the dog, if there happens to be one around, for an especially offensive intestinal assault. The dog won't mind. They're used to being guilty of this kind of thing. Babies also make sterling scapegoats for the more experienced fart-hider—some might even find it cute if they think it was the innocent, artless newborn, never knowing that it was actually you, praying that you don't need a diaper change of your own.You'll need to stick pretty close to the dog if you want this tactic to be convincing. People will eventually catch on if they keep getting musky whiffs while Fido is all the way across the living room.

Eat fewer carbohydrates.,
To reduce the smell, eat fewer animal products.,
Know what foods your body is sensitive to.,
Puree your veggies and soak your beans.,
Eat more fennel.,
Chew your food.,
Don’t swallow air.,
Don’t eat too much in one sitting.,
Exercise more.,
Turn to anti-flatulence medications, like Beano.,
Use charcoal tablets or products like Mylanta.,
Experiment with alternative medicine, too.",How to Stop Flatulence," Carbohydrates produce more gas than protein or fat because sugar and starch ferment the easiest. About half of all people have bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract that love feeding off of undigested carbs, producing gas.One of the worst foods with the most indigestible carbs? Beans. No surprises there!
Fewer carbohydrates often means fewer breads and sweets, which is a healthy part of any diet plan.;
, Though they don’t fart any less, vegetarians tend to produce better-smelling flatus (the technical term for farts) than their omnivorous friends. That’s because meat contains more hydrogen sulfides, which break down nutrients and omit an odor in the gas.This goes for everything vegetarians eat but lonely cauliflower, which can make you quite stinky.

, Discover (mostly through trial and error, unfortunately) which foods cause problems and should be limited for ‘’your’’ body, as everyone is different. What makes your body tick may not even be a blip on the radar for someone else. That being said, there are some foods which are known culprits to many of us:


Apples, apricots, peaches, pears, raisins, prunes
Beans, soybeans, popcorn, nuts
Bran
Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, eggplant, onion
Dairy products
Tuna

, Galacto-oligosachharides (GOS) are essentially indigestible carbs and beans and legumes (like chickpeas and lentils) are full of them. The more GOS in your food, the more likely you’ll experience flatulence. However, GOS is water-soluble. If you soak your beans before cooking, up to 25% of the GOS can disappear. A similar thing can be said for vegetables. However, GOS levels can be got around by pureeing. It increases the surface area of food particles, in turn increasing contact with digestive enzymes, making the food more readily absorbed. As a result, there's less residue in your colon to feed your gut bacteria – and therefore less flatulence on your end.

, Fennel seeds are a natural flatulence-fighter used in South Asia for centuries – if you see a bowl of seeds at your favorite Indian restaurant, that’s fennel. Just a pinch after a meal or brewed into a tea can help prevent oncoming flatulence.Fennel seeds can be a topper to any salad. You can also use the rest of the plant for just about anything!

, Chewing your food thoroughly (at least 20 times a bite) can help reduce the amount of air you swallow and reduce the amount of food you eat overall – both being factors that can lead to flatulence.


Take your time. When you eat more slowly, you enjoy every bite more, and you give your body time to register that it’s full. In other words, it's good for weight and gas reduction.

, Sometimes flatulence has nothing to do with the food we eat, but ‘’how’’ we eat it. And in some cases, it has nothing to do with food at all. It could be just from air bubbles getting stuck in your GI tract, from poor swallowing habits. Here’s a few tips to keep in mind:


Don’t use a straw. Sipping through a straw allows you to gulp air without realizing it. You are inevitably taking in the air that rests in the top of the straw with each drink.
Don’t chew gum. Chewing gum gets our mouths open and active, resulting in incidental swallowing of air.
Don’t smoke. When you inhale smoke, you inhale air, too.

, Simply put, the more food you intake, the more gas your body has to produce. With less food in your stomach, there will naturally be less gas. Keeping the food in your stomach to a minimum keeps everything else to a minimum, too.


This goes double for foods that are on the trigger-list and foods that are spicy or produce other gastrointestinal issues, like heartburn or upset stomach.

, Exercising can be helpful in two ways: it regulates your everyday process of digestion, but it can also mix things up if you’re feeling a bit under the weather. So keep a regular exercise routine, but the next time you’re feeling bloated or gassy, go for a walk, too – you’ll likely feel better shortly.


Any type of moment is good when you have stomach issues – it gets things moving and out of your system. You'll probably notice that starting up a regular exercise routine keeps your more regular, too.

, Over-the-counter digestive aids, such as those found in Beano, taken before a meal may help your stomach digest many foods without the flatulence associated with them. Beano is available at most pharmacies and grocery stores.


For the record, not everyone has success with these products. In a recent study, participants had to take eight Beano tablets to experience any significant relief.

, Maalox and Mylanta are two products that contain simethicone, a medicine that dissolves gas bubbles. These are for gas relief after the meal or at any time you find you need them. Extreme cases that do not react appropriately to over-the-counter medications should be discussed with your doctor.


Charcoal tablets (Charcoal Caps) are similar in that they absorb sulfuric gases in your GI tract. However, the science behind these products is not definitive.

, Chamomile, peppermint, sage, marjoram, and other herbs can alleviate flatulence. After a particularly risky meal, brew yourself a cup of tea with one or more of these herbs to calm your digestive system.


Try this method combined with others – the noted effect of these herbs isn't strong enough when used alone to produce any significant improvement. Look into dietary changes, too.

Determine if you have paruresis.,
Know that paruresis is not a physical problem.,
Make an appointment with your family doctor.,
Use medical-based solutions from your doctor.",How to Be Comfortable Urinating in Front of People2," Individuals with paruresis tend to have shy personalities and are sensitive and fearful of being judged and criticized by others. Those with severe cases of paruresis may have one or more of the following symptoms:Needing to have complete privacy when going to the bathroom.
Being fearful that other people may hear the sound of urine hitting the water in the toilet.
Being fearful that other people may be able to smell the urine.
Having negative thoughts while attempting to pee (e.g. I’m such a moron, I’m never going to be able to go pee here.).
Not being able to pee in public washrooms, washrooms at other people’s homes or washrooms at work.
Not being able to pee at home if someone else is visiting or waiting outside the bathroom.
Being anxious at the thought of having to go to the bathroom.
Not wanting to drink too much liquid for fear they’ll have to use the bathroom.
Avoiding travel and events outside the home in case they have to use the bathroom.

, The inability to pee in front of other people or when other people are around, is not a physical problem. There is nothing wrong with your kidneys, bladder or urinary tract. Unfortunately paruresis is caused by anxiety which tenses the muscles of the body, including the ‘urinary sphincter’ which prevents urine from being able to exit the body.The problem can enter a vicious circle as the fact that you are not able to pee then makes you more anxious, which makes it harder to pee, and so on.
It is possible that one specific event in your past caused the problem.

, While paruresis is not a physical problem, you may have physical problems that are making it worse. In order to ensure you don’t have any of these other physical problems, it’s best to talk to your doctor and have those other problems investigated.An example of a physical problem that may make your paruresis is prostatitis, which can affect men.

, While paruresis is not a physical problem, there are some medical options your doctor may suggest. Your doctor may prescribe anti-anxiety medications, anti-depressants or tranquilizers to help eliminate or reduce the anxiety you feel when trying to pee when others are around.Note that these drugs are not a cure for paruresis, so it is still helpful to obtain other types of help to eliminate the problem completely so you can eventually stop taking these medications.
In very severe cases your doctor may suggest self-catheterization. This is where a catheter (a very slender tube) is inserted into the urethra and into the bladder. Urine can then drain from the bladder without the need to relax the urinary sphincter.

, Cognitive behaviour therapy is therapy completed with a psychologist that helps you alter how you think and feel about urination and public washrooms., Because one of the anxieties associated with paruresis is the noise urine makes when it hits the toilet and/or water, one possible method to help overcome the anxiety is to create other sounds in the bathroom while you’re trying to pee. You can do this by turning on a faucet, flushing the toilet, listening to music, or whatever else might work for you."

Enlist the help of a psychologist.,
Create a list of bathrooms from easiest to hardest.,

Make noise while your pee.,
Select the next bathroom location on your list.,
Drink lots of water before each session.",How to Be Comfortable Urinating in Front of People4," While you could probably carry out these instructions on your own, it is also helpful to have a psychologist help you through the process. They’ll be able to help you plan the therapy, pick a partner that can help you and discuss the outcomes of each try., To start your therapy, you need to make a list of a variety of bathroom locations. These locations need to be everything from very easy to very hard locations for you to go pee. In addition to making the list, rank the locations from easiest to hardest., Because the main problem with paruresis is peeing in front of other people, you will need to enlist the help of a trusted family member or friend to help you overcome the problem., You most likely consider your home bathroom your easiest location to pee. Since you’re comfortable with this bathroom, the only thing to be added is another human being — your ‘pee partner.'Start by going pee in your home bathroom with your pee partner somewhat nearby. Pee for only a few seconds and then stop.
Wait a few minutes and go back to the bathroom. This time have your pee partner move a little closer to you. Again, pee for a few seconds and then stop.
Continue this process with your pee partner moving closer and closer to you.
This process may take several sessions before you’re comfortable peeing in front of your pee partner.

, Throughout the process of peeing in your own home with your pee partner, purposely make noise while you’re peeing. The types of noises you want to make are the types that embarrass you when you’re in a public bathroom. For example, if you don’t like to hear the sound of your pee hitting the side of the toilet or the water, purposely make these types of noises while you pee.By purposely making these noises you’ll start to get use to them and they’ll become less embarrassing. You’re essentially trying to desensitize yourself from these noises so you don’t think about them when you’re peeing.

, Once you’re comfortable peeing at home with your pee partner and with making a lot of noise, it’s time to move to the next place on your list. The next bathroom on your list might be a quiet public washroom, or maybe the bathroom at a friend’s house.Repeat the same process you used at home with your pee partner. Start by having them stand outside the door to the washroom and move gradually closer to where the toilet is.
Once you become comfortable with a specific location on your list, move to the next location and repeat the process.
Eventually you’ll reach the hardest location on your list and you’ll find you’re able to pee in a crowded, noisy public washroom.
You may need to have a practice session 3-4 times a week in order to make the process effective. You should see excellent improvement after 12 sessions if you are consistent.

, In order to make each practice session more realistic, and to ensure you actually have to go to the bathroom, drink enough liquids so your bladder is full. Do this on purpose before each practice session with your pee partner."

Practice holding your breath at home.,
Start somewhere you feel comfortable.,
Practice.",How to Be Comfortable Urinating in Front of People5," The breath-holding technique temporarily increases the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood which is suppose to help with relaxation and reduce anxiety. Before using this technique while peeing, practice holding your breath.Start by holding your breath for 10 seconds and seeing how you feel.
Increase the length you hold your breath by 5-10 seconds at a time. Always stop and assess how you’ve reacted to holding your breath. If you don’t feel well after holding your breath — stop — this technique may not be right for you.
Try holding your breath in different locations so you get use to the technique.
Once you can hold your breath for 45 seconds, try using the technique in a real bathroom situation.

, This comfortable bathroom might be at home or in an empty public bathroom.Stand or sit in the bathroom as you want and breathe normally.
On one of your exhales, stop exhaling about 75% of the way through so you do not empty your lungs.
Hold your breath for 45 seconds. Hold your nose closed if you have to.
After 45 seconds you should be able to start peeing.
You may need to perform the exhale technique a second time if you stop peeing midstream.

, This technique only works if you continue to practice in various situations and locations. You may find yourself altering the technique slightly so that it works personally for you — for example, you might decide to start holding your breath as you walk into the bathroom. "

Cut back on caffeine and alcohol.,
Cut back on dairy and/or gluten.,
Try peppermint.",How to Avoid Embarrassing Gut Noises2," A gut that never makes noises can be a sign of an unhealthy digestive tract, but so too can an overly noisy intestine. One way to keep your internal ecosystem healthy is to eat probiotic foods that encourage the growth of healthy bacteria in your system.Good choices for probiotic foods include sauerkraut, natural pickles, kombucha, yogurt, unpasteurized cheese, kefir, miso, and kimchi.Having healthy bacteria in your intestines aids digestion, which can cut down on noises that may come from an unhealthy gut.

, Eating too much at a time puts strain on your digestive system that isn't good for your health and can increase the occurrence of unpleasant noises.Instead of eating big meals, try eating several smaller meals throughout the day. This will keep your stomach from going empty, while also giving your system adequate time to digest.

, Fiber helps keep the food you eat moving through the system in a regular, healthy way.


Fiber is good for your digestive system, and actually has healthy, cleaning effect. Beware, however — too much fiber can create gas and contribute to gut noises.Women need 25 grams of fiber per day. Men need 38. Most Americans only eat 15. Whole grains and leafy greens (as well as many other vegetables) are great sources of fiber., Caffeine can upset your gut by increasing acidity and increase embarrassing noises.Alcohol and other chemicals (including those found in some medications) may further exacerbate the problem.


In particular, avoid drinking coffee on an empty stomach. The combination of all that fluid and the potential irritation caused by the caffeine and acidity can lead to a chorus of gurgles and groans.

, Sometimes, an unhealthy (and noisy) gut can be a sign that you have a food intolerance, which may be irritating your stomach and intestines.An intolerance to dairy or gluten (wheat), in particular, is a common problem that can lead to gut noises.Avoid foods containing dairy or gluten for a week or two and see if you notice any improvement. If so, you may have an intolerance. Consider seeing a doctor for formal diagnosis.
Try cutting back on one, then the other, and see if either one has a positive effect. Or you can try cutting both out of your diet and then, after a week or two, reintroduce dairy and notice any changes. After a week, try reintroducing gluten and see what happens.

, Peppermint can have a soothing effect on an irritated gut. Try drinking peppermint tea.For stronger treatment, you can try Colpermin or Mintec. These are natural products that mix peppermint and other soothing ingredients, which some people have found helpful."

Eat slowly.,
Spit out your gum.,
Avoid bubbles.,
Lay off the carbs and fat.,
Don't smoke.,
Consider medication.",How to Avoid Embarrassing Gut Noises3," Many gut noises don't result from intestinal conditions but instead arise from having too much gas or air in the digestive system. This is a problem that is relatively easy to correct. One simple solution is to slow down your eating.When you eat too quickly, you swallow a lot of air. This results in bubbles that create embarrassing gut noises as they move around your digestive system.

, Chewing gum has a similar effect to eating too quickly. It makes you swallow air as you chew it. If you're having gut noises, spit out the gum., Bubbly beverages like soda, beer, and and carbonated water can also lead to gurgling sounds in your gut.These drinks are pumped full of gas, which then makes its way into your digestive system.

, Carbohydrates and especially refined sugars can produce a lot of gas when digested. Steer clear of sugary and starchy foods, as well as excess fat.Even otherwise healthy foods such as fruit juices (especially apple and pear) can produce this effect due to their high sugar content.
Fat does not cause gas on it's own, but can lead to bloating, which can place pressure on your intestines and worsen the problem.

, Everyone knows smoking is bad for you, but you may not have known it can lead to embarrassing gut noises. Smoking, like gum chewing or eating too fast, can also result in the swallowing of air.If you smoke, consider quitting. If you can't or don't want to quit, at least avoid smoking before any situation in which gut noises might cause you embarrassment.

, If you suffer from frequent gas problems, you may want to consider a medication that targets this problem.A number of pills are available that can help your body digest the foods that cause gas. You can find these at any drug store. Talk to your doctor or a pharmacist for recommendations.

Get enough sleep.,
Relax.,
Loosen your belt.,
Brush your teeth more often.,
See a doctor.",How to Avoid Embarrassing Gut Noises4," Your gut needs rest, just like the rest of your body. Get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Otherwise, your gut's ability to function normally can be temporarily weakened.Additionally, many people have a tendency to overeat if they don't get enough sleep. This, too, creates strain on the gut and a potential for more noise.

, Anyone who has given a public talk or gone on an important date can tell you that stress and anxiety can affect the gut. This increases stomach acid, gas, and gurgling.Do what you can to reduce stress. Take deep breaths and get enough exercise. Consider meditation.

, Wearing clothes that are too tight can obstruct your gut, hindering healthy digestion. This isn't a positive thing under any circumstances, but if you are concerned about gut noises, it definitely may be contributing to the problem.A tight belt or clothing slows the digestion of carbohydrates, contributing to gas.

, Good oral hygiene can reduce stomach noises by limiting the introduction of unhealthy bacteria through the mouth., If you have ongoing problems with gut noises, especially if they are accompanied by discomfort or diarrhea, see a doctor. This can be a sign of more serious health problems.Ongoing gut problems can be a sign of irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease, among other problems.

Understand that these noises are common.,
Know that it's okay to feel embarrassed.,
Learn to deflect.,
Move on.",How to Avoid Embarrassing Gut Noises5," Sometimes, even if you do everything physically possible to avoid an embarrassing bodily function or gut sound, it cannot be avoided. The good news is that these noises and functions are common — they happen to absolutely everyone. So, while you may want to melt into the floor when your stomach makes a weird sound during your presentation, it may help to remind yourself that embarrassment (and gut noises) are universally experienced, and not something you need to obsess over.


Because the sounds our body makes are, ultimately, not totally under our control, try not to worry about it too much. If you'd like to minimize these noises, you can try the diet and lifestyle changes suggested in this article; but, unless it's indicating a more serious health problem, try not to worry about it too much.
It is unlikely, too that anyone else is making as big of a deal out of your embarrassment as you are — it's possible, even, that no one else heard your stomach rumble. You may be experiencing the ""spotlight effect,"" which is when you believe people are more focused on you and your actions than they really are., Everyone feels embarrassed at some point in his life — it's part of being human. And, believe it or not, embarrassment can actually be a positive thing. Research has found that people who display embarrassment are more likely to be kind and generous to others. In addition, a person who reveals his embarrassment is considered more likable and trustworthy by others., Maybe you know everyone heard the embarrassing gut noise because they responded with laughter, or a comment like ""What was that?"". There are many ways you can deal with the embarrassment in the moment (and some may be involuntary, such as blushing). One good tactic is to acknowledge what happened, then laugh it off or minimize it, and move on.You could say something like, ""Woah, sorry about that!"" or even, ""Well, that was embarrassing. Anyway..."" Even if you want to run out of the room and hide, try just owning what happened and acting like it's no big deal.
Take a deep breath if you need to get control of your emotions. Remember not to take yourself or the situation too seriously.

, Sometimes, people will dwell on an embarrassing moment weeks, months, even years or decades after the incident. But once the moment has passed, that's it — it's part of the past, and you need to keep moving forward and living. Reliving the experience doesn't change anything and neither does punishing yourself — especially because gut noises really aren't something you can even control!If your stomach is noisy and you're afraid of being embarrassed by the sounds again and again in the future, you can do some work to prepare yourself for these moments, such as visualizing how you might react in the moment should it happen again. This way, you've already practiced what to do, and it will likely be easier for you to quickly move past it in the moment.Don't let it stop you from living your life. You may be tempted to avoid situations with the potential for embarrassment (meeting someone at the library, where it's very quiet, giving a speech or presentation in front of a group, hanging out one-on-one with a crush, etc.), but it's important not to limit yourself based on something that might happen."

Understand the importance of a good argument.,
Pay close attention to your opponent's argument.,
Make sure that your own information is correct.,
Form your argument well.,
Round off your argument well.",How to Argue in an Annoying Manner1," There's nothing more annoying than losing an argument because you simply can't find any holes in your opponent's case. Adopting tactics meant only to be annoying will simply help, but backing those up with a solid argument will add that much force to your side of the discussion and help you achieve your victory.;
, If you don't notice even the smallest of details, you're not going to be able to provide a good counterargument. You'll be outrun with your opponent's arguments, and you'll fall short. Instead, observe everything. Pay attention and challenge their claims. Make sure to take note of slip ups, false information, and downright lies. Another common thing to look out for is the changing of subject, whether subtle or ludicrously obvious. This is always a great thing to fuel you while you rip into your opposition. If it's via internet (rather than face-to-face) you may find note taking on paper will help.

, Using incorrect information or made-up facts puts holes in your reasoning and hinders the strength of your argument. It's particularly bad if you're calling out your opponent for the very same things. Before entering an argument, make sure you've done your research and have a ready arsenal of facts and citations to fall back upon.

, Don't fall into the trap of being hypocritical. Make sure you stick to your own rules. Ask yourself: Is this argument related? Does it make sense? Does it matter at all? But most importantly, ask yourself: Will this bring the argument forward, and do I want this to happen at the current stage? Remember: There's an art to arguing well, and it needs to be learnt.

, Persistence is key, so you should come out on top, but don't leave it with a sloppy, rubbish ending. Make sure you get your point across. You want to rub your win into their face.

Isolate yourself.,
Walk it off.,
Join a crowd.",How to Act Like You Didn't Fart2," Take a moment and politely excuse yourself to leave the room. Your company will think you're simply going to wash your hands or smoke a cigarette, or that you've left something in the other room, when in reality you're being courteous enough to withdraw after deploying your chemical weapons on the general populace.


While this is the most civilized and secretive method, make a break for it after siphoning some sulfur won't always be possible. If you happen to be in a time and place where you can't justify excusing yourself, you may have to try out another approach.

, Give yourself a reason to walk away after an accidental fart. This is perhaps the best damage control scenario when airing one out in the open, for several reasons. First, the motion of walking will help wave away the emission, getting it gone faster. Second, whatever smell is produced will quickly dissipate in the open air, and you'll already be moving away from the source of the stink. Lastly, the commotion of breaking into a walk will provide a welcome diversion after the sound should there be any, and the gust itself will be harder to identify with the surrounding distractions., With more people around, it will become impossible to tell exactly who broke wind. This strategy requires a bit of a poker face, as it's likely that someone in the group may have heard or smelled the outburst, but you're relying on the good social graces of others not to draw attention to it out of fear that someone will think it was them.If you're the type who blushes easily or don't think you're capable of pulling one over on an unsuspecting crowd, consider finding another place to take refuge after easing out a surprise fart. If this method fails, it will leave you in the middle of a flock of people who are all likely to find out that it was you that, in fact, dealt it.

Bend or crouch.,
Mask it with other noise.,
Choose a soft surface for sitting.",How to Act Like You Didn't Fart3," If you feel a breeze coming on down below and circumstances allow, get into a position where you can bend over or crouch down. In these positions the bowels are less obstructed, which means you can let loose without worrying as much about waking the neighbors. Doing this will not mitigate the smell if there are discerning noses around, however.This method may be a lifesaver to those who work physical jobs or often partake in activities where they can move around freely, especially if you have the added advantage of being outside.

, When you're in a crowded room or roaring movie theater this won't be much of an issue. But if you're in the quiet living room of your in-laws' home, you may need a sonic diversion. Coughing, exclaiming loudly and dropping objects are all time-tested openings for stealth cheese-cutting, but you're free to get as creative as you please: work the toot into a well-timed bout of laughter, or wait until someone opens a bag of chips.Don't be too obvious about the cover noise you're generating. Act natural. And, of course, if the problem gets to be too much for you to handle at an important social event, you may have to just bite the bullet and let it go.

, The softer and more plush a seating surface is, the more it will act as soundproofing for your down-under disruptions. Pick an office or conference chair that can withstand the brunt of your blasts, and opt for the worn old sofa over the swanky leather recliner whenever possible. As long as you're careful, you should be able to expel as much flatulence as you need without ever having to get up.Avoid hard surfaces, such as park benches or wooden chairs, or ""reflective"" surfaces, like leather and hard rubber, when you're gassy. The acoustics of these materials tend to amplify the vibrations of impactful sounds, and if your antagonist fart happens to be too powerful, it will be like advertising.

Argue from a good premise.,
Don't require the last word.",How to Argue," Odds are you know exactly how to push the other person's buttons, but it's important to resist if you want to have a civil argument. Resolve that no matter how upset he or she makes you, you will not say the one thing you know would push the argument over the edge.;
, Respect what the other person has to say. An argument has to be two-sided; if you fail to hear the other side out, they will return the gesture and not listen to you. Refuting a person's opinion is fine, but refusing to hear it makes a debate pointless.


You should always be respectful when arguing with another person. Remember, that's what they are: another person. Treat them the way that you would want to be treated. Don't immediately dismiss their ideas just because they don't agree with you. Listen to them.

, When you argue with someone, you should remember to only attack that person's ideas, not the person themselves. That means you shouldn't call the person stupid for thinking what they think, and you shouldn't devolve to attacks on their physical appearance either.

, When you make a mistake, admit it. Admit that you misunderstood or were misinformed. Being wrong doesn't make you a lesser person but admitting you're wrong does make you the bigger person.

, If you've hurt someone or your argument caused problems, you should apologize. Be the adult in the situation and take responsibility for your actions.

, The best way to argue positively is to be open to new ideas. You don't want to be wrong in an argument again, do you? Open yourself to the possibility of a better way of thinking or new, fascinating information.

, When you make people feel stupid, that makes them shut down and tends to quickly lead an argument nowhere. Make them feel smart and you'll have an easier time turning the argument in your favor.

, Evidence from reliable sources that specifically supports and deals with what you're arguing about can be one of the easiest ways to win an argument. You should also tailor the type of evidence you use to what kind of person they are, using more logical or more emotional evidence based on what you think they'll respond to best.

, Pointing out fallacies in their logic and politely explaining why that logic is bad is a good way to start to change someone's mind. Learning to recognize logical fallacies can be challenging but here are a few common ones:


Watch out for arguments with incorrectly assume that correlation means causation. For example, rates of autism diagnosis increased with the usage of cell phones. Therefore, autism is caused by cellphone usage. Post-hoc fallacies are similar, but are based on the idea that because A preceded B, B was caused by A.
An Argument from Silence fallacy is the idea that because there is no evidence for something, it must not exist. For example, God/germs/evolution/aliens do not exist because we have never physically witnessed them.
Non-Sequiturs are when the conclusion of an argument is unrelated to its premise. For example, the argument that we can't pay teachers more because policemen and firefighters do not make that much money.

, People like to think of themselves as the main character in their life story. Keep them thinking this and charm them into changing their views by carefully tailoring how you talk about the issues.


For example, ""I know you really, really want to help people. You're one of the most generous people that I know. But if you really wanted to help people, you wouldn't donate to a charity that misuses their money like that. Don't you want to be sure that your money is directly saving lives?""

, When you argue, avoid language like ""you"" and ""me"". Instead, use words like ""we"". This brings your opponent into thinking of the two of you as a single unit with singular interests, rather than driving you apart.

, Sometimes, someone won't be able to change their mind right in front of you. Sometimes you have to just back off and their mind will change slowly over the course of time, as they think about what you said. Of course, sometimes you just have to persist too. It's a subtle art that you may just have to experiment with.


Generally, if someone seems like they're getting really upset, it's time to stop.
Close the argument with something like, ""Okay, I can see that I can't change your mind but, please, just think about what I said.""

, Starting an argument, clearly provoking one, will get noticed by the people you argue with. They'll be much less likely to take you seriously because they know you just want to shout for awhile. Avoid looking like a troll if you want to have an effective argument.

, Let your humanity and who you are as a person show through. This makes you more sympathetic and less angering to the people you argue against. Explain why you believe the thing that you believe and be willing to admit when an idea is your own, rather than using the ""devil's advocate"" cover up for an idea you know won't be popular.

, The fastest way to make an argument totally pointless is to let it get derailed. Stay on topic when you argue and when the other person derails, get them back on track. Solving a single disagreement is better than getting nowhere with 20 separate issues. Discuss one issue at a time, covering everything you want to say about it. When it's been settled or you've reached an impasse, move on to the next topic.


Don't allow subject changes. The other person might try to change the subject in order to cover up a mistake. Many people, when proven wrong in some area, will rather be dismissive of their mistake rather than acknowledging their error. Either leave the argument if the person refuses to acknowledge mistakes (i.e ""It doesn't matter"", ""Whatever, that's my opinion."", etc), or insist they acknowledge their error.

, Explain why you have the belief that you have, where you got your information from, and how you come to your conclusions. This can expose misunderstandings but it also forces your opponent to enter your head-space and follow your line of reasoning. It can be an effective way to win people over!

, When you argue with someone, acknowledge their argument and make sure that you actually understand what they're saying. Clarify with them if you have to.

, Make sure that you understand the basis of your argument before you argue. You should also make sure you agree with the premise of your opponent's argument. If you don't agree with the example they're using, or if you think it isn't representative or the idea is flawed in some way, say so before getting knee-deep in an argument. Letting your opponent work from a flawed premise makes it harder to show them the correct ideas.

, Both of you feeling the need to have the last word in an argument can quickly lead a conversation into a Bottomless Anger Pit of Doom. Don't go into the Bottomless Anger Pit of Doom. You wouldn't like it there. Just ""agree to disagree"" and go cool down.


If you've been talking for a long time and neither one of you is budging, consider calling it a day. There are some arguments you can't win, no matter how good your argument is, if the other person isn't willing to rethink the problem. If you know when to quit, you might still be able to preserve the relationship.

Nitpick your opponent's argument.,
Don't become irritated.,
Remember to keep it fun.",How to Argue in an Annoying Manner2," Point out their mistakes, hesitations, inconsistencies, and assumptions. Don't let them proceed with their argument until every little, inconsequential detail is ironed out. This will make the weaknesses of their argument very clear to everyone, and it will frustrate them as they begin to feel like their argument isn't getting anywhere. Make little jokes and laugh heartily as you do this: as they get more and more frustrated, it will only be more annoying to see you finding it so funny.

, Stay calm, and never raise your voice or become agitated. That's your opposition's job. In fact, laughing or in some other way demonstrating how much fun you're having or how funny you think it is will make it even worse for your opponent.

, If the argument gets heated or personal, or if one or both of you will be seriously hurt by something that's said, it's time to stop. You should frustrate and annoy your opponent, not abuse them. Know where the line is and how not to cross it.

Say you're debating the general issue of gun control with someone. The base level of the argument is whether you're ""against"" gun control or ""for"" gun control as a policy, but really the issue is much more complicated than that. Before you even think about ""choosing a side,"" start generating some probing questions that will narrow the issue and force you to define the terms.
What is meant by ""gun control""? What is the scope of the argument, legally and geographically? What does it mean to be ""for"" it? What would it mean to be ""against"" it? Why might someone be for it? Why might someone be against it?;
, But, wait--you may be asking: Why research the evidence for claims you may not even be making? Researching the evidence for both sides of an issue will be an integral part both of understanding, structuring, and eventually making the argument, regardless of which ""side"" you're going to defend. Think of it more as researching a topic and less of making an argument at this point.


Say you're having an argument with your parents about your curfew, and one of the reasons you've brainstormed for the argument about an early curfew involves getting enough rest. Your parents believe you need enough rest every night to ensure that you're physically healthy and that an early curfew will ensure enough rest. In that case, it would be good to look up statistics like how much sleep someone in your age bracket actually needs and other data you've gathered about the social and psychological effect of an early curfew.
It may be helpful to use note cards for this process, if you're arguing formally. On the front, write each bit of reasoning as a claim: ""An early curfew will ensure a good night of sleep."" On the back of the card, keep references to the evidence you've gathered.

, and ""How?"" For every claim you generate, qualify it by asking why and how that claim operates. Why was the second amendment written? How does it operate today? Why is it an important consideration?


The answers to these questions should be used to add complexity to your argument: ""While an early curfew is intended to ensure a healthy amount of sleep, the negative impact on the social development of the child outweighs the physical impact of sleep.""

, Some reasons will be ""better"" than other reasons. ""Gun control infringes upon the Second Amendment right to bear arms"" is a better example of reasoning than ""Gun control will keep me from having fun with my AK-47,"" because the former is worded in terms of universal rights articulated in legal documents and the latter is impossible to quantify or evaluate objectively. Asking ""How?"" of the latter will make it difficult to add any complexity and cause the claim to break down.


Order the note cards in order of the quality of their reasoning. Put the best arguments on top and the worst at the bottom. How many would you label ""good"" reasons? How many seem to be lacking?

, Once you've got a good list built up of reasoning and evidence, and you've used that evidence to begin qualifying your claims, narrowing them into an argument, you can begin by selecting the strongest reasons and organizing them into an argument.


Often a good rule of thumb is to stick to three main points, but there's no sacred law that ensures three main points makes for a good argument. Pick the strongest bits of reasoning you've got. If you've got five, so be it. Your argument will be all the stronger for it.

, British Philosopher Stephen Toulmin argued that all good arguments were made by offering data, that is factual evidence that supports the claim you're making (""Teenagers 16-18 only need 6 hours of sleep to maintain healthy body function."") for each claim in an argument.


What he calls a ""warrant"" is the logical connection made between that data and the claim that you're making (""So as you can see, an early curfew unnecessarily prevents social development."") and warrants should likewise be spelled out for each claim.
The ""backing"" in this case refers to the assumption being made by the warrant (""A later curfew will ensure social development."").

, Now's your chance to present all the research you did earlier by becoming familiar with the arguments for both sides. If you've researched the perspective the person you're arguing with is taking, you'll be able to introduce it before they do, effectively strengthening your argument by disallowing them from scoring the points.


""Now, it might be said that social interactions don't matter as much as getting enough sleep. That I get all the socialization I need in school. But, as you can see, the facts simply don't add up...""

, As you ask more and more questions of your reasons, you'll get closer to a manageable argument you can sum up after presenting all your good reasons and evidence: ""It's true that I need to get enough sleep. But the amount of sleep I need in no way corresponds to the unfair restrictions and the social strangling that results from my super-early curfew.""

, Study these and learn to recognize them quickly, and you'll be able to quickly dismantle weak arguments. You also need to learn to avoid using them and weakening your argument. Here are a few examples of common fallacies:


The ""straw man"" fallacy involves misrepresenting the other's argument to make it appear weaker: ""If you support early curfews I guess you must also support taking away of all my video games and sending me to a liberal fascist re-education camp.""
The ""ad hominem"" attack involves attacking your opponent personally as a way of undermining their argument: ""Dad's a dork. Why are we listening to what he has to say about going out with friends?""
The ""slippery slope"" fallacy involves drawing up a false cause-and-effect relationship as evidence: ""If I have to be home at 9 o'clock, next I won't be able to eat hamburgers in restaurants either.""
The ""anecdotal"" fallacy uses a single anecdote as evidence for a universal policy: ""Steve gets to stay out until 12.""

, Now that you've planned and presented your case, you can also do a lot to poke holes in the argument of the opposition. Remember when you were trying to develop your argument, asking ""How?"" and ""Why?"" is the most effective way to quickly pinpoint the holes in a particular claim. Do the same thing to your opponent. If they haven't thought these things through like you did beforehand, you've got an advantage.

, Socrates was an expert at leading a conversation from simple contentions to complicated gray areas by asking probing questions. Asking leading questions you already know the answer to can be a good way to score points: ""So it's your contention that an early curfew means I'll go to sleep earlier? Why? Does being home mean I'm sleeping?""

, If they seem to have no statistics backing up a particular issue, ask if they know of any evidence backing up a particular claim.

, In Aristotle's ancient text on Rhetoric, he outlined the three basic rhetorical appeals: Pathos, Ethos, and Logos.


An appeal based on pathos appeals to the emotions. If you can find a way to make your opponent empathize with your argument, it can be a very effective tool in breaking their confidence in their own argument and sympathizing with your argument.
An appeal based on logos is an appeal to logic and facts. If you're arguing about something you can quantify with numbers, such as the ""best"" home run hitter of all time, using statistics will be an important part of your argument. Making an emotional appeals about a player being the best because he was the nicest father or gave the most to charity won't hold much water.
An appeal based on ethos involves persuading based on a position of either expertise or simple believability. The word literally means ""character."" While someone with a tattoo may not necessarily be an expert on tattooing, they're objectively more ""qualified"" to offer you tattoo advice than someone without one. You can use this to your advantage by connecting yourself to an argument: ""As a former veteran and licensed firearms expert, I can tell you that gun safety is a skill anyone can learn.""

, When arguing, keep calm, and present your side of the argument in an organized manner. When the opposite side brings up a point, always counter this point with something relevant supporting you.

, Make sure to let the opposite party finish their sentences, and let them know you are listening to what they are saying. When you are talking and your opponent tries to interject, try to finish your point without raising your voice or speaking faster, but be firm.


If they don't stop talking and try to make their point over you, calmly point out that you had the courtesy to let them finish their sentences, and that you wish to be treated the same way. You will obviously appear to be the more polite and mature party, and that often helps winning your arguments.

, Quickly accept faults in your reasoning or weak points in your argument and move on to other things. Learn to quickly identify lost ground and move on to stronger points. Stay focused on the big picture and don't get drawn into tiny skirmishes.

Calm down.,
Listen.,
Confirm your understanding.,
Confirm that you have been understood.,
Identify the points where you already agree.,
State the disagreement.,
Consider your options.,
Decide how to decide.,
Celebrate!",How to Defuse an Argument," People's higher reasoning abilities shut down when they're angry. If either you or the other person is hot with anger, take a few minutes of quiet to cool off—half an hour or more if necessary.


Say ""I'm too upset to discuss this right now. Let's meet again in half an hour.""
During that time, relax.Breathe deeply. Don't ruminate or stoke your anger. Better to take a walk and clear your mind. If you must think ahead about the conversation, try to empathize, or think of how you might word what you need to say in the following steps.;
, Find out what the other person wants you to hear. You don't have to agree with it. Many arguments go on unpleasantly and without progress because each side is trying to be heard but neither side is listening. By listening, you break the deadlock.

, Summarize your understanding of the other person's position, by stating it in your own words, and ask if your understanding is accurate. ""Let's see if I understand you correctly. Are you saying ...?"" By switching from establishing which side is right, to accurately understanding the other side, you defuse the struggle to ""force a verdict"". You create an opportunity to correct misunderstanding, and if you do understand correctly, the other person now sees this.


Making an honest effort to understand shows good faith. The heat of an argument often derives from each party's doubting that the other is acting in good faith.

, Now, ask the other person if they would be willing to summarize your position. If they can't, or they haven't heard it yet, ask if they would be willing to listen to what you have to say now.


Phrase your request in a way that avoids blaming or shaming the other person for misunderstanding you. You can do this by wording it so you are the one responsible for communicating your point, rather than making the other person responsible for understanding you. For example, say ""I'd like to make sure that I've gotten my point across"" rather than ""I'd like to make sure you haven't misunderstood.""

, After listening and confirming understanding, most arguments dissolve right then: there was no actual disagreement. If there is still disagreement, though, take a moment to list the main points where you already agree. For example, if it's an argument about who should take out the trash, take a moment to see that you both already agree that you each want the house to be clean, and you each want chores distributed fairly. You would not be having an argument if there were not some underlying agreement.


If parts of what the other person has said have moved you to change your mind, now is a good time to say so. If they have enlightened you or corrected an error of yours, thank them.
Don't use agreement on these other points as a tactic to logically ""checkmate"" the other person into admitting they were wrong. That's the kind of tactic that keeps the argument burning. Genuine agreement will come, when and if it comes. It can't be forced.

, Now that you have clarity about each other's position and you know where you already agree, take a moment to put the point where you disagree into words. Many arguments go on fruitlessly because neither side even knows what the argument is about!


When you put the disagreement into words, either you will both agree very quickly on what the disagreement is, or you won't. If the latter, you open up an opportunity to hear something important that you haven't heard yet. Or perhaps you will discover that there is no actual disagreement.

, What can you do to resolve the disagreement? Some often-applicable options are:


If it's a disagreement about who should do some work (for example, taking out the trash), options are other ways to divide up jobs between you. You may find a way of allocating jobs that you both find more enjoyable. You simply have to negotiate and compromise.If it's a disagreement about who gets to use a limited resource (for example, who gets to watch TV right now, or whether there should be quiet or loud music right now), options include: scheduling use of the resource so you both get to enjoy it, finding a way to use it that you both enjoy simultaneously, going your separate ways.
If it's a disagreement about how to do something (for example, what color to paint the living room, how to word a sentence in an article you are collaborating on), options include: trying out both approaches and then seeing how you like them, exploring compromises that use the best of both ideas, looking for entirely different approaches, giving one person control over one part of the project and another person control over another, or simply giving in if you don't think it's worth fighting over.
If it's a disagreement about whether a plan will work (for example, whether a business idea is worth investing in), some options are: exploring small ways to try out the plan to see if it's feasible, or having the person who believes in the plan go ahead but without help from the person who doesn't (and reaping all the rewards if the plan is successful).
If it's a disagreement about what is true (for example, did O.J. do it, or what's wrong with your car, or whether God exists), likely options include thinking of ways to put the proposition to a test, new facts to check out, or simply letting the disagreement go unresolved—""agree to disagree"".
An option that is often fruitful is to delay in order to let your mind work on the disagreement. Now that you have each heard the other and understand the disagreement clearly, your mind has new material to work on, and this may take some time.

, By now, you've probably resolved the disagreement. If not, then agree on a plan for how to resolve it. You might go to a third party, flip a coin, meet again the next day after thinking, check out some facts that you think will settle the matter. Agreeing to a way of deciding is often easier than resolving the disagreement directly. You can both agree right now that the way of deciding is fair.

, You started angry over what looked like an insoluble stalemate, you heard each other, and you broke the logjam. This calls for a ritual to mark your shared success: a laugh, if it was only a silly misunderstanding, or perhaps a handshake or a drink.

Understand the purpose of humor within an argument.,
Be certain about whether or not humor is the right approach in a particular situation.,
If you've decided that the situation is appropriate and that the other party may be amenable to your wit, stay even tempered and respectful as you find the right moment to insert humor into the conversation.,
Insert humor here!,
Seize the gap.,
Address the underlying issues later on.",How to Use Humor to Stop an Argument," The purpose is not to belittle or show up your opponent; if that is your aim, then this is not the article for you. The purpose is to alleviate the tension and to help both of you see the absurdities and contradictions of life in general and of the topic you're arguing about in particular. It's about helping both of you to not take yourselves so seriously, even if the topic itself is very serious. Humor is a great way to quell emotional drama or inflation of an argument beyond its original point.


Be sure that you're actively listening to what the other person has to say and not simply attempting to deflect their concerns with humor as a brush-off. Active listening will ensure that you can reflect their concerns back at them at the end of the argument (see below).;
, Humor can alleviate a difficult situation and lighten the tension but it also has the potential to escalate the arguing if it's used in way that suggests belittling of the opponent or situation. Great care must be taken to assess this before inserting humor into the argument. There are several principle things to consider:


Ask yourself: ""Am I arguing with someone who responds well to humor?"" Not everyone appreciates a joke when tempers are flaring and for some people, humor will simply prove that they're not being taken seriously enough and could fan the flames of an argument. Use your awareness of the person to judge this aspect, as well as considering whether the humor you wish to inject is respectful of the other person.

However, this should also be balanced with a realization that a person who is very critical of others and yet very sensitive in return has an internal problem and you can't spend your life tiptoeing around their hyper-defensiveness. In this case, being respectful means being ready to drop the argument from your end and not being defensive if they do fail to respond calmly.


Ask yourself: ""Is humor appropriate in this context?"" Some fights are too heated or are about too sensitive a topic for humor to be appropriate and effective. Attempting to use humor in settings where your opponent feels extremely vulnerable, passionate or dogmatic can make the situation worse, since you may appear to be making light of a serious issue or putting down their passion or beliefs.

However, this needs to be weighed with taking care to not over-privilege ""taboo"" topics; if you're arguing with someone who stakes out a position of ""don't touch my beliefs/opinions even though I can decimate yours"", humor may be the last resort left before you end your involvement in the dispute.


Ask yourself: ""Is this the right setting for using humor?"" In certain settings, like a workplace, humor may be an inappropriate way to address conflicts. Obviously, this will depend on the context and the feel for the situation around you.

, Obviously, you don't want to elevate the argument into a more serious fight where humor may no longer be appropriate but if judged appropriately, humor can defuse the mounting tension and help your opponent see that arguing the toss is not going to solve the bigger issue. A big part of this is delivering your humor in a courteous and calm manner and avoiding any condescension or derision in your tone.

, There are a number of strategies that can be useful when deciding on your comment:


(1) Add perspective – making a joke that reminds people of the world outside the argument can lessen tempers. For example, in an argument about always forgetting to put the toilet seat down, you might throw in a comment along the lines of: ""Yes, it is nice to have indoor plumbing!""

(2) Be self-deprecating – arguments often arise when both parties are acting stubbornly. Making a joke at your own expense shows that you don't take yourself too seriously. For example, ""You know that I have trouble with complicated mechanisms that have both 'up' and 'down' settings."" Even more effective is an apology coupled with self-deprecating humor, such as ""I'm so sorry, it seems that missing my mid-afternoon snack has fueled my transformation into a gormless half-wit.""

(3) Be flattering – changing your tone by saying something overly sweet might seem like you're trying to weasel out of the argument, but when done with humor it just might fly. For example, ""You're so beautiful, you would make falling into the toilet look graceful... and then I bet everyone else would start doing it too.""


, A well executed joke can lead to a momentary break in the argument, particularly if the other person laughs. Take advantage of the break after the joke to defuse the argument entirely. This often means apologizing or accepting the other person's point of view. Alternatively, if you cannot accept their view, respect their view by telling them that you understand their side of the argument and that while it hasn't changed your own opinion, it has given you a lot to think about and that you're prepared to take into account the things they've raised.

, The best time to sort out an argument is when those involved in it are not overly emotionally invested in the argument itself and the tempers have been extinguished. Taking the time to address the issues that caused the argument helps to avoid future arguments on the topic. It also helps to show the other person that when you use humor during an argument, it wasn't done to avoid the issue entirely but just to change the format of the discussion. This may make humor even more effective with that person in the future; for example, eventually you either remember to put the seat down or explain why you just can't learn to remember...


Give yourselves at least 30 minutes to calm down and perhaps even longer, depending on the urgency of resolving the issue. Take a walk, listen to or watch something funny or spend time with pets or kids.

Consider the reasons that might be causing you to push other women away.,
Consider that you might be afraid of revealing too much in the presence of women and feeling vulnerable as a result.,
Know what you're missing out on by pushing women away.,
Think about the qualities you appreciate in the male friends you've surrounded yourself with and how these could translate into the same qualities you might find in a woman.,
Think about calming the hatred or condescension you feel toward women to bring peace and balance back to your life.,
Deal with your self-esteem issues if you really are just jealous or insecure.,
Consider befriending a woman.,
Stay positive.",How to Stop Hating Other Women," Perhaps you grew up in a household of domineering or difficult female relatives who put you off wanting to be around women for all time. Or perhaps you had a great female friend at school who suddenly stopped talking to you, spread rumors about you and broke your heart. Whatever traumatic past experiences have led you to mistrust all women, taking these early experiences and applying it generally will continue to cause you to miss out! Not all women are like the poor female role models of your past. Here is a range of possible reasons as to why you might be pushing other women away from you:


Bullying experiences in your early years. Were you teased or bullied by other girls when you were little? Or did a female family member berate or intimidate you? Bullying is extremely serious and can have devastating effects on a developing personality.
Perceiving female managers or coworkers as ""difficult"" or as betraying you. Have you worked with mean spirited, tough-hearted or difficult female coworkers or managers? Some women at work can fall foul of overdoing the ""keeping-up-with-male"" traits and treat other women more harshly than they do their male counterparts. Have you felt that some women at work have targeted you in this way and caused you to think they were out to make your life miserable? ""Being under the thumb” of authority can be a painful experience, especially if your boss or coworker should be on your side and you feel that they're betraying your gender connection. On the other hand, are you stuck in a pattern of only liking male bosses or coworkers because you can use your appearance and flirty ways to get them on side? Be honest; this isn't a reflection of you being a bad person, it's just an unhelpful habit that you might have failed to outgrow since the time of being ""daddy's little girl"".
Having had a problematic childhood. It's probable that almost everyone can list one or two irritating, embarrassing or painful experience with their mother, grandmother or a great old aunt. However, if your childhood was filled with these types of experiences (such as an overbearing or narcissistic mom), you may have developed a complex against other women as a result. Sometimes the manner in which males in your family have treated women might cause you to assume the worst of other women; or perhaps you were an only child or there were no sons in the family, and you were a ""substitute"" son and don't really know how to connect with other females as a result. Any such reasons can be complex and should be discussed with a mental health professional, but be aware that they may be causing you to keep women at a distance.
You feel that men don't ask the hard questions of you that women do. Perhaps you're feeling really vulnerable due to depression, an illness or you're trying to achieve in a job that is still known as a mostly male domain. You might be afraid that other women will automatically see through your attempts to cope, spot your weaknesses and get right at what is hurting you inside. You can't afford to show weakness or to be mollycoddled like this, so you tend to totally avoid it.
Envy. The big one. You are simply envious of other women in your environs, whether because of their status, beauty, education, popularity, intellectual skills, dating abilities, powerful positions, motherhood, whatever. Possibly you're in a fairly closed social environment and don't move beyond that circle much, so you're perceiving one ""type"" of woman a lot. And in this case, your insecurity is driving your envy and cutting you off from female friendships because you don't trust any of the women in this tight circle. Or, you might be feeling rebellious, angry or frustrated about the choices other women have made and yet secretly wish you'd made them too, such as early motherhood, staying-at-home or juggling children and a career, etc.
Fear of losing your male partner. Some women hate other women because of a huge sense of insecurity that other women will steal away your man. This can stem from bad past experiences or it can stem from the fact that your current partner isn't to be trusted for some reason (in which case, it's time to rethink the relationship rather than blaming all women).;
, By being ""one of the boys"", you get to distance yourself from female topics all the time and perhaps you feel more powerful, less inclined to vulnerability. However, while you might feel relieved about not being too ""touchy-feely"", by not wanting to get too close to other women who could share all your secrets and be open about feelings, it's probable that much of the things that you're not sharing are simply getting bottled up inside and may well build up to emotional troubles later. This has significant potential consequences for the depth of any friendship with males too because you may expect too much from them when you do open up and talk about feelings or reveal emotions, areas where men tend to take a different approach from women and can feel uncomfortable when a woman raises them.

, You miss out on a great deal by not including other women in your life, including having friends and confidantes who can really grasp the things you're experiencing because you're a female and they are too (things such as PMT, menopause, having babies, etc.). Moreover, you miss out on ""girl power"", that amazing experience in which females get together to bond as women and leave all the male domains truly behind and just ""hang out"", ""let it all out"" and confess to the craziest, zaniest and deepest desires that you'd only ever want another woman to hear because she knows just where you're coming from.


When you start becoming more and more like your mother, only your female friends will truly understand and know how to commiserate. And you can only have the ""My mother messed me up"" talk with other women; most men just don't diss moms, not even for casual banter.
There will be losses, down times and great victories in your life that you will want to share with women because they will have an unspoken understanding of what you're experiencing or going through without you having to explain, apologize or tiptoe around anything.
There is a well of strength to draw on amid your sisters. No matter how much you love the man/men in your life, women are an important part of revitalizing your energies and strength too.

, Not all women are catty meanies like the ones you may see on reality TV or perhaps those in your current circle or acquaintances. And as with any generalization, you're blinded by painting all women in the same light, yet women have numerous qualities and personalities; it's not helpful to lump all women together because not all women are the same––after all, clearly you find yourself different enough. And even the women you perceive as catty or snooty have soft underbellies that perseverance in friendship or tactful honesty can sometimes uncover. Qualities that you may be admiring in a man are equally discoverable in women, such as:


Truthfulness. If one reason that you don’t like other women is because you were burned by a woman who was either two-faced or who told you one thing but meant something else, then you may see male friends are more frank. Typically, it is said that guys like to “tell it like it is” and don’t want to play games with their buds––a quality you may hold near and dear. Yet, most women are truthful too and indeed, they may be more likely to tell you that you're putting on a bit too much weight, working too many hours or that your husband has been seen with another woman, than a male friend would. Remember that he still sees you as a woman and he may feel embarrassed or not want to hurt your feelings. On the other hand, a woman may be more likely to want to make sure that you're aware of the issues to prevent further hurt.
Loyalty. Perhaps you think that guys are more likely to stick with one another through thick and thin, preferring their mates over romantic interests. Yet, if you think that male friendship and bonding is deeper than that between women, this leaves you in a precarious friendship given that you are the woman befriending males, so can you really be sure that your male friends will continue treating you like ""one of the boys""? Could it be that they'd drop the friendship with you if push came to shove, just because you're a woman? While it may be impossible to know, female friendships tend to endure just as strongly as male friendships. They may wax and wane through times of marriage and child-raising but many a woman knows she can phone or email a female friend and pick up where they last left off.

Respect. Of course, not everyone has respect for each other, whatever their gender; however, when guys are with their friends, they usually try to respect the other dude and not find ways to dig at each other’s weaknesses. In the case of women, there are instances of cattiness, social status pulling and putting down other women in unkind ways. But to presume that these generalizations about men and women hold for all men and women is to do everyone a disservice. Insecure men do try to drag down other men, while strong women would never dream of putting down another woman. People are individuals, so avoid putting them into stereotypical types and take them as you find them instead, whatever their gender.
Trust. Even though it's (another) a generalization, you may feel that you can tell a guy a secret, ask him to keep it secret and it will most likely stay locked in the vault. On the other hand, perhaps you worry that women are known for being gossipy with confidential information, which may be a quality you despise the most. Obviously, it's not this simple and yet the answer is simple; don't distrust all women and don't think think all men are trustworthy, or you're going to be sorely hurt by the man who does spread the rumors about you or who is leakier than a punctured air mattress. Learn to spot the gossip queen or king and the backstabbing artiste and steer clear of them, whatever their gender––they're usually obvious.

By all means root out the gossip queen and the queen bee (or queen has-been) from your social circle if you can't handle them. Even better if you learn how to handle them, but leaving them behind or ignoring them works just as well. Just don't assume all women behave this way. Most women are as uncomfortable and embarrassed as you in the presence of rumor-mongering women and mudslingers, and the answer is to simply give such women wide berth.



, Perhaps you don’t want to run out and join a Bunco group or the Garden Club but you can certainly quell the disdain you have for other women––for your sake. Hating to be around women cuts you off from many activities, many of which could bring you respite from the other experiences in your life, such as sports, hobby activities and outings where women are predominantly involved. Here are some ways to calm your hate and restore some balance:


Consider what hating other women does to your state of mind. Conjuring up hatred takes a lot of energy, which could be taking away from activities or efforts you should be putting forth in your life.
When you feel annoyed or irritated with another women, do breathing exercises and mental visualization. If you feel your irritation coming on, don’t let it take you to the next level. Breathe deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth. If possible, close your eyes and try to visualize a place where you feel peaceful and calm.
Explore the possibility of trying therapy. While therapy may not be for everyone, it can be an instrumental tool if you’ve been a victim of bullying or abuse or your thinking is just all messed up. Your hatred for women may possibly be a symptom of a larger personal issue, in which case you owe it yourself to seek healing.

, Unfortunately, if you have low self-esteem, you may be constantly comparing yourself to other women, which may be feeding the fire of hatred. Moreover, if you're insecure because you think that your current male partner has a wandering eye, you may be terrified of every woman who crosses his path. Neither of these ways is a good way to be. Instead, it's time to seize back your self-esteem and shore up your sense of personal well-being, with or without a man in your life.


Try to keep in mind that it’s not a competition and if anyone is keeping score, it’s you. Explore how you would feel if you didn't constantly compare yourself to other women and could just appreciate your similarities and differences.
If you hate women because you're scared they'll steal your male partner, decide where this insecurity comes from. If it's from within you, seek therapy or work through the insecurities using online help or bibliotherapy. It might also help to tell yourself that other women are not interested in your partner and that should anything of the sort ever happen, then it's his loss, not yours and that you're strong enough to cope. If your insecurity is because your male partner truly isn't to be trusted going by the known facts, then reconsider staying with him. There are plenty of men who won't wander.
Practice letting go whenever your male partner talks to other women, even flirty ones. Take deep breaths and simply let things be. You might also find it helps to talk to him about your fears, so that he can understand how his behavior might cause you to feel; be sure to stress that you trust him and that this is something you're working to overcome. However, be careful not to crowd him out or make him feel that he can't interact with other women, or he may get too frustrated with your jealousy.

, One way to push beyond your hatred of other women is to try to forge a healthy relationship with another woman at some point in the near future. If you’ve identified the reason why you have chosen to hate other women and you're actively working through the underlying issues, allow yourself the opportunity to see if having a friendship with another woman might work for you.


Find a woman who shares your interests and tastes. One of the best ways to strike up a friendship is to find common ground. Trying to become friends with one of your child’s friend’s parents is not the best way to make new friends because the only commonality is that your children are friends––they get into a fight or the other child does something you don’t like and you are back at square one. Meet people through your love of yoga, painting or even through work.
Go slowly. You don’t want to start out as BFFs; in fact, that's an unrealistic expectation to hold and it's probably doomed to failure if you push too hard the other way. If the other woman comes on too strong, you may want to reconsider the friendship or at least tell her that it's nice to know her but that you need more time before considering her to be a good friend. Have coffee or go to the gym together every once in a while; maybe seeing movie or shopping together is a good start.

, If you feel yourself falling back into old ways, wanting to run back and hide with the guys, or if any new female friendship goes south, try to keep in mind that this is a single instance––not all friendships with women are the same. Moreover, bear in mind that you're likely to be still carrying some odd emotional baggage that other women aren't going to find familiar.


Give compliments. Do the opposite of what scares you––tell that other woman you think she is beautiful, smart, amazing, talented, etc., rather than internally berating yourself for not matching up to her. She will be pleased to know you think so and she will see good in you, and you will see good in you too. The more that women recognize the good in each other, the more support women give one another, the less temptation there will be to descend into the gossip, condescension and hating that you're likely worried about. Realize that while it's easy to cut down another woman, in doing so you make the world less hospitable for all women; join forces instead and help to make things better for all women.
If your new female friend starts to do something that upsets you, such as gossiping or giving you the silent treatment, nip it in the bud. Say something like: ""I really don’t like to talk about people behind their backs"" or ""I'd rather you told me straight what is wrong instead of giving me the cold shoulder; I can deal with talking it through but I'm not going to stick around to be ignored."" After all, you've spent a lot of time with the guys, so use their lines to put a stop to things you think don't show womankind in a good light!
Avoid pinning all your hopes on a single friendship. Get out and befriend many women from all walks of life, to broaden your perspective and to help you to click with different personalities.
Ultimately, approach all relationships in life by following The Golden Rule: Treat others as you wish to be treated. Gender simply doesn't come into that equation!

Understand that a certain degree of conflict is normal.",How to Make up After an Argument," If you can make up immediately, this is typically the best course. This is especially true if:


You accused someone of doing something, and you were wrong.
You are not overly angry. Anger, frustration, hurt, and other such emotions are the reasons you may wait to apologize, so you do not let them get in your way. But if you can put these aside, make up now.
The other person is willing to make up. Sometimes the other person will not immediately want to make up. But if he or she is, then do not put it off--do it now.
You are not doing so just to pacify the other person or avoid conflict that must be addressed. Some people make up just to avoid a fight. But sometimes this is at the risk of squelching your own needs.;
, If you try to talk with the other person while either of you is still angry, neither of you will be receptive to listening.

There is an adage of: “Never go to bed angry” which has some wisdom to it. Waiting too long will often make anger fester, and make you sleep poorly and less able to be in a good frame of mind the next day. This in turn can lead to more arguing.
However, not every argument will be settled by bedtime. Depending on the depth of the argument, the complexity, or simple logistics, you may not be able to make up immediately. But do not put it off.

, It is perfectly normal to feel upset with the other person after an argument, and it can feel natural to want to hurt them in some way, such as lashing out with snide or sarcastic comments or pointing out their failures. These actions aren’t constructive, however, and should be avoided when you approach the other person to make up., How you felt about whatever caused the argument between you is different than the actual issue (or issues) that may have initiated the argument. Keeping them separate in your mind will allow you to be honest about your emotions and still have a productive conversation about what happened., Don’t discount feelings by saying things like “You shouldn’t have felt that way” or “That’s not right.” Accept that the other person did feel the way that they did.

, As you prepare to approach the other person to make up, don’t assume that you know how the argument made them feel. Try to go into the situation without preconceived ideas of what the other person thought or felt, and don’t “read in between the lines” of what they tell you.

, If you’re still upset about the argument, or you feel like you have some very emotional things to say to the other person, try writing them down first. You won’t share this with the other person: the point is to explore your own feelings and try to clarify them before sharing them with someone else.

, Try to avoid approaching the other person to make up when they’re experiencing a lot of stress or heightened emotion (for example, a big project at work, a personal issue, or a major holiday). Wait for a time when they have fewer other worries.

, It is important that you be able to talk with each other face-to-face if at all possible. While the statistic that 90% of human communication is non-verbal isn’t exactly true, non-verbal cues do play a huge part in how we interpret each other’s words and actions.It is helpful to be able to talk in person so that you can clarify what you’ve said and keep an eye on how the other person appears to be responding.

, You don’t want the other person to feel as though they’re obligated to talk with you. Instead, express your regret over the argument and invite them to express their feelings in a conversation.


For example, you could send the other person an email or even a handwritten card or letter that says, “I’m sorry about our fight. I’d love to talk about it so I can understand your feelings better. Would you like to talk about it with me?”

, While you do want to convey your feelings about the argument, you also want to make sure the other person feels heard. Offer the other person the space to share their perceptions about the argument.


This also allows you to gain a better understanding of how the other person sees your role in the argument, which will help you as you form your apology.
For example, you could say something like, “I’m so sorry I hurt you. Please help me understand what you were feeling.”

, If your feelings were hurt during the argument, it’s fine to express that. However, you should first listen to what the other person wants to say. Listening to them communicates that you value their feelings.Don’t interrupt the other person as they’re talking. Wait until they’ve finished, and then ask for any clarification you need. Don’t contradict them: making up is about accepting responsibility first, not determining who was more right than the other person.

, After the other person expresses a thought or feeling, try to put it into your own words. This not only shows that you’re paying attention, it offers space in case you misunderstood what they were saying. Once you’ve done this, ask for the other person’s feedback to check that you heard correctly.For example, if your friend tells you that they were really hurt and felt left out when you didn’t invite them to your Halloween party, restate what they told you in your own words: “I heard you say that you are hurt because I didn’t invite you to my Halloween party.”

, According to marriage and family therapists, an effective apology incorporates “the three R’s”: regret, responsibility, and remedy.Regret: This element is an expression of genuine regret that you caused the other person unhappiness or hurt. For example, you could say something like “I’m sorry that I hurt your feelings by not calling you when I said I would.”
Responsibility: a good apology should speak only about your actions, and should not make any excuses for yourself (regardless of whether you think any exist). For example, try not to say things like “I’m sorry that I hurt your feelings, but you forget to call me all the time.” Instead, try something like, “I’m sorry I hurt your feelings by not calling you when I said I would. I know that was important to you.”
Remedy: a good apology will also focus on how you can repair the hurt you caused. This element shows that you are not only sorry for what you did, you are willing to work to keep it from happening again. For example, this could be something like “I’m sorry I hurt your feelings by forgetting to call you. I know that was important to you. Next time, I’ll put a reminder in my calendar so I remember.”

, Acknowledge the other person’s feelings when you apologize. This expression is very important in allowing the other person to know that you mean your apology. It shows that you are actively trying to imagine the consequences of your actions and that you care about them.For example, try saying something like, “I can see why my going out with your ex without telling you would hurt you. You two had a rocky breakup and it sounds like you felt as though I went behind your back instead of being honest with you. I want you to know that our friendship means a lot to me.”

, If the other person feels accused, it may simply trigger another fight.For example, if your argument was about you saying something hurtful to a friend, don’t say “I’m sorry you were hurt by my remarks.” This puts the responsibility back onto the other person for feeling hurt, rather than accepting the responsibility for making the hurtful statement.

, Simply saying “I’m sorry” may end up coming across as dismissive. Instead, listen to the other person and then make your apology as specific as possible.Don’t stop at “I didn’t mean to.” This doesn’t matter. What matters is that you did hurt the other person. You can say that you didn’t mean to hurt the other person, but you should follow it by saying that you acknowledge it happened and you regret it., It can be so tempting to make an apology but then follow it with a disclaimer: “I’m so sorry I hurt you, but you were really mean to me.” This but can end up invalidating the entire apology for the other person. Keep your apology and your own statements about your feelings separate., One of the most damaging things that keep people from making up after fights and arguments is the determination to maintain that they were right. It’s okay to admit that you hurt the other person. Remember: admitting that you did something that hurt someone else isn’t the same as saying you intended to hurt them.


For example, if your partner is upset because you forgot your anniversary, admit your fault: “I can see why you would feel hurt. I don’t want to hurt you, and I’m sorry I did.”

, In addition to saying you’re sorry, your apology should also make a future-oriented statement to let the other person know that you’re serious about maintaining your relationship. Say something like, “In the future, I will do X to keep this problem from happening again.”, Saying that you’ll never hurt the other person again isn’t really truthful. It's natural for conflicts to arise. Instead, you can say you will take conscious action to avoid hurting them again.

, Once you’ve made your apology, suggest something that the two of you can do together. This will demonstrate that you’re committed to the relationship with the other person and that you want to make them feel valued and happy. If possible, make the activity something personally meaningful to the two of you.For example, if both if you enjoy cheesy movies, offer to host a “Bad Movie Night” for just you and the other person.
Activities that prompt discussion and interaction are a good idea, because they offer you both a way to return to having positive feelings about interacting with the other person. This type of interaction actually serves as a reward for your having been constructive with each other, which reinforces that behavior in the future.

, Once you have apologized and are back to a secure place with the other person, it could be helpful to discuss what triggered the argument. Usually, arguments are about larger underlying issues, and if those issues aren’t resolved, you may keep fighting about the same things over and over again.Avoid totalizing words when discussing your feelings. Words such as “always” and “never” don’t allow any room for nuance. Generalizations are usually inaccurate and immediately put the other person on the defensive.For example, if the argument was triggered by your partner forgetting your birthday, don’t say, “You always forget important things” -- even if it feels like they do! Instead, try saying something like “I felt hurt when you forgot my birthday.” This way, you are only making statements about what you felt and experienced, not about what the other person intended.

, Arguments will sometimes happen, but valuing clear communication can help reduce the arguments you have and make it easier to make up after them. Speak openly with the other person about your feelings, and invite them to do so as well.


Don’t confuse openness with saying anything you want. While it can be tempting to point out a laundry list of the other person’s flaws or call each other names, this doesn’t do anything except foster feelings of hurt and frustration in the other person.

, Especially if you’ve had the same argument several times, check in with the other person occasionally and ask how you’re doing in changing your actions., All relationships, whether they’re with a friend, a family member, or a romantic partner, mean that you are working with a person who is often very different than you. Because of this, it’s natural to have some degree of conflict at times. The important thing is not to ignore this conflict or pretend it doesn’t exist, but to manage it."

Give it time.",How to Survive a Date when There's No Chemistry," Just because you do not feel a spark on a first date with someone does not mean it is the end of the world. Keep in mind that it is not possible to have chemistry with everyone. Try to laugh off the lack of chemistry and make the most of the date by considering it an opportunity to make a new friend. Get to know the person like you would try to get to know anyone else. Ask questions about his or her interests, hobbies, likes/dislikes, and goals. Some good questions to ask include:Where did you grow up?
What are your hobbies? How do you like to spend your spare time?
Where do you work? Do you like working there?
What are your friends like?
Do you like to read? If so, what is your favorite book?
Are you a big movie-goer? If so, what kind of movies do you like? What is your favorite movie?;
, If the date is not going well, try suggesting going for a walk. Sitting across from each other in a café can be really awkward if you do not have much in common, but you don’t need to face each other or talk much if you go for a walk. You will also get some mood boosting exercise in the process, which may make you feel better about the date.


Try suggesting a walk by saying something like, “It’s a beautiful day. Do you want to continue our conversation while we walk through town?”

, If the conversation is boring and you are having a hard time paying attention to your date, then try asking a few unexpected questions to spice things up. Even if you have nothing in common with the person, throwing a few curveballs his or her way should make the date a little more fun. Try to ask some things that really interest you.Some questions you might ask include:


“If you could be any cartoon character, who would you be?”
“What would you do to survive a zombie apocalypse?”
“Where would you go if you could go on an all expenses paid vacation?”

, When it’s clear no relationship will come of this date, you may want to use this opportunity to see just how different you are from your date. Try asking your date about his or her thoughts on global warming or some other controversial issue. Although you might disagree, you might enjoy hearing someone else’s viewpoint and the topic may spark an interesting conversation to help pass the time.


As an added bonus, by learning about your date's opinions you may even become more attracted to him or her. People who have common interests and beliefs tend to be more attracted to each other., Having too much alcohol on a bad date can lead to trouble. First, drinking too much on can impair your judgment, which might make someone who you are not interested in seem more appealing. Second, overindulging in alcohol on a date may make you seem immature and impolite. Drinking too much on a date may also lead to more severe consequences such as contracting an STD. That is why it is wise to stay sober and in control so that you do not do anything you might regret.Try not to drink at all if the date is not going well, just so that you can maintain control and handle the situation in the best way possible. Alcohol is likely to make things worse rather than better.

, If you are not interested, you should let the person know you have no intentions of carrying on a romantic relationship with him or her, but be as nice as possible about it. Avoid making a blunt statement such as ""I am not interested in you.” Phrasing your lack of interest in this way would come across as rude and inconsiderate.Try saying something like, “This is hard for me to say, but I have to be honest with you. I have really enjoyed spending time with you, but I don’t think that we are a good match. You deserve to meet someone who shares your interests and goals and I just do not think that I am that person. But I wish you all the best and I have enjoyed getting to know you.”

, If you do not feel any chemistry but suspect that the two of you may become friends, try making that suggestion. If you do this, be absolutely clear that all you want is friendship. It is possible that this may not be an option if the other person is attracted to you. However if the other person shares your idea, you might have found a great new friend out of a bad date.


Try saying something like, “Even thought we were not a match, I had a good time getting to know you. Do you think we could be friends?”
Keep in mind that this strategy can backfire as well, so be careful about using it. Some people may feel just as rejected if you suggest that the two of you become friends. It is also possible that your lack of chemistry may mean that you do not even have enough in common to become friends., If the other person is interested in a second date, you should politely decline either after the first date or later on. You do not need to provide a concrete reason. Avoid being non-committal and do not say things like “maybe we can meet again some time.” Although you may be reluctant to hurt someone's feelings, it is sometimes necessary to do so in order to find what you are looking for.Try saying something like, “It was great to meet you and to get to know you, but I don’t think that we should go on another date. I think you are a great person, but I do not think we are a match. I wish you the best of luck thought and I hope that you find the right guy/girl for you.”

, Chemistry is not scientific. It is not something that can be identified or be developed between two people. However, psychological studies have provided some insights as to what chemistry is made of. It includes non-judgment, similarity, mystery, attraction, mutual trust, and effortless communication.If you have chemistry with someone, then you will probably feel it. But you may want to take a moment to consider what you have in common with the person and determine whether chemistry is really lacking.


Try asking yourself some simple questions to determine if you have chemistry with someone. For example, you might ask, am I attracted to this person? Do we have things in common? Do we share values and beliefs? Do I want to know more about this person? Is it easy to talk to this person? If your answer is yes to any of these questions, then there might be something there.
Don’t try to force chemistry. While it is a good idea to search your feelings before you decide that this date is going nowhere, you should not try to force chemistry to develop either. If you do not feel attracted or interested in someone, then that will probably not change.

, Do not let pre-conceived notions about the person, the date spot, or anything else pre-shape your opinion of the other person. This can interfere with how you determine whether there is any chemistry between the two of you. Excitement and anticipation are fine, but judgement and expectations are not. It is critical that you do not make a judgement before the date begins or the instant the date begins.For example, if your date chooses a restaurant that you dislike as your meeting spot, do not read this as an indication that you will have nothing in common.

, Psychologists and relationship experts claim that you can recognize physical chemistry almost immediately. One of the most important factors for physical chemistry is sexual attraction. If you find yourself attracted to a person during the first moments of your meeting, then there is a good chance that physical chemistry can develop. If there was no initial attraction, there is a good chance physical chemistry may never exist between the two of you.Physical chemistry has been shown to be more important for men in determining whether a second date is possible.

, Compatibility takes a little longer to recognize than physical chemistry, and it can only be discovered through conversation and interaction. Compatibility is about common values, similar life goals, being comfortable with one another, shared experiences and having fun together. Compatibility is essential for the development of a healthy and long-lasting relationship. It can even help to build physical chemistry!Studies have shown that women are more likely to look for compatibility than a man would on a first date.
You may find compatibility based on your college experiences, your interests in sports or literature, a love of travel, experiences in previous relationships, desire for children, and more.

, Chemistry between you and your date may fail to develop if you organize a terrible date. By spending time together and having a good time, you have a better chance of seeing who the other person is and what they are like. Use your imagination when planning a first date so that it reflects you as a person, but you may want to keep these tips in mind.Pick a fun, neutral location. Avoid noisy bars, as you will want to be able to hear your date.
First dates can benefit from having shorter time limits. Consider getting ice cream or a coffee rather than meeting for dinner.
Avoid ambiguous locations that give you no aim. For example, meeting at the mall is probably not a good idea unless there’s a particular cafe you can visit.
Don't go to the movie theater on a first date. You won’t be able to speak with one another!

, There are a number of reasons why you may not feel chemistry from the moment a date begins. If you are nervous or shy, then this can make it hard to determine if there is any chemistry. Do you best to be friendly and relax, and to offer smiles and encouraging looks. This will help give chemistry a chance to develop.If you are nervous try admitting it. This may help your partner open up. Try saying something like, I am sorry I am not saying much. I am a little nervous.”
Ask questions to encourage conversation. You might ask something like, “What do you like to do on the weekend?” Or, “Where are your favorite places to travel?”
Avoid asking personal questions on a first date. People have differing levels of privacy and might not feel comfortable sharing everything. For example, it is fine to ask what someone does for a job, but you should not ask how much money someone makes.

Check off the symptoms of abusive or manipulative partners.,
Keep your ear to the ground for troubling stories or rumors about your partner.,
Keep your friends close -- especially if he/she is trying to cut them out of the picture.,
Show excessive jealousy or possessiveness the door.,
Walk out on double standards and can't-win situations.,
Ignore their sweet, fake attempts to make nice.",How to Recognize a Manipulative or Controlling Relationship1," Read over the following bullets. Answer honestly and without justifying your partner's behavior (don't say ""Well, she's not like that ALL the time,"" or ""It's only happened once or twice--"" if it happened at all it's an issue!). Simply answer yes or no. Even 3-4 yeses mean it is time to get out and get with someone who treats you with the respect you deserve. Does your partner::


Embarrass or make fun of you in front of your friends or family?
Put down your accomplishments or discourage your goals?
Make you feel like you are unable to make decisions?
Use intimidation, guilt, or threats to gain compliance?
Tell you what you can and cannot wear?
Tell you what you need to do with your hair?
Tell you that you are nothing without them, or they are nothing without you?
Treat you roughly without your consent - grab, push, pinch, shove or hit you?
Call you several times a night or show up to make sure you are where you said you would be?
Use drugs or alcohol as an excuse for saying hurtful things or abusing you?
Blame you for how they feel or act?
Pressure you sexually for things you aren’t ready for?
Make you feel like there ""is no way out"" of the relationship?
Prevent you from doing things you want - like spending time with your friends or family?
Try to keep you from leaving after a fight or leave you somewhere after a fight to ""teach you a lesson""?;
, Hearing multiple versions of the ""same"" story? Do their friends tell you things about your partner that you've never heard, or that your partner flat-out contradicted? Half-truths and selective memories often mean they're shaping the ""truth"" for you. This is a major red-flag for manipulation, and you best get to the bottom of it.


When you're being controlled or manipulated, it's usually through half-truths or omissions, not outright lies. There's just enough weirdness to make you stop and think, but not quite enough to get you to re-evaluate the entire relationship.
If this happens more than once, STOP and remind yourself that this isn't the first time you've had this reaction. Start analyzing discrepancies between what your spouse/significant other said and what your friends say. If there are a lot of them, call him/her out on them. If his/her reaction or answers don't satisfy, it is time to re-evaluate in a major way.

, Cutting you off from the friends and family helps her/him gain dominance over you. Then, because they are so terrible, they make you think that it's your decision to leave them. If they're constantly talking behind your friends' backs, making jokes about your family, or making a big scene every time you leave to be with pals, then screw that relationship and move on.


Controlling people love to make tension and drama. They'll stir up the pot by pushing people, acting passive aggressive, and initiating conflict. Then, like ""innocent"" little children by a broken lamp, they'll put their hands up and blame it on your friends and family.
It's much easier for him/her to control you when you've decided there is too much tension between your loved ones and your mate, and soon, you have no one but her/him to turn to.

, If your partner is protective of you, that's sweet. If they're bizarrely over-protective, it's scary and super annoying. Does she/he interrogate you if you aren't home exactly on time, or if you go out for any reason? Do they question you too intensely about why you were talking to another person? Does your partner tell you that you don't care about them if you spend time with a friend?


A little jealousy is normal, even cute. But it shouldn't affect your daily relationships. Jealousy means they don't trust you. And if they don't trust you, they aren't worth dating.

, It's okay for your partner to be two hours late, but you get attacked if you're five minutes off schedule? It's ""perfectly innocent"" when they flirt but you're accused of infidelity for saying ""Hey?"" If you save money then you're being too stingy, if you spend it you're careless with money. No matter what you do, you are at fault -- and this kind of bullcrap can't stand. These are just games meant to screw with your head, and are common in controlling-manipulative relationships. You're not going to win, so don't play the game. Get out!

, He/she does something that is totally unacceptable then asks your forgiveness. They tell you they realize they were wrong, and promises to change. They seem utterly sincere and convincing — and this is what makes them such master manipulators. They're using you -- the compassionate, kind one-- and turning your kindness against you. Watch for the bad behavior to resume as soon as they believe they have you hooked and complacent again. Then watch as they apologize again, rinse, and repeat.


At this point he/she may even tearfully say she/he wants your help to change, particularly if you have let them know that you will not tolerate such things again. They may bring you lavish gifts and attempt to sweep you off your feet again. It's up to you whether to give them a second chance or not. If they betray your trust again, though, cut through the crap and cut them out of your life.

Look for signs that this churchgoer is behaving in a toxic way.,
Check that your own attitude is in order before discussing anything.,
Suggest a conversation.,
Begin the conversation by clarifying how the words or behavior of the toxic person have caused you to feel.,
Seek to make the toxic church member accountable for his or her actions.,
Consult a pastor or spiritual authority.,
Forgive.",How to Deal With Toxic Relationships in Church," Does this person seem to feel compelled to act superior because he or she has unrealistic expectations of church life? Some faith believers are driven beyond faith into keeping score of who is ""the most religious."" This is a form of ""religious addiction"" rather than worship and can lead some sufferers to assume that they're better than others, simply because they consider that they believe more strongly or in a particular preferred way. This is a form of intolerance and willful blindness that can make it more difficult for you to discuss the issue but it is important to be aware that it might be a possibility. Other things that might indicate toxic behavior include:


Be aware that a religious addict often feels no sense of accountability to others. This means that if you're not conforming to his or her way of worshiping or seeing the world, then you may be considered a fair target for insulting or undermining. Do you feel like this is happening to you?
Does this person seem distraught, overwrought, exhausted physically and/or emotionally? This might be a sign of obsessing about their faith rather than living a life in faith, leaving the person open to feeling it's okay to hurt others because he or she already feels so much pain.
Does this person use threats or seek to intimidate you? Is this person obsessed with ""shaming"" you? Does this person seem to equate you with ""them"" (outside of the church), while he or she is ""us"" (the church)? There is no place for any of these attitudes and actions in a church environment––it's definitely toxic behavior.
Does this person try to label you? For example, does he or she insist that ""you are deceived"" or ""you are faithless""? This is another sign of toxic behavior.
Does this person insist that his or her accountability is only to God and believes that he or she is invested with the right to judge what God thinks of you? This lack of behaving like a basic, decent human being shows a lack of accountability and is a way to avoid being caring and kind––it is plain toxic.;
, In what ways have you possibly contributed to the toxic state of your relationship with this person? Maybe you have said or done something that was inflammatory or uncaring. If so, you're going to have to own your part in this and be ready to apologize for it. The good thing is that seeing your remorse and willingness to move forward will often help to open a way for the other party to try the same.

, Tell this person that you really need to speak to him or her in person. Set a date that is good for both of you, and find a public yet quiet place to meet. A restaurant or coffee shop is best, because it is easier to talk over food or treats.


You may like to pray before you meet. This can set your mind at ease and keep you focused on the purpose of your meeting and the love you wish to convey.

, Keep to ""I"" statements and avoid trying to pin blame on this person for actions or things said––keep the conversation as factual as possible and focused on what it's done to your feelings.


Keep the tone of the conversation light. If you shout, you risk escalating the conversation to a screaming match. Even if the other person is speaking loudly, you need to act above reproach.

, While keeping the tone of the conversation light, make it clear that you do not see any person in the church as having a special or pre-destined role to act morally superior over you or anybody else in the church environment. Inform him or her that everyone who attends worship at your church is an equal and each person is deserving of mutual respect and support. Make it clear that you feel that each church attendee has a responsibility to create a sense of belonging among all churchgoers and to avoid sowing disharmony.


If you feel it will assist, bring along a Bible to highlight your points. This way, you can show them where in the Word is your reasoning. The Letters of Paul contain many references to loving one another.
Note: do not force the Bible on them. The Word of God is not to be used to be used to hurt people.

, If needed, consult your pastor or spiritual authority. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, this person will refuse to reconcile. If this is the case, talk to a spiritual authority who can intervene and seek to mediate the situation to every person's satisfaction.


Bringing in someone who is excellent at dealing with difficult personalities is essential if the toxic person is behaving like an addict or a tyrant.
If you're concerned that it is your pastor who is behaving in a toxic way, seek help from outside your church. In this case, you may need to give serious consideration to changing churches––a toxic leader can be extremely destructive of the church community.

, Even if this person does not repent to you, you need to move on. Holding a grudge only hurts you. Remember that forgiveness does not mean complacency or continuing to submit yourself to the challenging person's arrogance and toxic ways. It is instead about realizing that this person has a problem and refuses to change, all while not letting this deter you from continuing to enjoy your role in the church. Find ways to manage around this toxic person and to build a good support team who recognize the toxic behavior without condoning it.


Cut this person out of your emotional framework. Be polite but be distant and don't engage with the person any further.
Continue to pray for this person and to care about his or her recovery from being toxic.
Avoid communicating with this person directly unless needed and do not play his or her games or let this person ""push your buttons"".
Stop feeling guilty about the aspersions he or she attempts to cast on you. Realize the anger, frustration and superiority for what it is––deep-seated issues this person needs to resolve within him- or herself and through dialog with God.
Keep your anger and irritation to yourself when this toxic person is about. Don't let him or her see that the insults or attempts to shame you are having any impact. Just be polite and kind on the surface and deal with your negative emotions later through prayer and talking to people you trust.

Cool down.,

Listen for underlying emotional needs.,
Summarize what is discussed to assure you understand.",How to Fix a Huge Argument with Your Girlfriend," You cannot expect to resolve an argument immediately after it has occurred. In the wake of a disagreement, take some time to cool down. Take a few hours, even a few days, to cool down and process your emotions properly. Take a long walk, go see a friend, watch a movie. Engage in relaxing activities until you've calmed down enough to look at the situation objectively.Don't: storm off without saying anything.Do: say ""I'm upset and need some time to cool down. Can we talk about this tomorrow?""

, Fights rarely happen over nothing. Take some time to analyze what caused the fight and whether there is anything you could have done differently in the situation.


Review what occurred. Why did you start fighting? What triggered the argument? What was said? Do you regret anything you said? Why or why not?Keep in mind memory is subjective, especially in stressful situations. It's likely your girlfriend might remember certain aspect of the fight differently than you. This is normal. It does not necessarily mean one of you is being untruthful. It's just that stress can cause memories to be inaccurate., After an argument, you need to accept and experience your feelings. While we may dislike emotions like anger and sadness, it's important to acknowledge them rather than ignore them. Stifling your feelings can cause an explosion down the road.


Accept that emotions are not always rational. If your girlfriend hurt your feelings, for example, logically knowing she did not mean to do so might not help you let it go. Know that you and your girlfriend are both entitled to an emotional response to a disagreement, even if that response is not entirely logical.Don't: shout ""How could you do this?!""Do: say ""I'm angry because you broke the promise you made yesterday.""


, After you both have calmed down, suggest a time to discuss your conflict. After a big argument, it's important you schedule time to talk to assure you are both calm going into the discussion.Choose a time to talk where there aren't outside constrictions on time. Pick a week or weekend night when neither one of you has to work early in the morning. Aim to talk in the early evening sometime after dinner so hunger and sleepiness cannot interfere with your conversation.If you do not live together, try to choose a place that's a neutral ground. While you might feel odd discussing your relationship in public, a neutral ground might assure no one feels uncomfortable. You can pick a place where not many people are around, like a spacious, quiet coffee shop or a public park that's not usually crowded., When discussing your conflict, use your body language to demonstrate that you are open to dialogue. This can allow the discussion to happen in a relaxed, effective way.Make eye contact. Nod occasionally to show you are listening. Never cross your arms or do anything that makes you look tense. Try to avoid nervous tics, like fiddling with your clothing or ringing your hands.Nod on occasion, as this gives a non-verbal indication you are listening to what is being said., When discussing your argument, use solid verbal communication as well. Your girlfriend needs to know you are open to working things out, so make sure you communicate with her effectively in the aftermath of a fight.


Be clear and concise when speaking. Do not include too many details and try to get to the point of what you're going to say. Do not interrupt your girlfriend when she's talking. Always ask if she understands what you're saying. Ask for clarification if she says anything you do not understand.Use ""I"" statements. These assure that you're expressing your own feelings rather than placing objective judgment on the situation. For example, instead of saying ""You overreacted about me being late and embarrassed me in front of your friends"" say something like ""I felt embarrassed when you called me out on being late in front of your friends."", It can be very frustrating to feel someone is not validating your feelings in a romantic relationship. Even if you do not agree with your girlfriend's assessment of a situation, make sure you strive to make her feel that her feelings are validated. Often, the simple act of allowing someone to feel the way they do removes a lot of tension from a situation. This releases pent up negative energy and will make your girlfriend feel like you genuinely care about making her happy.Don't: say ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but it was just a harmless joke.""Do: say ""I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I'm sorry I made you upset."", Most couples will have a few issues about which they cannot agree. This is normal, as humans are unique. Take an argument as an opportunity to figure out where the two of you differ and how you can reconcile these differences. If you have different expectations regarding time together, the relationship as a whole, or lifestyle choices, it's important to identify them and find a solution.


See if you can figure out if there's an underlying issue that drove your argument. If you had a big argument, it's doubtful it was over a minor matter. Try and figure out where you disagree and what you can do to reconcile the disagreement. Sometimes simply acknowledging that you feel differently about a subject can help ease tensions. The two of you will end up taking certain things less personally if you understand where you differ personality wise.Don't: force your girlfriend (or yourself) to change on every point of disagreement.Do: suggest ways to limit conflict, such as avoiding contentious activities or topics while you're together.


, After contemplating your actions and role in the argument, apologize for any wrongdoing. Make the apology as specific and sincere as possible, to demonstrate that you have heard and understood your girlfriend's concerns.

Don't: try to defend your actions with a ""but..."" or a reference to your girlfriend's behavior.Do: accept her reaction calmly, even if it's ""Yes, you were a jerk.""

, When you notice a problem is brewing, do not ignore it. Instead, discuss the issue before it becomes a large problem. This way you can prevent future blow-ups.Letting things bottle up means when the next argument happens you'll end up bringing things up from the past. This can make your girlfriend feel attacked and bombarded. When a problem arises, address immediately. Even a small issue can lead you to build resentment over time., Anger can make it hard to respond to a situation rationally. People often lash out in anger and end up alienating those close to them. Try to work with your girlfriend on finding a way to resolve issues without succumbing to anger. A good way to do so is to take 5 minutes to express your feelings when you have a disagreement rather than immediately trying to talk., Fights are often related to the fact certain emotional needs are being neglected. When your girlfriend is upset or frustrated with you, try to examine whether she has needs you're failing to meet. Have you been distance lately? Have you been busy to the point you're not spending as much time with her? Consider whether you're not meeting your girlfriend's needs and what you can do to help meet them., After an argument, always take a moment to summarize what was discussed. How do you feel? How does your girlfriend feel? How are you both willing to work on the situation to assure it won't happen again? Taking five minutes to summarize a situation after an argument can prevent the argument from reoccurring."

Be honest with yourself, even though it is going to hurt.,
Think about how your partner makes you feel.,
Take a look at the rest of your relationships.,
Ignore your own excuses for them -- you're just biased because you are in love.,
Stop hating yourself for loving someone; dump them ASAP.",How to Recognize a Manipulative or Controlling Relationship2," This is not going to be fun -- manipulative relationships never are. But you have to wade deep into your crappy feelings and personal worries or you're never going to understand things. Is this relationship healthy, or is it unhealthy? Try to be objective as you analyze how things have changed since this relationship began.


Let's be honest: sex clouds your judgment. Remove sex from the equation immediately. It should never be the only reason you're with someone. It doesn't matter how hot they are.

, You are the most important person in your own life, aren't you? Don't disregard your feelings as worthless, biased, or over reactionary. If you feel like crap in this relationship, then you're being treated like crap. End of story -- get out of there. This is especially true if you:


Feel scared of how your partner will act, or react.
Feel responsible for your partner's feelings.
Make excuses to other people for your partner’s behavior.
Believe it's all your fault.
Avoid anything that causes conflict or makes your partner angry.
Feel like your partner is never happy with you.
Always do what your partner wants you to do instead of what you want.
Stay with your partner because you are afraid of what your partner would do if you broke up.

, Are your family relationships and friendships increasingly filled with tension every time your partner's name comes up, or with your partner when their names come up? Red flags should go up if everyone who cares about you is becoming worried or being pushed away by your partner.


Does this person bring out your best or worst traits? You want to love yourself at all times -- because you're awesome. If you don't feel great, it's likely because their negative energy is sucking you down to their manipulative level.
Be aware of the way he/she behaves with your family and friends, especially if she/he antagonizes them, argues with them, or talks crap about them constantly.
If you decided it is just ""easier"" to ignore your friends and family, you've let the manipulating monster win. It's time to break this toxic relationship off.

, Falling head over heels isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you can't leave your head in the sand for too long. Your starry-eyed affection can make you willfully close your eyes to warning signals, even as friends and family tell you to wake up. You need to have some ""you time"" to find out what's what. Step aside from the relationship for a few days, however you can, and ask yourself:


Do you find yourself apologizing or defending your significant other's behavior toward you? You shouldn't have to defend a relationship with someone -- they should be good enough for you that it is obvious why you're together.
Are you hiding things from people? You should have privacy, of course, but you shouldn't be hiding a monster under the bed. The problem isn't keeping it a secret, its' that you are dating someone so terrible you have to keep a secret in the first place.
Do you always do what he or she wants, instead of you? You don't date someone because you want another boss in your life, do you? You have a right to your opinion, and you have a right to have your opinion respected -- forget about people who don't oblige.
Have you lost touch with your old friends and family? No matter how in love you are, you should never feel like you're cut off from old pals because of your new flame. They're trying to isolate you because you're easier to control -- especially if they're always throwing shade on your friends and family.

, Realize that they're amazing — on the surface — and you shouldn't beat yourself up for being attracted to that. Manipulators are often an odd mix of intelligence and charm-- it's how they get so manipulative. The best thing to do is just drop them from your life. These people are shallow and unworthy of your time, and it is their fault, not yours. The only reason they are manipulating you is because you're better than them -- so rock it and get the heck out of their life.


You have to acknowledge that they are using your love for them against you to keep you trapped in the relationship. You are not at fault for loving them. They are at fault for using your love as leverage.

However, it allows you both to move your arms freely., It’s important to find a position that works for both of you.

Use the momentum of the embrace to roll her gently away from your arm, which you can then free., If you can’t feel your arm and you can’t gently pry it loose, you might need to speak up. Be gentle but clear, saying something like: “Sweetheart, could you let me get my arm out from under you?” Even though it might feel awkward in the moment, remember that open communication is better than simmering resentment., If your partner is sleeping peacefully and your arm isn’t in too much agony, you might choose to wait it out. Sooner or later, he’s likely to shift positions, allowing you to free your arm.

Watch your tone.,
Keep your beliefs between the two of you.,
Avoid speaking negatively towards one another.,
Practice listening, instead of speaking.,
Remember how important your relationship is.",How to Deal with Political Discord in a Relationship1," When people become hurt during disagreements, it is often because one person feels like the other is being disrespectful towards them. This commonly occurs because of the tone or edge in their voice. Keeping condescending attitudes out of the discussion may stop hard feelings from forming.


When you feel yourself getting worked up and potentially getting an attitude, take a break from the conversation. You can say, “I need to take a break for a minute. I'm starting to get upset and I do not want to say something I do not mean or say it with an attitude.”
Excusing yourself from the conversation in this manner is respectful and can prevent a huge fight from occurring.;
, There is no need to drag anyone else into your political conversations. There also isn’t a need to talk badly about your partner’s politics to anyone, particularly your children. Instead of causing more issues by bringing others into your disagreements, simply keep the political talk between you and your partner.


You can talk to your children about politics, just try to keep your own beliefs and opinions to yourself, especially when they differ from your significant other’s. Stick with the basics and avoid inserting anything else other than the facts.
If your friends or family wish to discuss politics with you, simply say, “I don’t like to talk politics with friends or family, so let’s discuss something else.” Voicing your opinion in a calm way allows you to move on and keep the relationship intact., It’s common to hear of Democrats and Republicans trading insults, especially during debates. Doing this with your partner, however, is unacceptable. Although you have a difference of opinion when it comes to politics, you should refrain from insults and hitting below the belt to get your point across.Remember that politics is not black or white, good or evil — it is a spectrum, and there can be a lot of gray area. Don't assume something about the other person's beliefs or personality based simply on their political alignment. They don't necessarily agree with each and every viewpoint being presented by one side. People, and politics, are complex, and it's not necessarily a case of ""all or nothing.""

, In a majority of conversations, people don’t listen as intently as they should. Instead, they are simply waiting for the other person to stop talking so that they can then begin to speak. Not fully hearing your partner can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. To prevent this, fully listen to what your partner has to say and then formulate a response.


It may take some practice and a lot of self-restraint to resist defending yourself and your beliefs before allowing your partner to speak their mind. However, if you do so, you’ll likely find that your discussions may not end in as many arguments.
You can also ask your partner to do the same. You could say, “I am going to do my best to listen intently to what you have to say before I interject my opinion. I think if we both practiced this type of listening, we could better understand each other.”If your partner is taking about a topic you're not familiar with, be honest and open about it. You might say something like, ""I'm not familiar with that topic so I can't comment on it, but I'll do my best to educate myself on it.""

, In all of this, remember how you feel about your partner. There’s a reason why you are together in the first place. Instead of coming back with a cutting response, think about how much you love each other and if winning the conversation is worth potentially damaging your relationship.


Simply taking a deep breath and choosing to walk away from the conversation may stop a disagreement from occurring in which feelings are hurt. Instead, be the bigger person and realize that your relationship is more important than what is occurring in politics."
"
Pay attention to what you have in common.,
Appreciate that your other half has their own thoughts and ideas.,
Learn to fight “healthy.” Having a partner who disagrees with you provides the perfect opportunity to learn how to have an argument in a respectful and healthy manner.",How to Deal with Political Discord in a Relationship2," Although you may have some differences in opinion, chances are, you agree somewhere. Even if it is something small, it is something you can build upon. Use this common ground as a foundation to launch into a respectful conversation.


For instance, you could say, “I know we disagree on this matter, but we have the same opinion when it comes to this. Let’s focus on what we agree about instead of what we disagree on.” Starting off on a positive note helps to make the conversation more productive and hopefully, less confrontational., Although you may not like their opinions, at least your partner is knowledgeable and confident enough to formulate their own thoughts and beliefs.


You likely wouldn’t want to be with someone who conformed and agreed with every opinion you had. Be thankful that they don’t follow the crowd and are comfortable enough in their own skin to speak up, even if their opinion isn’t popular.A friend or partner who has different political views offers a great opportunity for you to test your own open-mindedness. Rather than disagreeing for the sake of disagreement, use your differences to learn. Take advantage of the information your partner has and use it as an educational opportunity.

, You can figure out how to have a debate with someone without using insults and cutting words. This can also help you in other situations, such as at work or with other family members.


While discussing your opinions, take care to keep your voice level and calm. Also, avoid using derogatory words and attempt to talk to your partner the way you would want them to talk to you. If you feel your partner is becoming disrespectful, point it out in a polite way so they can understand why what they said or how they are behaving is inappropriate, and they hopefully won’t do it again."
"
Avoid talking about it.,
Support your spouse as they work out their beliefs.,
Refrain from talking negatively about the political views of others.,
Look towards the future.",How to Deal with Political Discord in a Relationship3," If it’s getting to the point where you aren’t able to have a discussion about politics without a huge fight taking place, it’s time to take a break from the topic. Agree to take time off from discussing politics at all. Together, decide on an appropriate time for the break. Perhaps after the break, you can begin to start discussing politics again.


To approach the subject you could say, “I think we need to stop talking politics for a little while. It seems like we fight more now because of the subject, and I love you too much to let this affect our relationship.”
Voicing that your concern about the relationship is the driving force behind this decision will show your partner you care about the quality of the relationship and want to make it work., Your spouse may think they stand with a certain political party, but they may also still be working out their beliefs. Being supportive and withholding from judgment or criticism can help them to develop their political values and opinions.


Part of being in a relationship is helping the other person become the best they can be. Let them know that you are there for them and leave your personal opinions out of the equation, unless they are asked for.
For instance, you could tell your partner, “Although we have a difference of opinion, I respect that you are working to develop your own political beliefs. I will be here to support and help you in any way that I can.” Letting them know that you want them to grow and become well-informed and strong in their convictions will show that you are able to put politics aside and focus on the bigger picture., If you and your partner differ politically, they likely aren’t going to want to hear what you have to say about other people whose views you oppose. Not only will your partner probably think you are negatively speaking about their own views, but they may take offense that you don’t seem to respect differences of opinion.


Instead, simply don’t comment on other people’s political views, especially if you know it is a hot topic for your partner.
You can also ask your partner to respect your loved ones as well, by not criticizing their political views. Showing this type of mutual respect can help your relationship become stronger., When the dust settles, your relationship will likely not be affected by anything a politician does. Chances are, you and your partner will go about your everyday lives and still enjoy spending time with each other. You probably won’t even talk about politics again until another election occurs. Remember this when the next heated discussion occurs."

Take the time to be sure it’s what you want.,

Break up in person.,
Be honest, open, and direct.,
Be kind and considerate.,
Be prepared for negative emotions.,
Be respectful.,
Be firm.,
Encourage your ex to self-care.,
Practice self-care yourself.,
Avoid contact afterward.",How to End a Relationship With a Capricorn," Breaking off a relationship, especially a long-term one, is a big and difficult decision. After all, you don’t want to hurt the person you're with just because you're having a couple doubts. Moreover, Capricorns rarely give second chances, so be sure this is what you want.Ask yourself things like:Will I feel better about things if we break up?
How would I feel tomorrow if I woke up and had gone through with the breakup?
How will I feel tomorrow if I haven’t gone through with it?
Will I have any regrets if I do or don’t do this?
Do I want to give this another shot?;
, The conversation to break up with your significant other is going to be tough, but it will help if you plan what you want to say. Having a plan will also help stop you from saying anything you may regret later, especially if things get heated.


Try opening with something nice, like, “you're a really great person,” or “we’ve had a lot of great times together.”
When you're ready to move on to discussing why you want to break up, talk about why you feel you aren't a good match. Capricorns like order and stability,so maybe you feel like you need more spontaneity in your life.
Similarly, Capricorns appreciate hard work and responsibility, and maybe those aren't things that are important to you. Whatever your differences, have a list of issues ready that you want to bring up.

, When you’ve been dating someone for longer than a month, it’s basic and common courtesy to break up in person, or at least over the phone. Don’t send an email, text message, or use social media to break the news. One reason this is important is because it shows the other person that you care and have respect for his or her feelings.
It also gives you a chance to explain yourself, and gives the other person an opportunity to ask questions.

, You’ve already run through in your head all the reasons you want to break up, and now it’s time to communicate those reasons. Try to stick with the facts. Depending on your reasons for wanting to break up, you can say clear things like:“We have different priorities,” or “we want different things in life”
“We’re too dissimilar, and I don’t think those differences can be reconciled”
“I want to focus on my career/studies right now”
“I'm not ready to make this kind of commitment”

, While it’s important to be honest with the other person, this doesn’t mean you have to be mean or inconsiderate. Your partner is going to be hurt by your decision already, so you can try to make the process easier by being sensitive.Keep in mind that Capricorns tend to be shy and are afraid of rejection, so he or she may react very strongly to your desire to break up.Being sympathetic and understanding may make the break up a little easier on you both.
Instead of pointing out perceived flaws with the other person’s personality or behavior, keep the discussion focused on why the relationship isn't working for you.For instance, rather than saying “You’re too focused on work,” rephrase this as “I need a partner I can spend more time with”

, As if a breakup weren’t hard enough, Capricorns have been known to be jealous and angry when it comes to matters of love and broken hearts. This is largely because Capricorns can have a very strong instinct for self-preservation, and that means being defensive and unforgiving when they're hurt.Despite having spent weeks, months, or even years with this person, be ready to see a side of his or her personality that you’ve never seen before.
For example, be ready for accusations, jealousy, and having all the blame leveled at you.

, Even if your ex is acting jealous or irrational after the breakup, take the moral high ground and ignore the behavior rather than responding in kind. Just as you wouldn’t appreciate your ex gossiping, lying, or spilling secrets about you, so too should you be respectful of the other person’s feelings and privacy.

, Once you’ve made up your mind, don’t let the other person—or anyone else—change it. Capricorns can be stubborn and set in their ways,so if your ex thinks you two should still be together, it’s possible that he or she may try to convince you of the same.


Once Capricorns commit to a person, their natural loyalty leads them to preserve that relationship, and they have a hard time letting go.To help keep your mind off the breakup and to remind yourself how great life can be without the other person, try reconnecting with old friends, rekindling your love of old hobbies, and taking time to care for yourself.

, You can listen and be considerate of the other person’s feelings, but you can't take responsibility for him or her.In the end, it’s up to him or her to get through the breakup alone and with other friends and family. You can encourage this by:


Suggesting that he or she take some time away to think and process what's happened.
Recommending that he or she spend more time with other loved ones.
Reassuring the other person that life will go on and that you'll both be better off for the change.
Reminding your ex that while the breakup is painful, the hurt will become easier to manage.

, A breakup is a difficult time, and even if you were the one to end the relationship, you will still experience a sense of loss and a period of grief. To help get through this time, take your own advice about self-care:Get out and have fun with friends and family.
Take time to relax and pamper yourself.
If possible, consider taking a couple days off work.
Consider going on a holiday or weekend getaway.
Get out and meet new people and try new things.

, The only way to truly heal and move on after a breakup is to have time and distance from the person you’ve broken up with. After all, you decided to end the relationship for a reason, so why would you carry on as though you were still together after breaking up?


Experts recommend at least eight weeks with no contact, and this means no meetings, no phone calls, and definitely no sex."
"
Reflect on your feelings.,
Understand that feeling guilty and unsure is normal.,
Ask yourself if it is best to end the relationship sooner rather than later.",How to End a Short Term Relationship1," Examine all of the reasons why you want to end the relationship. Make a pros and cons list if you really need to outline the reasons the relationship won’t work. This will help you be sure that you are making the right decision by ending the relationship early.;
, It is ok and even normal to be unsure about breaking off the new relationship. You may feel guilty for hurting your partner’s feelings. You may feel like you should give the relationship more time to see if your feelings change., Many times, dragging out a relationship will only make you and your partner more invested in the relationship. If you feel like this will be the case, it is best to end the relationship sooner. If you think that the relationship might be healed, you can consider giving it more time."
"
Attend therapy sessions to evaluate the problem and your current psychological condition.,
Use your therapist's/support group's balanced, objective feedback to help you through the grieving process you are experiencing now that your NPD has stopped recognizing you as a primary supplier, and is engaging in the behaviors that hurt you so much.

,
If you are still with your NPD, they will do everything they can to discourage you from doing this: they will attempt to embarrass you, accuse you of being imbalanced (and that's why ""you"" need therapy, they will say), disrupt your schedule so you can't make your meetings / appointments - anything to prevent you from getting help from outside.,
Learn everything you can about NPD.,
Stop all contact with your NPD abuser.,
Learn to defend yourself.,
Start a journal - today.,
Get rid of every reminder of your NPD - take that energy out of your home and your environment.,
Find new friends, and cultivate new **non-romantic** relationships.,
Give yourself time to grieve.",How to End a Narcissistic Relationship," If your insurance won't cover it, or if you can't afford individual sessions, find a support team. Most women's advocate groups and domestic abuse shelters can give you excellent references. And yes, you are a victim of abuse. Use the therapy to learn everything you can about what can you do and say, and the intuitive signs you keep dismissing in yourself, that make you a perfect NPD (narcissistic personality disorder) victim.;
,,


The more s/he does this, the more you can be assured that you need the help, and the more determined you should be about getting it.

, Become an NPD expert. There are tremendous resources literally available at your fingertips through any web-connected computer, just like the message you're reading right now. And when you think you know it all, learn more. There is no truer statement made, in the case of an NPD victim, than this: knowledge is power.

, Know this: being with a narcissist is very much like being addicted to a narcotic -- wonderful at first - so wonderful that you keep longing for that initial high, and keep ""taking the drug"" (taking his/her abuse) hoping to get that amazing high again. And just as with a narcotic addiction, that initial high will never happen again. S/he'll lay out the lures for you, but see #2 above.


The more you know about NPD, the easier it will be to recognize that all s/he is doing is baiting a hook, and you know what happens when fish bite on a baited hook.






But the only way you can avoid the lures is to make it impossible for him/her to leave them in your path. This step is critical: *no* contact. Read that again: ***no*** contact.






In some cases, NPD victims actually have to move, where violence or other threats are imminent from their abuser for the act of leaving them. If that is your case, and you cannot or do not want to move, engage your support group and local law enforcement officials in what you are doing and why; make them aware that you are afraid for your safety, and they will, in most cases, help you.






Get a restraining order if you have to (although most NPDs are ""above the law,"" and that would be meaningless to them).







, Take a martial arts course, or learn to handle and effectively and comfortably use a weapon until it is second nature, get a license for it (if necessary), and buy one for yourself. Buy a dog of a breed well-known for its owner-protective qualities, and make that creature your best friend above all others. Make it unsafe for your *abuser* to contact *you*, instead of the other way around. Not only will you be providing yourself (and your children, where applicable) some measure of protection from further abuse, but you will build confidence and strength and belief in yourself -- all qualities that your NPD abuser has systematically eroded, and which s/he is counting on you never having again. Turn the tables!

, Find a notebook at any local drugstore, keep a pen handy, and write down your thoughts every day. Most especially, start a list at the back of it of all the behaviors, all the things s/he has done, that even in the beginning caused you to have doubts. Keep working on your list, every day, as you remember things. Its purpose will serve you in several ways, the two most important of which are the following: a- you can go back and read it when you are feeling ""weak"" (need your ""drug"" again) and need to be reminded of the true nature of this soulless person with whom you have shared your heart; and b- it becomes very cathartic over time. You find yourself realizing that this person is truly mentally ill, and that there is nothing wrong with you; you just became a target, and you are now ready to move out of the firing range.

, Find everything in your possession that were the early gifts from your NPD, and/or the (usually cheaper, less significant) later attempts to schmooze you back into compliance so you continued to supply his/her narcissistic needs. Eject every item from your life. Donate them to charity, sell them, give them away, or throw them away, even if you like them.

, Perhaps the most amazing discovery you may make is that suddenly all kinds of genuinely nice people were coming into my life. Give yourself that same opportunity! Join a pottery class, or a yoga class, or a book club, or a birding group - whatever interests you! It doesn't have to cost money. Just put yourself outside of your home, and into the company of new people, and learn again how wonderful it is to have an active, normal social life without this huge black cloud dominating it.

, *don't* jump back into a relationship. Not for a while, anyway. The sooner you do so, the higher the likelihood that you will attract and get involved with another NPD. See #1 and #2 above. Especially as you become more aware, through counseling and/or your support team, that an NPD is incapable of loving, you become aware that you are, in effect, a widow/-er, yet even worse. Not only has the relationship that you thought was perfect died, but that person you were involved with, the NPD, is not the person you fell in love with. You fell in love with something that never existed, and cannot exist, for those afflicted with this mental illness. So your partner is not only ""dead"", but they never actually lived. You have to mourn your loss not of what was, but of what you believed could have been: but the sad fact is that your real loss is that it was all an illusion. Your belief was, and is, a false one. This person never loved you, and never could love you, because s/he is incapable of it. S/he is mentally ill. It does not have the capacity to be a he or a she. There was no ""him."" There was just this ""it,"" and its entire purpose in my life was to suck mine out of me, to fill the emptiness that it feels inside itself. This sounds cruel, but the cruelty, in reality, has been against you, and you have a lot of healing to do. So take the time. Grieve. Invest in yourself. See steps 1-7 above, and focus on you, because no one else has been doing so for the entire duration of your NPD relationship - not even you. When you have given yourself back to you, then you can think about what you want to do next. Until then, be ""selfish."" Yes. Does that sound familiar? It does because that's what your NPD would say, along with all the other ""faults"" s/he said about you which were actually him/her projecting what s/he knows to be his/her deficits - see #2 above. Love yourself, just as you are, and give yourself time to learn once again how lovable you are to others...

Attempt to talk in person.,
Remain positive.,
Be confident.,
Remain firm in your decision.,
Be prepared to leave.",How to End a Short Term Relationship2," If it is not possible to talk face-to-face, call your partner on the phone. Try to avoid texting, emailing, or messaging on social media. Definitely don’t end the relationship by avoiding your partner altogether or ""ghosting."" Be sure to treat your partner with respect during your conversation, and expect that your partner treat you with respect as well.Choose a neutral location with some degree of privacy. Try to avoid either party’s residence. A local park or cafe is best. This will help keep everyone’s reactions low-key and allow for you to exit quickly if needed., Try to avoid playing the blame game. Discuss the reasons why you need to end the relationship and why it is the best decision for you. If you are honest and respectful with your partner, they are likely to be respectful in return.Don’t say things like, “You are too controlling.” Instead, say something like “I need more space in my life right now.”

, Make sure that your partner understands that this is definitely a breakup. Do not give the impression that you are trying to fix the relationship. This will confuse your partner and make them think that the relationship might work out.Say something definitive like, “I think the relationship is over, and I need to move on;"" or "" ""I know this isn't what you want, but it is what I need.""

, Your partner may not want to end the relationship. They may cry, scream, or beg you to reconsider. Remain calm and be compassionate but don’t allow this to change your mind.


Say something like, “I really hate to hurt you like this but this is what is best for me.”

, Your partner may not react to the news of your breakup well. It would be normal to see them cry or raise their voice. However, it is possible that they become very angry and abusive, either emotionally or physically. This is another reason why it is important to break up with your partner in a public space rather than in either party’s residence.If you think that your partner may become violent, consider breaking up over the phone instead of face-to-face.
If you think that you are in danger you should call the police. Don't hesitate if you feel your safety is threatened — trust your instincts and call for help.

Stop calling and texting them.,
Don’t be tempted by social media.,
Resist the urge to meet up with your ex.",How to End a Short Term Relationship3," Allow the break-up some time before you communicate with your ex again. Both you and your ex need time to heal and move on. Calls and texts immediately after a breakup can be confusing for both sides. Your ex also deserves the chance to move on. Moving on will be difficult for them if you continue to act as though you are not confident in your decision to end the relationship.If you ex calls you, politely say, “I need some space. Please do not contact me for now.”
Do not respond to any further communication. If they continue to contact you, ignore them rather than continue to engage with them and repeat your requests for them to stop.

, Stop commenting on their Facebook page or liking their Instagram post. If the temptation is too much to handle, consider unfollowing them for a while. You can always continue to follow them after you have both moved past the relationship.Unfollowing your ex from social media will help to curb jealousy that may occur as you each move on to the next relationship.

, Breakups, even from short-term relationships, can be difficult. You or your ex might feel guilty or lonely and could become vulnerable and possibly do something that you will regret in a face-to-face meet up. It is important to give yourself and your ex time to heal.


Spend time with your friends and keep busy, distracting yourself with plenty of activities. Breakups are hard no matter what, even if you are certain you want to end the relationship.

Tell him too much information.,
Interrupt sex and make-out sessions.,
Constantly compare him to your ex.",How to Dump Him Without Saying a Word1," While some guys can deal with a clingy girlfriend, this strategy will usually end in a breakup.


Call him every hour, on the hour, “just to check up.” Every time he answers, tell him how much you missed hearing his voice, that you can’t wait to see him again, that you’ve told everything and everyone all about him.
Get mad if he takes too long to answer you. This can be anything from answering a text to answering the phone to answering a question you ask him in person. Make sure you’re dramatic enough to be obnoxious, but not so much that he knows you’re putting on a show
Hang on him. Never stop touching him. Wrap your arms around him while you’re walking, and pout slightly if he asks you if you can just hold hands instead. Say things like “I’ll miss you pookie!” when he gets up at dinner to go to the bathroom.
Be possessive. Get jealous if he ditches you to spend the evening with his sister, if he tells you he’s going to spend a night with his friends, tell him you’ll come too. If he has a really close friend that’s a girl, tell him you don’t feel comfortable with their friendship and that he has to choose between you and her.
Interrupt Boys’ Night, if he has one. Call him in the middle in the throes of an emotional crisis, or, better yet, go over to “surprise” him.;

, Pretend as if his actual name doesn’t exist. Mr. Pookie Bear, Coochikins, and Cupcake are all good choices.

, If he mentions it, get offended and say that you thought he loved you for your personality, not just your appearance.


Stop wearing deodorant. Burp a lot and then laugh about it. If you have to fart, let ‘er rip.

, Hide ‘’nothing’’ about your life. If you had a disgusting surgery, tell it in all its gory details. Tell him explicit stories about your exes, family life, and friendship troubles.

, Nothing will frustrate him more than having to stop sex to deal with something you said.


Stop in the middle of sex and say “I don’t feel like you appreciate me for my personality, I feel like you only appreciate me for my body.”
Laugh or cry while you are having sex.
Call him by another guy’s name, preferably one that he used to be jealous of.
Randomly bring up something you did years ago that you’re ashamed of. “I can’t believe I cut Lucy’s hair in 5th grade. GOD that was mean of me! Do you think I should apologize again?”
Start a serious discussion. Ask him things like, “Do you think I’m a bitch?” or, “What would you do if I told you I was pregnant?” The second one has the added bonus of scaring him, as well.

, If he takes you to a restaurant, say something like, “Oh, Rick took me here! It was such a romantic evening. After dinner we went stargazing and he told me he loved me. It was so romantic.” If he does something you don’t like, say something along the lines of “Rick ‘’never’’ would have done that!""

Choose a neutral place.",How to Dump Your Boyfriend Nicely," It's going to hurt him more if you break up with your boyfriend remotely. Never text dump a boyfriend unless you want to cause him more pain. That's the worst possible way to go about it. Dumping your boyfriend by telephone, Skype, Face Time, over social media, or by email are also cold approaches you shouldn't use. You wouldn't like it if someone did that to you, so don't do it to them.
When you dump your boyfriend to his face, you can show compassion and care. Dumping your boyfriend electronically is too remote and shows disrespect. Also, people can perceive email and texting tone wrong, so he might read things into your words that aren't there.
If you really can't handle telling him to his face, or it's just not possible, choose to write him a heartfelt and detailed letter. Don't type it, either. You are trying to show compassion. He will feel less pain if you make him feel like he did matter to you, but it just didn't work.;
, Ghosting is a term that's become popular recently with some celebrity breakups. When people ghost someone else, they dump them without explanation. They just vanish.


Ghosting is cruel. It makes people feel disrespected and confused. It's the breakup method most guaranteed to cause him pain so, even if it's hard, face your fears and just level with him.
He won't be able to find closure as quickly if you ghost him, which means he's going to stick around a lot longer, trying to contact you and reaching out to figure out what's going on. So if you really want to break up with him, ghosting won't get him out of your life as quickly.

, Sometimes people try to let people down so easily that they end up leading them on. This isn't very nice. It will confuse him and give him false hope.


Don't contact him after you dump him, and don't let him draw you into endless discussions about it. Be final.
Be short and firm. Don't say things like ""I just need some space"" because it will give him false hope. If there is truly none, you need to stand firm and not confuse him. Don't tell him you love him or pay him excessive compliments or touch him in any way. You can show care and that you hope he will be OK, but any signs of overt emotion or touching (even a hug) could lead him to think there's still a chance. That's kind of cruel.
Explain very clearly the parameters of any future relationship. If there is no chance, say it.

, Gossip isn't nice. He's going to be feeling badly enough, so why hurt his ego more by spreading it around?


Let him tell other people, including your circles of friends. And keep the reasons to yourself. If people ask, just say that out of respect for him, you aren't going to share.
If he tells people, don't get too angry. Unless he's lying about you or being excessively mean, he's going to need someone to talk to probably.

, It's tempting to just trot out a cliche. You know, something like, ""It's not you, it's me"" or ""I think we should just be friends."" Nobody wants to be told they're in the friend zone anyway. It sucks, so don't say it. The problem with cliches is we've all heard them before, so they're just not believable. It's going to make him upset or defensive if he thinks you're not being honest. Lines such as ""I just need some time to work on myself,"" or ""I just need space"" instantly spring to mind as top offenders here. It's not that these statements can't possibly be true, it's just that there needs to be a little more than that. He deserves a more specific answer.
A much better approach is to just speak from the heart and be honest. Be very clear, but also be very simple and direct. Just say what's really going on. Maybe you can forge a friendship with him down the road, but if you try to do it right away, things could easily get confused. It's better to put some distance between your relationship and a friendship anyway. So skip the ""let's be friends"" cliche.

, If you really think you didn't do anything wrong, you should examine yourself. Both people are usually to blame in some ways when relationships fail. Or maybe two people just aren't compatible and no one is really to blame.


It's really a horrible move to act rotten to him so he dumps YOU, though. If you want out, dump him, but accept that he's not the only person at fault. If he's truly to blame - for example, if he's been abusive or he cheated on you - put your safety first and don't feel you have to shoulder any blame. No one deserves to be abused or lied to, so retain your self respect and just walk away. In cases where you just aren't that interested anymore or his offenses were more minor, why not shoulder a little of the blame yourself? This will lessen his pain by allowing him to retain pride. If you put all of the blame on him, it will turn into an argument instead of a conversation.
You're already dumping him, so it's not necessary to give him a long list of everything he's done wrong. Avoid excessively blaming language, and make sure your tone is soft and gentle, not angry and accusatory.

, People deserve to know why they're being dumped. You shouldn't go on and on and say hurtful things. But do give him a reason.


Don't stay long. Just give him your reasons - say them kindly, clearly, and quickly - and express empathy toward him. At the same time, once you’ve told him, don’t expect an answer immediately. If he’s in love with you this will probably be breaking his heart. So respect that and let him be. Don’t shower him with questions. He will need a few minutes to let it sink in. Give him those few minutes, and let him have his say, reinforce your message, and then leave.
Boil down your reasoning to a 3-5 sentence summary. This will help you keep it focused.

, A little kindness goes a very long way. It will make it more likely that he won't see you as an enemy, and that he won't grow defensive. If he starts to get angry anyway, don't respond in kind. Don't argue or yell.


Tell him you're sorry. You're sorry it didn't work out the way he hoped it would, and you're sorry that he's hurt. Allow him to react. If he cries or begs, let him say his piece, but don't respond to it. Just stick to your message - kindly.
Thank him. Thank him for the good times you did share, but then reinforce the fact it's just not going to work out. Thank him for anything he did for you or gave to you.
Explain to him that you are sure he will be fine and will be able to find someone new because he is a good person with a lot to offer, but you two are just not right for each other and it's just not going to work out.

, It's just not nice, and worse, he's probably going to find out you lied eventually - and that will make it much, much worse.


That doesn't mean you need to hammer him with details about the new boy you like (if there is one). It just means you shouldn't tell him something that is not true.
How about giving it some time before you jump into a new relationship anyway? Give him some time to heal before he has to see you with someone else (or hear about it).

, It's just downright mean to dump someone when they are going through a crisis in their lives. So you should really pick a time that will work best for him, not you. What's the rush?


Do it during the day. It's better not to dump someone at night (and never do it after they've been drinking or you have). You want this to be a brief conversation, and long drawn out discussions are more likely to happen at night. Longer discussions create more potential for pain.
Morning or lunch is better. But pick a weekend. You don't want to dump him if he has to go right to work. It's unfair to put him in emotional turmoil when he has to show his best side professionally.
Don't dump him on special occasions, like right before the holidays, on his birthday, or right before or on your anniversary. It will make him feel worse.

, It's probably better to dump him in private. That way he won't feel humiliated, and if he shows emotion, no one else will see. You will be able to have a heart-to-heart talk in this situation.


Never, ever dump him when he's with his friends. Give him the ability to tell the rest of the world about the break-up on his own terms. You want to in all cases give him some ability to retain pride.
Do it at his place, not yours. That way, when you're done with the dumping, you can leave on your own terms. If you do it at your house, he may try to prolong the moment or even could make a move on you because he might want to save the relationship. It can be awkward having to ask someone to leave.
The exception to this one is if you have any reason at all to fear for your safety. If he has a problem with anger, do NOT dump him in a private setting. Meet him in a public place like a coffee shop. Bring a friend for support.If he's abusive, don't meet him at all. Have someone else deliver the news or do it in writing.

, You don't want to pick a setting that has any romantic connotation to it. It will make it harder on him, and it could give him mixed messages.


A bar is a terrible idea because alcohol will fuel emotions and make things more dramatic.
That fancy restaurant where you went on a date? It's going to make him feel worse. Instead, pick something neutral, like a coffee shop or go for a walk so you have privacy.

Your boyfriend may ask for an explanation, and while you might not owe him one if he's treated you badly, it's still a good idea for you to understand what your reasons are.
This can help keep you from second-guessing yourself later or regretting your decision.;
, Even though it will help you if you can know why you are dumping your boyfriend, don't feel as though you must make your decision based on all of the pros and cons.


Love is not necessarily rational. While you might be able to come up with all sorts of reasons for staying together that look good on paper, this doesn't mean that you need to stay together, or that it'd be better for you in the long-run if you stick it out.

, If your boyfriend doesn't respect you or if you don't have enough in common, then those are excellent reasons to break up. Don't think, though, that you absolutely have to have good reasons before you can dump your boyfriend.


There are all sorts of reasons for breaking up, and they are all pretty much equally valid.
For example, if you're just not feeling it anymore, then that's a perfectly acceptable reason for breaking up., Once you've made your decision to end your relationship, putting it off for too long will just make you more anxious and keep you in an unfulfilling relationship longer than necessary., At the same time, though, if you rush to break up with your boyfriend without giving it any thought, you could end up saying things you don't mean or that you will later regret.It's better to give it some thought, and then, once you've made your decision to move forward with the break-up, to act with conviction.

, People seem to overwhelmingly agree that it's pretty lame to break up over the phone, let along to dump your boyfriend over email or by text.


If you and your boyfriend have a history together, and if you still care about him, then it's definitely a sign of respect to talk to him face-to-face, even if this means that it will be harder for you emotionally., If your boyfriend is abusive, or if you're worried that he might be violent when you break up, then you shouldn't feel any pressure to meet him face-to-face. Your safety matters most.


If you and your boyfriend are in a long-distance relationship, then you may not want to wait until you are able to see each other again to break up. If at all possible, try to get your boyfriend on video or chat instead of sending him an impersonal text or email., It's funny to read stories about people dumping their lousy boyfriends and girlfriends by taking out newspaper or billboard ads, or even by just changing their Facebook relationship status without first talking to their now-ex.


As tempting as this might be, keep in mind that these moves make your personal business public, that this won't make you look like the bigger person, and that you may eventually regret embarrassing your boyfriend., You may hear advice that it's easier to get your boyfriend to break up with you instead of having to do it yourself by acting obnoxiously or becoming really distant.


These are silly games, and they won't necessary work. Even if they do, and your boyfriend does dump you first, you may have created a pretty bad reputation for yourself, or you might later be ashamed of how you behaved.

, You may find it easier to have this tough conversation with your boyfriend if you first confide in a friend, a sibling, or a parent. If you're unsure about whether or not this is the right move, or if you're nervous about knowing what to say, this person can help you talk things through and give you some valuable advice.In order to respect your boyfriend, make sure that you can trust this person to stay quiet until you're able to talk to your boyfriend yourself. You don't want word to get to him behind your back and make things even worse., If you've never broken up with someone before, or if you're just really nervous, it may help for you to come up with a script that you can practice and memorize.


Think about what you want to tell your boyfriend, and also what you want to avoid being pressured into talking about. We'll give you some ideas about what you can say in following steps.

, You also may feel better if you can rehearse your break-up with a friend. This will help you make sure that you know what you want to say, and you can together think about how your boyfriend might react. This can help you practice knowing how to respond.


For example, your friend can pretend to be your boyfriend, and can beg you to take “him” back. You can have a response prepared. For example, “I'm really sorry that I've hurt you, but nothing is going to change my mind.""

, Even if you don't practice with a friend, you should spend some time thinking about how your boyfriend may react when you tell him it's over.This will help you sympathize with him, and will also help you be more prepared.


Your boyfriend could react with any of the following: anger, crying, rudeness, attempts to manipulate you, or by vowing to change things.
Decide whether any of these will be acceptable to you—for example, if he seems sincere when he promises to spend more time with you, are you willing to give him a second chance?

, There's no one rule about whether or not you should break up in public or in private. It will all depend upon your relationship and your boyfriend's personality. Even so, it's usually best not to break up with him in a place where he'll be humiliated.

, It's not a great idea to break up in a place that is totally isolated, just in case things get scary. Remember that even if you believe your boyfriend would never hurt you, people can act in surprising ways when they are hurt or embarrassed.


Try to choose a place where you can have a private conversation, but where you can easily leave or call for help if needed. A good place might be a public park where you can sit on a bench out of earshot of other people, but where there are other people around.

, You may want to consider having a friend or an older sibling hang out nearby in case you're worried about how the conversation with your boyfriend will go.

, Once you and your boyfriend have sat down together, you may want to begin by telling him something kind. Unless he's been terrible to you, there's no reason to be cruel.It may help him to be reassured of the good qualities that he has that brought you together in the beginning. For example, you could say, “You've always been so supportive of me, which I really appreciate,” or “We have an awesome spark, and had a lot of fun together”.

, You won't want to beat around the bush, though. Make sure that you are direct and that you let your boyfriend know that you are breaking up.Tell him, “I don't want to be in a serious relationship right now, and I want to break up” or “I'm looking for something more out of a relationship, so I don't think we should see each other anymore”.

, Everyone can see through the “it's not you, it's me” line, so try to find a way to clearly explain to your boyfriend why you want to end things without insulting his intelligence.


Of course, it is possible that you want to break up not because of anything he's done but because you've realized you want something else (in which case it really is you, not him!); even so, try to find a different way of putting it.
For example, try saying, “You're great, but we're very different, and I think I'd be a better match with someone who likes more of the same things I do.”

, Your boyfriend may have questions, or may want to explain himself to you, and you should at least be open to listening to him.


Of course, if he reacts with anger or calls you names, you shouldn't feel as though you have to hear him out, and you should not feel bad at all about leaving.

, There's no need for you to drag out your break-up conversation, or to stay up all night talking and crying. You'll just go around and around in circles, and you'll both be emotionally drained.


It may help if you schedule something that you need to go to shortly after your “meeting” with your boyfriend, so that you won't get dragged into a painfully long talk.

, Unless you're Taylor Swift, it may feel harsh to say “We're never ever getting back together.” It's important, though, that you don't leave your (now ex-)boyfriend with false hope.If you really don't see a future together, then avoid saying anything that might make him think there is still hope.
For example, don't suggest that you take a break, if what you really want is to see other people.

, Even though you broke up with your boyfriend, you may still care about him. If you two were close, and you've been the person he's always wanted to talk to when having a hard time, it may be hard for both of you to break the habit of confiding in each other.


You may be tempted to check in on him to see how he's doing, or answer his calls and texts. Don't. You'll only be sending mixed messages and will be making it harder for him to get over you and move on.

, At one point or another, you'll probably start to second-guess your decision, or you'll be lonely or bored and may be tempted to text or call your ex. Proceed with extreme caution!


If you really do start to think you've made a mistake and would like to get back together, take some time to really think about it.

, You may be tempted to tell your boyfriend that you can remain friends after breaking up, and you may sincerely mean this. Even so, you may both need some time and space before you can ever get to this place.


Don't try to force your ex-boyfriend into being friendly towards you, hanging out non-romantically with friends, etc.
Similarly, you shouldn't feel pressure from your ex about hanging out or trying to change your relationship into a friendship.

, Break-ups are rarely easy, and you may feel extra lonely or depressed after you've ended your relationship, even if you're convinced that you made the right decision.


Be sure to stay in touch with people who care about you, and be willing to seek out extra help or advice from teachers, guidance counselors, or your doctor if you're having a particularly hard time moving on. , If your ex-boyfriend threatens you, follows you, or makes you feel uncomfortable, it's important that you talk to someone right away. Confide in an (adult) friend, a parent, a teacher, a counselor or your doctor to get advice.You may need to take steps to block your ex from being able to contact you by phone, email, and/or Facebook.
At some point, it may also be necessary to involve the authorities or get a restraining order. You can get advice on this from any of the people above, but you should never hesitate to call the police directly if you feel threatened.

, Talking to a friend you trust will help you weigh the pros and cons of the breakup. You may also be able to practice what you plan to say on your friend. Make sure that it's stern enough to get the message across but gentle enough to do minimal damage to his feelings.


If possible, make it mutual friend. Warn them that you are going to break up with your boy, and ask that your friend be there to support him. If you are worried about losing your friends, tell your mutual friend your side calmly. This is not the time to rant or complain about everything that your boyfriend has ever done wrong. Instead, find a level-headed way to explain yourself. Make sure you make it clear that you want the breakup to be as clean and pain-free as possible. After you breakup with your boyfriend, you can tell your friend that it's okay to repeat what you said. In his support, he may be able to explain to your boyfriend that you really do care about him, even if it's not in a romantic way anymore.

, Choose a neutral date—try to give a week or two buffer time between birthdays or anniversaries if you can. Start to show subtle signs that you're less interested—don't tell him you love him out of the blue, act slightly distant when you're together etc. Be careful here; there's a fine line between giving subtle signs and being a jerk.


If you've told a friend, tell your friend exactly when you plan on breaking up. Call them just before you see your boyfriend so that they can give you extra courage. This will ensure that you go through with the breakup instead of dragging it on for weeks (which is not fair to you or your boyfriend).

, If your breaking up with someone long distance, make sure it's a day when you know they'll be available to talk on the phone or Skype alone., When the time rolls around, don't chicken out. Tell yourself that you're doing the right thing—not only will you be happier after you break up with your boyfriend, but it's not fair to him to be with him if you're not happy. Refresh your mental list of the reasons you're breaking up. Talk to your friend for support before you see him if you need to.

, You will be nervous, but don't just launch into the breakup. Give him a friendly hello and a smile. If he starts talking to you, don't panic. Sometimes a little small talk before you drop the bomb will help ease the situation. Don't force small talk either, though. When there is a lull in the conversation, take a deep breath. Tell him that you think that the two of you should split. The exact wording is less important than the fact that you should get the point across. This sentence is not the time to be sympathetic or apologetic—make sure your tone of voice is polite but assertive.

, Your boyfriend's first instinct may be to leave or say something rude. Keep a level head and ask him to talk it out before he gets angry. Give a couple sentence summary of why you want to break up. Apologize. Then, let him ask questions. He may be feeling overwhelmed, so don't be alarmed if he doesn't have much to say.


If your boyfriend asks why, do not give him a detailed list of everything he's done wrong. Try to keep it along the lines of ""my feelings just faded, sometimes it happens."" If he wants specifics, it's okay to give them, but be sensitive. He shouldn't feel like you're attacking him.

, Above all, try to stay calm. He will feed off your energy. When you sense that the conversation is nearing its end, explain to him that you really do want to get to the point where you can be friends again. However, you should also make it clear that you want to give him adequate time to get over you. Therefore, he will have to make the first move towards friendship if and when he's ready.


Let him know that you really enjoyed your time together. This will help him remember that he did mean a lot to you—that the whole relationship wasn't pointless.

, Once the two of you part, avoid contacting him unless he contacts you first. Don't talk smack about him to your mutual friends, and try not to make anyone take sides.

, Avoid flaunting the fact that you're with other guy directly after the two of you break up. It's okay to go out and enjoy being single, but don't post a million pictures of you with other guys to Facebook, and be sensitive if you know he's going to be there. Don't go on a date with someone to a place where you know you're going to run into him. Try to talk to him, see if you could still be friends so that it isn't making your life awkward.


Don't get sucked in if he tries to do this to you, either. Realize that it's his way of trying to prove to you and himself he doesn't care, and take a deep breath and turn the other cheek. If this happens, let him ""win"" by not retaliating.

Decide if you should detach.,
Talk to someone you trust.,
Set emotional boundaries.,
Be honest.,
Take a physical break from that person.",How to Detach from Someone1," Detaching temporarily from someone can be useful in helping you determine whether or not you want to continue being in a relationship with that person. Rather than breaking up with a romantic partner or cutting off a friend, pull yourself away emotionally so that you can think about what to do without causing the drama of an all-out breakup.Breaking up on impulse can make you regret your decision later, causing you to want the relationship back. Detaching slowly and carefully considering your actions can help you make a final decision that you don’t go back on later in life.
You might want to detach from a romantic relationship because you realize that over time, you and your partner have changed, or because they have a negative character flaw they are unwilling to work on.
You might want to detach from a friendship because your friend has developed damaging behaviors, or because you realize they are never going to change a negative behavior.
You might want to detach from a parent if they are overbearing or consistently rude.
Take time to write out a list of pros and cons of detaching. Figure out if there are consequences you will need to plan for, such as loss of financial support or a change in lifestyle.;
, If you are considering detaching from someone temporarily to think about things, find friends or relatives who will support your decision rather than nag you about it. You should also ask people you trust for advice about how to respond to the person you are detaching from.


When seeking advice or support, say something like, ""Do you think I could tell you about my situation, and you could tell me what you would do?""
You also need others to provide a distraction so that you fill the void the other person was filling.
Go to others when you need help with things like fixing the computer or advice about a decision.

, Detaching emotionally means that you are pulling away inwardly, not banishing the other person from your life. If you live with them, for example, you can still share all practical activities, such as eating meals together and discussing events and other superficial topics.If you have children together, it is important to continue the daily routines, even if you have activities with the children that you usually do together. This includes things like attending sports games or putting them to bed.
To give yourself an emotional boundary during a conversation, keep the topics superficial and avoid discussing how you feel about things (i.e., sharing your opinion) and asking for advice. If you are asked a personal question, you can say that you do not want to discuss it at the moment.

, Even though your partner or friend may be confused by your behavior, you don't have to confide in them that you are trying to detach. Doing so may open the door for them to get angry, try to convince you to stop, or other such behavior. However, you should be prepared to answer their questions honestly. If they directly ask you what you’re doing, say, “I am taking the time to think about our relationship.” Be prepared to explain what you mean and answer any questions truthfully. “We’ve had a rough year, I feel emotionally exhausted, and I am taking the time to process how I feel about it all. I hope that you will give me the time to do that.”
Do not treat this is a game. You are serious about thinking about the relationship. You are not withholding emotional intimacy to get attention.

, It is advisable to take a physical break from the person you are detaching from, even if a short one. Take a weekend trip by yourself or with friends so that you have a change of scenery and perspective. You may still be interacting with them in your daily life, but a weekend getaway can refresh your perspective and help you come to a decision.

Evaluate your decision.,
Get away from the person.,
Take a social media break.",How to Detach from Someone2," If you are thinking seriously about cutting off all communication with someone, then it is also important to think seriously about what the result of doing that might be. In addition to the emotional effects, detaching from someone may also affect your financial, social, or professional life.

Try to make arrangements for any negative effects of detaching from someone. For example, if you have children with someone, then you will need to make arrangements so that you can still see your children on a regular basis. If you rely heavily on someone for financial support, then you will need to find a way to support yourself.

, If you have made the decision to detach permanently from a relationship, knowing why will help you stick to your decision and save you from getting involved in the relationship again. Reflect on what your life would be like without them present and how they might react.

Make a list of reasons why you should detach. On this list might be because they create too much chaos, they take advantage of you, that you were losing yourself in them, and so on.

, To permanently detach from someone, you have to cut off contact and get out of that person’s daily life, at least for a while. If you keep a person in your life who you truly want to detach from, you are setting both of you up for emotional pain.Even if you still want to be friends, you need time away from the person to heal from the emotional attachment before you can attempt being friends. Otherwise, your past is too fresh, and you will be tempted to settle into old habits of intimacy.

Your relationship with this person, whether romantic or platonic, was most likely public on social media, and people may ask you questions. You may also see their posts, which makes it difficult to detach entirely.


Social media also records all of your text interactions, so it is easy to read old posts and recall old feelings, none of which help you detach.
You may want to consider making a general post to your friends to explain the situation so that they don’t talk to you about it.
You may also want to delete the person you are detaching from off of all social media so that you can no longer see their profile or communicate in this way.

The best place to start is discovering things you enjoy doing by yourself.

Consider learning a new skill or visiting places you haven’t able to yet to discover what you are good at and where your weaknesses lie.

, Start to move on from this person by looking forward to something new. Seek a new beginning, whether that means going back to school, joining a club or organization, even chasing a dream, you have been afraid to pursue.Use visualization to imagine how happy you will be in these new settings and doing these new activities.
Consider dating again or striking up new friendships once you have had time to recover and stop being angry at the person you were detaching from.

, To truly detach from someone, it is helpful to understand what detachment is. For one thing, detachment is becoming calm and not allowing others to get under your skin. It means maintaining your internal balance. But it does not mean that you stop caring about what is going on around you. It is essentially a state of being able to accept whatever happens.This detachment allows you to stop caring what they think and make decisions based on your best judgement, rather than feeling pressure to conform to the other person’s desires.
Because detachment is a state of mind, it is a handy skill to have to endure the negatives in life.
For example, you may find that you cling to pleasure and fear pain, but practicing detachment will give you the ability to go through difficulty with humor and a sense of “this too shall pass.”, Detaching from someone you care about is painful, and realizing that you are not alone can help you make the plunge. Gather friends and relatives around you by inviting them out to events with you. You can also attempt to make new friends to fill the void. Find someone you can confide in, and find a peer group you can trust.Set goals about building a support system. For example, you can write down lists of people in your life now and people you want to be there in the future by creating a visual diagram.Approach people, you would like to be in your support system by asking them if they would like to be friends with you. Be honest about your needs.

Start dating other kinds of guys when you're ready.",How to Dump a Guy," How much is too much? Deal breakers can be anything in a relationship that crosses a particular line and ""breaks the deal"" of your relationship. What are you not willing to deal with from a boyfriend any longer? When and if those things happen, it's always appropriate to end the relationship. List out your own deal breakers and stick to them in your relationships.


Some deal breakers should be serious. Any physical or emotional violence or threats should be taken very seriously. End abusive relationships safely and immediately. Read End an Abusive Relationship to learn more.
Some deal breakers should be personal. Your boyfriend doesn't like to eat at restaurants? Your boyfriend smokes cigarettes? Your boyfriend hates the music you like? In some relationships, these things won't matter much, but in others they may break the deal. You pick yours and decide.;
, Sometimes, there won't be any glaring or obvious deal breaker to find. Your boyfriend might be a great guy in a lot of ways. Still, you may find yourself feeling bored or unfulfilled. If you've started to find your relationship difficult, that's a perfectly fine reason to break up.


Some relationships are worth working on and some aren't. But any time your relationship feels like more work than it's worth, it is fine to end it.
How can you tell if he's worth it? Try to imagine your future. Do you see yourself with this person in a couple years, living the way you live now? Or would you prefer it to be different? Would you prefer him to be different?

, If your problem is about little things and small behaviors, it might not be worth breaking up over. If your boyfriend is a great guy but never shaves, that's a relatively small thing you could talk about. If your boyfriend does nothing but play video games and can't be bothered to look for a job, that's something else.


Be honest. If something bothers you enough to notice it, tell your boyfriend it's making you question your relationship. Say, ""This bothers me. Can we talk about it?"" Give him a chance to change, for small things.
You can change behaviors, but it's very difficult to change a person. And it's not fair to your boyfriend to expect him to become a different person, or for you to Try to become someone you're not.

, Sometimes, your friends will have a much more clear perspective on your own relationship than you do. If you're blinded by strong feelings for a guy, they might be able to tell you more about how he seems obviously wrong for you, or how you seem to be unhappy. Tell your friends you're considering breaking up and ask for advice.


While they may seems like dinosaurs sometimes, it's also good to talk to your parents. They've been there. Get their perspective as well.

, If you feel like breaking up with someone, there's no need to feel guilty. There's no reason to stay with someone for the sake of making them happy, if you yourself are not. Tell him the truth, end the relationship, and give yourself a chance to be happier.


Think of it like you're doing him a favor. If your relationship isn't working, don't waste all this time pretending. Give him a chance to find a relationship that will work better.

, Even though it's more difficult, it's important to break up with someone in person. Even if you've only been going out for a short amount of time, it's better to break up while you're face to face.


Break up via e-mail, text, phone, or in writing any time that you're scared to be around someone. If your boyfriend ever lashes out or abuses you physically or emotionally, you need to stop all contact immediately. Tell him it's over from a safe distance, with support.
If you're in a long distance relationship, it can be difficult to wait until you're face to face. In this case, it's ok to break up as soon as you decide to break up. Try doing it via Skype, or some other video chatting service, to make it a little more personal.

, Once you realize the relationship with the guy you're seeing isn't working, you need to communicate that to him as soon as possible. Choose a place where you can be private and speak freely. This should also be a place that you can easily and quickly exit as well, if you need to.


If you're scared about how a guy will react, always break up in a public place. If you still want some privacy, pick something like a park bench, where people will be close by, but not close enough to eavesdrop on your conversation.
Do this as soon as possible. Don't waste time waiting for him to change, or waiting for something else to happen. Never wait for someone to break up with you.

, Consider some of the reasons that made you want to break up with this guy, and decide what he needs to know. Some of them might be helpful for him to hear going forward, while others may just be insulting and hurtful.


If there are behaviors that might affect his future relationships, tell him. Say, ""We're having trouble communicating. I never know how you're feeling, and it's not working for me."" If you're just not attracted to him physically any more, that's probably best to save for yourself.
Try to anticipate the kinds of questions he might ask. If you just say, ""I'm not happy,"" he might say, ""What can I do? I want to change."" Have a good answer prepared., What to say to a guy you're breaking up with? Just tell him the truth. Say that you're unhappy in the relationship, and you think it's time to end things. State your feelings as directly and quickly as possible. You can talk about the specifics and how they've made you feel.


Keep it focused on yourself and the relationship, not on him. Instead of saying, ""I think you're boring and lazy"" it's much better to say, ""I think we just work at different speeds. I need a little more activity in my life.""
Sometimes, it's good to get more specific, and sometimes not. If you don't have enough things in common, tell him it's the differences that are driving you away.

, A break up isn't a chance to let loose with little insults and blame your boyfriend for what went wrong in your relationship. A relationship takes two people to make it work, and sometimes it just doesn't work out.


Try to keep your cool. If he fires back with insults, or wants to argue, do not respond to the attack. Just say, ""I know you're feeling hurt and I'm sorry. But that's why this needs to be over.""
Never let yourself get dragged into an argument about something small or petty. Focus on the big issues. If you're talking about your failure to communicate and he starts critiquing your texting habits, just stay on the course. Keep repeating yourself, ""This isn't working.""

, Too often, break ups can get dragged out way too long. If you've made your decision and want to break up, there's really nothing to discuss. You don't need to get into a big debate with a guy about whether or not he can change or work on the relationship. If it hasn't happened at this point, it's not going to. End the relationship and walk away.


Sometimes, it will be tempting to say, ""Let's just give it some time and maybe we can get back together"" to Try to make it less bleak. This is always a bad idea. If you do ever get back together, it needs to be after a healthy period of the relationship being over. If he doesn't think it's actually over, he'll never change. He'll never move on. And you'll end up right where you started.

, Once you break up, walk away and stop talking to him for a while, even if you hope to remain friends in the future. Stop calling, stop responding to his texts, and consider blocking him or unfriending him on all your social media accounts. Just avoid all interactions with him.


Social media can be a tough trap during a break up. Try to block him and his friends, and avoid getting sucked into checking his status every hour on the dot to see what he's doing. Give yourself some space.
""Staying friends"" is a nice idea that almost never works. Trying to stay friends only makes the process of breaking up harder. If you actually want to be friends with this person, give yourselves some time alone to get over each other, and then reconnect later when your feelings have cooled off. Don't immediately transition into hanging out ""as friends."" That'll be too hard., Often, it's easier to jump into a new relationship than to process the last one. Try giving yourself enough time to grieve over the relationship that just ended, and understand what went wrong, instead of just dating someone else.


How long is an appropriate amount of time? It will differ for everybody. Longer relationships will always need more time than shorter relationships. If you just dumped a guy who you had a fling with, it might be fine to start dating again right away.

, Try to look on the end of a relationship with some sense of joy. You're free! You can do what you want! You can stay up till 2 am and blast Taylor Swift and eat chocolate ice cream while you watch ""Orange is the New Black"" without having to worry about your criticizing boyfriend. Just let yourself be yourself for a while, and celebrate your new found freedom.


Start hanging gout with new kinds of people, and reconnect with old friends. Live the single life. Start meeting people, when you feel ready.

, What have you learned from this experience? If you've had a messy break-up with a guy, try not to make the same mistake twice. If you were attracted to someone for the wrong reasons, don't let yourself be attracted to your ex's clone. Learn from your mistakes.


Sometimes, breaking up can be a good way to try out different kinds of relationships. Was your last boyfriend really dull and sweet and serious? Try dating a fun-loving party guy for a while. Mix it up.

For example, if you loved going to yoga together, send your friend a gift card to your favorite studio.
You can also include items that are homemade. Make a batch of your dad's favorite cookies to send to him.
Be creative. If you're thinking of fun times you had at the beach, send a little plastic baggy of sand from the shore.

Be patient.,
Acknowledge your emotions.",How to Cope With Leaving Someone You Love3," Leaving someone you love is tough. But don't forget it can have some advantages. You'll definitely have some more free time, so take advantage of that.Find a new activity. You could look for a book club that meets in your area.

Speak to him in person.,
Choose an appropriate location.,
Focus on the task at hand.,
Do not lie or use platitudes.,
Shut down any discussion of past conflict.,
Feel free to mention the good times.",How to Dump a Nice Guy2," Breaking up with someone by sending an email, text, or even a voicemail is all the rage, but it will not satisfy him, it is ineffective, and it is inconsiderate. If he is a great guy, he deserves an explanation.Talking to him face-to-face will allow you to clearly explain your reasons for breaking up. Doing so will benefit you and him.People can experience long-lasting negative psychological effects if they don’t receive enough information about why a significant other left them. Nonverbal signals like touching him or smiling can let him know that you value him as a person, which would not come across electronically., This can not be an afterthought. Environment affects mood, ability to focus, and how we interpret what is said. Find a place where you both feel comfortable.


A lakefront park, for instance, might be a good idea since the waves can provide a calming distraction.
Going to a cozy café might be a poor choice since strangers will sit within earshot and the romantic vibe might make you both uncomfortable.

, During the actual interaction, keep the importance of the situation in mind. This person is someone that you value, and you have something that you need to say, so convey the message clearly and fully.


Don’t allow your mind to wander. Thinking about getting the conversation over with will just distract you and disrupt the flow of the conversation.
Don’t pull out your phone. Keep it in your pocket or purse and make sure that it's silent. Checking Instagram or your email can wait.

, Your nice guy doesn’t deserve false explanations. Take the high road. If he simply isn’t the one for you, tell him that, but be tactful.Don’t be like Chandler from the show Friends who told Janice that he was moving to a foreign country. It would certainly be awkward running into him later on!
Using the cliche that you’re just not in the right place for a relationship will come off as insincere, so avoid that one, too.

, Couples usually aren’t in alignment when it comes to whose fault it is that a certain argument got started. Rehashing previous disagreements or negative experiences won’t do you any good.At this point, it doesn't matter if he never wanted to go hiking or that he didn't like seeing concerts.
It also doesn't matter if you were sometimes short with him or ignored him. Don't let the conversation take an unproductive turn.

, Let him know that you enjoyed the time that you spent with him overall. Highlight some things about him that you might miss. You can even express regret about ending things, but only if doing so is sincere.Did you appreciate that he always responded to your texts or calls in a timely manner and that he sent you cute cat pictures because you like them? If so, tell him!
Was he good in bed? Definitely emphasize it to keep his ego intact!

"
"
Be prepared for how he might react.,
Cut off communication.,
Remind yourself that the break up will affect you, too.",How to Dump a Nice Guy3," It can be difficult to predict how even a nice guy will act during a break up, even if you know him well. Imagine different scenarios and build your deflection skills before having the big conversation.He might throw insults at you. If he wants to hurt you, he may target an area that you are insecure about, such as your career or parenting skills. Tell yourself that he is upset, and that what he says doesn’t define you. Silence might be the response. If he shuts down and refuses to converse, all you can do is say your piece and be on your way. Let him know that you are willing to talk once more when he is ready. , It is important not to remain in contact with your ex--at least right away. You might want to be friendly, but Facebook chatting him or asking him for coffee too soon won't help him detach.Our bodies become addicted to having another person around. When that person leaves, we have to process the withdrawal, just like a drug. Your ex can't move on if he sees you around.When we see pictures of our ex-flames and still care for them, those old lustful feelings rush back. It might be good to unfollow or block one another on Facebook until several months have passed--or even longer., Even though you initiated it, you will probably not feel relieved right away. Be aware for signs that the break up is affecting you, and take proactive steps.If you start telling yourself that you are a bad person, cut it out. It’s normal to feel this way after making someone else feel badly. You should counter those thoughts by focusing on the legitimate reasons for the break-up.Tell your closest friends and family members that you are ending the romance. That way, they aren’t blindsided and they won't ask you a ton of many questions, which will further upset you. More importantly, they can help you cope.Positive results can occur. Many women grow as people after ending unsatisfying relationships. You can, too!"

Think about whether you see your boyfriend as an equal.,
Consider whether you feel heard.,
Evaluate whether you're afraid of your boyfriend leaving.,
Review whether you feel angry or resentful.,
Review your fights.,
Think about physical intimacy.,
Evaluate whether you've withdrawn emotionally.,
Think about whether you still have fun.,
Consider the level of trust and openness in the relationship.,
Think about how you feel when your partner is gone.,
Evaluate whether you're comfortable alone.,
Look over the financial situation.,
Review your exit plan.",How to Decide if You Should Dump Your Live in Long Term Boyfriend," If you're nearing the end of a relationship, you will no longer see your boyfriend as equal to you. When you're falling in love, you have a tendency to magnify someone's good qualities and see them as greater than you. When falling out of love, this perception will slip. You may see someone as below you.You may see yourself as above your boyfriend. You may be increasingly distrustful of his point of view, perspective, and character.
In some cases, however, you may feel you're beneath your partner. This is also a bad sign. You are not feeling fulfilled enough in the relationship to have your own sense of self worth.
If you don't see your boyfriend as equal, it may be time to end things.
For example, your boyfriend disagrees with you on a movie you just watched. Instead of finding yourself accepting his opinion is different, you find yourself thinking less of him. For example, you think something like, ""I can't believe that's his opinion. It's ridiculous."";
, In a dysfunctional relationship, your perspective will not be considered. You and your boyfriend may struggle to truly understand one another. Disagreements are normal. However, when someone refuses to acknowledge your point of view, this is a sign it may be time to break up.When you have a disagreement, think about how your boyfriend reacts. Does he state your point of view, making it clear he understands it, and then disagree with you? Or does he simply skip to disagreeing?
If it's the latter, this is a clear sign your boyfriend does not understand your perspective. This is generally a sign the relationship is not sustainable in the long term.
For example, your boyfriend enjoys going to loud concerts, while you dislike attending. You tell your boyfriend you don't really want to keep going to shows with him, simply because it's not your cup of tea. Instead of understanding, your boyfriend berates you for not being fun.

, When a relationship is beginning to come to a close, you will experience fear much of the time. You will constantly be nervous your boyfriend is going to leave. This is because you sense the relationship is coming to an end.Some insecurity is normal in a relationship. Many people periodically worry whether things will work out long term. However, small negative events should not make you fearful that a breakup is imminent.
When you and your boyfriend fight, do you immediately worry about your living situation? Do you find yourself browsing apartments on Craig's List when you have a minor disagreement? Are you saving money in the event you have to move fast?
Good relationships can survive bumps in the road. Even in hard times, you should feel cared for and somewhat secure. If you rarely, if ever, feel secure in a relationship, this is a sign you should break up.

, In a functional relationship, your partner will support you. You will feel like you can achieve what you want with this person at your side. If you feel as if you can't do what you want with your boyfriend, you may begin to resent him. If you're feeling an overarching sense of frustration at all times, this is a sign you may be in a dysfunctional relationship.Feelings of frustration and resentment may be a sign that it is time for you to end the relationship.

, Think about arguments you have with your boyfriend. In a bad relationship, you will find yourself repeating the same arguments over and over again. If nothing is getting resolved, this may be a sign you're better off ending things.When a relationship is coming to a close, you will circle around the same subjects over and over again. You may find yourself revisiting the same topic.
If a fight reoccurs over and over again, this means you're failing to resolve something. Issues that cannot be fixed are a sign the two of you are not compatible.

, It's normal for physical intimacy to slow slightly as a relationship progresses. However, when sex stops altogether, this is a bad sign. Sexual intimacy can increase romantic feelings. A lack of sexual intimacy can make you feel distant. If you're no longer attracted to your boyfriend, this is a sign the relationship should end., In a good relationship, you should feel like you can share anything with your boyfriend. When a relationship is ending, you will begin to withdraw.You may share less and less with your boyfriend. Rather than talking over your emotions with him, you will turn to friends and family members instead. If you don't feel you can open up to someone, this is a sign the relationship isn't working.
Withdrawing emotionally may manifest itself physically. You may, for example, find you're less physically affectionate with your boyfriend.

, Fun is a vital part of any relationship. It's especially important to have fun with someone you live with. Evaluate whether or not you still have fun just hanging out with your boyfriend.With a live-in boyfriend, it's important to have fun during normal parts of the day. You should enjoy simply watching television together, eating dinner, or doing the dishes.
If you feel drained around your boyfriend instead of invigorated, this is a sign the relationship should end. It can be very exhausting living with someone whose company you don't enjoy.

, It is important to feel like you can be trusting and open with your boyfriend. If you do not feel like you can be trusting and open with your boyfriend, then you may want to consider ending the relationship.


Reflect on how comfortable you are telling your boyfriend about your hopes, fears, and dreams. Do you trust him with this information? Does he trust you with the same kind of information? If the answer is no, then this may be a sign that the relationship lacks trust and openness.

, It's normal to sometimes enjoy having your apartment to yourself. However, there's a difference between craving alone time on occasion and wishing your boyfriend wasn't around much of the time. Give serious consideration to how much space you desire.Do you find yourself wishing your boyfriend would spend more time away from your apartment or house? Do you frequently go out with friends without him and dread going home?
If you don't enjoy being around your boyfriend anymore, this is probably a sign you should break up. While it's okay to occasionally want to do your own thing, when you dread bringing your boyfriend along or having him home for a night, this is not a good sign.

, Being alone is difficult, especially if you've gotten comfortable in a situation. You may hesitate to leave a live-in boyfriend as you fear living alone. However, try to be honest with yourself. Are you staying in the relationship because you're genuinely happy or because you fear being alone?Think about the prospect of breaking up. Pay attention to what scares you the most. Are you sad at the prospect of losing someone you love and care about? Or are you dreading the loneliness that will come from losing the constant companionship of a live-in partner?
If your reason is a fear of loneliness, this is not a good enough reason to stay in a relationship. While adjusting to being alone can be difficult, it's better than staying in a relationship where you're unhappy.

, Finances are often a reason people stay in a relationship. If you share rent, bills, and other costs of living, you may not want to leave due to financial convenience. Really interrogate yourself as to why you're staying. If your main worries about leaving revolve around bills, you may be in the wrong relationship., If you're debating whether or not to stay, it may be because you don't have an exit plan. Many people stay in bad relationships too long because they don't know how to leave. Think about what you would do regarding your living situation in the event of a breakup. If you have a clear exit plan in mind, and still want to stay, the relationship may be worth salvaging. However, if you form an exit plan that makes you feel relieved at the prospect of leaving, this is probably a sign you should leave.Think about where you would go temporarily if you broke up. Could you stay with friends or family? Would you be willing to sleep on the couch until you find a new place?
Consider your finances. Do you have enough money together to secure a new place? Could you borrow from someone? Look at apartments in your area to get a sense of the price range, as well as the average cost of things like security deposits.
Figure out how you would negotiate shared finances. If one of you moves out, is that person still responsible for half of the rent until you secure a new roommate? Also, there are shared bills. Try to figure when you the two of you will last pay things like the cable bill and utilities bill together.

It’s better, especially right after a breakup, to let your feelings out in some way.When there is a bad situation after a breakup it’s even more important to express how you’re feeling about the things that are going on.


Keep a journal about what is going on. Write about the events, your feelings, your hopes, and your fears. Try to write in your journal every day.
Express your feelings creatively through music, art, or some other medium. For example, you could paint a picture depicting your feelings or write a song about the breakup.
Talk to someone you trust like a close family member or friend. You could say, “Can I talk to you about how I’m feeling about everything that’s going on?”;
, Coping with a bad situation after a breakup, no matter what the circumstances, can have a negative effect on your health if you don’t take care of yourself.Make the time to do things that will keep you healthy.


Stick to a regular sleep routine. Go to bed at the same time each night and try to wake-up at the same time each morning.
Make time to eat healthy. Your body needs all the nutrients it can get to keep your immune system stronger during this bad situation.
Do something active. Even if it’s just taking a brief walk or doing some stretches, physical activity can help calm you, clear your mind, and boost your energy.
Avoid alcohol or drugs as a way to cope. This will just lead to much bigger problems.

, There may be times when you are feeling upset or anxious. In these situations, it is important to find a way to soothe yourself. A good way to do this is to learn how to practice some self-soothing activities that work well for you. Some things you might try include:


Using a relaxation technique such as progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, or deep breathing.
Engaging with a favorite hobby, such as knitting, playing video games, painting, reading, or writing.
Pampering yourself, such as by taking a bubble bath, giving yourself a manicure, or experimenting with makeup or clothes.

, Your friends and family want to help you during this time. They can help you cope with a bad situation after a breakup by listening to you, distracting you, and just being there for you.Turn to them for support and encouragement.


Let them distract you from the breakup. Do something fun with them like take a bike ride or go for coffee.
If you are feeling upset, you can ask a friend to just come sit with you.
You might say, “This breakup has me feeling pretty down. Could you just come over and sit with me? I don’t really want to talk or anything.”

, If you are having a really difficult time coping with a breakup, consider talking to a professional. Also, if you are dealing with other stress, such as a mental illness, the recent death of someone close to you, or the loss of a job at the same time you are trying to cope with a breakup, you should talk to a therapist or counselor about what you are going through.


They can help you deal with the breakup as well as any other issues in your life right now.
A counselor can teach you coping techniques and methods to help reduce your stress, depression, and anxiety.
They can also give you strategies for dealing with other people involved in the situation.

Be mature.,
Try an ‘Obsession Diet’.,
Find yourself again.,
Boost your self-esteem.",How to Cope up With a Bad Situation After a Breakup2," It can be easy to do things out of anger or hurt after a breakup. This is especially true when there is a bad situation after a breakup. But doing things out of revenge, jealousy, or desperation will only make things worse. Don’t try to do extreme things to make your ex realize that you two should be together.
For example, don’t stage an accident to make your ex see how much they need you. You could end up seriously hurt and your ex still might not come back.
Don’t bad mouth your ex or try to do things that make them look like a bad person. It will only make you seem angry and resentful.

, This is a way to allow yourself to express how you are feeling about the breakup without letting it consume your life.An ‘Obsession Diet’ helps you cope with a bad situation after a breakup because it limits the time you spend obsessing over the situation.


For the first few days after the breakup allow yourself to cry, grieve, rant, or do whatever you need to do to express how you are feeling for five minutes each hour.
After the five minutes are up, you have to wait until the next hour to obsess over the breakup.
The next week reduce it to four minutes an hour. Reduce the amount of time each week until you are done.
It is also important to avoid exposing yourself to your ex through social media. Un-friend your ex or stop following them to avoid triggering hurtful emotions.
Also, remove their pictures, clothing, and other reminders of your ex from the home.

, It is easy to lose yourself when you are a relationship and think more of ‘we’ than ‘me’. For example, you may forget that you like olives on your pizza because you and your ex always ordered meat only. After a breakup, especially if it was a long-term relationship, you may need to remind yourself of the things you like and don’t like.Make a list of activities you enjoyed before the relationship started. Try at least one thing on the list each month to discover what you still enjoy.
Explore interests and dreams that you have put on hold because of the relationship.
For example, if you’ve always wanted to go zip-lining but didn’t because your ex is afraid of heights, then go!

, You may be feeling down about yourself after the breakup, so remind yourself of your worth and all the great things about you.Do things and spend time with people that help you realize all of your positive qualities.


Make a list of all of your skills, traits, and qualities that make you the great person you are.
Read the list out loud to yourself in your mirror as often as you need to.
Do things like volunteer or become active in the community in order to give back and remind yourself you are a good person.

Avoid your ex.,
Document any harassment.,
Report all threats.,
Keep yourself safe.",How to Cope up With a Bad Situation After a Breakup3," Unless you have a really good reason, like to discuss your mutual child, don’t contact your ex. Also, don’t respond when your ex contacts you. Unneeded contact will only make it harder for your ex to accept and deal with the breakup.Unnecessary contact will only make your ex think there is still hope for the relationship and encourage them to contact you again.
Let your ex’s calls go to voicemail and don’t respond to messages.
If and when you see your ex, be polite, but don’t engage in conversation. For example, if you are walking down the hall and see your ex, say “Hi”, then keep walking.
If your ex is harassing or stalking you, then don’t speak to them at all if you see them. Immediately go somewhere safe where there are other people around.

, Keeping a record of messages, phone calls, texts, and other contact provides proof of what your ex is doing.It can also help you cope with this bad situation by being like a journal.


Record the who, what, when, and where of the incident. Also write down how it made you feel and why it made you feel that way.
Save any voicemails, texts, emails, or posts that your ex makes to or about you. You may need to screenshot or email it as an attachment to yourself.

, Sometimes after a breakup, one person may threaten to hurt themselves, their ex, or their ex’s new love. If you are in a bad situation like this and your ex is threatening to hurt someone, you need to take the threats seriously and tell the authorities so that they can help keep you safe.


Tell someone like the police, a crisis counselor, your parents, or a teacher what is going on. You can say, “I need to talk to you about my ex making threats.”
Tell the authorities about the breakup and everything that has happened with your ex since then.
You can also call 1-800-273-TALK to get help coping with the situation.

, Using basic safety techniques can help you cope if your ex is acting unreasonable after the breakup.You don’t need to be paranoid and hire bodyguards, but you should do basic things to limit the opportunities your ex has to bother you.


Try to go places with someone else. The more you are around other people the harder it will be for your ex to bother you.
Lock your doors and be aware of your surroundings at all times.
Be careful about posting your location online for a while. This lets your ex know exactly where you are.
Don’t go anywhere alone with your ex.

Be there for the person.,
Set limits.,
Be patient.,
Focus on the positive.,
Do something fun.",How to Cope up With a Bad Situation After a Breakup4," When someone close to you is dealing with a bad situation after a breakup, it can be difficult for everyone involved, including you.You may wonder how you can make the situation easier, what you should do, or what you should say. You can cope with the situation and help them cope by offering a helping hand, a hug, or even just a smile.


Whether it is your parents divorcing, or a friend ending a long-term relationship, tell them that you care and want to be there for them.
You could say, “I know this is a really tough time for you. I want you to know I care about you and want to be here for you. If you want to, we can just sit here.”
Do little things that you know will be helpful like walking their dog, cooking a meal, or washing dishes.

, Whatever the bad situation, and no matter how much you want to make things better after the breakup, you have to set boundaries to the support you give. In order for you to cope with the situation, you’ve got to know what you can and can’t handle and you’ve got to express this.


Make a list of things that you are and aren’t okay doing to provide support.
For example, you might write, “I can spend all day with my friend Saturday, but I can’t skip school to be there for her on Monday”.
Tell the people involved what your limits are.
For instance, you might tell your dad, “I’m okay with talking about the divorce and this whole situation, but not with badmouthing Mom or you.”

, Everyone heals in their own way and at their own pace. There is no right way or time limit for getting over a breakup.It may take the people involved, and you, varying amounts of time to work through this bad situation. The best way to cope with a bad situation after the breakup of someone close to you is to be patient.


Be patient with the ex-couple. It may take one, or both, of them time to work through their feelings and move on from what happened.
For example, if your mom cries at everything after your parents’ divorce, remind yourself, “I need to be patient. This divorce is hard for her and she needs time.”
Be patient with yourself. Don’t try to get over the breakup in a hurry. You have feelings that you need to work through, as well.
Tell yourself, “This breakup is a bad situation for me, too, but I can work through it if I’m patient with myself and give everyone time to heal.”

, You do have to deal with negative parts, but you should also look for and point out the positive things that can come from the breakup.Looking for the bright side will help you cope with this situation better and help everyone else cope with the breakup.


For example, you could remind your friend that now she can move to that part of town that she loves but her ex hated.
Or you might tell your mom, “The divorce is hard on us all, but I’ve noticed it’s given you the freedom to spend more time on your painting.”

, One coping technique for any situation is doing things that improve your mood and make you feel happier. Cope with a bad situation after someone else breaks up by doing something fun to relieve some of your emotional and physical stress.For instance, you could go for a game of putt-putt golf with your dad or visit an antique store with your mom.
You could take your sister out for frozen yogurt after her breakup or catch a concert with your friend after their breakup.
Don’t forget to do something fun just for you. Doing things you enjoy will help you cope with the bad situation, so go skating or catch the latest 3D movie.

, Type in “myTifi” on the search field and tap the Search button.

, Locate the correct app and download it by tapping the “Install” button beside the app. It’s free.

, The myTifi app cannot turn your TV on. It has to be turned on using its standard TV remote; this is a limitation. Press the “ON” button on your TV remote while pointing it on your TV.


Be sure to check if your TV model is supported. Refer to the myTifi manual for the list of supported TVs.

, Connect your Smart TV and your iPad to the same Wi-Fi network or access point. This needs to be done so that the app can see your TV.

, Locate the app on your iPad. It has a picture of a TV with a Wi-Fi signal on its screen. Tap the app to launch it.

, Upon launch of myTifi, it will do an auto-detect of all Smart TVs within the same Wi-Fi network. Let the app finish the search.

, Once myTifi detects and links to your TV, your TV will seek your confirmation to allow the device and the app to interface with it. A confirmation window will appear on your TV.


Use your TV’s remote to click on the “Allow” button. This will allow myTifi to control your TV. This is only done once during the first time the two devices connect.

, Once the connection is approved from the TV, tap the “Continue” button on myTifi. The app will show a confirmation message as well, indicating that the TV with its IP address has been successfully linked.


Now, myTifi can act as a remote control for your TV.

, From myTifi, tap the “Standard” button on the bottom menu. The app will show you a standard TV remote layout, quite similar to physical TV remotes.

, On the middle of the screen is an Information icon. Tap this to enter the Standard control settings. Tap the “Select remote layout” button on the middle of the screen.


A list of all supported TV remote models will be listed. Scroll through the list and tap the one you want to use. It’s better to use the exact model of your actual TV remote to ensure proper functions.

, If you’ve selected the exact model of your actual TV remote, the layout on your screen will most likely be the same as your physical TV remote.


The remote layout will most likely be split to allow proper spacing on your screen. Identify where the key buttons are.

, The buttons on myTifi’s remote function exactly the same as your physical TV remote. You just have to use your iPad by tapping on the buttons instead of pressing them.


You don’t need to point your iPad to your TV for it to work. The signals for the buttons you tap will be sent over the Wi-Fi network and will be read by the TV from here, and not from the infrared receiver. You can even use the myTifi remote even if you’re not within the vicinity of your TV, as long as the iPad is in the same network as the TV.

, From myTifi, tap the “Smart” button on the bottom menu. The app will show you a sequence of numbered boxes. Each number represents the corresponding channel on your TV.


What makes this remote smart is the allowed customization for each of the channels on your TV. Each box can be customized by properly tagging the channel name and channel logo, making the whole remote user friendly and intuitive. With proper effort, the Smart layout will display all your channel logos instead of the numbered boxes.

, To input a channel data to a button, tap and hold the numbered box corresponding to the channel. A channel form will appear where you can populate the channel name.


The app will use this channel name and look for similarly named channel logos online. It will then list the results. Browse through the provided channel logos and tap the one you want to use for your button. Use the one closest to the actual logo of the channel.

, Repeat Step 2 for all numbered boxes for all the channels on your TV. Use the left and right arrows at the bottom of the screen to move through sets of channels in case you have more than 50.

, Unlike the Standard remote, channel surfing is a lot easier and more convenient with the Smart remote. No need to move up or down the channel buttons or to memorize the channel number for your favorite channels. All you have to do is tap the button from the Smart layout and your TV will immediately go to the channel you’ve selected.


For example, HBO is on channel 34. All you have to do is tap the HBO box or logo and your TV will go to HBO. You don’t even need to know that HBO is on channel 34.

Locate and use protective items, like bubble wrap and even newspaper.,
Use the correct packaging.,
Select a courier and get insurance.",How to Successfully Pack and Send an iPad Mini for Christmas," When sending any valuable item, it’s vital that you protect it and reduce the risk of any damage. So what’s the best way to achieve this? First of all, you should use protective materials when packing your items together. For example, foam, crushed up newspaper and bubble wrap are all ideal for keeping your iPad mini nice and compact within the parcel.


Ideally, you don’t want the item to move about and you also want to include enough padding so that the contents remain safe. There is a chance that during transport, the parcel may be thrown about a little, so avoiding any damage or at least reducing the threat is your first port of call.;
, If you are going to be sending an item like an iPad, you need to ensure that you use the correct packaging. Sending it in its original box is probably not going to be ideal, even if it is parcel shaped. Instead, you will need to use additional packaging so that the iPad mini can remain safe.


Find a suitable box to put the item in, one that allows the new iPad to be compact inside. Once you are happy with the packaging, you can use tape to reinforce the corners of the parcel. If possible, use the one it came in as well as another box around it.

, Once your items are ready for delivery, you need to find a suitable courier to send the parcel. In some cases, you can make an order online and arrange for your parcel to be delivered with minimal effort.


Whoever you decide to send your items with, you should always ask about insurance. Although it’s not a common occurrence, from time to time packages and parcels can go astray. The last thing you want is for your parcel to end up at an alternative address, or worse still, go missing completely. Like we mentioned, this is a rare event, but in order to cover yourself against these circumstances, make sure you have sufficient insurance in place.

You can try jailbreaking your older device to install the Siri files, but there's a very good chance it will not work. Jailbreaking voids your warranty and can also be a hassle, especially with newer versions of iOS. If you want to give it a shot anyway, click here.;
,,,


If you don't have a Siri option in the General menu, then your device is too old and does not support Siri. Click here for some workarounds.

, There will be several options that you can choose to modify Siri.


You can choose between a male and female voice.
You can select a different language for Siri, including Spanish, French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, German, Italian, and Korean., Enabling this feature will allow you to activate Siri by speaking the phrase ""Hey Siri"", as long as your iPad is plugged into a charger. This can be useful for when your iPad is plugged in at your desk or on your nightstand.


Some users have reported issues getting this feature to work reliably. if you are having difficulty with it, it may be more useful to just turn it off.

, Siri will search the internet, change your settings, and open apps for you without having to search for them yourself. If you would like to see an in-depth breakdown of the possible commands, you can tap the “?” icon and browse through the commands menu.


Speak clearly and slowly at first until you get a feel for how well Siri recognizes your voice. If you speak too quickly or quietly, Siri may misinterpret your command., You can use Siri to open apps, play music, start a FaceTime call, send emails, find businesses, and much more. Here are some basic commands to get you started:“Open Camera” (If you have multiple camera apps installed, you will be prompted to pick one).
“Launch Facebook” (You can use any app on your iPad using this command).
“Play <song/artist/genre on iPad>”
“Play/Skip/Pause” (Affects playback of music)
“Play iTunes Radio”
“Check email”
“New email to <name>”
“Find pizza near me”
“Find the nearest gas station”

“Turn on Wi-Fi”
“Turn on Do Not Disturb”
“Turn up/down brightness”
“Turn on flashlight”
“Turn on Bluetooth”
“Change text size”

, By default, Siri will perform all web searches using the Bing search engine. If you would rather search with Google, add the word “Google” to your search term. You can also search for images.“Search the web for -----”
“Search Google for -----”
“Search for images of -----”

, Siri can add events to your Calendar app, change them, and provide you information about your events.


“Set up meeting with <name> at ”


”Reschedule my appointment with <name> to <date> “

“Cancel the meeting with <name>”

“When is my next meeting?”


, When you search Wikipedia using Siri, you will be shown the intro image (if there is one) as well as the first paragraph. To read the whole entry, tap the result.

“Show directions to <location>”

“Take me to the nearest ATM”


, Siri has a huge list of commands, and with each iOS update more become available. Try asking questions to Siri to see what results you get. Oftentimes, you won’t even need to say an entire phrase, just the keywords for your query. Siri is especially useful when it comes to automating everyday tasks on your iPad, such as messaging, web browsing, and emailing, so you will find the most functionality there.
, One of the most powerful and popular voice control apps for iOS devices is Dragon Go!

Practice sensible use of your i-devices.",How to Use PadLock," It can be found at http://kitchenbudapest.hu/en/projects/padlock. Your Mac will need to have OS X 10.6 and it must have built-in or external loudspeakers.;

Re-plugging in the removed i-device will also inactivate the alarm.

, Although this alarm is handy, it doesn't stop theft, it merely alerts you to the possibility. When in public places, be sure to:


Keep an eye on your i-devices at all times. This includes those times you think it'll be all right to leave your gear unattended, such as getting up to pay for a coffee or getting a book from the library shelf!
Use a Kensington or similar physical lock for your laptop if at a public library, cafe, etc. (unfortunately, the iPad currently doesn't have a locking port).
Always know the whereabouts on you of your iPhone and iPod; keep well secreted in a bag or enclosed pocket.
Relying on this software when traveling is foolhardy. While you might live in a high trust suburb, city, or country, when traveling, you simply won't know until you've lost something whether you can be as relaxed with your i-devices as you are on home territory. Always assume the worst and guard well!

, You'll find this in the third section of options, above ""Battery.""

, If you have a passcode, you'll be asked to enter it before you can proceed.

""Apple Pay"" allows you to confirm payments using your fingerprint instead of your passcode. This is only available for the iPhone 6, 6s, and SE.
""iTunes & App Store"" allows you to confirm your account information without having to enter your Apple ID password when making purchases.

, Click the home button with one of the fingers you've stored, then leave your finger over the home button. You need to use one of the fingers you've registered in the Touch ID settings.


Try to place your finger directly on the center of the Home button. Make sure your finger and the Home button are both clean and dry.
Don't hold the button down. This will enable Siri instead of unlocking your iPhone or iPad.
When you restart your phone, you'll need to enter the passcode. Touch ID only works when the phone is asleep, not turned off.

, Usually when you make a purchase, you're prompted for your Apple ID password. With Touch ID, just place your registered finger on the Home button when prompted for your login information during a purchase. When your finger is recognized, the purchase will be authorized.

, If your device supports it, you can use Touch ID for one-touch payments with Apple Pay. You'll need an iPhone 6, 6s, or SE to use this feature. Just hold your finger on the Home button and move the iPhone near the terminal. If Apple Pay has been properly configured, the payment will process automatically.


See Set Up Apple Pay for details on getting started with Apple Pay.

, iOS 9.3 added the ability to lock notes in your Notes app. When Touch ID is enabled for Notes, you'll be able to quickly unlock your notes with your fingerprint. See Password Protect Your Notes in iOS for more details.


Open the Settings app and select ""Notes."" Make sure you're running iOS 9.3 or later.
Select ""Password Protection and toggle ""Use Touch ID"" on.
Test it out. You can lock a note in the Notes app by tapping the Share button in an open note and selecting ""Lock Note."" Once the note is locked, you'll need to scan your fingerprint on the Home button after trying to open it.

, The most common reason that your finger won't scan is because there is too much moisture or debris in the way. Wipe your fingers and the Home button clean and try again.

, If you can't reliably unlock your device, you may want to try re-registering the fingerprint. When registering your print again, try to hold the phone and place your finger like you naturally would.


Open the ""Touch ID & Passcode"" option from the Settings app.
Tap ""Fingerprints"" and then select the fingerprint you want to remove.
Tap ""Delete Fingerprint"" and then follow the steps above to re-register it.

, You'll be prompted to enter your passcode after your device boots up from being completely powered off. This is due to the way your data is encrypted. Touch ID will start working again once you enter your passcode.


You'll also be prompted to use your passcode if you haven't unlocked the device in 48 hours, or if you're trying to change your Touch ID settings.

Promote the virtues of your iPad.,
Set up an account at Craigslist, Amazon, and Ebay.,
Close the deal.",How to Sell Your iPad," Backing up your iPad before replacing it allows you to restore your settings, pictures, contacts, apps, and suchlike onto your new device. You easily can back up your iPad to iCloud or iTunes.


For help in backing up your iPad using iCloud or iTunes, check this article out.;
, For your security and peace of mind, and as a courtesy to the buyer, clear your device of its contents after backing it up and before handing it over to him or her. Do so by going to your Settings app, and clicking on “General.” Next, select “Erase All Content and Settings” to reset your device to the state it was when you first purchased it.


The next user will have to use Setup Assistant to reactivate the device.

, If you’re using a 3G or 4G network on your iPad, contact your provider to find out how to transfer your iPad to a new user. This may be as simple as terminating your contract with them, but you should contact your carrier to find out what steps are required of you.

, If you want to part ways with your iPad so you can exchange or upgrade it for another electronic device, a trade-in program may be in sync with your plan. A number of companies allow you to trade in your iPad for credit, cash, or a new gadget.


When deciding which trade-in program is best for you, go to the websites of companies offering the trade-in program to find out how they assess devices, how they offer compensation, and if it will meet your specific requirements.
Compare similar used models sold online for a ballpark figure of how much you can expect to get from these companies.
If your goal is to have extra cash on hand, a trade-in program wherein you receive a gift certificate for a retailer is not ideal. However, if you simply want to get rid of your device without much ado and still get something in exchange, go for the trade-in.

, Apple also allows you to trade in your iPad for a gift card. Recycling can either be done online or at an Apple store. To find out more, check out this portion of Apple's website.

, Unless you already have a customer lined up, determine first how much a same-year iPad would sell for and which selling platforms would be most advantageous to use. Browse for information over at Craigslist, Amazon, and Ebay.


It is also helpful to search for online forums that discuss the topic of selling used gadgets over the Internet. Read about previous sellers’ experiences and their best practices to give you a background of what to expect.

, If you’re going the online route to sell your iPad, take the time to showcase your device and its features as best as you can. Doing so will increase your chances of selling it at a good price.


For example, clean your iPad and take high-resolution photos of it and the accessories you’re throwing in with it. You can go for a higher asking price if your iPad is in great shape and if its original packaging is still intact.

, If you know of other selling platforms, set up an account there as well. Websites that allow customers to bid on items for sale are the best places to make a profit, especially if your device is in great condition and includes accessories.


After your research, set or start with a fair asking price and let the bids begin.

, After receiving bids and agreeing on a price with a particular buyer, conclude the sale of the iPad, and ship it off promptly after making sure all of the agreed-upon accessories are in to fulfill your end of the agreement.

By selecting the ""Add to Notes"" option, you can save links to your Notes app.
Social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook are another way to share links. Twitter will simply give you the option to ""Post"" the link as-is, and Facebook will similarly allow you to ""Post"" the link with the option to add text before sharing.
If you want to add, remove or rearrange your sharing options, scroll all the way to right of your visible sharing options and select the ""More"" option.
You may also use the Share button to add links to Favorites, Bookmarks, your Reading List or Home Screen. These options are located in the row below the previously-mentioned sharing options and also include ""Copy"" and ""Print"" functions.

, A new Mail message will appear with the link included. The subject line of the email will include the page title, but you can edit this at your discretion. Simply type the e-mail address (or multiple addresses, including—potentially—your own) of the person(s) you wish to receive the link into the “To:” field and add (optionally) add any preferred text to the body of the message containing the link.


Note that this method automatically uses the default email account linked to your iOS email client. If you wish to send your link from an alternate email account, you may wish to use a different method instead.

, Your message will be delivered to its recipient(s) just as any other email would.

Send your email.",How to Mail a Link from an iPad2," If you've installed another browser like Chrome or Firefox, you can launch that instead. Subsequent steps will remain the same with any major browser on an iOS mobile device.


Note that rather than using the Share button, this method relies on a basic ""copy and paste"" technique. This may be advantageous if you want to use an email account that hasn't been linked to your iOS client or if you'd like to add a URL to an already-existing email thread (e.g. to reply to someone else's message). This method would also be helpful if you wish to include more than one URL in the same email message.

, Simply click on the URL in the web address bar and make sure the entire link is selected (which will likely happen automatically). Then select the ""Copy"" button that appears after highlighting your desired text.

, This might include clients like Gmail, Microsoft Outlook or Yahoo Mail, and you'll find this located wherever you've stored it on your iPad Home Screen.

, You can either compose a new email or reply to a preexisting email thread. Determine your recipient(s) and make sure their email addresses are entered in the ""To:"" field. Remember that you can also email your own email address if you wish to access your link later. Finally, don't forget to enter your preferred text into the subject line.

, Tap and hold a preferred spot within the body of your email message. You'll see a ""Paste"" option appear. Select the ""Paste"" option, and your link will appear in your message. You may of course add additional text above or below that link.

, Once your message appears as you'd like, just tap the ""Send"" button as you normally would in order to send an email.

, Type in “UPAD” on the search field and tap the “Search” button to begin your search.

, Locate the correct app and tap on it. The app is developed by Pockey Soft.


Tap the “Free” button beside the app then on “Install.”

, Locate the app on your iPad. It has an app icon with a yellow pad background with the letter “U” written on it. Tap on it.

, When UPAD loads, it will display all the pads or files you have on it.

, Tap the plus (+) sign at the bottom toolbar to create a new pad. You will be asked for the memo template to use.


UPAD has some good templates already installed. Scroll through them to see if it has the calendar template you can use.

, Most likely, there’s no calendar template existing yet. This shouldn’t be a problem as you can import any image to be your template. All you need is a workable blank calendar template. Tap the first button from the left to create a new template. The list of options for template sources will be displayed.



Import from Photo Album. Tap photo album icon if the calendar template is saved as a photo in your photo album. Select the template from your photos to load it.

Import from Camera. If you want to take a new photo of the calendar template you want to use, tap camera icon. Use your iPad’s camera and take a photo of the template.

Import from Clip Board. Tap the clip board icon if the calendar template you want to use is already stored in your clipboard. You may have already copied it to your clipboard from another source.

, Select the template by tapping on it. It will immediately be loaded on your screen, ready for use., The best calendar template to use is one set by month and year. Don’t get a calendar template for a whole year as it will be too cluttered and too small to be of any use. Once you’ve loaded it, first thing you have to do is to name it. A good naming convention will be to use the month and year. Write the name on the top of the calendar using your finger directly on the screen.

, If you’ve loaded a blank calendar template, most likely it won’t have any days or numbers on it yet. If it already has, you may skip this step. Otherwise, identify the date boxes by writing the corresponding day numbers.


Be sure to match it correctly with the actual calendar.

, After you’ve identified the month and year and put in the dates, you’re all set to use your custom calendar., Identify the date on your month calendar that you need to mark or write on. Tap on it so you can see where you’re going to write on.

, You can directly write on the screen, but if you’re limited to its size, you can always maximize or minimize, just like any photo on your iPad. Maximize the box you’re writing on for better control on what you’re writing.


You can format your entry by using the formatting tools in the header toolbar. Tap on the icons to use them. There are tools for text boxes, coloring, highlighting, and erasing.

, If you want to write across multiple dates, across the whole week, or even across the whole month, you can. Since the calendar you’re using is technically a photo, you’re not limited by the boxes on the template. You can do whatever you want and write wherever you want.

, Once you’re done making your entries, tap on the leftmost button on the toolbar to save your work and exit the current file. You will be brought to the main library with all your pads or files."

Make sure you're actually ready to break up.,
Never break up over a text or over the phone.,

Don't break up with someone on a date.,
Don't break up with someone just over a small thing.,
Don't break up with someone when they're in a bad or mad mood.",How to Choose a Good Place and the Right Words to Break Up1," Breaking up prematurely will, 99.9% of the time, ruin a relationship. If there's a problem, try to find a way to solve it, and if you can't, you'll either have to deal with it or break up.;
, Common sense, right? Wrong. Breaking up over the phone is a sign of fear to some, and a sign of lying to some.

, If you're breaking up with someone who really likes you, of course they'll cry or get angry. Save yourself the embarrassment and try not to break up with your boyfriend/girlfriend in a place such as the movie theaters, the beach, a restaurant, etc.

, This just ruins the mood, and if it's a movie or restaurant, you're the one whose going to have to pay the bill. Definitely.

, So say your girlfriend/boyfriend crashes your car. Don't get angry and end it just because she/he wrecked your car. If you do, this screams that you don't care about any girl/guy you'll have, and it's extremely hard to get another girl/boy to trust you.

, This IS COMMON SENSE. Breaking up with someone when they're mad is just screaming ""Give me what you got!"" They just might end up taking out their anger on you.

"
"
Don't ever say ""it's not you, it's me"".,
Look them in the eye and be as confident as you can.,
Let them off easily.,
Don't make it seem like a joke.",How to Choose a Good Place and the Right Words to Break Up2," This can be countered by the classical ""Well, why can't we work it out?"" This just makes the situation more intense and longer.

, As I've experienced, it's not smart to act like you don't want to say ""we're done"". If you act like you've thought it out and you know what you're going to say, it helps a lot.

, What do you gain from telling them off? You gain enemies, you gain hate towards you, and you gain a bad reputation.


For boys. Try: ""I'm not ready for a real relationship yet"", ""I'm just not feeling it"", ""I rushed into this relationship"", ""I wouldn't be true to you if I keep forcing a relationship"", ""I don't want to play you"", followed by the ""I'm breaking up with you"".
You rather have her as a friend? Just tell her then. What's the use of hiding it?
For girls. I'm not a girl, so it'd be nice to have a girl do this part.
For both. If you're at a public place and you just have to break up with them there, make sure you're outside or some place where you have some privacy.

, This can **** some people off very quick, and it's even harder to break up with someone when they're upset.

"
"
Don't rush into another relationship.,
When it's done, let it be DONE for a bad relationship.,
When it's over for a good relationship,try to maintain your ex as a friend.",How to Choose a Good Place and the Right Words to Break Up3," If you broke up with your girlfriend/boyfriend for someone else, wait a little while before you date someone else. If you break up with your former boyfriend/girlfriend and get a new one in the same day, people will talk, and not in a good way. Wait for a week to pass, then slowly move on the next one.


If you want them out of your life. When you break up with someone, don't just cast them away like a used tissue. Keep them around and slowly let your contact with them diminish. Don't initiate communication with them or they may think you're still interested in them.
If you want to keep them as a friend. After you break up with them, give them some time, like a day or two. Then, initiate communication with them every now and then, that way they'll think that you're still their friend, but that you're not trying to run back to them.

, If you start talking about how bad a relationship was, word of mouth(the rumor mill, snitches) will get around and more drama than you can imagine will come as a result. Don't talk about it unless you really feel as though it's time to talk to someone about it, and even then, let that someone not be a friend of the ex you're talking about,

, Just because you're not boyfriend/girlfriend status anymore doesn't mean you can't be friends. Even though it may seem awkward to have an ex as a friend, as long as you don't bring up your past relationship with them, you can be friends.

Apologize when you make mistakes.",How to Treat Others With Respect," Teachers work hard to ensure that you have a pleasant and valuable learning experience, so it is important to show them respect. It might be hard to show respect to a teacher with whom don’t always see eye-to-eye, but you can do so by using some simple courteous behaviors.



Address your teacher by his or her name. For example, if your teacher goes by Mrs. Smith, then address her this way. Never use her first name or just call her “Smith” or “teacher.”

Listen when your teacher is talking. Make sure that you are facing your teacher and making eye contact with her. You can also nod your head now and then to show that you understand what she is saying. Don’t look away or try to occupy yourself with something else when your teacher is talking. It is important that you hear what she is saying so that you will know what you are supposed to do.

Raise your hand to ask questions. It is okay if you do not understand something, but you should always make sure that you raise your hand before you ask a question. Raise your hand and wait patiently until your teacher calls on you to ask your question.

Stay on task. If your teacher has asked everyone in your class (or you in particular) to work on something, then make sure that you are doing what she asked. Choosing to do something else when you teacher has given you specific instructions is disrespectful.

Be polite. As in most situations, remembering your manners around your teacher is a good way to show respect, such as by saying “please” and “thank you.”;
, Your parents provide food, clothing, and a place for you to live, so it is important to respect them for everything they do for you. Although it is normal for kids and parents to butt heads sometimes, you can show respect for your parents by doing some simple things.Do your chores. You probably have some household tasks that your parents expect you to do on a regular basis. Doing these chores without being asked first is a good way to show respect to your parents. For example, if it is your job to set the table before dinner, then make sure that you do so each night before your mom or dad asks you to.

Listen. Your parents may feel disrespected if you do not pay attention to them when they are talking, so it is important to be a good listener. Make sure that you look your parents in the eye when they are talking and nod your head to show that you hear and understand.

Use polite language. Say “please” and “thank you” to your parents to show respect. Never swear, make demands, or give your parents the silent treatment. If you are frustrated about something, then use an “I” statement to express how you feel. For example, you might say, “I feel angry because I can’t go to the mall with my friends this weekend.”

Follow the rules. Respecting your parents also means respecting their rules. You can show respect for your parents’ rules by following them. For example, if your parents have a rule that you cannot watch TV until your homework is done, then do your homework before you turn on the TV.

Remember special holidays. Your parents have birthdays just like you do and they will appreciate it if you remember their birthdays. It is also important to remember to do something for your parents on Mother’s Day and Father’s Day. Even giving your parents handmade cards on these special occasions will show that you thought of them and that you respect them.

, Even though your friends are your peers and do not have any authority over you, it is still important to respect them. You can respect your friends by remembering to do certain things when you interact with them.



Allow your friends to have their own opinions and beliefs. Part of respecting people is respecting their right to maintain their own opinions and beliefs and not imposing your opinions and beliefs on them. If you disagree with your friends about something, that is okay. For example, if you have a friend who is a big fan of a band that you think is dumb, it would be disrespectful for you to tease your friend for this. Instead, just recognize that you and your friend have lots in common, but this is something you don’t see eye-to-eye on.

Don’t gossip about your friends. You can also disrespect your friends if you speak ill of them when you are not with them. That is why it is important to avoid gossiping about your friends when they are not around. If someone starts gossiping about a friend, don’t engage in it. You can simply walk away, or say something like, “I don’t think we should be having this conversation. It seems disrespectful.”

Ask your friends before you make plans. Making plans without your friends’ knowledge may also cause them to think you are disrespectful. Always ask your friends for input on what they would like to do before you make plans. For example, if you want to go to see a new movie, then call up your friend and say something like, “Hey, I really want to see this movie. Would you be into that?”

, Even if an adult is not your parent or teacher, it is important to show respect. People who are older than you may see you as disrespectful if you behave in certain ways. But by making sure to avoid certain behaviors and include other behaviors, you can ensure that you are being respectful of your elders.



Don’t break rules. Observe the rules wherever you go. For example, if you are at a public pool and there is a sign that says “No running,” then don’t run.

Avoid cursing or other rude language. Don’t swear at people or insult them if they upset you. Instead, express how you are feeling. You might say something like, “I am really frustrated right now because I think this rule is unfair.”

Say “please” and “thank you.” Always use “please” and “thank you” to show that you are polite and that you appreciate the ways that people help you.

Make eye contact. If an adult is speaking to you, then don’t look away or look down. Look him or her in the eye to show you are paying attention.

Be helpful.For example, if your friend’s mom has invited you to stay for dinner, then you might offer to help by setting the table or doing something else that would help her out.

, Younger kids can be frustrating to be around sometimes, but they are people too and they deserve your respect. You can respect younger people by doing certain things.



Allow them to be silly. Young people might sometimes get on your nerves because they have a different sense of humor than you do, but you should not get upset with them for that. Just remind yourself that you were probably pretty silly at that age too. If you are annoyed, then go into another room for a while.

Don’t shame them for not knowing the things that you do. People learn as they grow, so the younger you are, the less you know. Don’t make fun of young kids for not knowing the things that you do. Instead, try explaining things in ways they can understand. For example, if your little sister is confused about how to add and subtract, then you could show her by using grapes or orange slices. Show her how taking four grapes away from a pile of 10 grapes leaves only six grapes.

Help them when they need help. Young kids cannot do the same things that you can do. They are smaller and they have less control over their muscles. If you notice a young child struggling with something, don’t poke fun at him or her, help the child out. For example, if your little brother is trying to reach something on a high shelf, offer to get it down for him.

Encourage them.Saying something nice is a good way to respect anyone, but young kids may need it even more sometimes. For example, if your little sister gets an A on her math test, give her a high five and tell her you are proud of her.

, If you want to be respectful of others, take some time to consider what that means to you. How would you like people to talk to you? What would you consider an appropriate response if someone disagreed with you?


Take some time to identify the types of behaviors that you consider respectful. You could even make a list of behaviors that you consider respectful.
For example, you might include in your list of respectful behaviors, addressing people by their preferred names, not raising your voice in anger, and being willing to listen when people share an opinion that differs from your own opinion.

, You probably know someone who is respectful in his or her interactions with other people. To learn how to be respectful of other people, pay attention to how this person interacts with others. Consider how he or she handles difficult people and situations.For example, someone who is respectful of others does not yell, resort to name-calling, or use passive-aggressive language. Instead, she may always use an even, yet firm speaking voice, address people by their preferred name, and use assertive statements to express herself.
Consider modeling your behavior after a teacher, parent, or older sibling who behaves respectfully.

, It can be hard to be respectful of other people’s views if you cannot relate to them. That is why it is important to put yourself into someone else’s shoes now and then. The next time you are trying to be respectful of someone you disagree with, try imagining how the person must be feeling.For example, if you are upset with a friend because he has said he is against gay marriage, take a moment to consider why he might have this belief. Is it possible that he was raised in a conservative environment where being gay is discouraged? If so, then this might help you to be respectful of him even though you disagree with his beliefs.
Or, if you are upset because your parents won’t let you stay out past your usual curfew to attend a concert, then you might benefit from considering their perspective. You might conclude that your parents love you and want to protect you from potentially dangerous situations. Although you might still disagree with their decision, understanding their perspective should help you to be respectful if their decision.

, Listening to people and giving them your full attention is an important part of being respectful.Try to practice active listening when someone is talking to you. Some things you can do to be an active listener include:


Allowing a breath and pause after the other person finishes speaking before you respond.Making eye contact and facing the person who is speaking.
Making neutral statements to demonstrate that you are listening, such as “Yes,” “Go on,” and “I see.”

, Collaborating with other people who may not share your perspective is another way to learn how to respect people.Whenever you have to do a group project or team up with someone, look at it as an opportunity to develop your ability to respect others.


For example, you may not agree with a classmate about how to approach a presentation, but be willing to listen to her perspective before you provide your perspective.

, When you have identified the types of behaviors that you see as respectful, then you can start to put those beliefs into practice. By treating people the way that you would like to be treated, you will also be showing them how you want them to treat you.For example, if you are always interrupting a friend when she talks, then she may do the same when you talk. However, if you always listen until your friend has finished speaking, then you will be teaching your friend to do the same when you are speaking.

, Keep in mind that it is normal to get angry sometimes, but this does not make you a disrespectful person. If you feel angry about something someone says or does, then it is okay to acknowledge that feeling. Just make sure that you do not allow the anger to control you and cause you to say or do something that is disrespectful.For example, if someone calls you a hurtful name, then it is normal to feel angry. However, you do not need to retaliate by calling the other person a name. Instead, you might respond by saying something like, “It makes me angry when you call me that name. Please don’t do that again.”

, Being passive-aggressive is a disrespectful form of communication, so it is best to avoid. Instead, try to be assertive when you voice your opinions.For example, if a friend voices an opinion on politics that you disagree with, don’t say “Too bad some people are so ignorant about politics.” Instead, say something like, “I respectfully disagree, and here’s why…”

, Sometimes the topic of discussion may be too personal for you to react in a respectful way. Other times, the person you are dealing with may not be capable of having a respectful conversation. When you end up in a situation where you feel like you are losing your ability to be respectful, then you should just walk away.You have the right to just get up and walk away, but if you are worried about seeming rude, then you can always excuse yourself by saying something like, “Sorry, but I have to go. Have a nice day.”

, Part of being respectful is also knowing when you have crossed a line and said something that you should not have said. If this happens, then you will need to apologize. Apologizing when you make a mistake will demonstrate respect for the other person’s feelings and beliefs.


Try saying something like, “I am sorry for what I said earlier. You have the right to your opinion and I should not have ridiculed you for what you believe.”

Select a time period.,
Take the next step.,
Pay attention to yourself.,
Find yourself.,
Let it go.",How to Cope After a Fight or a Break Up," For any stressful situation, one needs to choose as to how long you are willing to brood over a fight and break up. Every individual is allowed to brood after a fight and mourn over the end of a relationship, however they do not know when to get over this mourning period. Select a time period, it can be a week, one month, a few months, but one needs to make sure that by the end of that time period, they will start over a new leaf.;
, It can be difficult to take the next step but, there is no easier way to do it than taking the leap of faith. A fight/argument/ break up always has a reason. Some people get closure by knowing the reason, but some don't.


If during your brooding/mourning period your ex or your partner comes back to solve the issues you may have in your relationship, then give it a go. Do sit down and listen to what the partner has to say and if the conversation comes up with a solution that works for both, then go for it.
 Couples who get cheated on by their spouses, should avoid getting back to their partners, however not everyone is the same. Some of these spouses have learned their lessons and have not cheated ever since. Spouses who decide to move on can start by improvising on themselves.

, Often people tend to become what their partner wants them to be. This can lead to sacrificing ones self-esteem and the things you like to do in your spare time. Revolving your life around your loved ones is not always healthy for the person themselves. Simply start by doing things that you would do on your spare time. It could range from sports, art, music, dancing, to spending quality time with your friends. Once you get in the habit of doing your own things, your confidence will start coming back. This will in turn lead you to begin your next relationship

, Get your thoughts straight. ""I don't know"" is not a real answer to any ""yes"" or ""no"" question. Learn to accept this statement. Often relationships don't work out as spouses are unsure of what they really want and this often begins as to who are they as a person.


Find out what are your strongest personality points and work on those.""I am a strong willed person"" When you say this to someone, you are saying that I am not a person who gets influenced by anyone and ""that if I believe in something strongly"","" I will get/achieve it ""or ""I follow through it"". Finding out who you are as a person brings out the confidence that you may have lost after a break up/fight.

, When you accept the worst, your mind becomes clear and you are relieved. Your mind will become clear and fresh. It's easier to breathe when you don't worry about your break up every minute of your life. Do not have regrets about what was done. Just let it be as it is.

Consider what the child is saying or doing.,
Be frank and clear.,
Be polite.,
Focus on the behavior, not on the child's personality traits.,
Be amiable.,
If the child persists in being rude, there are several things you can try.",How to Tell Someone Else's Child to Stop Being Rude," Be sure this is a battle worth entering, as trivial things are often best overlooked. Things that are of immediate concern include the child swearing at you, dropping constant f-bombs, name-calling, gouging holes in your soft furnishings, asking intimate questions or rifling through your undies drawer. Things that you might consider letting pass you by include back chatting to his or her own parents, refusing to eat something at your table or making annoying sounds. For the latter instances, take a deep breath; for the former, you are completely within your rights to say something pointed and frank.;
, Adults worry about ""social niceties"" and tend to beat about the bush when trying to convey messages about rudeness and other unacceptable social behaviors, because they're trying to be polite, save face, not tread on toes, etc. Children don't have this socially-ingrained baggage and are much more amenable to being corrected based on the facts presented to them. They understand direct and clear comments that go straight to the behavior in question. The child knows that he or she is doing something wrong or offensive; part of this is often about whether he or she will get called out on it. And when this does happen, the child will know that the game is up.

, Obviously remain polite. But avoid the temptation to sugarcoat the reality; if a child is cursing away, that is the behavior you point out. If a child is digging his or her stylus into your softwood coffee table and leaving holes behind, that is the behavior you point out.


Use the word please when asking the child to stop the behavior in question. It both shows your own restraint and kindness in instructing the child, and it also shows respect towards the child and parents. As an added bonus, it demonstrates the value of using manners when instructing others, something the child will pick up on.
If you are worried about the parents, manners will win the day. It is hard to fault a polite person, who has relied on respecting each other person involved by acknowledging them and using polite language.

, In other words, don't say: ""Johnny, you are such a bad boy, you will end up in jail."" Johnny will think, wow, this person is mean and why do they think I am bad?"" Instead, it is important to direct your comment at what Johnny is doing that bothers you. For example:


""Johnny. That was my favorite economics textbook. It disappoints me that you ripped out pages from it. I now have to buy another one for $89 and I don't have that sort of money. Please put the book down and sit quietly until your visit is over.""
""Missy, I appreciate that you are a sassy girl with lots of confidence. But it is not okay to call me ""@^$^%@&"" either to my face or behind my back. That is disrespectful and unkind. It also hurts my feelings. Please speak nicely about me from now on.""
""Rennie. I understand that you are feeling bored. I can give you some toys to play with from my son's old collection. So, please stop using my glass ornaments as shooting targets and I will fetch those toys for you. While I am fetching them, I am sure your parents will find you a nice and comfy spot to sit down on."" (Note how you can also bring the parents in to do their bit.)

, Use a soft and friendly tone. If you sound whiny bossy or angry, the child may cry, get aggressive or throw a tantrum. If the parents are present, it will reflect badly on you and if they're not there, it's likely they'll get the story secondhand. Stick to firm but polite, and treating this whole occasion as instructional and enlightening, not a telling off.


Smile after you have instructed the child to do something else. This indicates that ""the instruction is done now"" and ""we're not going to bring it up again"".

, For example:


If the child is visiting without parents: Talk to the child quietly but firmly, explaining that you like the child and that he or she is welcome to visit again and play with your children, etc. but that if he or she is not able to respect you/your family/your things, etc., that he or she will not be welcome back if this disrespect continues. Again, name the exact behavior that is bothering you along with how to solve it, and make it clear that once the warning has been given, it won't be raised again unless the child breaches it.
If the child is visiting with the parents: Ask the parents to stop the child from misbehaving. For example, you might say: ""Jenny and Rick, I love having you over here. I would be happy though if you would kindly ask your child to stop breaking my china ornaments. I have asked him/her to leave the ornaments alone and I have given him/her toys to play with but still the behavior is happening. Please ask your child to stop so that there are no more breakages during this visit. Otherwise, maybe it's time to finish up for today."" Many a parent will be mortified enough to respond quickly; if not, then maybe these people are not ideal visitors.

Set a bottom line.,
Explain why good manners are important to you.,
Dig deeper into your teen’s behavior.",How to Teach Teenagers Manners1," Communicate what sort of behavior you expect from your teen. Be detailed and specify what the basic standards of politeness are for various situations in your home, from answering the telephone or door to sitting down to dinner.The idea is not to establish a Miss Manners level of civility in your house, but to set the bare minimum. Make it clear that you will not accept anything less.
How do you expect your teen to answer the telephone, for instance? Is it “Hello, Thompson residence, Grace speaking” or are you willing to accept anything above an annoyed “Hullo?”
How about at the dinner table? Is just attending the bottom line? Or do you also have rules, i.e. no interrupting, no criticizing the food, no snarky remarks, and no talking with a full mouth?
Don’t forget to note other exchanges. Do you expect your teen to say “thank you” in certain situations, like after you drive them to a friend’s house? Or will you be content with less, so long as it’s snark-free?;
, Explain to your teen why you feel that it’s beneficial to use good manners around others. Don’t expect that she will “buy in” because of your speech. The aim, like setting a bottom line, is again to set basic standards.Communicate your feelings clearly and concisely. I.e., “Good manners are about showing respect, empathy, and kindness to others. It’s the right way to treat people, and by showing good manners others will treat you well in return.”You teen might want to debate you on the merits of good manners. Don’t let her. You are stating your opinion, not asking for hers.
Instead, make it clear that you will not be flexible on the matter. Say, for example, “You don’t have to agree with my views. That’s OK. But these are my rules and I expect you to follow them as long as you live in this household.”, If using simple good manners is a trial for your teen, and if you are able, sit down and ask her why. She may give an incoherent reply, “’Cause being polite is stupid.” However, there may well be reasons.


Try to be empathetic and understanding. Remember that your teen is going through a lot of big changes and that you went through them once, too.
Why is your teen such a lout? Well, teens are notoriously moody. This may be hormonal or due to changes in other areas of the brain. Some scientists even think that teens have a lower ability to recognize emotions in others.Teens are also very self-absorbed. This is a natural part of development and has been called “adolescent egocentrism.” It’s possible that your teen is so wrapped up in inner life that she’s unaware of being thoughtless or rude.It could be that your teen is simply going through a tough time at school, as well, or is worried about things like fitting in or her appearance.

Be direct.,
Be kind.,
Keep it objective.,
Be consistent.,
Elaborate briefly.,
Don't lie.,
Ask for empathy.,
Don't waver.,
Offer an alternative.,
Keep a schedule.,
Pick your battles.,
Consider what's best for you.",How to Say No to Others Without Offending Them," Try to have a strong tone of voice, without appearing harsh or intimidating. It should be obvious that you're not available, but that you appreciate the thought. Being firm and giving the ask-er your full attention demonstrates thoughtfulness, and shows you're not dismissing them needlessly.


Say it fast. Don't trip over your words, but don't stop to chat if you've made it known you have places to be.A good example of the need for brevity are run-ins at work:

Them: ""Hey, I could use your help with a presentation later today.""
You: ""Nope, can't do it. Unfortunately got my hands tied with work all afternoon.""
Them: ""How about now?""
You: ""Gotta start the work sometime, I'm afraid; good luck with the presentation, though. Remember: don't just read what the projector shows. Gotta be running now, see you later.""
Offering a quick bit of advice--whatever you can spare--is a kind gesture if you've got to brush someone off. Always look to have the last word, and make sure to go when you've said ""I'm going.""

;
, This is the ""thanks"" in ""no, thanks,"" and is the key to an inoffensive rejection. You'll want the person asking to know you're happy that they've thought of you, and you'd like them to continue thinking of you in the future.


Say it in person, if possible. Especially if it's something of significance, people appreciate a face-to-face meeting, particularly in this age of text messages and e-mails.Kindness is key if turning down someone for an outing, or a date:

Them: ""Would you want to be my plus one at that work gala this weekend?""
You: ""That's so sweet of you to ask, but unfortunately I can't make it.""
Them: ""No worries, I knew it couldn't hurt to ask.""
You: ""I'm glad you did; I appreciate the thought.""



, Don't make it personal--making it personal is a definite way to offend someone, even if you don't mean to. Let them know you'd love to help them, but unfortunately have no time for that. This helps to keep the conversation level-headed and unemotional.


For example, if someone asks you to help them move on the weekend, but you've already got plans, make it known:

You: ""Oh, I wish I could help but I've made plans already.""
Them: ""I see; are you sure? I know how people hate to move stuff.""
You: ""Yeah, I promised a friend from out of town time to hang out this weekend. I'm bummed, I'd love to see your new place.""
Them: ""Got it. You'll have to come over sometime later then.""
You: ""Sounds like a plan.""



, Know what you've said no to, and be mindful what you say ""yes"" to after the fact. Avoid seeming available to help someone else so soon after dismissing another. Whether the original person has all the facts or not, they make think you've brushed them off to help someone else.


For example, if you've already given a no to an unpopular co-worker, careful what you agree to later:

Them: ""Are you still coming to the barbecue this weekend?""
You: ""Turns out my mother is coming into town, so probably not. I'd think of swinging by but I already turned down Glen for something with the same reason.""
Them: ""Glen will probably be at the party.""
You: ""Then it's a definite no. I'm not looking to hurt his feelings.""



, As mentioned above, brevity is the heart of a polite rejection. However, any person asking for your help deserves an explanation as to why you can't. This demonstrates concern and consideration on your part, and moves them to understanding instead of frustration.


Avoid over-explaining. Don't detail every to-do item that keeps you from helping. It not only wastes time, it provides an opportunity for ask-er to work around your ""no,"" to exchange help for help, potentially.
Put the blame on you, but don't insult yourself. Avoid convincing others that you should not have been asked in the first place--or that there is someone better. Instead, reassure them that you would help if you could. , If you're trying not to offend anybody, avoid lying to dismiss someone. Worse than the awkwardness of an honest ""no, thanks"" or ""I'd really rather not"" is the upset that comes from getting caught in a lie.


If you're really without a good excuse, just be straightforward. At worst, you've lost the attention of someone who wouldn't respect your honesty.

, If the person to whom you've said ""no"" is giving you more than a hard time about it, ask them to consider being in your shoes. Help them to understand the what and why of your ""no."" Don't fear being totally honest with a person about your situation if they insist on asking for some of your time.


Don't strain yourself in pursuit of their empathy. Some people just won't take no for an answer, and in this instance those people will always be upset with you. Know when you've said all you can.

, Let them know that, unfortunately for them, your ""no"" means no. Be careful of people who will try to change up what they're asking in the hopes of finding a ""yes."" Caving in only cheapens your word, and will have others flocking to you with word of an easy target.


Don't be afraid to repeat yourself, or even walk away. On occasion, the ""no"" will mean the end of the conversation if the person asking refuses the polite no.

, While you're not able to help, perhaps you know someone who can. Or perhaps you know a new, more efficient method. In any case, proposing an alternative when saying ""no"" proves to the person asking that you've put thought into your rejection.


Consider offering your help at a later date. If possible, this avoids rejection while also giving you the time you need to finish the tasks at hand.
Defer to a co-worker. You demonstrate modesty by admitting that a peer may be better equipped to help than yourself. If not better equipped, do your best to find a colleague who is simply less busy. , If your ""no"" is because you just don't have time, your schedule can be an easy, on-hand way to prove it. Even if you know the answer, consider scrolling through your datebook only to come across something already scheduled; you'll say ""oh, darn"" and apologize, wishing you were free., Know what you're saying ""no"" to. If your boss or co-worker desperately need your assistance, know what if would mean to them for you to help. Weigh that with what you already have planned, and make the reasonable choice. Don't say ""no"" off-hand to something before investigating it--it might be a great opportunity.

, In the calculus behind give someone a ""yes"" or ""no,"" you're usually tempted to only consider what it will mean for the person asking--which you should do, just don't consider them alone. Know your limits and know what you'll get out of the experience.


Don't spread yourself too thin. Part of learning to say ""no"" is avoiding exactly this. Be careful not to give to so many that you end up giving very little to anyone in particular. Saying ""no"" is part of being a determined, focused person; let it be known that you'll take things one at a time.

Think through why you want to retract your apology.,
Consider how the apology and a retraction will be viewed by others.,
Consider whether the energy expended on retracting your apology is worth it.,
Find the right words.,
Do not rub salt into the wound.",How to Take Back an Apology," It's important that the reasons for your retraction are honest, realistic, and based on good grounds. Some examples of why you might feel the need to take back an apology include:


If you apologized for saying something about a person who claimed it was untrue but then facts later reveal that what you said was spot on, you might feel the need to retract your apology and return to your former comments, publicly.
Perhaps where you apologized but the person receiving the apology has continued to trash you and drag you through the mud despite you offering to be conciliatory. Of course, this needs to be weighed with you trying to rise above their ""gutter-sniping"".
From a professional standpoint, you might feel that without a retraction of your apology, facts, research, or viewpoints that you uphold or promote might be compromised.
You're still scratching your head as to what you actually apologized for...;
, People viewing the situation will often see it for what it is much of the time, and will understand your role. It is important to give credit to people for seeing the situation with some level of being on your side if your original apology turns out to have been based on the other person's falsehoods or inaccuracies.


If you don't think that is the case, however, perhaps an explanation of your ""regrets"" and ""feelings"" is better than an outright retraction of an apology.
On the other hand, if the apology concerns your principles, something that you stand for professionally, or something that will impact your future career, then there may be a good reason to retract it openly and with clarity.
Is a retraction of an apology essential to set a record straight, such as about scientific/economic/research facts? In this case, you may have no choice in order to ensure professional integrity and data accuracy.

, Sometimes it is better to let bygones be bygones and to live with such a reputation-hitting bump in your life, especially where the alternative is to stir the hornet's nest again and throw you back into a frenzied debate. It really depends on whether or not the principle or issues at stake really matter to you and how you consider your standing in the public sphere will appear if you do or don't retract the apology. Consider the following:


Will taking back your apology bring about more arguing, debating, or mistrust? Is that something you can live with, or that you're keen to sustain?
Will taking back an apology make you seem selfish, indecisive, obsessive? Think of all the negatives involved!

, Equally important as to understanding the why of taking back an apology, and working through the consequences, is the how. Finding the right words will be easier if you remain calm, level-headed and cautious in your approach. It isn't possible to create a one-size-fits-all apology retraction, as each answer needs to fit who you are, what the situation is, and who you're taking back the apology from, but here are some ideas to inspire you:


""I realize that the matter X was really important to you. Facts since have shown me however, that you were not speaking in good faith about the matter X. And since the new facts have come to light, I no longer believe I was wrong to say what I said, therefore I withdraw my apology and return to supporting what I said before my apology.""
""I regret the confrontation we've had over the past few weeks. I apologized in good faith but I no longer believe that my apology was appropriate and I take it back. I wish you all the very best.""
""I am sorry that you feel so angry/disappointed, etc. about matter X but my apology was aimed at what I said about matter X, not at you. I still remain firm in my conviction that matter X is a dangerous menace to society and I retract my apology over that statement, although I still defend your right to speak your own mind about it.""
""I take back my apology to you about X matter. I don't feel that you played fair and I know now that you lied to me. I am willing to keep talking about it with you but I am not apologizing for my take on it.""

, The best means for withdrawing an apology is to do it, then leave it. You will most likely stir up some sort of controversy whether it's a love tiff, a workplace disagreement, or a legislative fisticuffs. From this point on, you simply have to be prepared to uphold your choice and to get on with your life. Do not keep badgering, hounding, or repeating the matter - it's done with, and you've made your point.

Demonstrate good manners at home.,
Be polite in public.,
Be civil to your teen.,
Admit to failings.",How to Teach Teenagers Manners2," Live by your own rules to set a good example for your teen. This means being civil at home, saying please, thank you, and excuse me, and being polite in your daily interactions.


In setting an example, go beyond the basic standards you have set out. When you answer the phone, say something like “Hello, this is Dan. How can I help you?”
Practice good table etiquette. Help to set the table and clean up. Don’t chew with your mouth full. Eat with silverware rather than with your hands. Wait until the meal is over or ask to be excused before leaving the table.Share spaces like the shower, the bathroom, the computer, and the television room. Don’t monopolize them and allow others a turn.
Thank your teen if he helps you or does something thoughtful. Recognize his contributions.

, Setting an example in good manners extends to your interactions at work, at the store, at the park, and anywhere else you may be. Demonstrate that you try to be as polite to strangers as to your own family.


If you bump into someone, say “I’m sorry, please excuse me” or “Pardon me.” Make room on the sidewalk for others, do not litter, and thank people who hold open doors for you.Treat service employees well. Your teen will notice if you talk down to a cashier, don’t tip a waiter, or are rude to stranger.

, Try to take the high ground and to remain civil to your teen, no matter how hard and no matter how impolite he may be. This does not mean you should let him walk all over you. However, try to keep your cool.


Speak civilly. Try not to raise your voice or to respond in kind to snarky comments or insults. By taking the high ground you will avoid escalation and continue to model good behavior.Say, for instance, “I’m about to lose my temper. Please leave the room if you can’t talk to me more civilly.”
Some teens like to bait parents. Don’t fall for it. Losing your temper doesn’t work, and you will undermine your cause.
Try to stay empathetic. Remember how you felt as a teenager, what your moods were like, and how you might have clashed with your own parents.

, Own up to your own failures in being polite and good-mannered. If your teen points out a flaw, take responsibility for it rather than making excuses.


Say, “You’re right. I was a bit rude to that attendant. I shouldn’t have done that.” Or, “Yes, I ought to have given my seat to that older gentleman. That was the polite thing to do.”
Use your failings as a learning opportunity. If caught in a lapse of manners, try to engage your teen and ask him how you could have better responded.

"

Be tolerant of the occasional rudeness.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Prompt the teen non-critically.,
Punish consistently.,
Try deprivation, restitution, or reparation.",How to Teach Teenagers Manners3," Your teen may be off in her own world and oblivious to those around her. Try to be empathetic and tolerant of her lapses. But, on the other hand, do not forget and don’t allow them to build into worse manners.Low-level lapses in manners are things like forgetting to say please or thank you. Or, perhaps your teen forgot to help clean the table in her rush to go out.
Take more care when it comes to talking back, making snarky comments, rolling the eyes, or refusals to cooperate. Be less willing to tolerate this sort of behavior.

, Reward your teen when she does well. It doesn't have to be something big, but let her know that you’ve noticed her effort and appreciate it. Praise her good manners and encourage more of the same.


Say something like, “Thanks for helping me take in the groceries, Alex. You’re so helpful today!” or “You’ve been so polite today, Alex. I appreciate it.”
Note automatic and deliberate good manners equally. If your teen was on auto-pilot, you will end up drawing her attention to the behavior that earned praise.

, In the absence of other signs, assume that your teen’s rudeness is simply a part of self-absorption. Point out when she might have shown better manners, without being overly judgemental.Some studies show that negative rather than positive reinforcement is more effective on teens.To a teen, however, any unsolicited advice sounds preachy. Try to phrase your prompt as a polite request.
Say something like, “Please try to say excuse me, Sam” or “Please ask me before you take my things, Sam.”
Phrasing the prompt in question form will make it sound even less judgmental. I.e., “Can you please say excuse me, Sam?” or “Can you please ask me before you take my things, Sam?”

, If your teen continues to behave uncivilly – and you know that it’s deliberate – keep cool, but make the penalty swift, clear, and consistent. Sometimes a teen need to learn the consequences of bad manners directly.


Behavior that merits a punishment might include talking back or refusing to cooperate, hurling insults, or picking on siblings. Minor lapses will probably not need to be punished.
Unless the behavior is really serious, consider giving a final quiet warning: “Stop that, Max. If you do it again I will ask you to leave.” Or, take the teen aside for a private chat., How do you punish a teen? One common strategy is deprivation. You might take away his privileges on the computer, cell phone, television, or other electronic device. You might also “ground” him, restricting his social life for a short period.Another way is restitution. This involves naming a penalty or specific task for the teen to “work off” the offense. For example, you could assign your teen more chores for a week. I.e. “You’re going to have to make up for your behavior with some extra work. I want you to clean all the house’s windows before you see your friends – to my satisfaction.A final way is reparative punishment. This can work if your teen’s bad manners have a “victim.” Did he offend Grandma by not writing a thank you note for Christmas? Arrange a meeting where Grandma can air her hurt feelings, and where he can apologize and make amends."

, Try exchanging simple introductions. Simply approach the newcomer and tell them your name and title if you are on the job or at an organization’s meeting.

Try to get to any newcomers as quickly as possible so they are not walking around aimlessly with no one to talk to.

, After your brief introduction, you will want to find out more about your guest. In general, people enjoy speaking about themselves, so allow your guest to do so. Ask them their name, what they do, how they heard about your organization, and any other questions you might find pertinent.You might say something like “So what’s your name?” and when they reply ask “How did you hear about our organization?”

, During this welcoming process, be mindful that not all people are equipped to be social constantly. Many introverts need some time to themselves to recharge. Provide a space that has games, puzzles, or pamphlets so that these guests and others can take a breather.Choose games that most people enjoy and that are quick and easy to play.
Make sure any and all pamphlets that you have are up to date.

, Let them know that you are available if they have any questions at all or just want to talk. If you have a listserv that announces any upcoming dates in your organization or office, see if they would like to be added to that so they can stay informed.


You can also tell them to reach out to you on social media.

, If your organization has a website, make sure that this information is updated regularly so that newcomers can stay up to date. Having misinformation on your site can make you look disorganized and it can deter new membership.Ensure that you have one concise website rather than multiple. The same goes for social media, as well.

Have a sexy goodbye.",How to Talk Dirty on the Phone," If you want to have a flawless dirty talk phone date, then you have to make sure that both you and your partner are alone and ready to start having a sexy conversation. Your dirty talk won't go very far if you're ready in bed while your partner is having dinner with his mom. Plan your dirty talk date in advance so both of you are free and alone at home or in your rooms.;
, Take a nice warm bath and put on some sexy lingerie and a hot outfit. Even if your partner won't be able to see what you're wearing, you'll be more easily turned on if you look ready for some action. You can even rub some scented oil or lotion on the nape of your neck to get you in the mood.

, Would you have sex with your dirty laundry all over your room and empty takeout containers all over your desk? Hopefully not. You shouldn't talk dirty until you're in a romantic atmosphere either. Just clean up your space, dim the lights and light some candles, and lie in your clean, welcoming bed. Do whatever you would do to prepare to get it on for real.

, Before you pick up the phone or start getting turned on, don't stare at yourself in the mirror or analyze every last thing you'll say to your lover. Even if you're a dirty talk virgin, the process will feel more natural if you just sit back, relax, and get ready for what's to come.

, This doesn't mean you should touch yourself -- unless you want to -- but it does mean that you should start getting in a sexy mental space. Close your eyes and think of your most illicit sexual fantasy, or remember the last time it got really hot and heavy between you and your lover.


If it helps, you can lightly caress your body to get in the mood. But you should save most of that for your phone conversation.

, It should still sound like you -- but like a sexier, slower-talking version of you. Don't use the same voice you would use to ask your honey how his day went. Instead, talk a bit lower and more slowly -- you can even lower your voice to a near-whisper if you want to. Just make sure it still sounds like you to an extent.

, You don't have to say anything X-rated right away. Just start with a few basic compliments. Tell your special someone how much you've missed him, and how amazing his body is. You can even remind him of the last time you had sex and how hot it was. Just start saying nice things to your lover to get into the mood. Here are some things you can say:


""I've been thinking about your toned arms all day.""
""I miss you and your body so much.""
""I love hearing your voice.""

, Tell your lover what you're wearing and describe it in great detail. Talk about how your body looks in your clothes, and mention any parts that are exposed. Ask your lover what he or she is wearing and close your eyes and imagine him or her in those clothes. Here are some ways to describe what you're wearing:


For women:

""I'm wearing your favorite bra.""
""I'm not wearing any underwear.""
""My dress is really tight around my chest.""


For men:

""My shirt is tight around my biceps.""
""I'm wearing that belt you love to take off.""
""I'm wearing a button-down shirt. It comes off pretty easily.""



, Start slow. Just say a few things that you wish would happen if your lover was there. You can get as graphic as you want, but you can start with the basics as you build toward your more elaborate fantasies. Here are some things you can say:


""I wish your arms were around me right now.""
""I wish I could kiss your neck right now.""
""If you were here, I'd start nibbling on your ear. You wouldn't be able to stop me.""

, You can do this at any point while you're talking dirty. But the earlier you do it, the more turned on you'll be. Start gently stroking your own body and let your lover know what you're doing. Then, ask him or her to touch his or her own body and be detailed about what you want him to do. Just like real foreplay, you don't have to touch yourselves anywhere too untoward -- just start with a light touch that turns you on.


As you keep talking, you can start touching yourself in your erogenous zones.
Let your lover exactly what you're doing to your body. If you're caressing your breasts or stomach, tell him.
Describe all of the sensations you feel to your lover. If you start to feel a sexy shiver after lightly caressing your neck, describe it.

, Start talking about all of the things you wish your lover would do to your body until you're both bursting with excitement. Take turns telling each other what you wish you could do to each other. This can get more graphic than just saying what you want to do to your lover.

, Let your lover know exactly what you would do to his or her body if you were there. Now that you're starting to get excited and to touch your own body, you can kick it up a notch and say whatever you want to do to his body, no matter how dirty it is.

, Don't be shy -- tell your lover how turned on you are just from talking to him and thinking about him next to you. Let him know that you're excited and that you feel it all over your body. If you're so turned on that you feel it in your toes, tell your lover.

, Once you're really excited, share your fantasy with your lover, no matter how dirty it may be. He'll play along and talk about it with you, helping you get more turned on as you picture yourselves enacting the fantasy together. Don't be afraid to put it all out on the phone line -- just close your eyes and start talking.

, Don't just start stripping -- let your lover in on the peep show, button by button. If you're taking off your shirt, let him know that it's sliding over your head. If you're taking off your belt, let your lady know that you're dropping your belt to the floor. Paint a picture of your body that will turn on your lover even more.


You can also ask your lover to take off his clothes. Ordering him or her around will be extra hot. You can just say, ""Now take off your shirt"" or, ""I want you to pull down your skirt.""
When you start taking off your clothes, you can ask your lover for validation. As you're taking off your shirt, you can ask, ""Are you sure you want me to take off my shirt?"" This will help paint a visual image for your lover.

, If you just want to talk dirty just for fun or practice, then you can get off the phone and get off on your own. But if you really want to commit to talking dirty, then you and your lover should touch yourselves until you orgasm. If you want to keep things hot and heavy, you can announce your orgasm, and tell your lover that you're about to come. This will build anticipation and will turn both of you on even more. Once you've both orgasmed, you can say goodbye and look forward to your next dirty talk date.


Don't be shy -- tell your partner when you're touching yourself, and let him or her know how it's making you feel. Be as graphic as you want.
As in real sex, it's pretty difficult to climax at the same time as your partner. If you climax first, just keep talking dirty to turn on your partner. Don't stop and ruin the mood. Keep talking dirty until both people are satisfied.

, Don't start transitioning into talking about how your days went; don't start telling goofy jokes, either. Just as you would cuddle after real sex, say some sweet, soft words to your lover and let him know how amazing he makes you feel. Get off the phone after a little while -- if you want to have a normal conversation with your lover, do it a bit later, so you can enjoy the sexy feeling after your dirty talk date.

Find out what they enjoy and what they’re good at.,
Introduce them to others.,
Include them in conversations.,
Provide activities for them to participate in.,
Acknowledge their contributions.,
Invite them to other events.,
Ask them their thoughts.",How to Welcome New People2," Everyone wants to feel that they have something to contribute. Begin asking them questions about their interests as it relates to your organization or office. You do not need to probe them too hard, but finding out some basic information early can be helpful in providing them with a quality experience.If they are at your organization’s meeting, you might ask “So what brings you to us today? What are you hoping to gain from this experience?”
If they are new to your office or friend group you could ask “What kinds of things are you interested in either professionally or personally?”

, When the newcomer arrives, after introducing yourself and getting to know them a bit better, introduce them to others as well. Asking those basic questions like “what are your interests?” can help you identify which people in your organization or office to introduce them to first.You might say something like “Hey Karen, I wanted to introduce you to Jorge. This is his first meeting. Jorge tells me that he’s an attorney, too.”

, Once you have successfully introduced your new guest to others, don’t leave it at that. Work to actively engage them in any group conversations that you might be in. Often times, you and your group may have inside jokes that your guest may not understand. Try to avoid those during this new time.You might say something like “Yeah, speaking of technology, Ada just showed me her new phone. It’s definitely one of the coolest I’ve seen.”

, Activities like games allow for new people to blend into a group with a bit more ease than does having a conversation. Provide some space for activities during this time of welcoming guests so that they can feel on equal footing with others. Try not to play something that you have already played often so that you don’t have an unfair advantage.Perhaps you want to do a fun icebreaker or play a card game.

, If they should make any contribution of value during this first gathering, be sure to acknowledge that. People enjoy being recognized for their input and will be more likely to return if they feel valued and productive.Say something like “Mary, thank you so much for coming tonight. And thanks again for that fundraising idea. I would never have thought of that!”

, Once the event is over, invite them to come back for your next event or to something unrelated to the group. For instance, you might have an upcoming social event that they might be interested in or perhaps you are going to the movies soon. Invite them and ask if they would like to bring a friend.

, After the meeting or event is over, find out their thoughts. See if there was anything that they enjoyed or that they did not like in particular. Find out if they feel that any information was missing.A more formal way of collecting this information from newcomers is to do an assessment and have them fill it out. It can have questions like “On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy tonight’s event?” Make these surveys confidential.

"
"
Don’t crowd them.,
Avoid giving responsibilities too early.,
Avoid being clique-ish.",How to Welcome New People3," Make sure that you are giving your new guests some breathing room. Do not hold their hand or attempt to babysit them from the time they walk in until they leave. Be friendly and inviting and connect them with others but do not feel that it is your total responsibility to watch over them.Don’t try to make them stay if they have decided to go. Don’t try to sign them up for anything that they are not interested in.
Don’t make them talk, especially if they are shy.

, People can be off-put if they are given too much too soon. Though they can certainly volunteer for whatever they want, avoid assigning them any task during their first meeting.

, Though it can be easy to relegate yourself to your pre-established friend groups, avoid being clique-ish in general, but especially when new members are present. If you see others doing so, remind them that you have guests and encourage them to introduce themselves."

Sneeze into something.,
Clench your teeth and jaw to suppress the sound.,
Cough as you sneeze.",How to Sneeze Quietly1," Keep a tissue or a thick handkerchief with you at all times. A tissue is portable and disposable, but a handkerchief will do a better job of muffling the sound. If you have no other choice, bury your nose into your shoulder, your arm, or the crook of your elbow. Any fabric or solid body part will help keep your sneeze quiet.;
, Leave your mouth slightly open so that you don't build up too much pressure in your sinuses. Done correctly, this move should lessen the intensity of your sneeze.If you hold your breath at the same time, you might even be able to stop the sneeze from coming.

, Make sure to get the timing just right. By mixing up the reflex to sneeze with the reflex to cough, you might lessen the sound and severity of each noise.

Respond with “you’re welcome.” This is one of the most obvious and widely used responses to “thank you.” It conveys that you accept their gratitude.Avoid saying “you’re welcome” in a sarcastic tone.,
Say “thank you!” This conveys that you are also grateful for their contributions.,
Say “It’s my pleasure.” This conveys a sense of enjoyment in the act of doing something for others.,
Tell them, “I know you’d do the same for me.” This conveys that you have a reciprocal relationship where you do each other favors out of good will.,
Say ""no problem."",
Choose a casual response.,
Watch your body language.","How to Respond to ""Thank You""1"," Unless you want to convey that you didn’t really appreciate doing the job for someone or don’t appreciate them in general, it is best to avoid a sarcastic tone.;
, Responding with a “thank you” conveys a reciprocal sense of gratitude. However, avoid repeating it multiple times in the same conversation. One thank you for each person in the conversation will do just fine., It can be heard at five star hotels but could be used more widely.For instance, if a friend says, “Thanks so much for making this delicious meal!” You might respond by saying, “It’s my pleasure.” This conveys your enjoyment of cooking for for others.

, It also communicates confidence in your ability to help and activates the reciprocity of the partner.For instance, if your friend says, “Thanks for helping me move into my new apartment this weekend. I don’t know what I would have done without you!” You might reply, “I know you’d do the same for me.” This conveys an understanding that you have a great friendship built on reciprocity.

, This is a common response but should be used sparingly, especially in a business setting.It conveys that what you did was no big deal. This can be fine in certain situations but can also diminish the relationship building opportunity of the interaction.Only say ""no problem"" if it is true. If something took effort or time, don't be afraid to accept the other person's gratitude.
For instance, if your friend says “thank you” for a small act like grabbing something out of the trunk of the car, you might say “no problem.”
Avoid saying “no problem” in a dismissive tone. This conveys that you didn’t really put any work into whatever it is that you are being thanked for. Your friend or business partner will feel like your relationship is not important., If you are replying to gratitude in casual settings or relationships, there are a variety of phrases to choose from. If you are responding to expressions of gratitude for very small things and a you need a quick response, these phrases may be appropriate.


Say ""it's alright"". This phrase is best used in moderation. It can be used in situations where ""thank you"" is being offered for very small or petty things. Like “no problem,” it should not be said in a sarcastic or dismissive tone.
Say ""anytime!"" This is another one which can be used to assure the person that in such situations help can always be given. It conveys that you are willing to do the favor or task anytime.
Say “glad to help.” This conveys that you are happy to help your friend or acquaintance with the job or task. For instance, if your friend says “thanks for helping me install my new bookshelf.” You could say, “glad to help!”

, Your expression and body language can help make you seem sincere, personable, and helpful. When accepting thanks, remember to smile. Make eye contact with the other person as you speak, and nod along to what they say. Avoid crossing your arms or looking away."
"
Be prepared!,
Focus on the other person.,
Pay a genuine compliment.,
Try the abrupt approach.,
Consider your relationship.",How to Change the Subject in a Conversation1," If you know you’ll be going into a situation where you’ll be talking to a lot of strangers, think of 2-3 topics for small talk before you get there.


Choose topics that are of interest to many people - hobbies, sports, and tech gadgets are a good place to start.;
, Since people like to talk about themselves, focusing on the other person can make it easier to change the subject.


Choose a topic that you know is important to your conversation partner. Examples include hobbies, an upcoming event, or a work project.

, This smooth way to change the subject can be used no matter who you’re speaking with. Find a specific aspect of the person’s jewelry, shoes, clothing, and say something nice about it! You can also expand on this new subject by asking for more information about the item or feature you are complimenting. For example, “Where did you get that great tan?”

, If there is a lull in the conversation, change the topic completely rather than returning to it or trying to transition to another topic more gradually.


Ask a “conversation starter” question, such as: “What’s the oddest job you’ve done?” or “If you can have dinner with any three people, who would they be?” , When deciding what topic you want to change the subject to, think about your relationship with the person to whom you are speaking. Are you trying to change the subject with a co-worker, someone you just met, or your mother-in-law? The stronger your relationship with the person, the more flexibility you have in topics to choose from. With strangers, stick to small talk. Since you don’t know the person, you can’t know what subjects might be touchy for them. The weather is almost always a safe topic.
If you’re trying to get to know someone, trade information. For example, ask the person why they are at the conference where you just met. With friends or co-workers, you can trade opinions. If you want to change the subject, give your opinion of a related topic. For example, your friend is complaining about the food at a restaurant that you chose, and you want to change the subject. Ask something like, “Isn’t this music unusual?”
With close friends and family, you can discuss feelings. This is the most intimate topic of conversation, but emotions are a valid topic if you are trying to change the subject with your spouse or your sister. Ask how the person is feeling about something you discussed in a previous conversation.

"
"
Hold your breath.,
Use your tongue.,
Push your nose up.",How to Sneeze Quietly2," When you feel a sneeze coming on, inhale powerfully through both nostrils, and hold in your breath until the urge has passed. You may be able to counteract the sneeze reflex. Do not plug your nose. Holding your breath can be effective, up to a point, but plugging your nose during a sneeze can have serious health consequences. Among other disturbances of the ear and nasal passages, this can cause larynx fractures, ruptured eardrums, voice changes, bulging eyeballs, and bladder incontinence.
Bear in mind that while holding a sneeze back might be effective, it also might leave you feeling somewhat stuffed-up.

, Press the tip of your tongue firmly into the roof of your mouth, right behind your top two front teeth. This should hit the spot where the alveolar ridge or ""gum palate"" reaches up to the roof of your mouth. Push as hard as you can until the urge to sneeze goes away. Done correctly, this can stop a sneeze in its tracks.This strategy is most effective if you do it the moment that you feel a sneeze coming. The longer the sneeze has to build, the harder it will be to stop.

, When a sneeze is coming, place your index finger beneath your nose and push up slightly. If you time it right, you might be able to suppress the sneeze. At the very least, this move should lessen the intensity of the sneeze."

Offer sincere replies in a business setting.,
Make people feel special.,
Say “You’re very welcome.” This is a classic response and keeps things simple.For instance, when a partner says “Thanks for writing up the contract,” you can simply say, “you’re very welcome.”

,
Offer a warm reply to a customer or client.","How to Respond to ""Thank You""2"," In business meetings and relationships, you should avoid casual replies and show your sincerity when responding to “thank you.”


Avoid using casual replies in a business setting. For instance, you should avoid phrases like “no problem,” “anytime,” and “it’s alright” when replying to a client or customer.Use a warm and sincere tone when replying to “thank you.”After the meeting, you can send an email or note that expresses appreciation for your business relationship. This will make the other person remember how helpful you were!

, When replying to “thank you,” it is best to offer a response that makes them feel that your relationship with them is special and unique.For instance, you might say, “That’s part of the complete commitment to service that you can expect when you do business with me.”
Try saying, “That’s what good business partners do for one another. Thanks for doing business with us.”
If you know anything about the client, you can personalize the message. For example, you can say, ""It is always a pleasure working with you. I hope your big presentation goes well next week.""

,, When dealing with a customer or client, you want to convey your appreciation for their business.


Tell your customer or client, “We appreciate your business.” Use a sincere and warm tone. This tells the customer that you are grateful for their business.Reply, “I’m happy to help.” This tells the customer that you enjoy your job and are keen to help them. If you are serving a customer in a retail store and they “thank you” for showing them the options for a particular product, you could say, “I’m happy to help.”

Reply to thank you emails in a way that fits your personality and audience.,
Responding to a “thank you” email is considered discretionary.,
Respond to “thank you” emails when you want to continue the conversation.","How to Respond to ""Thank You""3"," There is no standard for replying to “thank you” in an email. Your response should fit the expectations of your audience and your personality.


Use email in a way that fits your personality. If you are a chatty or outgoing person, go ahead and say “you’re welcome” or “it’s my pleasure” in response to a “thank you” email or text message.Consider your audience when replying via email or text. Younger audiences might not expect a reply to an email or text saying “thank you.” Older people often have different expectations for etiquette, and may very well appreciate a reply such as “you’re welcome.”You may want to avoid emojis, smileys, and other images when responding to someone in email. These may be too informal for the situation.

, Consider your personality and your audience. If you are a chatty person in face to face conversations, it may be best to respond to a “thank you” email. However, if you are not very outgoing, you can probably get away without a response., You can write, “you’re welcome” and then move on to the next conversation topic.You may want to respond to the “thank you” email if there is also a question requiring a response in the email. In this case, you can say “you’re welcome” and then answer their question.You may want to respond to the “thank you” email if there was a specific comment in it that you wanted to address. In this case, you could say “you’re welcome” and then address the comment that you wanted to talk about to continue the conversation."
"
Focus on the present situation.,
Expand your audience.,
Excuse yourself from the conversation.,
Fake a call.",How to Change the Subject in a Conversation2," Talk about the place where you are - the decor, the landscaping, the event, the city, etc.


Get your conversation partner thinking. Ask “How many people do you think are here?”
Point out something unusual in the environment. For example, “Did you see that huge dog over there?”

, Another way to change the subject is by bringing a new person into the conversation. Either introduce your conversation partner to someone else you know, or ask your partner to introduce you to someone.


If neither of you knows anyone at an event, suggest going together to a lively group and introducing yourselves together.

, You can tell the person you’ll be right back if you’d like to keep talking to them - a few minutes apart creates a natural reason for the topic to change.


Use a common excuse. Take a trip to the restroom, or to the buffet, or to get a few minutes of fresh air. , You can ask a friend to call at a specific time with a potential “emergency.” There are also apps that can automate the process.


This can be a particularly handy technique on a first date.
You can always decide to stick with the conversation, but the interruption provides a space in which to change the topic.

"
"
Make small changes.,
Use the ‘yes, but’ method.,
Ask questions.,
Bring the conversation back an earlier topic.",How to Change the Subject in a Conversation3," You can shift the topic of conversation instead of changing it abruptly, by branching out in small steps from the subject that you are currently talking about.


Use ‘word association’ to shift from one topic to another. For example, if you have dragged on the subject of skiing or snowboarding too long, go on to talk about the weather up north, which can eventually branch to talking about the weather down south.

, You can build a bridge from one topic to another by agreeing with the speaker, and then using the word ‘but’ to change to a new topic.


For example, if you don’t want to hear any more about cars, you can say, “I love fast cars! But I’m actually really into running fast.” Other transition words/phrases include: “That reminds me of…” and “By the way…”

, Let your conversation partner help you change the topic of conversation. Listen carefully what they are saying and ask questions that steer the conversation in a different direction.


Make your questions open ended. This means they cannot be answered by a yes or no. Begin your question with the Who, What, Where, When, Why, or How to get a more detailed answer. , Maybe the conversation has just gone off on a tangent. Reintroduce an earlier topic by saying something like “I was really interested in what we were talking about earlier - can you tell me more?”

"
Set aside time for her.,
Be completely honest.,
Give her space to express herself.,
Touch her casually.,
Practice self control.",How to Stop Turning off Your Female Partner1," Establish a time to spend together without distractions. This can be a romantic date, but it can also be a movie or dinner night at home. Avoid other activities where you may see people you know. Do not invite anyone else to spend time with you during your designated time.


Turn off your phones and forbid checking email. Focus on your shared time together.;
, It’s easy to assume that all your feelings in a relationship should be about love and adoration. In order to establish trust, however, you need to express the full range of emotions. This includes negative or neutral emotions as well.


When you talk, don’t force yourself to stick to positive emotions. Letting her know that you are a complete person will create a better sense of trust and intimacy.

, You may not realize that you are talking nonstop, that you interrupt her, or that she may feel uncomfortable. If you don’t leave space in the conversation for her to talk, she won’t be able to be able to express herself, and she will feel ignored.


Sometimes silence is enough to get someone else to talk, so don’t be afraid to be quiet. Other times you will have to prompt her to express herself. Ask questions and make sure that she has time to answer.

, If you are only touching her when you are interested in sex, she may feel as though you are only interested in sex. Practice touching her casually and without sexual undertones.


Touching can be sensual and not sexual. Run your fingers through her hair, touch the small of her back, and hold her hand. You can express a lot of love non-verbally by practicing this kind of touch.

, Relationships are a give and take.

If you are overly needy and demanding, this may cut into time that you could be spending together in a more pleasant way.

Don’t ask for things and then act ungrateful. Always thank her for what she does for you.
Complaining sometimes comes off as needy. It may sound like you are trying to get her to solve your problems. Venting is okay, but don’t overload her with negativity.

Listen to the request respectfully.,
Phrase your ""no"" as simply as possible.,
Transfer ownership of your refusal to something else.,
Try to remain non-confrontational.

,
Don't feel obligated to explain.,
Explain simply, and only if you wish to do so.,
Stand firm.,
Keep in mind that it's your time they're are requesting for and you have the choice to accept or decline what they're asking of you.

",How to Say No Respectfully," Do not interrupt the speaker.;
, Don't raise your voice or become upset, simply say that you cannot help this time. When you say no, say it in a confident, well modulated voice to sound more straightforward.

, For instance, say ""I can, but my schedule is booked now. How about some other time?"" You don't have to explain further. This deflects any resentment they might have towards your schedule.

,, You have your reasons and they may not be ones you wish to discuss. If this is the case, try saying something like, ""I'm just not able to."" Leave it at that - if you must, change the subject, or say, ""I'm sorry, but I need to go.""

, If the case really is one that you feel okay explaining, make your explanation as simple as possible.

, If the requester does not want to accept your answer, tell him or her that your mind is made up and that you will not change it.

Understand the reason.,
Continue with your decision.,
Consider how this decision might affect your relationship with that person.,
Think of an excuse that sounds probable but not too far out of the realm of possibility.,
Tell the person that you won't be able to attend the function.,
Do not lie.,

Saying, ""My wife is in labor"" wouldn't work unless she is actually pregnant and is close to delivery.

, There are many ways to inform them.



Call them. If you have their number and have spoken to them through phones, then this is the right thing to do. Phone calls reduce the formality and the host might get more influenced with your emotions. Do not drag the conversation though. Try to keep the phone call short and sweet. Following is an example :






Hey Jane, how are you? I just called you to inform that I might not be able to attend the function since I have a prior commitment. I'm sorry, and I hope the function goes well.



Notify them through email. If the host is a kind of person who regularly checks their mails, then this might be suitable. With emails, you escape the awkwardness and the nervousness that you might feel while talking to them. Follow email etiquette and inform them properly.







Meet and tell. If you live near the host's house, or meet them on a daily basis, like a college classmate, tell them directly. Tell that you have your reasons and you wouldn't be able to attend. Following is an example :






Hey Noah, thanks for inviting me to the party. I hate to say this, but I won't be able to come because my mom is ill. I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused. You enjoy!



Sending a greeting card. Probably the nice and sweet way of letting them know. Buy a greeting card that suits the situation or make one yourself!


, In any case, it is not suggested to lie or just cook up an excuse. You might be caught, and that might create a dent in your relationship with the host.

, Thank them for considering you, and say that you are touched and very much happy by their thoughtfulness.

, Do not keep them in doubt by telling that you might attend it. Be direct, and tell them clearly.


Hey Hannah, I appreciate that you considered me. Very thoughtful of you!

, Tell them that you wish you were there, and that you're very happy for them.


Hey Sam, so how did the event go? Did you enjoy yourself? I'm sure you did. I wish I was there to give you company!

Figure out what makes her tick.,
Let her know that you love her.,
Forgive her.,

",How to Communicate Effectively With a Teenage Daughter," If you know what she likes and dislikes, this will give you common ground.;
, Don't be overbearing with this one. Maybe you could start small.Write a little note and stick it on her mirror. Make her cookies. Give her a ride somewhere. Come to her games or plays.

, She is young and is still figuring things out. Teach her what she did wrong if she's made a mistake, but make sure she knows you still love her. Let her know that you forgive her and understand that everybody makes mistakes.

, This is true for every single teenage girl, whether they show it on the outside or not. Just because she yells at you doesn't mean she hates you. If she does, it's probably because she has reached the end of her rope and doesn't know how to react to her situation. Let her cry if she needs to. Cry with her, but not too much. Rejoice with her. Be a strong anchor for her while her emotions are unsettled from hormones, lack of sleep, and too much going on.

, Find activities you both enjoy and spend time together.

, This is a big one. Try to see what circumstances and emotions are making her think the ways she does.

, This is huge. When a teenage daughter knows that they can go to their parent(s) with concerns, problems, and joys, it makes communication meaningful and easy.

When you meet someone new, smile while greeting and talking with her or him. It only takes a moment, can have a positive effect on others, and affects how others perceive you. , Making eye contact can deepen your connection with others. Look someone in the eye while speaking or listening.

Ask her what she wants.If she is uncomfortable telling you, ask her again.,
Be passionate, not desperate.,
Pay attention to how she likes to be kissed.,
Emphasize foreplay.,
Give feedback.Tell her how much you enjoy sex.",How to Stop Turning off Your Female Partner2," Women are often very uncomfortable asking for things during sex. Just because she feels uncomfortable does not mean that she doesn’t have preferences.


If she is really too embarrassed to talk about herself, try to find a middle ground. Maybe she can touch you a certain way when you do something right or wrong. Maybe she just needs to talk about it later, and doesn’t like talking in the moment. Whatever it is, make sure that you find a way to understand her needs and her body.

, The difference between passion and desperation can seem difficult to discern, but to your partner it will be obvious. If you seem to want her specifically, you will seem passionate. If your focus is on sex in general, you will seem desperate.


Passion is about making a woman feel wanted. Instead of talking about wanting to have sex, talk about how much your partner makes you want to have sex. Compliments are the best way to go about this. Say, “The way that shirt looks on you drives me crazy!” or, “You smell so good, I just want to eat you up!”

, Kissing is usually the gateway into other forms of intimacy. It is also a way to experiment with sexual style without as much fear of rejection.


Try starting slow, being aggressive, and using your hands on other parts of her body while you kiss. If she recoils at sudden aggression, she will also recoil from it during sex. If she melts when you build up to aggression, the same will hold true during sex.
Kiss and touch other parts of her body. This holds true at all times. No matter what part of her you are kissing, make sure that she feels connected to her entire body.

,

Oral sex and fingering, while encouraged, are not the same as foreplay. Caressing, kissing, and other forms of touch are foreplay. Explore her body before beelining for her underwear.

Flirty exchanges can also act as foreplay. Light teasing and wrestling works for some couples. Massages and romantic dates also factor in as foreplay. If you touch her during a date, you will subtly remind her of intimacy later.

, Whether or not women like their partner to be vocal during sex is a matter of personal taste. However, if you are completely stoic during and after sex, she might feel insecure.


Even if she is not insecure, she may get bored. Sex is a shared experience, and some women need to know that you are enjoying sex in order to be able to enjoy it themselves.

Brush your teeth.This seems obvious, but it is easy to forget.,
Wash your clothes.,
Shower often.Clean hair and skin are signs of health for new partners.",How to Stop Turning off Your Female Partner3," Brush your teeth twice a day. Furry or yellowing teeth are a turnoff, and bad breath is even worse.


Flossing is important. Remember, you can’t brush between your teeth! Floss at least once a day.
You can also get breath mints or mouthwash for the middle of the day.

, Even if you are wearing clean clothes, piles of dirty clothes in your bedroom will create a musty smell. You should wash your clothes and sheets once a week.


Outerwear absorbs sweat as well. Jackets and sweaters also need to be washed.

, If you are trying to be intimate at the end of the day, you may have gotten used to the smell of your sweat and grime while you were out and about. Make sure to bathe before instigating any intimate contact.


Do not overdo aftershave or perfume. Some women like the smell of perfume and cologne, but all women react to the natural scent of a body.

Talk about subjects others can relate to.,
Ask questions.,
Be an active listener.,
Be genuine.",How to Click With Anybody You Meet2," Finding commonalities is an important part of clicking with others. Begin connecting with new people by talking about something others can relate to.Ask your co-worker about a common aspect of your work. You could say, “Ann, I really enjoyed reading your last report. Do you have any tips on the final editing process?”
If you find yourself with new friends at a football game, try saying, “Our team is really talented this year. Do you think we’ll make it to the championship?”
Connect with your new classmates by talking about the coursework or readings. For example, you can ask, “What did you think about the book we read this week?”

, Sometimes people are hesitant to open up, and asking questions opens up the door for connecting. Ask open questions that will help you learn about the other person, rather than closed questions that can be answered with a yes, no, or short response.Try asking, “Why did you choose to become a teacher?” instead of “Do you like being a teacher?”
You could ask, “Why do you want to study abroad in Spain” instead of “Are you excited about studying in another country?”

, Listening to others helps us obtain information, understand, and learn.Pay careful attention to what the other person is saying without becoming distracted by what’s going on around you.
Don’t think about what you will say next while the other person is speaking.
Show that you’re listening with a nod.
Provide feedback by asking questions to clarify specific points the other person brought up.

, Be authentic and take a genuine interest the people you are trying to connect with. People will sense if you are not authentic in your interactions. If you’re not genuinely interested in who a person is or the type of work they do, don’t pursue the connection."

Exchange contact information.,
Follow up.,
Spend time together.,
Stay in touch.",How to Click With Anybody You Meet3," When you click with someone new, it’s important to have a means of connecting again whether it is through email, social media, phone, or in person. Before leaving, be sure to exchange contact information.


Try saying, “It was really great meeting you, Roy. I’d love to connect again in the future. What’s the best way to get in touch?”

, It’s important to follow up with people you meet, whether they are potential new friends or professional contacts. If you click with a new person, a call, email, or text is a great way to follow up.Send a short email to the person you met at a professional networking event. For example, you could write, “Thank you for taking the time to talk with me about your work. I’d love to hear more about it next time you’re in New York for business.”
Send brief message on social media to a new friend. Try writing, “It was great to meet at the baseball game. Hopefully I’ll see you at the next one.”

, After you follow up and receive a response from your new connection, schedule some time to spend together. This could be as simple as having coffee with a new work colleague, or asking your soccer teammate if she’d like to carpool to next week’s game. Put it on your calendar and prioritize strengthening the relationship by spending time together., It’s important to keep up with connections even when you’re not spending time together. Don’t overdo it. Use their responsiveness as a guide for how frequently they like to stay in touch.Email a professional contact and ask, “How is your work on the new project going?”
Text your new friend and ask, “How did your Spanish exam go?”

Solicit feedback.Don’t get feedback from any random audience member.,
Work on your timing.,
Be confident in your delivery.,
Keep your story focused.A good story will revolve around a single well-defined idea, topic, or theme.When developing and practicing your story, ask yourself, “What is this story about?” If you cannot answer concisely in a sentence or two, revise the content of your story to keep it more tightly focused.,
Use body language to engage your audience.,

Consider becoming a musician or adding music to your story.,
Become a religious officiant.",How to Become a Professional Storyteller," Often, the beginning of a professional storytelling career involves many free performances at public events. By volunteering at a local library, community day care, cafe, charity, or other venue, an amateur storyteller can gain the experience needed to perfect their craft and transition into becoming a professional storyteller.As the old saying goes, “Practice makes perfect.”;
, If you don’t have many events or storytelling venues near you, take the initiative and found your own. Propose the idea to start a public storytelling hour to your local library or coffee shop. Give your story event a theme. For instance, you might open the event up for proposals pertaining to specific themes like romance, adventures on the sea, or troubles with technology.Don’t make your theme too specific. For instance, a theme like “my first date” might get a lot of similar stories and be boring for the audience.
Set a time limit so you don’t get stories that are too long and rambling. Ten minutes is usually a good limit for the average story.
Alternately, you could just get your closest friends together in your living room on a Friday or Saturday night and swap stories in a semi-structured way. You could select a specific theme, or you could just provide an open forum for sharing stories.
StoryCorps is a podcast which attempts “to preserve and share humanity’s stories in order to build connections between people and create a more just and compassionate world.”For the hefty sum of $3,500 per day, you can host a StoryCorps event in your community. (You might consider soliciting public funding or private fundraising to help with the fee.) Interviews can last forty minutes and are added to the Library of Congress archives. They are also available online., A podcast is a streaming or downloadable audio interview. Podcasts are a great format for telling your own story or those of others. With some editing, you can incorporate music into your podcast too. Your podcast can be narrow (stories in the history of astronomy) or broad (stories from around the world) in focus.


Podcasts can be hard to produce. Get help from a trained sound engineer to record and produce your podcast.
As you build your audience, seek local businesses for financial support. Offer them advertising space on your podcast.While you can easily do a simple podcast on your home computer with your built-in microphone and recording software, a good podcast will need to invest in high-quality technology.If conducting interviews over Skype, Pamela is a great program for PC users. A similar program, Ecamm Call Recorder, is available for Mac users. Adobe Audition is a useful program for editing purposes.

, Storyteller groups host festivals all over the country. Whether you attend festivals or conferences as a participant or as a member of the audience, take advantage of the opportunity to hear other storytellers to hone your own craft and inspire you to find new stories of your own. Conferences are great opportunities to perform or engage in professional development.


The largest festival -- the National Storytelling Festival -- takes place each year in Tennessee.Check the National Storytelling Network’s calendar at http://www.storynet.org/events/calendar.php to search for storytelling events in your area.

, Read both fiction and nonfiction in a conscious way, thinking about what made a given story memorable. Memoirs are especially useful for helping you think about how to frame your personal experience and regurgitate it as a great story. Read storytelling guides to improve your delivery, learn how to pace your story, and understand what makes a story great.While you might intuitively understand some or all of these storytelling elements already, explicitly recognizing how these elements work in conversation with each other will hone your storytelling skills
You probably have lots of questions and issues about becoming a professional storyteller that someone else has already dealt with. Learn from their experiences, avoid their pitfalls, and adopt their paths to success.

, Get feedback from people who are professional orators, actors, writers, and storytellers. Ask them what worked and what didn’t. Make improvements if their criticisms are well-founded and continuously review your own storytelling style and material to become the best storyteller you can be.


Beyond some simple feedback and nurturing, consider getting real coaching from another storyteller. A storyteller coach will tailor their advice to your specific needs and presentation and give concrete steps to help you build your business., Pause for laughter when something is funny. If you say something that is meant to be funny but falls flat, move on.Use pauses between sentences to give your story a natural, conversational rhythm. Do not speak too fast or you will lose the audience. Remember, storytelling is not a race. Pause before revealing a surprise or a shocking conclusion.

If you plan on telling a story and you know you’re limited to a certain amount of time, ensure your story is the right length. Do not try to jam a 15 minute story into 8 minutes.
Use repetition of a certain action or event to set up a pattern that will later be broken, or drive home feelings of drudgery or disappointment. For instance, if your story is about a person’s boring life, don’t just say that they walk home “alone, every single day.” Say instead that “They walked home. Alone. Every. Single. Day.” This emphasizes the monotonous, lonely nature of their life.
Speak rapidly -- but not so fast that the audience can’t understand you -- to describe or depict a sudden, jarring event or action.
Work on your timing not only within each story, but between stories as well. If you intend to deliver multiple stories to a class or group of people, follow a longer story with a shorter one, and vice versa. This will give your listeners a chance to mentally rest and reset their attention.

, Enunciate clearly and project your voice so that everyone in attendance can hear you. Your delivery should be energetic and memorable.Do not use filler words like “uh,” “anyways,” “you know,” and so on. Keep your head up and eyes forward. It helps to focus your eyes not on any particular member of the audience, but on a point just over the heads of the audience and towards the back of the venue in which you’re telling your story.


Be authentic when telling your story. Even if the story you tell is fictional, show enthusiasm for the characters and events.
Don’t be afraid to use unique voices for certain characters.For instance, if your story features a fierce monster, make your voice harsh and scary when reciting the monster’s dialogue. If your character(s) are afraid, speak in (audible) whispers, as they would. Getting into character can bring the story to life.

,


Your audience should also be able to summarize the main theme or events of the story in a succinct way. If other people who read or hear your story get confused in the telling, you may need to edit the story.
For instance, if you rehearse your story in front of a test audience of friends or family and they all have competing and contradictory ideas about what the story is about, you might want to revise the way you tell your story.
Examine each part of your story and ask yourself if it adds to the narrative flow. The events of your story should be clear and connect with one another in a logical way.
Listen to the advice of others when developing your story. It is important to understand how other people receive and understand your story if it is to be effective and memorable. Soliciting feedback from other writers is especially useful.

, Sharing a story well requires a total physical and mental commitment on the part of the storyteller.The amount of physicality you include in your storytelling varies with the content and style of the story. Incorporating physical movement into your storytelling enhances the experience.


For instance, if you’re telling a story about a big bird, you might say, “Then the bird swooped down from its nest.” While saying this, you might raise your hand high above your head and bend it at the wrist in a ninety degree angle. You could then move the hand across and down your body at a forty-five degree angle and elongate the long “O” sound in “swooped.” This would add an exciting physical dimension to the story and help the audience visualize what it was like to see the bird swooping down from its perch.
Don’t over-perform your story. A storyteller is not an actor.Always keep your body language appropriate and relevant to the tone and style of the story.

, Work part-time as a storyteller and keep your full-time job until you’re well-established. Set some benchmarks to help you decide when you should make the move from part-time to full-time storytelling.


For example, you might decide that if you make $1,500 each month from your storytelling, you can become a full-time storyteller.
A supportive spouse or partner who contributes to the household income can make it easier for you to take the necessary risk which becoming a full-time storyteller entails.
Keep enough money in the bank to carry you through lean times. Maintain at least six months’ worth of funds.

, Start by building a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, and the like. As you get more experience and start to develop your business, contract a web designer for your own web domain. Having your own website is important because it gives you total control over the style and presentation of your own work in a way that social media sites do not.


Upload audio and/or video of your stories in part or in whole
Provide a bio of yourself, including how you got started as a storyteller and what drew you to it. Make your own life a story!
Be sure to include contact info for people who want you to deliver some stories to their event or party.
Get listed in online directories.The Storyteller.net directory is a good place to start.List your available services on local marketing sites like Craigslist to get your name out, too.

, Open a business account, register your business with your local and state authorities, and maintain accurate tax and financial information. Like any other home business, professional storytelling requires a keen eye for finances. Take some accounting classes or enlist the services of a skilled accountant to ensure your home-based business conforms to the letter of the law. Your business will probably be registered as a sole proprietorship, a business which is owned and operated by a single person.

, Being professional means comporting yourself with grace and dignity, and demanding respect from your audience and hosts. For a professional storytelling session, always plan ahead. Find out where the venue you’ll be performing is, where you can park, and how many people will be in attendance. If possible, scout out the location before attending. Ask important questions like if you will be provided a microphone, bottled water, or other amenities.If you are performing in a large hall in which sound does not easily carry, suggest -- or insist -- that your hosts provide a microphone for your performance. Remember, your reputation will suffer whether a bad storytelling performance is or isn’t your fault.
Similarly, don’t be afraid to ask that a teacher, parent, or other adult stay in the library or classroom with you if you’re delivering a story to children.
Always aim to defy your clients' expectations and leave them wanting more., The National Storytelling Network is the country’s largest storytelling organization. There are many other local and national storytelling organizations, some with specialties like African or Native American heritage stories, others with stories about history, nature, or another topic of special interest.Depending on the club or organization your join, you will gain access to any number of neat perks. Becoming a member of the National Storytelling Network, for instance, will allow you to apply for NSN grants, access online discussion groups, and attend the National Storytelling Conference.Check http://www.storynet.org/resources/organizations.html for a list of organizations by state.

, Many professional storytellers get more successful in their business when they identify a particular audience for their tales. Ask yourself what kind of stories you like to tell and who they would most appeal to. For instance, if you love metaphorical fables about anthropomorphic animals, or tall tales about fantastic happenings, you might be best suited to storytelling for a youth audience.

, Many professional storytellers reach out to the primary consumers of stories: Many professionals will admit that opportunities for children's entertainment far outnumber gigs for storytelling to adults. Being open to a young audience will help storytellers build a career.


Librarians often pull double duty as both librarian and storyteller.If you have a passion for telling stories, you might be able to introduce a storytelling program to your library.

, Comedians have a knack for timing and know how to make people laugh with their stories. If that sounds like you, start out by doing open-mic nights and hone your jokes. When you feel comfortable, move on to booking professional gigs at bars and nightclubs.

, Almost nothing can compare with the ability of film to inspire, excite, and convince us to suspend our disbelief. Becoming a filmmaker usually requires at least a four-year degree in film. You can make as many kinds of films as there are kinds of stories: westerns, sci-fi movies, romantic comedies, thrillers, documentaries, and dramas.


Consult with the film’s writer to talk about their vision for the script and characters. How do they see various lines of dialogue being delivered? How do they imagine the characters moving and the sets looking? Since films almost always begin as a screenplay, use that as your bible and integrate the writer’s vision into your filmmaking process.
Make shorter films first to get a feel for how the medium works. Most phones have a video function and can be a great first camera for a young amateur filmmaker.
Get a production internship with a film studio to learn how the industry works. Continue developing your filmmaking abilities with new projects and developing new contacts with actors, producers, and studio executives.

, Singer-songwriters set stories to music and can use the rhythm and volume of their music to add gravitas to their storytelling process. Whether you rock out with a whole band behind you or simply strap on an acoustic guitar, music can be an effective storytelling medium.


Another community of professional storytellers includes those who tell their stories with a guitar, drums, or other musical instrument.Including music in the narrative can get both children and adults involved in clapping or singing along to your story. Musical storytelling can also constitute an important educational tool by providing new linguistic structures to young children.
Think about adopting a spoken-word storytelling style. While spoken-word storytelling requires no musical instruments, it does require a sense of timing, rhythm, and (often, though not always) rhyme. Look for opportunities to perform at open-mic nights in your local coffee shops and bookstores.

, If you are a religious individual, you might feel called to put your storytelling skills to use in the service to your higher power. Priests, imams, and rabbis don’t just recite ancient passages from their holy books. They must prepare innovative sermons and stories for their congregations. Storytelling is integral to keeping their attendees engaged the religious service."

Start low.,
Negotiate the terms.,
Follow through with your end of the deal.",How to Bribe Someone," Bribery can be useful, but can backfire on you if you're not careful. For example, a mom bribing her kids to finish their vegetables might find herself having to offer a new incentive every night! Alternately, a kid bribing parents to attend a party might come off as manipulative instead of open to compromise. Before deciding to bribe someone, answer the following questions honestly:


Do I really need the thing I'm asking for? Can I handle the situation myself or just go without?
Can I afford to offer something in return?
Will this bribe change people's opinion of me?
Will that make my life harder down the road?
Will the bribe become an expected part of our relationship?;
, If you’re going to bribe someone, you want to make sure that you get exactly what you want. You need to be as specific as possible when explaining what you need in return for your gift or favor.


There's a better chance the person will agree to a specific action, rather than a vague objective.
For example, ""helping me move"" could be a three-hour time investment or a week-long investment. Give specific hours and a clear description of what you’re asking the person to do: “I need to borrow your truck Friday and Saturday, from 5-9 p.m., and need your help moving large furniture at that time.”
Be as specific as possible about what you need, so the person you're bribing won't want to say ""no"" off the bat.

, When it comes to bribing, picking the right person to bribe is the name of the game. Start by asking yourself who among your contacts has access to what you need to gain your desired result. You may want to make an actual list while going through phone or Facebook contacts.


In our moving example, you want to skip anyone you know is lazy or too weak to lift heavy furniture for you.
People who are organized efficient, strong and active, and who own trucks will be most useful to you.

, First, cross people off the list based on their availability. Think about which people will be legitimately unable help (instead of just not wanting to help). Cross anyone who's out of town, at work, unwell, or otherwise out of action off the list. Also ask yourself who would be most receptive to a bribe. People who might otherwise be too lazy to help you move might perk up if you offer a free round of golf, a weekend of babysitting, or something else they value highly.

, Successfully bribing someone is about finding the right price. A bribe doesn't always have to be about money! You can offer favors in return, goods, services, or anything else you think someone might want. In fact, many people find accepting money vulgar, and you may have more luck by offering a gift than cash.Think about what each person on your list would value most, and personalize your bribes.


For help moving, you might offer to cover gas costs, then sweeten the pot with dinner and drinks once the move is complete.
Open-ended IOUs (""I owe you"") can be an effective bribe. Be ready to return the favor when called on, though.
The fewer people who can supply what you want, the more expensive the bribe needs to be. For example, plenty of people can help you move — you can get by offering pizza and beer. But if you're bribing a friend to quit smoking, only one person can provide that favor. You'll need a heftier bribe., Think of your decision in terms of ""return on investment."" The people you bribe should be the ones who will offer you the most in return for the gifts that cost you least.

, When approaching the person you're bribing, there are many ways to frame the bribe in different terms.

You might call it a negotiation: ""Mom, I'll do extra chores for a whole month if you let me go to this concert.""
Frame it as a compromise: ""If you waive the late fees on my account, I will sign a new 2-year contract with your company. That way, we both win.""
Frame it as a fee: ""If you help me move, I'll pay you for your labor and gas.""

, Once you know who to approach and how to bribe them, approach the person you're bribing as far in advance as possible. A number of small gifts over time can prime a person to provide a service in the future without you ever even framing the service as a bribe.They might just want to help you because you've been so nice to them in the past.


Sometimes, you need favors quickly. In that case, ease into the topic slowly. Talk about how difficult the situation is for you and how much you need help before asking for the favor.
Especially when talking to someone you don't know well, you want the person to feel bad for you before you ask for their help.

, As with any good negotiation, the person you plan to bribe likely won't respond to your first offer. Treat it like an auction or negotiation. Start with a low bid with the expectation that the amount will probably rise.


Judge the starting point for negotiation based on your knowledge of the person. If you start too low, the person might get offended that you thought you could bribe them so cheaply.
If you start too high, then you might reach the limit of what you can offer before the person feels he's been offered a good deal., Will the gift be given ahead of time? When the favor has been given? Sometime in the future? Make sure the terms of your agreement are clear ahead of time to prevent hard feelings down the line.


Many people may only agree to a bribe if the they're ""paid"" upfront. ""We'll go out for drinks on me as soon as we're finished moving my furniture.""
In some situations, the bribe might be drawn out over time, such as with the example of bribing a friend to stop smoking. In this case, you can offer the bribe in smaller chunks based on progress. ""Every week you go without smoking, I'll take you out for a nice dinner on the weekend."", If you don’t follow through with the gift you offered, you're lying to and taking advantage of people. He or she will remember this and likely never help you again regardless of any of the circumstances. You might also get a reputation for taking advantage of people, making your other friends less likely to help you in the future.

Strike up a conversation with a simple, “Hello, how are you?” Depending on the response, you will know if the person is comfortable talking with you.,
Use conversations to determine compatibility.,
Be open to answering questions.,
Be an active listener.,
Ask for a second date.,
Consider age differences when conversing with someone.,
Focus on networking for personal and business growth.,
Find common threads that link you to the person or people in the crowd.,
End a conversation gracefully.",How to Carry on a Conversation1," If he wants to have a conversation, ask him questions that are basic to begin with such as, “Where are you travelling to today? How long are you staying?”


If the conversation continues, you can ask more personal questions. As she shares more personal information, you can as well. This will increase the quality of the interaction.
Ask questions such as, “What was it like growing up in southern California? Did you spend a lot of time at the beach or playing sports?”
If you sense that he is tiring of the conversation simply say, “Well, it’s been great talking with you. I’ll let you get back to what you were doing.” You can tell if someone is tiring if they keep looking away, checking their watch, or just seem generally distracted or rushed.;
, Conversations that occur on a date carry a bit more pressure than most conversations. The only way you will get to know someone is to have conversations about subjects including shared interests, values, ideals and education level.You want to find someone who is compatible with you and conversation will lead you there.

, Open conversations require you to be vulnerable. Keep your eye on the benefits involved in getting to know someone. This might help you remain open. You may want to date the person, do business with them, or ask them to be your mentor.


Thank the person for being open and answering your questions.
Start with simple questions and move toward deeper questions. You will definitely want to ask about where the person attended school before you ask about his relationship with his father.
If you sense the person’s discomfort with certain subject matter, don’t continue in that direction. Choose a different topic. Signs that someone is uncomfortable may include: looking down, fidgeting, looking pale, clenched jaw or forced smile.

, Let the person know that you are listening by repeating back what they say in a different way, or at another point in the conversation. People like to be listened to and more importantly understood.


For example, when someone is talking, keep your eyes focused on them and occasionally nod to show that you're engaged. Wait until they are done talking to make a comment like, ""wow"" or ""yeah, I see what you mean."" Perhaps ask a follow up question that directly relates to what they were saying.

, If you're on a date and the conversation flowed say, “I think things went well tonight, do you? I would like to do this again.” If they give a positive response, set a second date or at minimum tell her when you will call or text. Make sure you follow through on your stated intention.

, Everyone, regardless of age is happier when their lives are filled with deep and meaningful conversations.However, it helps to be aware of a person's age when conversing with them.


Do not intimidate or invade a child’s personal space during a conversation.Ask simple questions and allow the child to respond. Children usually resist the harder questions that may have more social significance. If she doesn’t want to talk with you, then allow her to refrain.
Speak in normal volume levels when talking with an elderly person, unless the person asks you to speak louder. Don’t assume every old person is hard of hearing. Saying, “Hello, how are you doing today?” will start any conversation. Learn as much as you can from older people. They have learned a lot in life and are likely to be happy to share it with you.Not every older person likes to be called sweetie or honey.
Be kind and understand that you may be the only one the person talks to during any given day. A happy life includes meaningful conversation.

, You might be at a local meeting or at a national gathering of people you don’t know. Conversations are essential if you want to do business with someone, or someone is seeking you out.


Break the ice with compliments such as, “That is a great tie,” or “Your watch is amazing,” or “Those shoes are spectacular.”
Manage humor with caution. Everyone has a different sense of humor.
Secure contact information to expand your mailing list.

, Humans have an innate tendency to find a way to relate to one another. Comfort is gained when you don't feel alone in a crowd. Conversation will lead you to find connections to explore.


If you are at a wedding and sitting at a table with people you don’t know, you have options. You can sit there quietly eating your meal, or you can spark up a conversation to pass the time. Some people have actually met their future spouses at weddings. That wouldn’t happen without conversation.
Ask the person or people around you how they know the bride or groom.
Stick to safe subjects and avoid politics, religion and sexual content.You want to keep the discord to a minimum at least until they cut the cake.
Talk about the food being served, and hope that it is good.
If the conversation becomes bogged down, excuse yourself to use the restroom or go to another table where you might know someone. Weddings are usually held in beautiful places. Take advantage and find a beautiful place to take it all in. Perhaps the bar will be your destination.

, There might be times when you would like to end a conversation during a date, at the end of a meeting, or when you are exhausted.You have every right to end a conversation if you want or need to. Be kind and say, “I’m so happy you took the time to meet with me today. I think I’m going to get going.” A graceful exit is your goal.

Have you recently reflected on this weird situation?,
The first thing to do is: try to make eye contact,even if only for a fraction of a second.,
A safe way to open a conversation is asking a general question that is directly related to the environment where you are, or making a neutral statement and end by asking the other person’s opinion: Hi, what’s up?,
Asking somebody for advice or help is another great way for opening a conversation: Excuse me; What do you think of this t shirt, should I buy it?,
You shouldn't really think that your words must be the start of a flirtation.,
Here are some examples of good follow-up lines which will help you to keep the conversation going: May I join you?,
Some communication specialists qualify the following follow-up lines as bad: So, what do you do for work?,
At all times, though : what matters most is how she responds.,
It may be a good idea to stick for a while to the opening subject: It’s non threatening, less conspicuous and therefore raising less resistance It’s always a good idea to listen actively to what other people have to say; Allows for a strategical retreat: nothing has happened yet.,
Only after you are convinced that you’re in, can you use one of these “pick-up lines” that are often mistakenly advertised as first-contact starters.,
Because you want to build a conversation, it is good to end answers with a question: I think, … and you?,
An other interesting kind of questions to get the ball rolling are: probing questions: Interesting - Specifically what kind of … do you mean?,
Or reflective questions, which echo the statement the other just made.,
Every now and then you should may also first summarize what the other just said, to show that you are interested, and then guide the conversation with a new question: ""I see … is important to you, what else is high on your list of priorities?,
Overall, it is very important to balance the conversation.,
When you meet new people, always try to keep the questions simple, fun and light-hearted.,
Remember: People are usually very quick to form an impression about somebody they meet.,
A first date is supposed to be lighthearted.,
Here are some practical questions for finding out about your date: What is your dream job?,
A special kind of questions are these in which you offer a multiple choice: You're cooking dinner for a friend and you accidentally burn the main course.,
Good questions to help you discover how how (s)he looks at Relationships: Tell me a little bit about your family.,
The following questions help you to find out more about her hobbies and interests: What kind of music do you like?,
Fun Questions (which may run deeper than one might think at a first glance): What three things would you take with you to a desert island?",How to Build an Enticing Conversation,": to know there is no such thing as a ""best pickup line a man can use” and yet thinking to yourself how to start up a conversation with that gorgeous girl that you are watching. You know you have to be enthusiast, friendly, interested, sufficiently good looking, assertive, fun and smart… Men tend to focus on the verbal skills or tricks that will allow them to make contact. However, statistics teach that the initial – and often definitive - impression is based in the first place on appearance and body language(55%). What you say accounts only for 7% of the impact you make. How you say it, for 38%. So, What does define a successful intro? - Or, in other words: How to make a good impression? How to make her feel good and happy? How to make her talk back to you when you say something? How to find the subjects she is interested in?;
, If, after the first contact, your target does not look back to you, you know that the battle may be lost even before it’s begun. But let’s assume she did look back. So, you decide to make your move. The first thing they will teach you is that the words you say are really quite unimportant and that there is no point in striving to be witty or amusing from the start. The best opening lines are, quite simply, those that can easily be recognized as openers. You may get inspiration from the actual environment, the time of the day, etc… It is a good idea to have more than one opening line in your sleeve. You may need the second to restart the conversation if the first one does not trigger the conversation.

, Hi, lovely day, isn't it? Hi, how do you like the weather today? Bit crowded here, isn't it? Not much lively here tonight, eh? Hi, how do you like the band? Are you also waiting for the bus to … Looks like the train is going to be late again. Nice music, isn't it? Shopping time again? Sigh … I shall be glad when this week is over! And you? --- You can smooth the approach with a neutral pre-opening: Sorry, do you have a light for my cigarette? Sorry, can you tell me what time it is? - A simple “yes” or “no” need not be a bad sign, but the longer and more personal the answer, the easier it will be to continue the conversation and the better your chances are. The best answer you can expect is personal, informative and ending with a question.

, I'm not very good at the whole fashion thing I’m sorry, I'm new in town and can't find my way around; Could I have directions to the best ...?"" Do you know at what time is the next bus to … Long time no see!

, Nope: all they need to convey is your interest and your desire to start a conversation. In this way you save everybody the risk of causing offense and the humiliation of a direct rejection in case the chemistry just isn't there. At the start her body-language will teach you more about your chances of success than the actual reply: is she nodding, smiling, leaning forward, taking on an open posture, … ? Distinct advantages for you are: Being a good listener; Finding ways to compliment in a pleasing way; Confirming her in how and what she is; Giving positive, emphatic feedback; Teasing her; Showing some sense of humour, making her smile.

,; That’s a nice jacket you are wearing; That color really suits you; You look lovely; I love the way you smile; You have beautiful hair; You have fantastic legs; I love the way you dance / move; I’d like to buy you a drink; I hear you know a lot about this subject, are you studying ...?; How is it that you know so much about.

, (too serious); What’s your sign? (cliché); Excuse me, but I think you just dropped something (showing pen, …) (boring); Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again? (stupid); Are you seeing somebody? / Are you married? (too serious).

, If she says “thank you, sir”s and turns away, then she’s definitely not interested. But if she thanks you, smiles and gets funny, you’re in.

, You can learn a lot from her reactions, without having to reveal much of yourself.

, Make sure though to pick a line that is suitable and to say it in an amused and amusing way! Can I borrow a quarter? I want to call my mom and tell her I just met the girl of my dreams. Are you religious? Because you look like the answer to my prayers. Can you give me directions…to your heart? Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? Did they just take you out of the oven? Because you’re hot! Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again? Do you have a map? I just got lost in your eyes. Do you know why the sky is so gray? All the blue is in your eyes. Do your legs hurt from running through my dreams all night? Don’t stop! I don’t usually get to see beauty in motion. However, you should never use them as opening lines. Why not? Simple because they require that a positive, playful mood is already present.

, How about you? Are you also going? ---- coming? How do you do this? Where did you find it? What do you think of? Open questions make it easy for the other to take their part in the conversation: These are questions which begin with : who, what, where, why, when or how. Open questions cannot be dealt with by simply answering yes or no.

, Great – Can you tell a little bit more about it? What exactly do you mean by that? That’s interesting - Can you go into some more detail on that? I see – And what is your personal opinion about …?

, She: “No, thank you, but there is no time for that now.” You: No time?

,""; ""I totally agree that …., what else do you have on your mind?""; ""I understand that ……, what else is important to you?"" Just remember: If you fail to prepare, You are preparing to fail!

, When your intention is to build a real, interactive, conversation, to which both parties contribute, you should not be afraid to do more than your part at the start. Yet, it’s equally important to avoid that the conversation turns into a personal interrogation. What you have to do is to ask the right questions, knowing things will then almost always flow nicely.

, The intention is to have a good conversation and get to know the person beyond what they do for a living. The best way to make somebody tell about his/her life, is to ask questions which will encourage them to talk about themselves in “an unusual, quirky way”. The best way therefore to approach a conversation is to forget about flirting and seducing, but to see it as an opportunity to communicate, learn, exercise and practice. If you find out that your conversation-partner is interested in playing card games, and you are not, then why not say - 'Interesting - tell me, what makes playing card games so interesting or exciting for you, as I don't get it'. The purpose is not to argue the benefits of playing card games, but to have a passionate discussion about a subject that is of special interest to them.

, For instance: about a third of the speed dates are actually over within the first 30 seconds. In fact, 45 % of women and 22 % of men come to a decision within 30 seconds. If you get a good conversation going, you might check for an opportunity to continue the conversation elsewhere or at another time: I’d love to talk a bit more with you about this subject, but my train is due any minute now. Can we meet again to continue this conversation? This is real fun, but I wonder if you are free to continue this conversation. Do you have to go somewhere right now? Would you like telling me a bit more about … over a warm cup of coffee?

, It is not about facts, it is not supposed to be an interrogation. It's way too early to decide about a long term relationship. It should just be about enjoying each other's company.

, Where are you from (originally)? What is the one thing about yourself that you would like me to know? What are you most proud about? What do you consider your best attributes?

Look at the speaker.,
Show that you're listening.,
""Listen"" to body language.A great deal of communication happens through body position and movement.,
Avoid distractions.,
Don't interrupt.,
Summarize and paraphrase.,
Ask questions.,
Use tact.,
Respond appropriately.",How to Become a Better Listener," There's nothing that more quickly signals ""I'm not paying attention"" than staring over someone's head. Make eye contact to illustrate your respect and attention.


Some people feel uncomfortable making ""too much eye contact."" Looking somewhere nearby, like between the eyes or at the nose is a good way to train yourself to make eye contact.;
, Nod frequently to encourage the speaker. Smile. Small words like ""yes"" and ""right"" will show that you're engaged in the conversation, that you're listening, and that you wish for the speaker to continue.

, Pay attention to the signals the person gives you. Car accidents are no joke, but if a story about a recent fender-bender is being told with bright eyes, grins, and wild gestures, it's a good indication that the story is supposed to be funny.


Also pay attention to your own body language as a listener. If you're grinning during a sad story, or if you're slouched with your arms crossed, it communicates that you're unattached from the conversation and focused on yourself. Sit up, lean forward, and make eye contact.

, Whether it's a side conversation, your phone, or the cute barista, splitting your attention between the speaker and something else will signal that you're uninterested.


Too often, instead of listening, we like to wait for our turn to speak. Anticipating what the other person is going to say or preparing a rebuttal before they're finished speaking means that you're not actually having a conversation, you're waiting for your turn. Wait to formulate a response until it's appropriate to make one.
Multitasking while you are on the phone seems efficient and harmless if the person can't see you, but distracting yourself with other things

, Even if someone is saying something you disagree with wildly, keep it civil. Wait for an opportune and tactful moment to voice your disagreement. Listening actively to your uncle's tirade against a politician you support at Thanksgiving will only provide you with the ammunition to thoroughly dismantle it later.

, One of the best ways to signal that you're listening is to periodically repeat what you've been told. Starting sentences with ""It sounds like what you're saying is..."" or ""What I'm hearing is..."" will encourage the speaker and it will prove that you've listened to what they've said. This also gives them an opportunity to clarify anything you've misunderstood or transition into your response.

, Another great way to listen actively is to ask open and leading questions, or ask for clarification about something you're confused about. If you're asking questions, it means that you're interested in the responses, making the speaker feel comfortable and ""listened to.""


Try to ask questions with complicated answers: ""What did you major in?"" is less interesting than ""What was college like for you?""
If a person's story starts fizzling out, ask for specific details. Asking ""What are the people like in Paris?"" or ""Does your uncle enjoy hunting squid?"" will rekindle the story, giving the speaker a new avenue to explore.

, When it comes time for you to contribute to the conversation, put yourself in the speaker's shoes. Assert your opinion on the matter respectfully, being candid, open, and honest.


Parroting what the speaker says or saying what you think they want to hear is a quick way to condescend, while ignoring their feelings entirely is rude. Neither displays good listening.
The latin root of ""tact"" means ""touch,"" which is helpful to keep in mind when you respond. A conversation is a kind of intimacy. Someone has trusted you enough to tell you something and is willing to hear out your response, so be kind.

, If a group conversation revolves around funny lunchroom stories from elementary school, it won't signal good listening if you suddenly shift subjects and talk about how excited you are to study abroad or the whaling story you just heard on NPR.


You don't have to speak. It's ok if you don't have much to contribute to a particular topic of conversation, but changing subjects just so you can contribute is self-centered and rude. Encourage the speaker and see what you can learn.

, This will lessen your anxiety and calm you.Pick something you like to do and focus your attention on getting a good work out. You will feel clear-headed as you approach the conversation.


Being responsive in your actions and communications with the person you have feelings for are keys to a good relationship., Most people are busy so setting a time for the conversation is helpful to everyone. There are times when you won’t be able to set something up. Instead, you might need to pick an opportune time right on the spot. If you are prepared, then you will be able to respond when needed.

, The lead-up to an important conversation can be filled with nervous energy. Find a way to manage your nerves. Take deep breaths, close your eyes and tell yourself, “I can do this. This is important to me and I need to do this.""

, Sometimes we need a little push to get things going. You push yourself because the matter is important and you are willing to take the risk. The potential for a great outcome is directly tied to you taking action. It won't happen unless you do it.


Once you are with the person, take a deep breath and tell yourself, “1-2-3 go,” then say what you need to say. to the person, “Hey, I want to tell you something that is really exciting for me. I hope you feel the same. I’ve really enjoyed the time we’ve spent together and I would love to spend more quality time with you. How are you feeling about this?” These words will provide a great starting point. Let his answer guide the way.
Prepare yourself for the possibility that he may not feel the same about you. Leading off the conversation with a certain amount of ambiguity, will allow you the safety and freedom to discontinue or redirect further conversation.

, Open-ended questions are preferred, but you can ask closed-ended, yes or no questions too. An open-ended question is framed to elicit a detailed response. If you have prepared yourself for the conversation, then you won’t have a shortage of things to ask.


An example of an open-ended question is, “Tell me a little bit about growing up in Arizona.” A question like this might steer you toward family details, education, and other interesting subjects.”
An example of a closed-end question is, “Did you find a good place to park?” Even though this elicits a yes or no response, it may lead to a detailed conversation about the parking situation in the neighborhood, which could lead to other topics.
A meaningful conversation will include both types, so don’t let the pressure to be perfect cause the conversation to wither and end.

, Looking at someone while they talk shows the person you respect her. If your eyes wander to other body parts, or to other people walking by the person will notice and either be upset or lose interest in talking with you. If the person is looking at you when you are talking, you must return the favor.


There are different cultures that believe averting your eyes away from someone is a sign of respect. You are responsible to determine ahead of time if cultural differences will impact your conversation.

, Mobile phones left in your immediate surroundings will cause unwanted distraction. Distractions from mobile phones pull your attention away from the person and the conversation. Determine if the conversation requires a heightened level of your attention. The more serious the subject matter, the higher the need is to remove the possibility of distractions.

, Once the person is done you can ask a new question, or ask a question to clarify or reflect and emotion back to the person. When a person knows you are listening and they are being heard, the interaction becomes more comfortable. As conversations become more comfortable, you can ask deeper more intimate questions.

, It is difficult to tell someone bad news whether you have to fire someone, tell someone a loved one passed away, or you are breaking up with someone. It is perfectly normal to get nervous about it, squirm and try to avoid it. Unfortunately there are times in life when it is unavoidable and you’ve got to find the strength to do it.


Use the sandwich technique. This technique involves saying something positive about the person, telling them the bad news then finishing with a positive statement. This will help soften the blow of receiving the bad news. Depending on the intensity of what you have to tell the person, anything that eases the situation is helpful.
For example you could say, “You are really good with people and I can tell people really like you. Unfortunately, we’ve decided not to fill the job after all. I’m certain another employer will benefit from having a great employee like you.”

, You don’t want to prolong the inevitable, so get to the point of the conversation as quickly as possible. This is the most compassionate thing to do. If you drag out a conversation that ends with bad news, you will likely cause a negative reaction.


Start the conversation by saying, “Look, I’ve got some bad news and it’s going to probably upset you. So I’m just going to say it. I got a call. Your mother passed away. Is there anything I can do to help?”
Listening to the person express their feelings and concerns is an important part of the conversations.
Share similar experiences with the person by saying, “I know when my mother died it was one of the hardest things. I’m so sorry you are having to go through this.”

, The more you practice your approach to the different types of conversations, the better you will get. When the time comes it will be less difficult. Develop techniques for dealing with people such as car repair people, contractors, store clerks, and people on the bus or subway.


For example, if you continually have difficulty with contractors working on your home, have a conversation with them at the outset by saying, “I’m looking for someone who is going to follow through on what they say rather than over promise and under-produce. I would rather have honest communication than feel bad about the situation if expectations are not met.” They will let you know if they can rise to the challenge. This sets an expectation that will help you if there are future difficulties.

, It is one of life’s pleasures when you get to deliver good new to someone. There are times when you may need to be more prepared than simply blurting out the news. If you are planning to have a conversation about having a baby, or getting married, or taking a dream job in New York, you need to have a plan.


Consider everyone’s reactions and plan accordingly. If you know your mother flips out when she hears exciting news, determine an appropriate location.
Anticipate the questions people will ask you during the conversation. For example, if you are pregnant people will want to know when you are due, if you have selected baby names, and how you are feeling.
Be open to answering questions and remember the other person is excited for you.
If you are asking someone to marry you, decide where it will happen, what time, and what you are going to say. Whether you are on a mountain top at sunset or on paddle boards in the morning, the conversations leading up to and following your proposal can be exciting. These are special moments so take extra precautions so you won’t be disappointed.

If you don’t have the benefit of a face-to-face conversation, your image is formed by crafting online communication.

, Be mindful that the tone of your texts and emails can get lost. Conversations in e-form are one-dimensional and can be misunderstood. You don’t have the benefit of seeing a person face-to-face to observe the body language, voice tone, and emotion of a conversation.


Be polite in your choice of words.
Refrain from using all capital letters throughout the text or email. This will be perceived as yelling.
Use emoticons, a small facial icon portraying an emotion, to clarify the emotional intent of your comments and conversations.

, For example, always include a greeting such as, “Dear _____, I was excited to see your email today and thought I would reach out.” Sign off of by saying, “Thank you for allowing me to explain my situation. I look forward to your reply. Respectfully submitted, _____.”

, If you have a question, quickly get to asking it. Depending on the recipient, you may only have a few seconds to hook the person’s attention.

, Treat others as you would like to be treated. Even if you need to express a conflict or dissatisfaction you can maintain a professional demeanor. For example, “Dear ____, It has come to my attention that there has been an error made by your company. I am contacting you today to resolve the matter and hope that the issue can be settled without taking further action.”

, Whether you spend an hour per day or per month online, everyone has an online reputation.The power of positive actions and the devastating consequences of an online fail can change your circumstances in a heartbeat. Each comment you make on social media is either the potential start of a conversation, or a response that can further the conversation.

, For example, you can say, “I understand why you are upset, and I need to tell you why I am too.” Pause before you make any comments. Ask yourself, “Will this offend, belittle, or cause me problems in my future interaction?” Pause twice before you hit send. Remember you can’t get something back once you send it.

, The anonymous nature of online commenting carries a potential to unleash the mob mentality. If you start an online conversation on a social media site and someone doesn’t like the comment, a herd of haters may join you. Reasonable people can turn into irresponsible people because they believe no one will catch them or punish them., If someone says something to you, turn the other cheek. Positive comments will almost always elicit positive responses. Stick with those types of comments and every online conversation will be positive.

, Text messaging allows you to stay in touch with those you care about. Some age groups use it more than others, and some abuse texting to the point of causing health problems.Texting is a very useful tool in today’s conversations. When life is busy, you don’t always have the time to call or talk to someone you care about.

, If a person sends you a text, respond to them in a reasonable amount of time. The same common courtesies you would demonstrate in a face-to-face conversation need to be demonstrated in text conversations.


If you send a text and you do not get a response, don’t pout about it. Send a second text and ask if the person received it.
If it bothers you that someone doesn’t respond to your text messages you can say, “Hi, can you do me a favor and at least respond with the letter “K” when I send you a text. At least that tells me you received it and I won’t have to worry about it.”

, If your grandparents are set up to e-mail and text, send them texts to let them know you love and care for them. Grandparents feel ignored at times and benefit from knowing that you are doing well.If they are capable and interested, they are never too old to learn something new.

Breathe deeply.,
Buy yourself time.,
Remember that the trick is to respond rather than react.",How to Be More Careful About What You Say," If you don't realize, you're not going to be able to deal with it effectively. Here are some questions to ask yourself that might help you see clearly if you have this obstacle.


Have you ever said something unintentionally that hurt someone's feelings?
Have you said something you haven't meant?
Have you ever said anything you didn't want to that just ""slipped out?""


If you answered yes to all of these questions, you may well have the incapability to control everything you say. This doesn't mean you're out of luck or that it's bad news––all you need is to begin acknowledging that you do and start working on no longer doing it.





;
, As well as catching yourself do it, begin to undo any of the damage it may be causing.


First, say sorry to anyone that you may have hurt haphazardly, if you haven't already done so.
Secondly, tell your close friends and family or anyone else who will understand you, that you don't always say what you mean or vice versa.

, Talk to your friends and family about your tendency to say what you think without reflecting. Explain to them that you're going to do your best from now on to speak with greater care, to respond more slowly and to learn to buy time instead of reacting immediately to the things that annoy, excite or upset you. Ask for their help in gently pointing out when you blab all, and let them know that you won't be offended.

, People who don't you very well or who don't know that you're working to minimize this bad habit may be offended if you say something out of turn. In this case, you could try to:


Explain that sometimes you really don't mean what you say, that it just comes out the wrong way.
Say sorry to anyone whose feelings or dignity may have been wounded.

, Try to wait a minute, to give yourself some time to think after someone says something to you, before responding. If you need more time, or the silence is awkward, here are some helpful lines to use:


""That's news to me. I need some time to digest that. Do you mind if I get back to you with my thoughts later?""
""Wow, that's incredible/terrible/upsetting. I need a moment to process it please. Do you mind?""
""I am listening, please explain more to help me really understand your point.""
""Could you run that by me another time please?""
""Gosh, I feel quite overwhelmed by that information/news/update. Could I have a moment please?""

, This can help you to refrain from saying something mean back to a mean person or from cursing, arguing or making a hotheaded retort. Breathe from your stomach, to keep yourself calm.

, Count to ten before giving your more reasoned response. If it helps, ask for a minute, and actually walk away to get some space and think through what you really want to say. Also think about the tone, along with the words, for when you do respond.

, Reacting is a rash, immediate and emotional way to answer someone, whereas responding is a calm, considered and focused way of answering a person.

If you feel yourself getting agitated or angry, try to sit down and focus on your breath. Once you have calmed down, then respond.

Be polite.,

Try to understand this person's needs body-language wise.,

Slow the pace with your words.,

Create a kind impression.",How to Be Open and Polite With Non English Speakers," Even though you don't know what they are saying, body language affects a lot. Maintain welcoming body language. This is positive for communication. Smile, nod and keep palms visible. Make eye contact without glaring. Stand at a comfortable conversational distance. Show you care, give a kind look and say clearly in English that you don't speak their language.







Use simple words and sentences. These are easier for a non native English speaker to follow, particularly those who are just beginning to learn English. The exception is for people who speak Romance languages like French or Spanish; in this case, using as much Latinate words as possible (e.g. ""necessitate"" instead of ""need"") will greatly improve your communication, because these words sound similar to their own native words.;
, Does she look worried or stressed? Does he look confused? Look for things like pointing towards an object or better--listen for recognizable words. A stream of unrecognizable words can be discouraging. A few key words will reveal the content of the message. For example, a non native English speaker may state the name of a soft drink. Don't try to decipher the other words in his message. Instead, assume he desires to obtain the beverage., Anyone talking fast is hard to follow. Enunciate syllables clearly. A non native English speaker can become embarrassed when pronunciations are exaggerated. If you show you're not rushing, they will do the same., Don't give an uncomfortable look, or give questionable gestures (like raising eyebrows, rolling your eyes, stressfulness, etc), it may make the person you are speaking to feel guilty and isolated. Keep a friendly face and a warm welcome. If you try your best, they may too."

Prepare yourself.,
Be confident: If you aren't confident with yourself, you'll be scared of sharing your opinions.,
Form a debate: Group discussion is weighing the pros and cons of a debatable topic, e.g., should prostitutes be taxed?,
Conquer misunderstandings: Even though you are mainly talking, and announcing whatever comes to you to debate over; it doesn't stop heated words from spilling.,
Find balance: It's important to have those small 'no' or shake of the heads, it's better not to find a topic you all agree on.,
Decision: There is always something different for group discussions.",How to Be Good at Group Discussion," If you don't know your material ahead of time, you will have less to contribute and will understand the discussion less. Research some background information on your topic if you are given it ahead of time.;
, You need to trust yourself and others and you need to feel confident in your thoughts. Share your opinions- it doesn't matter what other people think as long as your thoughts matter to you.

, Some will say no, they have unprotected sex and spread AIDS around, but people who know prostitutes will object or live in a building that has one. But they have a living besides prostitution. The group discussions are mostly a way to see if how people's views are different, and how they perceive things. It's also comparing answers to others.

, So take in all in stride and try to form a question about why such an argument bursts out from something misunderstood. Try to make sure that their anger simmered down, and make a light-humored topic to stay. Compare comedy to the comedy back then, with all the custard pies thrown, and chases, it's a good way to diminish the tense atmosphere.

, This allows your view to be heard, and thought upon. There has to be flaws, obviously, or else it wouldn't be a good debate. That is probably the main problem, where the topic is perfect to discuss about. Instead of finding the boring, flawless debate, find one that you never heard of. It'll be enough to research, and enjoy. It also might be something educational, not the regular question from teachers about whether school uniforms should be allowed.

, Ranging arithmetic, charities, healthy eating, politics, sports, and virtue or value in today's products. Mainly, you got to wonder if that topic is worth talking about, for politics, it varies; there is the government, and what they control. It's challenging, but group discussion is an opening to your lives. An introduction for you to get to know each other. Good luck in starting it...

If you act judgmental or with a dismissive attitude towards other people, they will most likely return the same negative feelings towards you. Making others feel welcomed and appreciated will go a long way towards your success in making friends.


Interact with strangers nicely and calmly, request favors patiently, respond to others promptly and remember your pleases and thank-you's.
Remember that everyone you're interacting with is human, too. Just because you're paying someone to wait on your table doesn't give you the right to be rude; treat them like you'd want to be treated if you were in their position.

As J.K. Rowling put it, ""It's easier to see what someone is really like by how they treat their inferiors, not their equals.""

;
, People like to be around others who are sure of themselves without being arrogant. Be confident in who you are without constantly stepping on others' toes. A healthy level of confidence is knowing you're pretty great, but that there's always someone better than you.


If you always criticize yourself and seem to be unhappy with who you are, you run the risk of people feeling the same way about you. After all, if you aren't pleased with yourself, why should others be?
The other side of the coin is just as bad -- too cocky and people will think you like yourself so much that no one else needs to. The aim is contentment, not excessive pride.

, It is particularly important to be honest to your friends and people who solicit you for advice. Usually, people can tell when someone is lying and fake; insincere people are not well-liked. People you want to be around should not tolerate liars.


When someone asks, ""Does this make me look fat?"" (yes, it's a cliché, but it's a classic example), make your comments gently, framed in a way that is unlikely to upset them. If you know your fashion, tell them WHY. They're sure to trust you knowing that you were honest and appreciate that you're helping them.
It is a trickier idea to be brutally honest with someone who does not solicit your advice. Bringing up a comment like that can either generate appreciative responses or offended looks, depending on the person's personality, so judge the situation at your own risk. You should probably avoid initiating negative comments, no matter how truthful, with people whom you are not closely acquainted or good friends with.

, There is not a single person on this planet who feels like they receive too much attention (a single person not constantly followed by paparazzi at least). When we humans engage in conversation, most of us are looking for someone to be genuinely interested in what we have to say -- the input of the other is secondary. Don't think you're being boring! You're letting the other person feel good about themselves.


It's important to listen actively, though. If someone is going on and on about the most effective way to wash their dog, glazing over, while tempting, is not being a good listener. Try to engage your entire self at all times -- your eyes, the nodding of your head, commenting and questioning, and the positioning of your body -- it should all be focused on them.

, A huge part of being a good conversationalist (and when you're listening) is asking questions. A social jiu-jitsu master has someone walking away after a conversation feeling good and not realizing they didn't learn a dang thing about the other person because they were talking so much. Be that person. Ask who, why, or how. The other will feel appreciated, liked, and go on a spiel that takes the pressure off you. And they'll like you for it.


Keep everything open-ended. If Jill from the office says, ""God, I just spend hours on this freakin' Powerpoint,"" jump in! Ask her what it was for, why it took longer than normal, or how she did the research. Even a bias topic like a Powerpoint can start a good conversation where Jill feels paid attention to.

, One of the tenants of Dale Carnegie's massively successfully ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is to use a person's name in conversation. Hearing our own name activates a region in our brains that remains dormant at any other soundand we love it. Our names are our identity and conversing with someone who uses it makes us feel like our identity is acknowledged. So the next time you're speaking to that acquaintance, slip their name in. Odds are they'll feel a bond to you that may not exist otherwise.


This is fairly easy to do. The most obvious way is to add it on to your greeting. ""Hey, Rob, how are you?"" is much more personal than, ""Hey, how are you?"" And if you're close enough to Rob to say, ""Hey, Rockin' Robby D! How are you, man?"" that works, too. Apart from greetings, it can be inserted casually just about anywhere. Initiating a conversation -- ""What do you think of this for my desktop, Rob?"" -- or just as a comment, ""Rob, you're being ridiculous again."" Rob will practically feel like your best friend.

, Odds are you know people from a few different social groups. Getting the Plastics at high school to like you (if they're capable of actually liking people) is a much different path than getting your engineering classmates at Harvard to call you up on a Friday night. So know who you're dealing with. What do they like? What do they seem to value? What interests them?


If you want to be genuinely liked (being popular and being liked are not the same thing), you're in luck: generally, humans all like the same qualities. And no, wealth and attractiveness aren't high up on the list. Trustworthiness, honesty, warmth and kindness are, in a recent study, the highest rated, most valued qualities (across the board of relationships), while extraversion, intelligence and sense of humor come in close behind., You can ask all the questions you want, be super polite, say all the right things, and sometimes people still won't be having it. If every time you walk up to Johnny he miraculously gets a phone call, take the hint. Spend your resources elsewhere. This will happen -- there's no pleasing everyone. While it's very important to put in effort, put it in where it's due.


Relationships are a give and take. If you're constantly the one making the effort, sending the texts, going out of your way to be nice and friendly, take a look at the situation. If there's an explanation (the person is going through a hard time, they work 60 hours a week, etc.), then you may have to do the brunt of the work. But if they're responsive to other people but don't seem to have the time for you, go elsewhere. You can't be friends with everyone.

, Everyone and their brother appreciates the person who can ease the tension in the room and make them laugh. A good sense of humor can go a long, long way. When people know you're playful and looking to have a good time, they want to join in. It's also a great way to be approachable because people know what to say (they want to be liked just as much as you do) -- they can joke with you, too! Win, win, win.


If once in a while people have to laugh at you, great! If you can laugh too, you're good to go. That shows you're down-to-earth and not overly concerned with your image -- two very good things. And research even shows that embarrassing yourself makes people like and trust you more -- you become a real person.Makes sense, doesn't it?

, You emanate a good vibe with this simple gesture, and you can improve the mood of everyone around you. Even if you don't feel particularly joyous or are stuck in a mood slump, the voluntary action of your muscles turning up into a smile can sometimes trigger feelings of lightheartedness and happiness.


Think of happy thoughts or past moments that did make you grin to help trigger a genuine smile. If nothing else, people will be wondering what the heck you're smiling about!
It takes more facial muscles to frown than to smile -- and for good reason! Everyone should be smiling more often than frowning.

, The fact of the matter is that everyone wants to be liked. Everyone. It's simple logic -- the more liked you are, the easier life is. Because everyone's fighting the same battle you are, help them out a little. Be approachable (when you're not doing the approaching yourself -- which you may have to do). Smile, uncross your arms, and set down your phone. The world is in front of you. What will come to you if you let it?


Think about the people you want to be friends with. Odds are an adjective you wouldn't use to describe them is ""surly."" If you want to pull your half of the weight in making a friend, be sure your vibe is welcoming. Keep your body relaxed, seem engaged in your environment, and notice people. Half the battle, really.

, Have you ever been talking to someone and their eyes seem to wander around the room to everything but you? That's a pretty crappy feeling -- as soon as you notice it, it's tempting to just shut up then and there and see if they snap out of it. Don't be that guy. If someone is saying something offhand, it's fine to lapse (you don't want to start a staring contest), but if they really care about the topic at hand, give them your attention. You'd want it, too!


Some people have issues with eye contact -- they just can't really do it. If this is you, try tricking yourself and looking at the bridge of their nose or their eyebrows. People tend to get a little disconcerted when you don't look at them, so trick them and trick you by staying in the vicinity of their orbital bones.

, A known way of subconsciously increasing rapport between two parties is mirroring or mimicry -- where both end up with the same stance, facial expression, weight distribution, overall body position, etc. Consider toying with this when you're in conversation -- a perceived ""sameness"" can go a long way. However, as it's supposed to be subconscious, don't mess with it too much -- you could become preoccupied!


This is generally good when working with peers -- not when you're working with superiors. Recent research has said that the adverse effect can take place -- feelings of coldness, etc. -- when the two subjects aren't in an appropriate scenario (dealing with money, job issues, and so forth).So keep it to that group of friends you want to get closer to and not your boss.

, Odds are at some point in your lifetime someone stressed the importance of keeping your shoulders back, your head high, and having a firm handshake. While these definitely have their place (like a job interview), making friends and getting people to like you isn't exactly the place for it. Your body should be relaxed, not squared off. Show that you're not challenging the other person.


Think of greeting someone. In that video where Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela meet (two people that have the right to think they're each a pretty big deal), both show deference -- a slight lean-in and step forward, using the free arm for extra touch, smiling.They're conveying that they respect and like the other -- which goes a long way to being liked in return.

, Humans need other humans to survive and, of course, be happy. Babies that aren't touched enough don't thrive. That doesn't exactly go away in adulthood! If you want to form a more concrete bond with someone, find small opportunities for touch. Appropriate touch, of course! A brush of the arm or shoulder or even a high-five. Those small moments get turned into connections when touch is added.


Think of someone walking up to you and saying, ""Hi! How are you?"" Now imagine that same person walking up to you and saying, ""! How are you?"" and lightly touching your arm as they pass. Which greeting left you feeling a bit warmer on the inside? Probably the second one, huh? Use that. It doesn't cost a thing.

, Straight up, the easiest way to get someone to like you is to like them. Not exactly rocket science, is it? Surely you've been around someone who just didn't seem to give a hoot about whether you were there or not. And you've probably been around the opposite too -- people who make you feel appreciated and are quite clearly glad you're there. Which do you like more, even if you can't explain it?


You can't expect people to like you if you can't say the same for yourself. Odds are you do like the people you want to like you (why else would you care?) so make it clear! Smile when they walk in the room. Make conversation. Comment on a detail they mentioned last Wednesday to show you were listening. The little things will tune them into your genuineness.

, Everyone wants to be around the person that has that sunny disposition that lights up the entire room. And the opposite rings true -- no one wants to be around Debbie Downer. To get people to like you, be positive. That means smiling, being enthusiastic, happy, and looking on the bright side. You probably know someone like this who you can emulate.


This is very much so a 24/7 thing. It's gonna be hard to be positive in front of people when you're negative by yourself. You have to train your brain to have certain habits -- positivity being one of them. Try to always think positive even when you're alone; that way it can become old hat in no time.
Know when to commiserate. There is a certain level of bonding that can be had over group complaining. Talking to your coworkers about how terrible the new boss is will foster friendship -- but if it's all you do, you'll be associated with negativity. Use the complaining sparingly and use it only to relate -- not to spark conversation or turn it around.

, What talent or trait do friends admire in you? Show them to the world! People are naturally drawn to those with passions and abilities. It makes us useful, valuable, and interesting. Whatever it is, wear your flag proudly.


If you are a good singer, get up on karaoke night and entertain the room. A good baker? Bring a treat to the office. A painter? Invite a group to your showing or simply hang something in the communal area. Let people see your personality to get to know you a bit better.

, It's impossible to get everyone to like you -- differing personalities will inevitably result in some clash at some point of your life -- but you will earn the admiration of those who are compatible with you and those who matter.


People like others who come off as sincere and genuine, so avoid taking steps to change so far that you are uncomfortable with your actions. Faking anything may be a red flag to those who are tuned in. Mean everything you say and do. If you want people to like you, you'll have good intentions and be fine.

, They sincerely like the genuine. So while that Coach purse or those six-pack abs might get you a fan or two, it won't be that meaningful and it certainly won't last. It's tempting to think being attractive will make people like you -- and it will, but only to a point. You need the goods to back it up. If people find out you're a lying scumbag, they'll drop you like a sack of potatoes regardless of what you look like.


In a recent study, people were asked what qualities they thought others looked for in friends and relationships. Money, appearance, and status were pretty high up there. But when they were asked what they valued, they answered with things like honest, warmth, and kindness. Society tells us (wrongfully so) that looks and money are more important than anything else and deep down we know it's not true.If you want people to actually like you, worry about the inside of your book, not the cover.

That being said, it's important to be hygienic. People won't likely give you the time of day if you smell like you're fresh off the manure farm. Even if you have the personality of Mother Theresa and Bill Cosby's lovechild, you'll probably be given the cold shoulder. So take a shower, brush your teeth, look in the mirror before you leave, and then go out there with a smile.



, Wanting to be liked puts you at the mercy of everyone else. Going outside of your box to get this accomplished will make you feel a bit uneasy. The actions you undertake will feel scary. This is good. This is challenging. This promotes growth. As long as you still feel you're being yourself, you're only building on your character, improving it. It may be scary, but it'll be worth it.


There's a difference between wanting people to like you and needing to be liked in order to be happy. Your self-image should not be based on the approval of others; that will leave you hurting in no time. But if you are comfortable with yourself and just want to be well-received, that's respectable. People will see that and respond. That scare-factor will go away with time.

, Most people are turned off by people who can't turn off their insecurities. Saying something like, ""It's okay...it's good enough for me"" or constantly commenting on how fat or ugly you are gives off the red light that you don't like you. That personal negativity isn't becoming on anyone. So leave it at the door. It's not good for you and it's not good for your friendships.


Insecurities are what we call the feelings we get and the behavior we display when we're uncomfortable with ourselves. If you're uncomfortable with yourself, it puts a damper on the entire room and plenty of people aren't going to deal with that. Don't worry about coming off as humble or arrogant. Say things like they are. You have worth. We all do.

, Negativity can be learned and unlearned; no one says, ""Gosh, my baby is just so negative. If positivity is an issue for you, luckily you're the only one who can change it! Your brain is plastic and it can be trained. You just gotta buckle down and do it.


The simplest way to start is to stop. Stop the negativity in its track. When you catch yourself thinking something bad about yourself, don't finish the thought. Replace it with something a little more realistic and positive. You'll feel better, too. Turn ""I'm so fat"" into ""I'd like to lose a little weight. How might I go about doing that?"" and a new train of thought will start. So get on board.

, We've covered how confidence is a very, very likeable trait, and being unconcerned with how you present yourself goes along those same lines. When you start self-presenting, people will notice. Think of the guy at the party who's ""peacocking."" He's trying to strut his machismo for the entire room to notice. It's not attractive. It's disingenuous and, quite frankly, it's sad; he doesn't think who he naturally is is good enough. Don't be that guy.


Whether you're a dork or a hipster or a jock, it doesn't matter. If people have the idea that your penchant for sparkly nail polish means you're an idiot, let 'em be wrong. If they think your veganism makes you a liberal loony toon, great. Hilarious even. People are gonna judge you -- let 'em. They can think what they want. It shouldn't have any effect on you.

, You know why shy people get a bad rap? Because people mistake their shyness for being cold and aloof. Those are two qualities that really intimidate people and turn them off. So be the opposite! Being warm and kind are highly valued in any society -- it shows you have the other person's interests in mind and want the best for them. Who wouldn't like that?


Initiate random acts of kindness. Do things for other people, even if you don't know them. Hold a door when going in or out of a building, pick something up for a stranger when they drop it, and offer to take a picture for a group who looks like they're trying to take one. This type of selfless giving inspires others to do the same in return -- not just for you, but for others in their life as well.

, Generally speaking, people value a certain level of extroversion. It makes sense: we all want conversation and being social to be easy and extroverts lessen the risk of awkwardness. If you sit mutely at the table not contributing, well, you might as well be somewhere else. Chime in! Let your voice be heard. How else will people find out you're valuable?


However, if you know you're guilty of not being able to put a lid on it, so to speak, you may want to tone it down. While everyone likes a good conversationalist, they are not looking to spend their time with someone who won't let them get a word in edgewise. If the last 5 points that were made were yours, back off a bit. The other person might not be the type that will jump in; they may need an invitation. Ask them their opinions to share the spotlight with you.

, People like likable people, not people who are dying to be liked. If you're constantly complimenting them and following them around like a puppy dog, you won't get what you want. As much as you're being nice, you'll be viewed as a pesky gnat that needs to get swatted away. Avoid being the clingy, needy one.


If you stay attentive, you'll be able to see the clues. If someone doesn't return your calls, engages in niceties only, doesn't make much of an effort -- and you're constantly hounding them to hang out, you might be a suck up. While you have good intentions, being desperate isn't attractive. Back off and see if they come around.

, If you've ever heard of the Benjamin Franklin effect, you'll know where this is going. Turns out we often take cues from our own behavior to determine how we think. If you do something nice for someone, you'll like them more. If you hurt someone, you'll like them less. It's all about cognitive dissonance.So ask for a favor -- if the other person does it for you, they may end up liking you more.


The idea here is that we subconsciously look at our behavior and ask ourselves why we did it. Why did we loan that acquaintance of ours our favorite coffee mug? Well, gee...must be because we like them. Light bulb! Funnily enough, deciding we like someone is no different than actually liking them.

, Make sure you can follow through on all your commitments. They're called ""commitments"" because you've committed to making the effort for that task or event, so don't back out last-minute. If breaking a commitment is unavoidable, let everyone else involved know as soon as you are aware that you cannot make it. It may still be annoying to the other parties, but at least they expect it and can adjust their schedules as necessary.


Whether it's making it to dinner or finishing up a project, it's important to keep your friends and co-workers in the loop about your progress. Whether it's a quick email to say everything's on track or a note apologizing for unexpected delays, people appreciate communication. Not knowing what's going on can be extremely frustrating, even if the project is ultimately completed on time and in top-notch quality.

, To be liked you gotta have personality. No one would argue with that. Part of having personality is having beliefs, opinions, and standards. Express those! They're part of you. They liven up the room. If we all had the same ones, life would be incredibly boring. Chip in your two cents. It could spark something interesting.


Standing up for your beliefs is one thing; preaching them is another. If you don't agree with someone's stance on a topic, great! Explore it. Talk about it. Have an intellectual discussion on your opposing viewpoints. You two will both learn something. Instead of shutting them down, telling them they're wrong, and preaching your own ideas, open your mind and try to see their point of view. Maybe you'll realize something, too.

, People are sensitive creatures. If someone you know starts spouting off about how the Easter Bunny is the long lost son of Jesus Christ and you really want them to like you, don't make a scene about how they must be inbred. Let them be. The same thing goes if someone says something like, ""I really think my best quality is how amazingly down-to-earth I am. I mean, all my actions are humble and selfless."" That's not an opportunity to call them out on their raging arrogance and lack of self-awareness.


Again, it's only if you want to be liked by these people. After enough comments on how great a person is, you're totally entitled to lose your cool. But if you're still new to the person/group, it's sometimes best to just go with the flow.

, Everyone looks for reaffirmation. We want to be told we're good-looking, smart, funny, have it going on, etc. We can barely be told it enough. So when that one person comes up and says something positive about us, it can make our day. Think of this: some people go their entire lives without hearing anything positive about them. Change that. It'll take two seconds of your time.


Be genuine. Don't walk up to someone and tell them you like their khaki pants. Make it meaningful. Make it something about them. It can be something as simple as ""that's a great idea."" Often the smaller ones are more thoughtful (and more believable). ""You're hilarious"" after a joke or ""that article you wrote was really insightful; it really got me thinking."" Whatever you say, mean it. You'll probably get something back.

, Most people aren't social butterflies. We'd love some attention, but we don't really know how to go about getting it. We all feel vulnerable in social situations and we all want to minimize that. Recognizing that everyone else is in the same boat you are will help you realize that making the effort isn't an odd thing -- it's just the brave thing. Everyone else wants to, they're just complacent. If there's someone you'd like to be friends with, start talking to them. It could be just the thing they were waiting for.


It's impossible to be liked if you're not really a factor at all. Often we feel like we're not liked when really, people don't have feelings one way or another -- and that's because we haven't put ourselves out there. Next time you're in a group of people you'd like to feel liked with, show your personality. Make the effort to fill a role in the group. Crack a joke, a smile, initiate a simple conversation. It'll springboard from there.

If you want to be better at small talk, practice making small talk whenever you can.Choose low stakes situations to practice small talk. If you're going to a party on Friday, you may be very nervous about making small talk with potential new friends. Therefore, work on making small talk during less intense social situations.
For example, make small talk at the line in the grocery store. Try to strike up small talk with a barista at a coffee shop. If you're making small talk with people you're unlikely to see again, you may be calmer.;
, If you're stressed when making small talk, this is likely to rub off on other people. Therefore, work on developing a positive mentality surrounding small talk. Going into the situation positive can make it a more positive experience for everyone. This can make small talk easier, easing your social anxiety in future situations.Change how you think about small talk. Don't think of it as a burden. Instead, look at it as a way to get to know new people.
Try doing something to relax, like taking a few deep breaths, before going into a situation that requires small talk. You will end up calmer during the situation, and better equipped to make small talk in a positive manner.

, You may feel anxious going into a social situation where you don't know anyone. Something as simple as learning people's names can help. In places where you need to make small talk, like your office, work on learning the names of co-workers.After you've heard someone's name the first time, repeat it once or twice in your head. This can help you commit the name to memory.
Repeating the person’s name out loud when you meet can also be helpful, such as by saying something like, ""Nice to meet you, John.""
You can also try coming up with a way to connect the name to something familiar to you and this may help you to remember. For example, you might think to yourself, ""John with the tweed blazer,"" or ""John rhymes with Sean my brother,"" or ""John, like my uncle John.”
Remember, you can always ask a third party for someone's name if you forgot it.

, Sometimes, just knowing you're not alone can help you make small talk. Going into a social situation, remind yourself that everyone gets nervous. You are probably not the only one feeling anxious during small talk. When you start to feel social anxiety coming on, remind yourself the other person is likely as anxious as you are., Being a good listener is important even when you are just making small talk. Active listening is a way to stay focused while someone is talking while also showing them that you are listening. To be an active listener, try to:Show that you are listening using your body language. Maintain eye contact, face the person, and nod your head.
Use neutral leading statements to make the person feel heard. Try saying things like, “yes,” “uh-huh,” and “I see.”
Ask questions to keep the person talking or to clarify. When appropriate, try asking questions like, “What happened next?” “How did you feel?” and “What did you mean when you said ___?”

, Showing empathy for someone else can also help you to be a good listener. When making small talk with someone, try to consider their perspective when they tell you things. How might you feel if the same thing happened to you? This can help you to respond appropriately to the things the other person says.


For example, if you are making small talk with a coworker who tells you she got halfway to work and realized she left her phone at home and had to go back, then you might guess that she felt very frustrated and it was not a pleasant morning for her. Therefore, an appropriate response might be something like, ""Oh no! That sounds frustrating! I hope the rest of your day goes better.”

, Having a lot to discuss can improve your small talk skills. One way to do this is to stay up-to-date on the news. Most people follow current events to some degree. Being able to comment on what's happening in the world can be excellent fodder for small talk.The news can usually make a good conversation starter. For example, you can say something like, ""Did you hear about..."" or ""How do you feel about...""
However, it may be best to avoid controversial topics in small talk. You do not want to make someone feel uncomfortable asking their opinion on a hot button issue.

, Certain subjects should not be raised during small talk. They tend to halt the conversation, and may make others feel awkward. While engaging in small talk, make sure to avoid conversation killers.Don't talk about yourself too much. While it's okay to talk about your own experience, do not relate everything the other person says back to a personal anecdote.
Never interrupt someone. Even if you think you know where a sentence is going, it's considered rude to try to finish someone else's sentence.
Avoid arguing with someone during small talk. If someone brings up a political point you don't agree with, let it slide instead of arguing. People may take disagreements personally, and you don't want to risk alienating someone.

, This is another good go-to if you're nervous during small talk. You can always talk about the setting. Comment on the theme or atmosphere of a bar where you're socializing. Make a comment on the weather. Compliment someone's home or apartment if you've been invited over for dinner., You will be a better conversationalist if you can remember small details about people's lives. This can help streamline small talk. When people tell you about themselves, make note of small details. You can use these to fuel small talk later.For example, you may learn you co-worker has a dog named Linus. If you need to, say, make small talk in the elevator, you can ask something like, ""How is Linus doing?""

, You can always talk a bit about yourself if you have something interesting to share. While you should not go overboard talking about yourself, relevant and interesting facts about your life can help move small talk forward. If someone asks something about you, give an interesting answer. This will help conversation move along.For example, say something asks you how your weekend was. Do not simply answer fine.
Tell them about something you did that weekend that may be of interest. For example, ""My weekend was good. I went to the beach with my friend and we collected seashells. How was your weekend?""

, People love to talk about themselves. If there's a lull in the conversation, you can always ask someone something about themselves. Most people will eagerly share facts about themselves when asked.For example, if you were just talking about something at work, and the conversation has stalled, ask something like, ""So, how did you find your job?""
You can also ask about the other person's interests. If conversation slows, try a generic conversation starter like, ""Have you seen any good movies lately?""

, Sometimes, there are awkward silences during small talk. If a conversation slows, do something to keep it going. Ask appropriate questions during quiet moments to keep a conversation going.Bring up something mentioned previously in the conversation. For example, say something like, ""So, tell me more about your job.""
Encourage someone to share a personal story. Ask them something like, ""So, you studied English in college? How did you get into that?""
Recalling and asking about information brought up previously can always push the conversation forward, so make sure you pay attention when people talk. You may need to use the information later.

, Building your skills at small talk is a learning process. Each time you successfully engage in small talk, try to learn something about the experience.The more you know about the world, the better you'll be at conversation. Talking to people from a variety of backgrounds, with a variety of different experiences, can broaden your horizons.
Make an active effort to learn from people. Ask about other people's opinions and experiences. Remember interesting tidbits and facts you learn from others. You can use this information in conversations down the road.

, Some people dislike small talk because they see it as fake or useless. However, making small talk can help you to build new relationships with people, such as for friendships, romantic relationships, or working relationships. Try to remind yourself that making small talk can lead to great things in some situations.

, Confident body language will help you give off the right attitude during conversations. Work on maintaining eye contact, sitting up straight, and doing other things to look social and engaged.Be aware of your body language. Strive to look engaged with the person.
Avoid gestures that make you look distant. Don't, for example, cross your arms, look at the clock or phone, or lean away from the person.

, If you want to build your social skills, start small. If you're shy by nature, you don't want to push yourself to do too much too soon. Set a goal to do one small thing each day to push you out of your comfort zone.For example, you could set a goal to eat lunch in the break room instead of alone in a nearby coffee shop. This way, you'll have to be social with your co-workers.
From there, work your way up. Set more and more small goals, until you're brave enough to go out for drinks with co-workers after work.

, It can help to model your behavior after someone you see as socially adept. You can, for example, study the behavior of a very social co-worker in your office. Pay attention to how they interact and make conversations with others. Try to emulate some of their behaviors., Shyness is often linked to a lack of confidence. If you're shy by nature, trying new things can help you feel more confident in yourself. Developing a wide skill set or a wide array of hobbies and interests can make you feel bolder. It can also give you more to talk about during small talk.Join a club. Take a class. Enroll in a sport's team. Do anything that pertains to your interests that is new and exciting for you.

, It's hard to lift others up when you're barely staying afloat. Look out for your physical and psychological health so that you can feel energetic and grounded when other people need you.


Eat well, take walks or do other forms of exercise, get at least 8 hours of sleep, and stay hydrated. This is all important to your well-being.

Learn how to say no. It's important to set boundaries in your life, and stick by them. Even though it might feel tough, boundaries are an act of love—they allow you to breathe, and keep the relationship strong.
Spend time doing things you love. Hang out with loved ones, work on your hobbies, and schedule relaxation time every day.

, Bathe regularly, wash your face, brush your teeth, comb your hair, and wear clean clothes. Looking good lets people know that you care about them enough to be your best for them.


Wearing designer clothes, doing your hair, and wearing makeup are all optional. It's okay to do them if you like them, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with choosing not to do them, either.

, An attitude of gratitude will make you a happier, warmer person. When you're driving alone or reflecting on your day, focus on the good things in your life, and you will end up feeling better. Here are some ways to build a habit of thankfulness:


At the end of every day, think of three positive things that happened. Reflect on why you're glad about them, and write them down if you wish.
Keep a list of things you're grateful for. Add to it every day.
Write a list of the good things in life (hot chocolate, rainbows, good friends, fuzzy animals, etc.). Add illustrations or photos if you feel like it. Then look through the list whenever you're having a bad time.

, Write them down if you want to. Remind yourself often of why you care about them, and what makes them special.

, If you look approachable to others, they're more likely to hold a conversation with you. Be open, treat others with compassion, and prepare some conversations ahead of time to help you get to know others. See the above image as a prime example of how to not look open to conversation.

, A good friend is one who is there not only on the rainy days, but out enjoying the sunshine. Say ""I'm happy for you!"" and mean it.

, You should always do good things wherever you are. It doesn't matter how small they are—each tiny effort makes the world a happier place. Give kindness freely, and it will come back to you.

, Choose something that will help a certain group of people: disaster victims, animals at shelters, disabled people fighting stigma, or campaigns that fight hunger. This will help you feel more satisfied with yourself, and lets you practice empathy and kindness.

, This doesn't necessarily mean taking them aside and launching into a monologue about how wonderful they are (although there's nothing wrong with that). You can also do it in little ways: compliments, smiles, listening about their interests, gifts, little things to make their lives easier, hugs, et cetera. Every day, resolve to show love to at least 3 people in some small way.

, Sometimes, people try to take advantage of your kindness, bully others, or spread hurtful information, and it is absolutely okay to be firm with them. You can even be rude if you have to. You have the right to assert your boundaries and protect others, and doing so does not make you less warm or less likable. It is an act of kindness and self care.


""Turn the other cheek"" is only good advice if the person's conscience will kick in and they will immediately realize that they were in the wrong. Sometimes people will slap the other cheek. In this case, passivity is not the answer, and you will get help or fight back.
Sometimes, being firm is an act of kindness. For example, if your son is crying because he doesn't want to go to the doctor, capitulating will only hurt him: he won't get medical attention, and he'll learn that crying will get him out of anything he doesn't want to do. Tough love is okay in these circumstances.

, Whenever you see someone having a bad day or facing a problem, stop and think: ""If I were in that situation, how could someone help me?"" Offer help when someone is struggling, listen thoughtfully and patiently, and seek to understand before judging others.

You need to ask yourself certain questions to make this decision. Be as honest as possible with yourself.


Has your girlfriend cheated in the past? For some, cheating is a compulsive behavior that happens again and again. If the problem is less rooted in this specific relationship and more grounded in a problem your girlfriend has with fidelity that is not personal, the cheating may be easier to accept and get past.Why did your girlfriend cheat? While some might say cheating is cheating, end of story, the fact is the reasons behind infidelity mean a lot. A one night, purely physical slip up may be far easier to forgive than a longterm affair in which your girlfriend became emotionally attached to someone else. Try to put yourself in your girlfriend's shoes and question how you would have felt in her position.What was the state of your relationship when the cheating occurred? If the relationship was in a rough patch, and you knew your girlfriend was unhappy, cheating may be easier to understand. Were you two taking each other for granted? Did she need emotional needs filled outside the relationship? If so, can these problems be fixed or should you both sever ties and move on?;
, Educating yourself on the factors that encourage cheating can make understanding and forgiving your girlfriend easier. If your girlfriend has cheated on other partners, learn about sexual compulsion and its causes.


Compulsive sexual behavior is a term applied to a wide variety of sexuality activity that falls outside societal norms including some forms of infidelity. Infidelity is usually only considered a compulsive sexual behavior if it is a pattern of behavior that a person engaged in without thought and at great personal risk.If your girlfriend has cheated on partners in the past, she may be doing so compulsively. Once you've had time to calm down, ask your girlfriend whether she feels she has any control over her sexual impulses and if she gets any pleasure out of her sexual experiences. If the answer is no, she may have a disorder that requires psychiatric treatment.Remember, not all cheating is compulsive. It's important not to automatically define infidelity as a disorder. If your girlfriend cheated because of an issue in your relationship, or if she is polyamorous and is not interested in a monogamous relationship, accusing her of having a disorder can come off as insensitive. She might feel like you're being judgmental and ignoring other, more relevant issues that caused her to cheat.

, It can be difficult to sort through the emotional impact of cheating on your own. Reach out to friends and family members to help talk through and better understand your feelings.


Talk to friends and family members you trust, who you know will refrain from judgment. Tell them about what occurred and ask for emotional support. People may offer advice, but politely tell them you're merely trying to figure out your own feelings and do not need instructions on how to proceed.Do not be vindictive. It's okay to reach out to others, but do not tell your girlfriend's mother, best friend, or co-worker about your relationship issues. Pick people you had an existing relationship with before you got together with your girlfriend., Some people are polyamorous. This means they struggle to stay with a single partner and may want someone open to seeking sex and romance outside a single relationship. If your girlfriend falls into this category, consider whether or not you could handle an open relationship.


Polyamorous and open relationships come in many forms. Some people merely seek out sexual relationships outside of their boyfriend or girlfriend while others may want to have multiple sexual and romantic partners at the same time. Decide what form of an open relationship, if any, you are comfortable with before pursuing one.Communication is key to a successful open relationship. In the poly community, a lot of emphasis is put on discussing boundaries, respect, and expectations. If you want to try to open things up, make sure you and your girlfriend have many long talks about what an open relationship means for the two of you.Remember, there is nothing wrong with not wanting an open relationship. When it comes to monogamy, there is no wrong way to feel. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of an open relationship, pursuing one can be damaging to you. If you and your girlfriend have different ideas about monogamy, this may be a sign you're not compatible longterm.

, If you've just found out your girlfriend is cheating, you are probably very emotional. Give each other some space in wake of the revelation so you both have some alone time to think.


Your impulse may be to keep your girlfriend close by to make sure she does not cheat again. However, it's difficult to work through your emotions about a relationship when you're seeing your girlfriend every day.Use this time to reflect on what you want. What are you absolutely not willing to give up in a romantic relationship? Where would you be willing to change? Figure out your own wants and needs so you can address these the next time you see your girlfriend.

, You need to discuss what happened with your girlfriend. Whether you decide to work things out or not, an open and honest talk is important for closure.


Listen when your girlfriend talks, even if it's hard. Use verbal and non-verbal cues to show her you're paying attention. Keep eye contact, lean forward, nod and occasionally make a comment when there is a pause. Avoid noise barriers, such as choosing a loud coffee shop to converse. This can make effective communication difficult.Asking meaningful questions. What issues cause conflict between you and your girlfriend? What causes disappointment, pain? What kinds of things made you happy and helped you feel connected? How would you like communication to be different between you and your girlfriend?Be respectful. This will be a painful discussion for both of you and you need to converse in a civil, productive manner. Speak politely. Begin sentences with ""I"" instead of ""you"" to avoid sounding accusatory. Take turns speaking and try not to dwell on a topic for too long. If you've been discussing one issue for more than 15 minutes, it might be time to move on and revisit that topic later., Depending on why your girlfriend cheated, there might be issues regarding your relationship that need work. While this does not mean infidelity was your fault, it does mean if you're interested in salvaging things you might need to make adjustments on your end.


You need to understand why your girlfriend cheated. Even it may be painful to confront, there might have been something wrong with the relationship itself. You and your girlfriend need to find certain shared goals for your relationship, and this might mean you always have to change the way you do things.Change takes time. You have to realize, even if you're willing to make certain changes, things will feel different at first and it takes time and commitment to heal a damaged relationship., Ultimately, you need to decide whether or not you can forgive the cheating and move on.


Sometimes, needs or desires are mutually exclusive and cheating is often driven by this fact. If your girlfriend has different sexual desires or a different sexual appetite, the two of you may simply not be compatible. If you firmly believe in monogamy and your girlfriend wants an open relationship, it is also probably time to move on.Boredom is another factor that leads to relationships ending. Discovering new things about your partner is vital to a long lasting relationship, but if you've both stopped growing during the course of your romance it's a sign things are simply not working anymore. Lack of continued interest and personal growth are both signs a relationship does not have a future.Conversely, if you and your girlfriend are able to find a place where you both feel happy and comfortable, without compromising anyone's vital needs, you may be able to continue the relationship. However, move forward knowing that tension and lack of trust will be major issues after infidelity. It will take a long time for things to feel normal again.

, It's important for both you and your girlfriend to be tested for sexually transmitted infections after your girlfriend cheats.


People who engage in infidelity are often careless about engaging in safe sex. It's important to go to your doctor's office of a testing clinic to get a full STD screening.Ask your girlfriend to get tested as well. It's important you both have a clean bill of sexual health before you resume sexual activity, especially if you are not using condoms or other forms of barrier protection., See a therapist together as a couple if you want the relationship to continue after infidelity.


A therapist can help a couple work through difficult issues together. Having hard discussions in the presence of a trained therapist can help both you and your partner feel like your needs are being addressed in a calm, respectful manner. You can also discuss any questions you had about the cheating that you felt uncomfortable discussing with your girlfriend one on one.If your girlfriend is hesitant to see a therapist, see one yourself. Even without her presence, you can still work through some issues on your end., After cheating, the relationship will not be the same. Both you and your girlfriend need to work on forming a new relationship together.


Infidelity with underlie every argument for awhile, and you need to be able to consciously work to move past any bitterness you may feel. Obsessing over an affair is toxic to a healthy relationship. A therapist or counselor can help you get out of the trap of constantly thinking about your girlfriend's infidelity.Try to see things from a positive perspective. While the early innocence and trust is gone, you and your girlfriend have survived a major setback and are still functioning as a couple. This shows your relationship is strong and now you have the opportunity to build a new, healthier relationship."

Listen to the kind of language your partner uses.,
Nod as your partner speaks.,
Don’t rush to speak.,
Prime your partner.,
Ask your partner to tell their story in a different way.,
Tell an incorrect version of your partner’s alibi.,
Use open questions.,
Don’t push your partner too far.,
Avoid using an accusatory, cold tone.,
Express empathy for what your partner did.,
Get in their space.,
Don’t share all your information at once.,
Pretend you know exactly what’s going on.,
Let your partner fill in the blanks.,
React calmly when your partner confesses they were cheating.",How to Get Your Partner to Admit to Cheating," Cheaters tend to use different words when lying about their behavior than when they are telling the truth. Specifically, they will use words with low complexity, make few self-references, and offer more negative emotions in their speech.High-complexity language includes “exclusive” words (“except,” “but,” and “without”) and compound sentences. If your partner is cheating, they will probably avoid sentences with lots of information and complex language when offering an alibi.
Self-references are words like “me,” “mine,” and “my.” These words show ownership and personal responsibility for the story the liar is telling. Cheaters who are telling a lie about where they went or who they were with will be more likely to exclude these words when sharing a false alibi.
Words that express negativity or negative emotions include hate, sad, worthless, or enemy. These words tend to come up more frequently during stories that are untrue because the liar will feel temporary guilt and discomfort when lying (unless they are truly sociopathic).;
, Nodding is a sign of encouragement and agreement. If you nod your head as your partner speaks, they will be more willing to continue speaking, and feel at ease. With luck, they will divulge that they cheated.At the very least, you should be able to get them to provide more clues about their whereabouts and recent activities.

, Many people think that the best way to extract a confession of infidelity is by browbeating their partner with endless questions. However, this will not give your partner the space they need to admit what they’ve done. When broaching the topic of cheating, allow them time to speak. Don’t try to respond to each of their statements immediately with another question, accusation, or statement of your own., Priming is a psychological technique in which you frame a person’s thoughts or behavior in a certain way by employing particular words or phrases. Your partner will be more cooperative and willing to help you if you prime them to admit they are honest. Simply ask your partner casually, “How honest would you say you are?”Your partner should reply that they’re very honest (especially with you).
Most people want to imagine themselves as honest, and by helping your partner remind themselves that they are honest (or see themselves as honest) will make them more willing to admit they’re cheating.

, If your partner is trying to hide their infidelity, they will tell many lies about where they are going or where they’ve been, things they’ve done, and people they’ve been with. In order to get your partner to confess – or to gather evidence that your partner is cheating – ask your partner to share their alibi in a different way.Liars often cannot tell their story in reverse (ordering the events of the story from last to first), and have a hard time telling their story from a starting point in the middle of the story, too.Encourage your partner to recap their story, using the last thing they said happened. Then ask, “What did you say happened right before that?” If they say they can’t remember, or if they offer a different sequence of events than what they initially reported, point out their error. Ask, for instance, “Are you sure that’s where you were?” or “What really happened?”

, If your partner offers you a story about where they were and what they did, retell their story incorrectly, and add some damning detail about their cheating behavior. For instance, imagine you think your partner is having an affair with a coworker. When you ask them where they’ve been, they might say they went out for drinks with their friends. In reply, you could say, “Oh, you went bowling with your friends and coworker?” They might reply, “I didn’t go bowling with my friends.”In this case, your partner’s partial denial suggests that the other part of your statement – that they were out with their coworker – is true.
Your partner will probably catch the fact that they failed to correct the second part of your statement and quickly cover themselves
This works best if you pretend to be deeply interested in something else like reading a book or watching a film.

, Open questions are those which require more than simple yes/no answers. Open questions force your partner to start talking, and the more information they provide, the more evidence you’ll have to draw on later when you try to demonstrate to your partner that you know what’s going on.Open questions will also make your partner comfortable, which could lull them into revealing – directly or indirectly – that they were cheating.
Listen for small details that you can verify later. Check these details out. For instance, talk to the people your partner says they were with to find out if your partner’s story checks out.

, If you ask too many direct, pointed questions, your partner will probably clam up and prove unwilling to confess that they are cheating. It is normal to ask a few questions about your partner’s day when you both arrive home from work, such as, “What have you been up to?” or “Why are you home so late?” But if you demonstrate that you’re suspicious before you think your partner is ready to crack, you’ll only push them to frustration, and end up getting only sarcastic or obviously untrue answers.Stick to natural patterns of conversation. Use the conversation patterns you and your partner had before you began to suspect they were cheating as a baseline for normal conversation.
On the whole, avoid pointed questions like “What were you doing?”, “Who were you with?”, and “Where were you?”

, Getting nasty or passive-aggressive (or even just aggressive) with your partner will not inspire them to be more open with you. Instead, adopt a light, non-judgmental, and curious tone when asking your partner questions. This will prevent them from suspecting that you suspect them of cheating. If your partner starts to believe you’re onto them, they might take extra steps to conceal their actions and throw you off the trail.Stay calm and level-headed when asking questions of your partner. If you are feeling emotional or physically enraged, you may not be ready to have the conversation yet. This can be a hard topic to approach, so wait until you are able to be calm.

, If your partner thinks that you understand and sympathize with their behavior, they will feel safe. This will make them more likely to share with you that they cheated.Put your partner at ease.Offer some excuse as to why you can understand what they did. For instance, you might say, “I know I’m gone a lot for work. I could understand if you’ve been seeing someone else.”
Offer encouragement with phrases like, “I’ve always been honest with you” or “Please just be honest if you’re cheating on me. I want to know the real you.” You could also say, “It’s okay, I won’t be upset if you cheated on me.”

, Adopting an empathetic, gently approach is usually best, but some people won’t confess unless you turn up the heat a bit and show that you’re in control. Don’t be aggressive or domineering – just make them a bit uncomfortable. Get inside their personal space.Bring your chair up more closely to your partner than you normally would.
Take a small step toward them if you’re standing.
Lean across the table when you speak.
These subtle behaviors will shift the dynamic in your favor and could push them to spill the beans about what they’ve done.
If your partner is violent or if you believe that they will become violent, avoid taking these steps. You may want to call The National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for advice.

, If you know that your partner was not at the bar last night, don’t begin a conversation about their whereabouts by saying, “I know you weren’t at the bar last night.” This tips your hand and makes it easier for them to deny they were cheating.Instead, wait for them to fall into the trap of providing an excuse, then compare their story with information you definitely know about where they were not seen and who they were not with. This will allow you to deflate their alibi.

, If you think you have substantial evidence that your partner is cheating but aren’t 100% positive, you could make your case against them directly in an effort to get them to confess. Find a quiet moment when you’re both home together. Confront your partner by saying something like, “I know what’s going on,” or “I think we should talk about .”You could preface the conversation by offering your partner the chance to confess by asking, “Is there anything you want to tell me?”
Bluffing can be effective when trying to get your partner to admit they are cheating, but if they don’t buy your bluff, they won’t admit what’s really going on. Plus, afterwards, they will feel more confident that you know nothing about their activities.
If you bluff your partner but they truly aren’t cheating on you, you’ll look quite foolish.

, When bluffing, guide your partner into telling you what they did by offering details with a narrative built on facts you know for sure. For instance, you could say, “Every night this week you’ve been home really late. You told me you were with friends, but you weren’t, were you?” Then supply the narrative you believe (or know) happened. Your partner should begin to make corrections and fill in details about what really occurred., Even if you’ve long suspected your partner is cheating, it can be heartbreaking and emotionally jarring when they finally admit it. Despite the emotionally charged nature of the situation, do not start yelling or physically abusing your partner. These behaviors are not just immature and unkind – they could also be grounds for legal action.To react calmly, breathe in slowly and deliberately through your nose when hear that your partner is cheating. Exhale through your nose and ensure your exhalation lasts longer than your inhalation.
Excuse yourself to another room or go for a walk to clear your head if you need to.
Call a friend or family member to let them know what’s happening. The best way you can cope with the realization your partner is cheating on you is to get support from people who care about you.

Spend time around groups of good talkers.,
Take note of whether the conversation is from a first, second or third person perspective.",How to Be Good at Conversations1," This way you can figure out good conversation moves naturally. It lets you sponge up the ability easily with little effort. If good talkers are hard to find, it means the people in your zone need your help.;
, Conversations often flow from one perspective to another - you may be discussing a political situation (third) and then give your opinion (first) and then ask what somebody else thinks (second), but keeping an ear on the predominant perspective is a good way to maintain the flow. If everyone is focused on discussing somebody's relationship dramas and you keep bringing the conversation around to your own, people may get annoyed, unless it contributes something to overall point of the discussion.


Is the group sharing personal stories that relate to the topic? For example when discussing food, people may recount travel stories about interesting places they've eaten - sharing personal stories is usually a first person (""I"") perspective.
Are you all discussing a particular situation that someone in the group is going through? For example you are helping a friend out with a relationship problem. This is often done in second person (""you"") - though the person you are discussing will be speaking in first (""I"").
Are you discussing concepts, politics, culture or other topics not directly relating to the people in the group? For example you are talking about a new album that has been released, or something you saw in the news. This often takes the form of third person (""they"").

"
"
Position yourself comfortably.,
Introduce yourself to the group.,
Start a conversation yourself.",How to Be Good at Conversations2," At the start everyone settles into a comfortable distance from one another. Aim to stand or sit as close to them as they are to you.

, It is customary for each person to get the chance to introduce themselves. It can be a nod of the head or a simple Hello, and its nice to give your name if you wish. Standard phrases like ‘how are you?’ and ‘I’m fine, what about you?’ are often used to build up good feeling among the group. Experiment with phrases like this. Conversations follow a general pattern: the greeting, the body of the conversation and the farewell. The main body follows the greeting.


People now take it in turns to talk. Appreciate and support the conversation as it unfolds. Its perfectly all right, and actually valuable, to remain in the listener role for as long as you wish.
The farewell: After a while, the conversation will come to an end and people will say goodbye to each other.

,


Create a comfortable atmosphere of approachability. Do this with your posture, your position, your tone of voice and a friendly face.
Guide the bubble of atmosphere toward the people you wish to converse with.
Invite people into the conversation. Do this with an Opening Question. Make the opening question easy and comfortable to answer. Or, make an opening observation about some feature of the situation you both share.
Encourage and support the conversation. (Rather like being the host at a mini-party.)

"
"
If offered a speaking turn by one of the others, use the opportunity well.,
Say what you feel moved to say.,
Unleash your powers of evocation.,
Discover that ideas come to you as you speak.",How to Be Good at Conversations3," For example they might ask you a question. Or, the offer to speak might be made through a gesture, non-verbally.


Invite yourself to take a speaking turn. There are always small pauses in the conversation as the current speaker reaches the end of her point. Take advantage of the pause to launch into your contribution. However, someone else might try to start talking at the same moment. There is usually a little friendly rivalry before the group decides who should continue the turn. It might be you!

, As we listen to the ebb and flow of conversation, we find ourselves stirred with feelings, ideas and reactions. Respond to these inner promptings but, at the same time, relate to what has gone before - blend in and blend out.

, Conversation is very different to written language because it’s like music. It has rhythm, melody, harmony, spontaneity and movement. Qualities that are just as important as the lyrics. Orchestrate your powers of evocation by variations of voice-tone, face expressions and hand gestures.

, But if they don’t, use conversation moves that let you hold the floor whilst you catch up with what you want to say, for instance: stock phrases, repetitions, ""um""s, ""ah""s, and other exclamations, hesitations and questions out loud to yourself. Certain teachers used to admonish us about these things (think before you speak); but they were misguided. If your having fun, it doesn’t matter whether it always makes sense. In fact it’s even sometimes necessary to pass through phases of non-sense in order to reach higher levels of sense.

Approach the group.,
Nudge a little nearer and see if they welcome you.,
Help to support the conversation by listening to the others and appreciating their contributions.

After a while, offer a gesture of farewell and leave.

Learn the structure of a conversation.,

Don’t feel obliged to follow everything.,

Include the quieter members of the group.,
Remember the old show business adage, ‘Best to leave them wanting more.’ Less information is appreciated––it gives others the space to talk and it gives you something more to say next time.",How to Be Good at Conversations5," This is simple: The greeting. The body of the conversation. The farewell. Greetings and farewells vary from simple to elaborate depending on the culture, but they follow a standard pattern. Both greetings and farewells are opportunities to swap names and to create a good feeling by wishing people well.

, After your greeting, there is no need to launch into an impressive monologue! Its much better to spend time listening to the ongoing conversation. You will pick up clues about people's interests, and you will automatically begin to pick up the rhythm of the conversation as it flows from person to person.

, It’s easy to be so overwhelmed by what everyone else is saying that you get mesmerized and no longer able to follow your own train of thought. Learn some breakout strategies to give yourself a rest and time to put together your own thoughts.

, Exclamations are expressions of feeling. When people agree with what is being said, they might call out “yes” or similar vocalizations to that effect. When they disagree, they might make other vocalizations that express this.

, Examples of conversational purpose:


Promoting fun and conviviality.
Investigating a topic.
Giving out information.
Encouraging or persuading people to do something.

, Murmuring along with everyone else is an enjoyable and low risk way of being in the conversation until you build more confidence. Asking people questions about things they want to talk about is very much appreciated and also low risk. Talking about yourself can often feel high risk but it is safe when you cover standard topics. Moving onto very personal topics, political or religious topics increases the risk of disagreement and embarrassment but it doesn’t mean you should always avoid them. Try to match the level of depth and seriousness of the other conversationalists more or less.

, To get the most out of a conversation it's important to hear from everyone, not just the dominant personalities. It doesn't mean demanding they speak or peppering them with questions, but just looking at them as you speak and making them feel they are included. Leaving a bit of time after someone has finished speaking also allows a less confident person to have their say without having to jump in too quickly.


If you notice someone is speaking but not including the quieter people, you can direct their attention to them as they are speaking to you. For example, if you have just finished talking it's common for the next speaker to direct their attention to you, since they may be addressing a point you just made. If they are focused too heavily on you however, it's possible to direct their gaze to other people in the group simply by looking at them yourself. It works because when you are looking into someone's eyes and they look somewhere else, it's natural to follow their gaze.

, The mystery can't hurt you either!

The friend should be the same sex as your partner. Go around town, and take pictures together. Post the pictures where your ex can see them.This revenge works best if you do some romantic-looking activities together, such as having a candlelit dinner together or walking hand-in-hand through a park;
, Advertise your happiness on social media. Even if you're not feeling happy, try faking happiness for the photos. Post pictures of yourself out with friends having drinks or hiking through the woods. Include smiling selfies with local landmarks or in local museums. Anything that shows you are living a great life is game for posting on social media.This step shows the other person what they've given up. Plus, faking happiness is one step in moving towards happiness.
In addition, try to hide your pain. While this one can be difficult, it can make cheaters upset, as many cheaters are ego-driven, so they want to be in the middle. If you blow up at the person, you're feeding that person's ego. Try calmly breaking up with the person and then getting on with your life., That is, once you've moved on from your partner, that person has to learn to live by themselves again, which they may not be equipped to do. They have to pick up the pieces, pay the bills, and be the one known as the cheating partner. Watching them try to pick up the pieces can be pretty good revenge., Once you've decided to move on, don't take the person's calls. Unless you really, truly want to make up with the person, it's best to any communication from them. Once again, you don't want to feed their ego or be persuaded by their rhetoric. Of course, it may do some good to keep the person around on social media, so they can see how great your life is. That way, the person knows what he or she has lost., Being cheated on comes with a whole range of emotions. You probably expect anger and sadness, but you may be surprised that you also feel shame and emptiness. You may find yourself annoyed or possessive. You may even feel relief because you have finally figured out what's going on with your relationship. All of these feelings are perfectly normal.The first step in dealing with your emotions is figuring out just what you're feeling. Try spending some time journaling to help you identify your emotions.Discussing it with a friend can also help you figure out what you're feeling.Don't be afraid to talk to a therapist. If you feel like your emotions are overwhelming you, it's perfectly normal to accept professional help., You may be thinking that it's partially your fault that the person cheated. While you may be partially responsible for letting the relationship go, it was the other person's choice to cheat.However, you can learn from what happened. In the future, trust yourself when the relationship doesn't feel quite right, and take steps to make it better. For instance, stop to talk to your partner when you feel like something has gone wrong., This step may feel counter-intuitive to getting revenge. However, holding on to your anger only makes you unhappy and keeps you from moving on.Forgiveness starts with identifying your anger and feelings toward the person, which you've already worked on in this section.The next step is to see if you can find why the person did what he or she did. That means trying to find compassion for the partner to figure out how he or she got to the point of cheating.Forgiving the person doesn't mean excusing what he or she did, nor does it mean you must stay with him or her. It does mean you have to think about the person as a person, not as this entity who hurt you., In the wake of breaking it off with a cheater, you may find yourself wanting to wallow in your grief. When you're down-and-out, you may also find that you're not eating properly, sleeping well, or getting proper exercise. Taking care of yourself is essential to helping you heal and move on.Try to stick to a regular eating schedule, and be sure to make some healthy choices.Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and fish in your diet.
Give yourself extra rest. Not only will you need extra rest, but you may find it harder to fall asleep. Therefore, you'll need extra time for sleeping.Try to get some exercise in, as well. Take a walk outside in the sunlight. Go for a swim. Play a game of basketball with your friends. Take steps to get up and get moving., Pick up old activities you may not have had time for in a relationship. For instance, hang out with your friends or pick up an old hobby. Find time to volunteer. Not only will these activities help you move on, but they will make you happier as a person. Happiness is the best revenge.Don't be afraid to snap a picture or two to post where your ex can see it.

, Once you've given yourself a little while to heal, pick up dating again. For one, trying to find romance again can make you happier. In addition, it can show your ex that you've truly moved on, and that what or he or she did lost you for good.If you're unsure how to get started again, consider using a dating site. You must pay for some sites, but others are free. Dating sites offer a way to connect with people with similar interests to you.

, Sometimes, when you're in a relationship, you put off doing the big things you've always longed to do. Now is the time to go do those things. You have your life wide open right now, and the possibilities are endless.For instance, take a vacation to a far-flung country that you've always dreamed of. Go back to school for the degree you've always wanted. Get that pet you've longed for but couldn't have because your partner was allergic. Move to a new city. Get a new job or start a new career. Whatever it is that makes your heart beat a little faster, that is what you should do.
Once again, it doesn't hurt to post a few pictures of your fabulous adventures where your ex can see them.

, One way to get back at the cheater is to tell the truth about what happened. That doesn't mean you should go into extreme detail. Rather, if one of your friends or even one of your ex-partner's family members ask, tell the truth, that your partner cheated on you with someone else. Eventually, the bad karma will get back to your partner in the form of a tongue lashing from a mutual friend.However, this revenge can backfire if the person you're talking to is fiercely loyal to the other person. They may just see it as you spreading lies around.

, In seven states, a married person can sue the person on the side for damages. You can try this (legal) revenge in Hawaii, Illinois, South Dakota, Utah, New Mexico, Mississippi, and North Caroline.Generally, you need to either prove criminal conversation or alienation of affection. With criminal conversation, you'll need to prove that your spouse is having an affair generally through the use of a private investigator. With alienation of affection, you just need to prove that the person on the outside moved your marriage from a loving one to one of alienation and that you were harmed by that situation somehow.Contact a divorce lawyer for more information., If you're sure your partner is cheating, you can post that information in a public forum. For instance, you can post it on a social media platform as a blog post or add pictures to drive home the story.Alternatively, you could go with a paper version and put up flyers in your neighborhood. That way, your spouse has to live with the consequences in a public way.

, This one is good to try if there's a big holiday or anniversary coming up. Instead of outing the person right away, print out any proof you have of the affair. Wrap it up in boxes to hide the fact that it's not a present, then have the person open them on the big day., If you can find a number for the person your partner is cheating with, try calling that person up. That person may have no idea that your partner is with someone else, and letting him or her know it may be pretty good revenge."

Question and reframe self-blaming thoughts.,
Avoid negative thinking.,
Regain a sense of control.,
Establish boundaries about what you want.,
Remember that you are worthy of love.,
Set measurable goals to move forward and regain confidence.",How to Get Self Confidence After a Husband Cheats1," Your husband did not cheat because you weren't good enough, so try to avoid dwelling on what you could or should have done to prevent it. If these thoughts arise, then take a moment to challenge them by asking questions and then rephrase the thought into something more realistic.


When you start to have a self-blaming thought, then try taking a moment to question the thought and reframe it. For example, if you notice yourself thinking, “This is all my fault!” then you might ask yourself questions like, “Is that really true? Could I have prevented this or am I just being hard on myself? What is my evidence? What might be a more realistic way of thinking about this?”
Then you could rephrase the thought into something like, “I wish I could have prevented his actions, but there is no way that I could have. I am not to blame for what happened.”
Try to remind yourself that your husband's actions are his, not yours. Don't assume that you are the cause of his actions.;
, Try to avoid thinking about the betrayal 24/7 and instead focus on re-establishing your positive emotions about yourself. When you find yourself thinking about the negative aspects of your relationship or yourself, take a step back and breath.When a negative thought is triggered, it may make you feel sad. For example, you see a picture of you and your husband after knowing he has cheated, and then you think about how you aren't worthy of love. You feel sad and upset.
Focus on replacing those negative thoughts that are triggered with positive ones, or at least reframing the situation. For example, you see a picture of you and your husband after knowing he has cheated, and then you think, I know that there were some good times, but I deserve better than this. You feel calm and confident.

, You don't have to feel powerless in this situation. Regain control of your self-confidence by finding out what you want and who you are. Your husband should not control the nature of your relationship. Both of you determine this.


Focus on what is going well in your life. Identify areas that are going well, and things you can be proud of.
Address things that are within your control that you feel you can change for the better. Focus on your needs.
Prioritize yourself.

, Whether you are staying together or considering separation, you may need some space to reflect on the situation. Tell your husband or other family members in your life that this is a time of reflection and evaluation. Tell them clearly and concisely that you need to figure out your needs and what may need to change.These boundaries may mean that you want to do something in the evening for yourself. Maybe you find someone to watch the kids, while you go to a place that is quiet and relaxing.
To set a boundary, try saying something like, “I need some time to think through what has happened, so I am going to spend a few of my evenings alone in my office over the next few weeks. When I have the door shut, please do not disturb me, okay?”

, You may feel angry, sad, anxious, or frustrated about what happened, but avoid seeing what you're feeling as permanent. Know that you are worthy and deserve to be loved and respected.


Make a list of positive attributes. In private, consider writing a list of positive, loveable attributes about you. From that list, focus on three attributes to write more about. Use a few paragraphs to explore who you are, using these three attributes. Use this writing exercise as a statement of self-affirmation., You are strong and you can overcome this difficult time. While it may be difficult to feel confidence, sometimes it takes motivation to try even when you don't feel it in your heart. Consider trying to act more confident until you begin to believe it more and more within yourself.Set goals to feel confident with things that make you feel good about you. Do these things for yourself and no one else. These should be goals based on what matters to you, rather than your husband, family, or friends.
Identify areas where you think you already have competence, and then build from there. For example, let's say you enjoy running, but only for a mile or two. Think about an achievable goal like running in a 5K race in your community.

Connect with family and friends for support.,
Do things that you enjoy for yourself.,
Discover a ""new"" you.,
Let out your emotions creatively.,
Find support groups.",How to Get Self Confidence After a Husband Cheats2," You will feel more confident about yourself when reaching out to friends and family outside of your husband. Get their advice and perspective on the situation. Listen for any advice about things that they've been through.


While this may seem awkward, ask a friend or family member to name three positive traits about you. Instead of the conversation only dwelling on your cheating partner, use this time to bolster your self-esteem. Get them to open up about the good things you have to offer.
Explain to your friends and family that their reassurance is invaluable. Consider saying, ""This has been a rough time for me. Your words of encouragement and support are very important as I cope with what to do. Your support matters a great deal.""

, Take time to do things just for you, not for your kids, family, friends, or spouse. While it may seem ""selfish,"" in truth making time for yourself to do the things you love will help to heal you--mind, body and spirit. Consider doing these things:


Take a weekend trip on your own or with a supportive friend. Don't bring the kids or spouse. Let loose and enjoy a little adventure.
Get active. Go to an exercise or fitness class. Go outdoors. Take a swim. Make being healthy a priority.
Treat yourself with a massage. Go to a day spa. Take a hot bubble bath. Unwind with activities that make you feel relaxed.
Do fun and adventurous things. Make your ""bucket list"" a priority. Find new people to connect with and who make you feel happy.

, When you're feeling less desirable, sometimes a change in your look or wardrobe can help to boost your self-confidence. If you've been in a rut, and are doing the same, old routine with your hair, makeup, clothes, and accessories, then consider trying some new things.


Get a new hairdo. Try a new hair color.
Change your makeup routine.
Get new clothes that make you feel young and sexy.
Find accessories that make you feel special and unique.

, Learn to let out your emotions in healthy and creative ways. With a cheating husband, you may feel betrayed, abandoned, traumatized, or unlovable. Use creative self-expression as a way to heal. This can help you to gain a better sense of self confidence and understanding of what you need in life and love.Write in a journal for about five minutes each day. Let out what you're feeling or thinking. Use this time to evaluate how you feel.
Create art. Take an art class. Draw. Paint. Sculpt. This will help you to de-stress and find clarity.
Get crafty or build something. Maybe you're handy around the house? Find a home remodel project that gets your creative juices flowing. Whatever it is, it should feel enjoyable and cathartic.

, Sometimes the best way to feel more confident is to know that you're not alone. Other people have faced cheating husbands, and have still lived happily after the fact. Whether or not you plan to stay or leave your husband, you may find emotional validation through support groups.


Consider finding a counselor in your area that can provide a referral for an infidelity or relationship support group. They may be able to find options in your area.
You may find support groups also online or through your place of worship.
You can also look more broadly for support through self-esteem and self-confidence support groups. There are many of these that focus on depression, social anxiety, feelings of loss, and body image issues, depending on what area you wish to work on for yourself.

Repair a lost emotional connection.,
Feel loved and sexy.,
Evaluate if your needs are being met.,
Arrange an open policy on emails, phones, and social media.,
Consider individual or couples counseling.",How to Get Self Confidence After a Husband Cheats3," After an act of betrayal such as cheating, you may feel torn about whether to continue a relationship with your husband or anyone else. Be confident that you can be stronger, happier, and more fulfilled in your relationships. You will feel more self-confident when you realize that you can have control about the future of your relationships. Ask yourself: Do you feel like your distrust of your husband is getting in the way of moving forward?
Even if your husband may not be motivated to change, do you feel ready to move on, with or without him? Understand what may be hindering you from change.

, Cheating isn't simply about sex. It is often about a loss of love and emotional connection. Whether you trying to rebuild your marriage or find someone new, the emotional connection is key to a healthy and lasting relationship. It will make you more confident about yourself and your partner.If you have felt distant with your husband, address this feeling with him openly. Learn to air out your emotions in a clear and concise way. Be willing to listen to his perspective without assuming you're to blame for his actions. Talk with him one-on-one in a neutral setting, possibly away from the kids, work, or family.
Do you feel able to rebuild an emotional connection? While you may not feel ready now, believe that you can be happier when you communicate effectively with your partner.

, Figure out what you need to feel loved and attractive. Your husband may have one view, and you may have another. Identify what things make you feel sexy and appreciated, and communicate that in a clear way. See how your husband responds. See if both sides are willing to work to make each other feel loved.


If you don't see the beauty within yourself, then now is the time to find that. You don't need a man to find that. It comes from within you.

, As you consider what the future holds for you, your self-confidence, and your love life. Think about how your self-confidence may be tied to feelings of validation, understanding, and satisfaction. When your relationship needs are met, you feel those things. So, ask yourself these questions:Do you feel appreciated?
Do you feel safe?
Do you feel understood?

, Rebuilding trust can be easier if you have some certainty that your husband is not continuing to communicate with the person or persons he had an affair with. If you have not already agreed to an open policy on emails, text messages, social media accounts, and any other forms of communication that he might use to communicate with people, then bring it up.Try saying something like, “Apparently, it will be easier to rebuild trust after infidelity if I can have access to your emails, phone, and social media accounts for at least a few weeks. Is this something you are willing to try?”
Keep in mind that if he is unwilling to share these things with you, rebuilding trust could take longer and you may deal with some suspicion during this time.

, If you are having difficulty with trust, love, and respect, find a third-party that can help to provide some perspective. Therapists and counselors provide an empathetic look on what is troubling you, your self-esteem, and your relationship.If you are trying to make the marriage work, ask your husband to join you for couples counseling. See if he is willing to participate in the process. Be wary if he rejects this idea, or thinks he ""doesn't need counseling.""
Consider going to counseling to focus on your needs and feelings. Counselors can help to provide healthy coping strategies and greater insight into your emotions.
Find providers that are covered under your health insurance. There may also be low or no-cost options in your community or through your place of worship.

Take care of yourself.",How to Get over a Guy Who Is Using You for Sex," If someone is clearly only using you for sex, you should not keep reaching out to them. If more of a relationship was going to develop, it would have by now. Once you realize you're not getting what you want from a situation, stop contacting the person in question.Do not see the person at social events, text him, or call him. If you feel the temptation to reach out to him, do something for yourself or hang out with another friend. You might make an agreement with another friend that whenever you feel tempted to contact him, you contact your friend instead.
In some cases, it's not possible to completely cut someone off. If you work or go to school with the guy, for example, you may need to see him. If this is the case, keep interactions short and to the point. Do not engage in small talk.;
, If a guy is using you for sex, he may text or call late at night. You may get a text message at 1 AM, for example, asking if you're still awake. This is a sign the guy wants to come over for sex. Do not answer these texts. It will only prolong the situation, resulting in you getting hurt more. Start simply ignoring this kind of contact.If the guy keeps sending these types of texts after you've ignored them for awhile, text him something like, ""I don't want this kind of relationship anymore. Please stop texting me.""
When someone is used to a certain behavior and getting a certain reward and this suddenly stops working, they will often try harder for a time before giving up. Stand firm. They will eventually move on.

, The social media connection can be difficult to sever. Oftentimes, we hang on to past lovers via things like Facebook and Twitter; however, research indicates checking up on someone online will only prolong your anguish. Block or delete him on social media profiles, or at least unfollow him.Sometimes, it's very tempting to check an ex's social media; however, doing so will not result in you feeling better, so do your best to not indulge in the practice. Each time you are tempted to click on his profile, remind yourself it will only result in you feeling bad and set you back in your efforts to get over him.
You will probably slip up a few times in regards to checking your ex's profile. If this happens, do not beat yourself up. Remember that no one is perfect.
Consider taking a break from social media altogether until you are feeling stronger. This can help you focus on other activities and practice good self-care.
Another option is to just delete these apps from your phone, leaving only the less convenient option of using your computer.

, No one likes to feel bad after being rejected; however, it's impossible to bounce back from being hurt without experiencing some negativity. In the wake of ceasing contact with the guy, allow yourself to feel your feelings instead or denying or or trying to bury them.Remember that being sad sometimes is a normal part of life. People may tell you to cheer up or go get over it long before you are ready.
It's okay to be sad for a little while. Try turning off the television and eliminating other distractions. Take a few minutes each day to simply experience your feelings, good and bad. This will allow you to heal. Try journaling or talking to a trusted friend to help you process these emotions. It is important to honor your feelings — this will help you heal.

, You won't be able to get over a guy unless you accept what your relationship was. If you're still indulging the notion that he was maybe interested in more than sex, you're only prolonging the grieving period. Own up to the fact you were used, even if it's painful, and this is not someone who will ever offer you a relationship.In the wake of rejection, people often have unrealistic thoughts about the importance of a relationship. You may find yourself thinking everything would be easier if he had not rejected you. Remind yourself there's no such thing as perfect.
What would have happened if you had gotten together in a more romantic sense? There would still have been difficulties and fights, and you may very well have broken up. The fact is, the guy was not interested in more than sex and, even if he were, he may not have made a very good partner.

, In the wake of rejection, it's easy to spend time ruminating over what you did ""wrong."" You may think things like, ""Why doesn't he want to be with me? What's wrong with me?"" Try to ignore these types of thoughts. The fact is, there are many reasons someone may not feel for another person romantically. It likely has little to do with you.There are many reasons, most of which are not personal, that a guy may have not had romantic interest in you. Maybe he liked you and was attracted to you, but felt like you were on different paths in life. Maybe he's not in a place where he can handle a romantic relationship. Maybe he simply prefers a different type of woman for romances than he does for casual encounters.
Whatever the reason, it probably has nothing to do with you as a person. You might have rejected people before and it likely wasn't because there was something wrong with them. They simply were not your type.
It can be helpful to think of this as one experience in the journey of life — not as something absolute. It is easier to deal with feelings of regret if you feel that they serve a purpose.

, Sometimes, it can be helpful to remember the things you disliked about someone when trying to get over a romantic rejection. Even embracing small flaws can remind you the relationship, and the guy, were not perfect.Think about everything about him that bothered you. Maybe he talked about himself too much. Maybe he returned texts using brief, one word answers. Maybe you didn't like the same books or movies.
You can also focus on petty things. Maybe you hated his haircut or he never clipped his toenails.
Write these down and review them regularly. You may even post them on your mirror or somewhere you will see them frequently. This will help keep you from idealizing the relationship.

, When you start to feel angry or bitter, take note of your feelings. You don't want to harbor feelings of resentment. While it's okay to think about things that bothered you, do not let these feelings translate into bitter, mean thoughts. Such thoughts should be translated to neutral assessments of the situation.For example, you think something like, ""He's such a jerk. I was way too good for him."" Rephrase that in neutral terms for a more realistic evaluation of the situation. For example, ""We clearly wanted different things and were on different paths.""

, If you want to keep busy, it may be easier to do so once you get negative feelings out of your head. Get a pen and paper and jot down what you're feeling for a little bit each day. Then, once your feelings are out, you can focus your energy elsewhere.Make a list of everything he did to disappoint you. For example, write things like, ""He never held my hand in public"" and ""He didn't want to call me his girlfriend.""
Once you're done, set the list aside and try to focus your energy somewhere else.

, In the wake of a breakup, you may find yourself constantly thinking about what went wrong and why. It can be helpful to have new goals. This will help you stay busy and avoid thinking about him.It is important to strike a balance between activity/distraction and rest/reflection. Thinking about it too much can result in depression, but running away from it can keep you from healing.
Think about something you always wanted to do. For example, did you always want to take up running? Try developing a workout routine that will teach you to run.
People often become obsessive over past lovers. Sometimes, the easiest way to beat one obsession is to replace it with another.

, Try to stay present instead of lingering over what happened in the past. At any given moment, keep your mind on what you're feeling and experiencing right now.Try to enjoy the small day to day things. Even something as simple as eating a great lunch should be savored.
If you find yourself thinking about your ex, stop and think something like, ""That was then. I'm going to focus on what I'm doing and how I'm feeling right now.""
You can use grounding techniques to get off the hamster wheel of thinking about him and bring you into the present. Look around and name five things you see. Five colors. Five textures. Close your eyes and identify what you hear or smell.

, Self care is important, especially after someone hurt you. Do not neglect the normal rituals of eating right, exercising, and caring for yourself overall.Keep up with personal hygiene. Even if you feel like lingering in bed all day, get up, shower, and brush your teeth.
Stay on track with your exercise routine as best as you can. If you're feeling really down, reduce your routine. For example, go for a brisk walk instead of a jog.
Eat right. Binging on junk food may be tempting when you're feeling down, but it's unlikely to make you feel better.

Take space.,
Reflect on what you saw.,
Decide whether or not the relationship is worth salvaging.,
Forgive him.,
The only way to trust is to trust.,
Call friends and family to hang out.,
Do 'not stalk the females he cheated on you with.,
After you've had adequate space from each other sit down and discuss where to go from here.,
Set boundaries.

,
Determine the motive for cheating.,
Do not tell everyone you know and do not post anything about it on social media.",How to Forgive a Cheating Boyfriend," You are going to be flooded with very deep conversational topics. This may seem counter intuitive, but do not engage in any conversation right away. The most you should really say is, (in the most sane voice level), is how hurt you are and how you are going to take some space from him. Why space? Because, men need space when they think. You are both emotionally charged and no matter what agreement or conclusion you come to, it won't be valid because emotionally charged conversations hardly ever hold weight long term. So take space, right away. This will also prevent things from escalating into a potentially dangerous situation. Cheating has caused people act very dramatically and intensely, it carries much built up resentment and anger. Again, walk away for now.


While you are away, avoid lengthy texting and phone conversations that lead to eventual phone tag.;
, Did you see any warning signs? Men who have a hard time dealing with depression, major life changes, death, or money issues tend to cheat. But there is also something else that may be causing him to cheat. Maybe it was something about you. Have you been emotionally unstable or rude? Have you pulled away sexually? There are no actual justifications for cheating, but there are triggers. When a man feels as though you are not trying to get ready for him, please him, make him happy, he will naturally sometimes seek it else where. Once a man is in this fragile state it will not take much to swoon him. Which plays back to why the girl is less attractive typically with low moral standards. He just needs the attention, and if you aren't giving him any, unfortunately, it will be received else where. This is not all men, but it is an explanation for the ones who do cheat.


If you feel like maybe you've been verbally abusive to him, neglectful sexually, emotionally unavailable, not trying to get ready for your dates, and giving up your typically funny jokes if that suits you, it's time you get in touch with yourself. You should seek counseling if you feel like you've fallen off your normal self. You could be experiencing depression. Seek a counselor. If you constantly put yourself down to a man from low self-esteem, he will recluse and seek more confident women.

, Only you can decide whether or not this man is the one who makes you happy and could continue to do so in the future.

, Forgiveness is more than just pretending it didn't happen. It's more than ignoring the hurt. It's an actual process. You will never be able to brush hurt and anger and resentment under the rug for long, it always comes back out. If the pain is severe enough counseling is strongly recommended. Being cheated on can bring up past hurt and pain from previous relationships and even childhood. Once you decide to forgive you are completely banned from catty comment making and rude snappy remarks. You cannot and should not ever bring it up as ammo for any fight or argument. This takes time, so do not say you are okay if you are not. Develop some trust as you forgive. Remember it's a process.

, You must trust your boyfriend again. Let him go. Let him be free. Give him another chance. If you are going to forgive then do so in such a way that makes him feel grateful that he has you again. No leash, no check-ins, no non-sense. Let him go. If he cheats again, then you know it's not meant to be. He could also need professional help for a love/sex addiction. (It's not likely but it's possible.) You have been cheated on and you deserve to be happy and no amount of check-ins will erase what he did to you. So do not stress yourself out by trying to control his every move, it simply is not possible.

, Get away more and get your own space. Forgiveness takes time. Have a little fun, although it's hard right now.

, It will do nothing but set you back and make you unhappy. She's not as pretty and you are a better person.

, Do not ask for details about the cheating. This does nothing for you in the long run. He can tell you simply, that he cheated sexually/emotionally, and he wants to forget about her and move on with his life with you. Discuss if you two even want to stay together. Does he really want this? Or was he cheating because he is scared to say he's done? What were his motives?

,, What did he say is the reason? You both may need some professional help from here to move forward.

, Aside from 1 or 2 close people if you must, you really should keep it private. This is so when you are ready to move on and forgive the incident you are not constantly burdened by people around you to do otherwise or reminding you of the hurt.

Catch them in the act.,
Let the other guy/girl know.,
Tell your friends.,
Post about it on social media.",How to Get Even With a Cheater1," If you have reason to believe that your partner has been cheating, try to catch them red-handed or uncover some evidence to confirm your suspicions. Pay particular attention to any odd or unusual behavior they exhibit, and keep an eye on the people they’ve been corresponding with. You’ll have undeniable proof of their wrongdoing, and there will be no way for them to lie or weasel their way out of the situation.Trust your gut. If you sense that something is off about the way your significant other has been acting, it very well could mean something.
Resist the urge to go through your partner’s phone or email, or snoop into their private life in general, unless you’re fairly certain they’re carrying on an affair.;
, As soon as you find out that you’ve been two-timed, go straight to the other person. The infidelity has already occurred, so there’s no use inciting a confrontation, but it may give you the chance to expose your cheating partner to their other, unwitting lover. Chances are, the guy or girl they’ve been keeping on the side is none the wiser about their dishonest ways, and finding out from you will let them make a clean break before they waste any more of their time.Don’t assume that the other person helped your partner cheat with malicious intent. It may be that they’ve been deceived, too.
If the other person does know about the cheating, you can always blow off some steam by giving them a piece of your mind.

, Once someone gains a reputation as a cheater, it can be hard to regain the trust and respect of the people in their lives. Spread the word that you’ve been betrayed and watch the cheater’s social circle dry up. Your friends can also function as an excellent support group. They can lend emotional consolation, offer a diversion to take your mind off the scandal and act as your better judgment if you’re thinking about giving the slimy homewrecker another chance.Letting your friends know that your boyfriend or girlfriend has been running around will motivate them to cut ties.

, Go public with the news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Not only will this let your mutual friends and acquaintances know exactly what your partner has done wrong, it will also be extremely embarrassing for them to see their deceitful deeds dragged out in the open when they’ve been trying to keep them secret. No one who hears about what they’ve done will be willing to date them, which will keep them from hurting other people in the future.Be sure to tag your cheating partner in your post(s) so that they’ll know that you’ve found out what they’ve done and you’re not going to tolerate it. They’ll be horrified to discover that they’ve been outed to hundreds of people that know them.

Plot an act of revenge.,
Spill one of the cheater’s secrets.,
Inform the cheater’s family.,
Let them live with the guilt.,
Make them atone for the sake of the relationship.",How to Get Even With a Cheater2," If you absolutely can’t stomach the shame and anger of being cheated on, retribution may be your most tempting option. Post flyers up around town announcing what the cheater has done, mail herpes medication to the other guy or girl to get them panicking or hide a bag of shellfish in their car on a hot day. It may seem childish, but revenge is a strong, instinctual urge, and it can be very satisfying once it’s been achieved.Make sure you don’t do anything that could get you in bigger trouble when exacting your revenge. If something you’re considering doing sounds illegal or unethical, it probably is.
Taking revenge may just escalate the hostility between you and your cheating partner.

, Trade a breach of trust for a breach of trust. Let everyone know that your unfaithful lover is a bedwetter or that they cry after sex. Carrying on with another person behind your partner’s back sends the clear message that the values of trust, loyalty and faithfulness are no longer being respected in your relationship. That means all bets are off.


If you’ve been dating someone for a while, chances are you know a few embarrassing things about them that they would be mortified to have get out.
Make up a damaging rumor about the cheater and let them deal with the gossip. Who says you have to play fair?

, If you want to really wound their pride, don’t just tell the cheater’s friends or Twitter followers what they’ve done, tell their mother, father, siblings or grandparents. There’s no shame like the shame one feels when they’ve let their family down. This one can come as a real shock to their system and make them rethink the consequences of their actions.Because most people learn their morals from family, exposing their transgression to a loved one can be a powerful way of reminding them that they’ve done wrong.
This may be difficult to do if you’ve grown close with your partner’s family.

, Be up front with your partner about how much they’re hurt and disappointed you. There’s no need to act scornful or petty. Instead, be direct and unflinching and force them to confront the emotional backlash of betraying the person they were supposed to care for. Guilt is a powerful antidote for infidelity and deception, and they’re more likely to feel guilty if you don’t justify their harmful behavior by seeking out more destructive methods of retaliation.Don’t let it turn into a fight. A cheater will make excuses and do everything they can to make it seem like your fault, but don’t be fooled. Stay strong and let them know that what they’ve done isn’t okay.
If you talk to your partner earnestly and they still don’t feel any remorse, they’re probably not the kind of person you ought to be with in the first place.

, Many couples decide to remain together after one partner has been unfaithful. If you decide that working things out is for the best, make sure to lay down strict guidelines for what types of behavior are acceptable and what is now expected from your cheating partner. This might involve monitoring their calls, texts and emails, forcing them to follow an agreed-upon schedule and limiting the time they spend out socializing. Let them know that they have one last chance to prove themselves to you, and that they'll have to work hard to rebuild your confidence in them.Cheating changes things. Your relationship might never be the same again, but that doesn't mean it has to be over. Sometimes, dealing with the fallout of an affair constructively can bring two people closer together than they were before.If they're serious about fixing the relationship, they'll tread lightly and show you more consideration going forward.

Treat the cheater with indifference.,
Make the right call for your relationship.,
Spend time improving yourself.,
Understand that you’re not to blame.,
Find someone better.",How to Get Even With a Cheater3," Don’t indulge an unfaithful partner’s ego by acting jealous or possessive. Sometimes, people cheat to put themselves at the center of attention or because they don’t feel validated. By allowing yourself to get worked up, you’re giving them exactly what they want. Responding with total apathy shows them that you’re the only one in control of your emotions, which means you can’t be manipulated.It will take an incredible amount of self-control not to show anger or sadness, but as you make a conscious effort to display indifference, you’ll have an easier time putting things in perspective and letting go of negative emotions.

, Not everyone who gets cheated on decides it’s worth ending their relationship over. If you’ve been together for a long time, and especially if you’re married, there may be other circumstances to consider before simply turning your back on your partner. Think long and hard about whether it’s possible to rebuild and make things work or if it might just be time to move on. Whatever you decide, make sure it’s a healthy, productive course of action that’s going to be good for you in the long run.Don’t be afraid to end things. It can be hard when you’ve invested so much of yourself in another person, but you should be able to recognize when you’re just being hurt and walk away.If you and your partner decide to work on your relationship, you should make it understood that you both need to be willing to communicate openly about when your needs aren’t being met.

, As the old saying goes, ""living well is the best revenge."" Turn your partner’s weakness into your strength. Channel your anger into productive activities like exercise or putting time into practicing a creative hobby. Make it obvious to your cheating spouse what a mistake it was to give up someone as beautiful, talented and ambitious as you. It’s natural to feel less desirable after being cheated on, but if you channel those hopeless feelings into more positive avenues, you’ll emerge a more confident person better equipped to cope with grief.


You should be motivated by the desire to improve yourself, not by insecurity.
If nothing else, take some time to be alone and enjoy the benefits of solitude. Meditate, catch up on your reading or simply find a quiet place to sit and reflect. It is extremely important to reclaim your peace of mind., Your partner’s choice to be unfaithful has nothing to do with you. Don’t hold yourself responsible or look for reasons why they might have been driven to cheat. You might find yourself questioning whether or not you were attractive or fun or supportive or emotionally available enough to keep your partner satisfied, but this line of thinking is useless. The best you can do is accept what’s happened, acknowledge that you deserve to be treated better and move on with your life.Accept circumstances as they are. Don’t waste your time wishing things were different—instead, make the best of a bad situation and compel yourself to make a positive change in your outlook and ability to stand up for yourself in your relationships.

, If your partner is willing to endanger your bond by cheating on you, they've shown that they either can't or won't meet your needs. Once infidelity has been committed, it can be nearly impossible to restore trust and intimacy. In most cases, you'll be better off moving on and starting a new relationship. You owe it to yourself to be with someone who cares about you and appreciates the effort you put into your relationship. Life is too short to waste your time settling for less than what you deserve.Ending a relationship is never easy, especially if you've been together for a long time. Just know that the pain will gradually fade, and that you'll soon find happiness again.Don't let yourself become paranoid or distrustful because you've been cheated on. This will just make it harder to establish a strong emotional connection in the future.

Is this the first time my partner has betrayed my trust?
Is this relationship important enough to fight for?
Do I want to stay in this relationship even if some things change and it doesn’t go back to exactly the way it was?;
, You may have to consider that other people in your life know about the infidelity: children, family members, coworkers, or friends. You get to decide how their opinions are to your personal relationship. Know that it may be harder to move on from the infidelity based on how it was discovered.This will help you decide how to move forward, or what aspects of your relationship are important to you in the future.If you have children, it may be very important to them if one of their parents is an adulterer. Think about what values you want to teach your children.
You can tell others that your personal life is none of their business, or is private.
It might feel like everyone but you knew, yet that might not necessarily be the case.

, Tell your partner exactly what it was that hurt you and what you need him or her to do if you are to ever trust that person again. Your partner must know why you want to trust her and why she needs to be trustworthy.


Tell your partner that your feelings are legitimate and important even if the other person does not think you should feel hurt or sad.
It is important to express your feelings with words instead of with your body. You may use hugs, tears, kisses, or other calm forms of interaction; never use punches, hits, slaps, or general violence.
This is not an opportunity to hurt the other person. If you feel the desire to hurt the other person, say so but don’t actually try to do it.

, Let your partner tell you what he was lacking in the relationship, and whether he thinks it is worth fixing. If your partner does not want to continue a relationship, you should talk about breaking up.


Remember that this conversation is about how each of you feel, not about what is fact or argument.
Listen to your partner’s needs in the relationship. Can you give her what she needs? It is possible that the infidelity was the result of someone feeling neglected, yet uncomfortable with saying so.
Your partner’s feelings are legitimate and important even if you do not “agree” with what she feels. If your partner’s feelings are not legitimate and important to you, then you might want a conversation about ending the relationship.

, Each of you must take responsibility for your past actions, both good and bad. You cannot fix something if no one takes ownership and accountability for fixing it. Responsibility is key in being able to improve your actions moving forward.


Acknowledge that you can have a certain effect without intending to, or being aware of that certain effect.
There is a phrase, “It takes two to tango.” If it seems like your partner is completely at fault for something, look for other factors or reasons beyond your one partner. Rarely is one person truly to blame completely for a relationship issue.

, What would it take for you both to be happy and trusting of one another? What steps and actions can you each take to get there? Answering these questions will help you decide how each of you should act moving forward. Write down 5 important things that you think should happen so that you have a secure relationship.

Examples of relationship-related issues: repeated infidelity, sex addiction, sexual fetishes, sexual abuse, family relationships
Examples of other issues that can affect your relationship: substance abuse or addiction, financial problems, legal problems, health issues

, Some couples find this imperative to do; in a few cases, it is not necessary to break all contact. It depends on what you find helpful and your particular situation.

, Agree on what you literally expect from yourselves and your partner moving forward. Consider starting from the very foundation of your relationship and discussing every aspect, so that nothing is left assumed. On the other hand, consider thinking about what you find the most frustrating and start taking measures to address those first.


Examples of concrete steps: giving you access to his phone, or calling and checking in at night.
You might each be taking different steps but towards the same goal. Or, you might help one another take steps and do each together.
It may help to write these down, similar to rules in a classroom, and sign your names at the bottom like a contract.

, Your partner can be held accountable for his behavior by accounting for how he spends his time, and being transparent and willingly offer information before being asked.Your partner should make a promise to do better, but know that a promise or apology alone with only restore trust short-term.Set up ways to be held accountable for the future actions. For example, if your partner does not give you access to his or her phone one night, you have a set-up protocol or discussion to handle it already.
This contingency planning of sorts allows for the “concrete” steps to have some flexibility. You can show that you are trying even if you sometimes break a rule or fail to take a step.
Ultimately, you and your partner should each be accountable for communicating and being trusting of one another. Have a way to talk about if you think one person is not being held accountable.
A promise to do better works in the short-term, but must be kept in the long-term in order to have value.

, Infidelity is often correlated with emotional distance between you and your partner, and one way to avoid the urge to cheat in the first place is to remain emotionally close. Is it possible that you and your partner had difficulty sharing emotions in the past?


In the future, learning to share your feelings effectively may open up the possibility of sharing with your partner your desire to cheat, before cheating.
Consider talking openly with your partner in the future about your experiences and perspective on commitment.To avoid making someone else feel attacked or hurt, start your sentences with “I feel that…” This makes it clear that you feel a certain way, and are not arguing or stating something as a fact.

, Give yourself permission to move on. Remember that you might feel sad or angry now, but you won’t feel this way forever. Don’t bottle your anger up inside, but address it. Work on letting go of the pain, while remembering the lessons you’ve learned.If you are angry at your partner, but your partner does not know why, you should tell your partner.
Resist the urge to throw the betrayal in your partner’s face during arguments. It will hurt your trust for one another and keep you both from moving past the betrayal.

, To move forward in your relationship, you must have a nugget of trust between the two of you. Don't look for clues or evidence she is cheating again. Being able to forgive your partner and move past this hurdle will strengthen your relationship in the long run.Trust your partner to uphold his end of whatever rules, boundaries, or effort you decided to put into effect. If you said so, trust him to bring up any issues he has.
It may seem scary to trust someone to do exactly what he failed to do last time, but there is no alternative that leads to trusting relationships again.
Trust yourself. If you do not feel comfortable, figure out why. If you feel like you cannot trust the other person, address it instead of ignoring how you feel.

, Part of forgiveness is seeing your significant other as a whole person again, and in a positive light, rather than thinking of her just as someone who acted in a way that hurt you.You want to see your partner as vulnerable and capable of being hurt, instead of thinking of him as malicious.Exercises like role reversal and role play can help you empathize with the other.Try thinking about the what it’s like to “be in her shoes,” or try speaking to each other as the other person.

, Betrayal does not at all mean you're unworthy, or that the betrayal was your fault. Yet, it is possible that someone betrayed you because she didn’t know how to ask for something she needed. Ask your significant other to tell you ways to make the relationship better. Be open to suggestions about how to improve and strengthen your relationship.


Start your sentences with “I feel that…” to avoid making someone else feel attacked or hurt. This makes it clear that you are experiencing something, and are not arguing or stating something as a fact.
“Mirror” what the other person said. Mirroring is when you repeat what you heard the other person say, to validate her perspective and ensure you are both on the same page.

, Surround yourself with people who love you and who will help you feel good about yourself. Getting social support from others in the maintenance of your relationship will help you move forward.Feel free to tell others that your private relationship is “none of their business.” People who care about you will respect your boundaries.
Get social support from those whom your significant other trusts and believes in. Sometimes, the people you seek support from can be part of the problem for your significant other.

, If you have been trying to solve your relationship on your own and it’s not working, an expert is likely to have seen couples like you before. Especially if an outside factor is complicating your betrayal, it can be helpful to seek professional advice or guidance on how to improve your relationship. Experts include marriage counselors, therapists, family psychologists, sex therapists, or certain community leaders like priests.


Examples of relationship-related issues: repeated infidelity, sex addiction, sexual fetishes, sexual abuse, family relationships
Examples of other issues that can affect your relationship: substance abuse or addiction, financial problems, legal problems, health issues

, Focus on showing your partner that you still love her, and accepting her acts of love as well. Be kind to each other, and treasure those acts of kindness.If your partner tries to show affection, you should focus on accepting the affection as genuine.


Cook with each other, spend time outside, exchange physical touch, and give each other thoughtful compliments.
Do acts of kindness that show you know and care about the other person. For example, take him out to a restaurant you know he likes or see her family for the holidays.

, It can take months or even years to recover from a betrayal, and your relationship may never be what it once was. Accept where you life is now and that it might take a really long time to get to where you want to be. Your partner may even be going at a different pace than you are, which is why communication is so important.


Don’t compare yourself to other couples or relationships.
Use small metrics. Was today a good day? Did you go through the entire dinner meal without thinking about infidelity?
There is no such thing as shortcuts in relationship-building. Take as much time and effort as you need to get your relationship to where you both want it to be.

Knowing the whole story may even help make it possible for you to forgive, but avoid asking for details about sexual encounters or other intimate moments.

What did it do for you?
Why did it continue?
Was alcohol involved?
Was there any other motivation for the affair?;

Tell your partner if there is anything standing in the way of forgiving him or her. For example, has your partner convinced you that he or she is sorry? Does your partner need to work on certain behaviors? Make sure that you express these things to your partner.

It just means that you are choosing to let go of your anger and resentment about the affair.For example, after you have forgiven your partner, you may still feel hurt and you may sometimes ask questions about the affair. However, you will have to avoid lording the affair over your partner or using it as a defense during arguments.

, Seeking the help of a qualified therapist is essential to recover from emotional infidelity. Look for a therapist who has experience with couples counseling. You and your partner may need to see the therapist together and individually in order to work through all of your emotions and relationship issues.


Make sure that you find a therapist who has experience working with couples who are recovering from emotional infidelity.

, While you may be tempted to condemn your partner’s actions and refuse to see his or her side, this will make it harder for you to forgive. Instead, you will have to spend some time thinking about why your partner cheated. If you do not know why your partner cheated, then you will need to ask.People cheat for a variety of reasons. For example, some people cheat because they are looking for a distraction from something unpleasant, such as the death of a loved one or financial troubles. Other may cheat because they come from a background where infidelity is accepted or even encouraged.Ask your partner to consider the motivation behind the emotional affair. What happened that may have motivated your partner to develop emotional intimacy with someone else? Why did it continue?

, Some people are more likely to cheat because they are surrounded by temptations at work, with friends, and in other situations. Consider your partner’s work environment, social life, and other interests. How might these settings have contributed to the affair?For example, perhaps your partner works in a night club with lots of attractive young people. The combination of working late nights, having plenty of alcohol on hand, and being surrounded by attractive people might have contributed to the affair.
If you think that your partner’s work or social environment played a role in his or her affair, then you will have to discuss the possibility of a career change or making other changes to prevent another affair.

, Although you may see yourself as blameless (and you may be) in your partner’s cheating, it is possible that his or her actions were in response to something you said or did. Consider whether it might be possible that your partner engaged in an emotional affair because his or her emotional needs were not being fulfilled.For example, you might decide that your part in why your partner started confiding in someone at work was that you did not make time to listen to your partner when he or she wanted to talk. Or perhaps you may decide that you listened, but that you did not respond in ways that made your partner feel heard.
Try to pinpoint any part that you may have played in your partner’s affair and look for opportunities to change your behavior.

Writing about your feelings may help. Try taking 15 to 20 minutes per day to check in with your emotions and write about them.
You may also feel the need to express your emotions in other ways, such as screaming to express anger or crying to express sadness. Allow yourself to express your emotions in appropriate ways. For example, you might scream in your car while driving on the freeway alone or have a good cry when you are at home.

, You may find yourself dwelling on what your partner did to you, but this will not help you to move on. You have a right to feel the way that you do, but dwelling on your partner’s betrayal will only hurt you. Instead, try to distract yourself with engaging activities, such as:Meditation. Meditation is an excellent stress relief strategy.It can help you to dispel unwanted thoughts and focus on the present instead. Try taking a meditation class to help you develop this skill.

Getting more exercise. Exercising is necessary for good health. It can also help to relieve stress and distract you from worries about your affair.Try to get at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise every day. For example, you might include 30 minutes of walking, running, biking, dancing, or swimming into your daily schedule.

Making plans with your friends. Getting together with a friend can help you to relax and forget about your problems for a while. Go to see a movie, have dinner, or grab a cup of coffee.

Picking up a new hobby. For example you might try weight lifting, knitting, or cake decorating. Choose something that is fun and engaging for you.

, You may have an ideal vision of your relationship with your partner, or at least a vision of how it could be better than it is now. Think about this vision and try to identify what needs to happen in order to get there.What needs to change? What specific things do you or your partner will need to do differently?


For example, if you want your relationship to be more honest and open, then you and your partner might agree to only tell each other the truth, even about little things. Or, if you want your relationship to be more spontaneous, then you and your partner might agree to surprise each other once every week, such as with a small gift or a surprise date.

, Before you can forgive your partner, you need to forgive yourself for any resentment you are feeling towards yourself. If you have identified something specific that you think may have caused your partner to have an emotional affair, then use that as part of your statement of forgiveness.For example, if you think that taking on extra hours at work may have played a role in your partner’s emotional affair, then forgive yourself for putting work before your relationship.
You might say something like, “I am human and I made a mistake. I put my career ahead of my marriage and my partner turned to someone else for companionship. I am upset that it happened, but I am willing to forgive myself and move on.”

, Although it is possible for a relationship to recover from infidelity, there are situations where this is not possible. Sometimes affairs continue or there is simply no trust left in the relationship.


If you cannot seem to get past your partner’s affair or if the affair is still going on, then it may be time for you to move on.
Keep in mind that recovering from an affair takes time and persistence. If you and your partner are both willing to work on the relationship, then it may be even stronger in the end."

, A new dating partner or relationship brings new and exciting adventures into your life. Try a new activity in your area to meet a new group of people. Date someone a little different from your last relationship.
Get a new “type”. If you are into a certain set of qualities and your ex is a perfect representation of them, it might be time to look for new attractions in a partner.
While the “bad boy” or “bad girl” image may be appealing, these types may not make the best long term relationship partners.
Think about what you want from your love life.
Decide whether you want a relationship full of twists and turns, or one that is more smooth sailing.
Find a partner who is looking for the same type of relationship.

, Assuming your next boyfriend or girlfriend will cheat will sabotage that relationship. Being too controlling with your new partner can make that person feel stifled and restricted.Don’t expect your new partner to serve the sentence for the crime committed by your ex. That is, don’t punish your new partner for your ex’s infidelity.
Don’t send the message that you expect this new person to cheat on you.
If you aren’t at the point where you can treat a new relationship with trust, you are not ready to date someone new.

She expects an expensive lifestyle.,
She has a lot of admirers.,
She talks badly about other women.,
She's only available to be with you on a very limited schedule.,
She pouts.,
She struggles to communicate in meaningful ways.,
She switches between hot and cold.,
Make your expectations of the relationship clear.,
Communicate openly.,
Keep your pocketbook in check.,
Be cautious in the bedroom.,
Watch for signs of unfaithfulness.,
End the relationship if necessary.",How to Detect a Playgirl," Playgirls are generally characterized by their desire for a wealthy lifestyle, one supported by a variety of male admirers all competing for her attentions. If a girl seems particularly obsessed by material wealth and status, it might not mean anything about your relationship, but it could signify a playgirl in the making.Look out for the following warning signs that a girl might be somewhat materialistic, and also just crummy kind of date:


She refuses to split a tab
She wants to go expensive places right away
She mocks servers or waitstaff
She refuses things like public transportation
She mentions how ""spoiled"" she is, or wants to be
She seems concerned with her attire, or with your's
She doesn't seem to do anything for money
She doesn't seem to care how much money she spends
She usually wears expensive clothes, purses, and has lots of necklaces and earrings;
, Playgirls sometimes require a big social network of admirers, friends, hangers-on, and lovers. These admirers are used by playgirls for support and self-esteem boosting. If a girl is regularly surrounded by guys they use to get attention and affection, you might be another in a long line.


Playgirls sometimes use male friends as possible prospects while at the same time exploiting the kindness that their friends are giving them. Playgirls often use these massive social networks to create some kind of a seductive web to entice other guys.
Playgirls may also sometimes brag about how many men they have rejected, or how ""hard to get"" they are.

, Playgirls will often look on women as competition, rather than potential friends. If a girl regularly criticizes girls you know or strangers on the street based on little more than looks, it's not a great sign. If a girl gets jealous of any time you spend around other women, including friends, coworkers, and even relatives, that's also not a great sign.

, Playgirls date a lot of people at the same time. If you're worried a girl might be playing the field on the sly, one typical sign will be that she's unable to see you at different times of the day. If a girl seems extremely busy socially, and can't make time for you to be together during the week, it might be a sign that she's seeing a lot of other guys.


Try an experiment. If you've got a date set up for one day, call her and try to switch it up on the fly, and see if she's amenable. If she's really offended, it might not be a great sign. At the same time, if she does this to you regularly, it could be a sign she's got a lot going on with other guys.
If you've just started dating someone, it's not really any of your business who she hangs out with other than you. Try to remember that there's nothing wrong with playing the field and have an open conversation with her, instead of getting angry about her other dates.

, A classic sign of emotional manipulation and immaturity is pouting. Adults can take disappointment and rejection in stride, and are able to move on without falling apart. Playgirls act like, well, girls. If a girl you're seeing can't get a particular table at a restaurant, or tickets to a particular show, and then promptly falls into a pouty funk, that's not a great sign.


Getting upset about something serious is one thing, but pouting about something petty is another. You can't expect someone to be happy all the time, so try to distinguish between the two., Playgirls don't want to have serious, deep, or emotional conversations with you. They want to use you for what you're worth, and then move on. If you've been seeing a girl for a while but have never had an actual conversation, that could be a sign of a playgirl, when considered in tandem with other qualities from this list.


Try an experiment. Decide that you want to talk about the future, or about your childhood, or some other serious topic. If the girl is excited to deepen your emotional bond, good! If not, it could be a sign you're dating someone superficial.
Sometimes, playgirls may Try to work from conversation ""scripts"" as well, which usually don't last longer than an hour or so on dates. If a girl totally runs out of interesting things to say at a certain point, it could be a sign that she's kind of vapid.

, If you're not clear whether or not she even likes you, that might be a manipulation tactic. Showing warmth and love and then withholding it is an excellent way of getting a guy locked in and wanting more. If a girl seems like she can't get enough of you one minute and you're a stranger the next, it might be a sign of manipulation.


When you see or talk to a playgirl, she will sometimes do just enough to make you feel ""special,"" stringing you along. She might try to make up to you for being absent, but then will continue the behavior, ignoring calls or texts.

, There are all kinds of different relationships, and it's your job to make sure you're both on the same page when you're starting a new one. If you're dating someone and you want it to be exclusive, don't automatically assume that the other person will feel the same way. Make your desires for the relationship clear and respect her desires for it as well.


What do you want out of a relationship? If you want someone to spend time with that you feel an emotional connection to a few times a week, what's the big deal? If you want a committed and serious relationship, let her know in the early stages.
If you don't like what you hear, don't try to change her, or yourself. Just end the relationship. There are lots of people to date. Don't get stuck on someone you're incompatible with.

, The most important part of any relationship is communication. If you're suspicious that a girl you're seeing might be inclined to cheat on you, talk to her about monogamy. Talk to her about being in a committed relationship. Tell her that you feel like you're not as close as you'd like to be.


If you're unsure how to bring up the subject, just say something simple like, ""Where do you see this relationship going?"" If you get a vague answer, push for a specific one. If she says she wants to be exclusive, but behaves in a way counter to it, then talk to her about it.
If you don't like what she has to say in return, or she doesn't follow up with what she says she'll do, then end the relationship. You're not powerless in this situation.

, You can't buy love. If a girl you're seeing makes her presence conditional on you buying things or you furnishing expensive or lavish lifestyle gifts upon her, then you're in a bad situation. If you suspect a girl you're seeing might be playing you for what's in your pocketbook, refrain from opening it up when you're out. See what happens.


If she stops calling you altogether, consider yourself lucky. You just freed yourself of someone who only loved you for your money. If your relationship improves, then follow that path and try to change your relationship to money in your dating habits.
Don't disclose anything like personal finance and keep away from the girls who question your salary. Any girl who makes it obvious or points out how she wants this or that is most likely a playgirl.
Try not to go looking for signs of ""gold-digging."" If it's there, it'll be obvious. Most people will be happy to have dinner purchased for them. It's not automatically a sign of something amiss. An obsession with stuff and material gifts, though, is.

, Attraction is both emotional and sexual. A lot of playgirls understand that sexual attraction plays a fairly central role in manipulating a guy. While all playgirls are different, and all sexual relationships are different, it's very important that you practice safe sex, especially if you're not sure your relationship is exclusive.

, Playgirls sometimes practice unfaithfulness to avoid having their attention focus on a single guy. This strategy detracts them from falling in love and help prevent them from getting too serious. Always talk openly with your girlfriend about the expectations of your relationship, and decide on the terms mutually.


Some people are in open-relationships, which can occasionally work. Whatever the case, you need to be on the same page.

, Relationships aren't supposed to be conditional. If you feel like a girl is only spending time with you based on your money, or because of some service you provide her, stop seeing her. There's nothing wrong with ending a relationship that leaves you unfulfilled, or that has no room to grow. Get out now before it gets worse.

Remain as calm as possible.,
Avoid putting the blame on yourself.,
Think positively towards yourself.,
Talk to someone.",How to Deal With a Cheating Girlfriend1," You might be overcome by emotions of anger or sadness. Giving in to these emotions might lead you to react poorly. Do your best to give yourself some time to think and reflect. It's often good to talk about your thoughts and feelings with a friend or even a counselor.To relieve stress, pick a recreational activity or spend time with friends and family to get your mind off of it.;
, A relationship should belong to two people. Both individuals carry the responsibility of actions and communication that make the relationship work. If she cheats on you, do not falsely put the burden of blame on yourself. You are never in control of her actions, but you can control your thoughts. Keep your mind clear of feeling you are at fault., You will have a lot of thoughts and scenarios running through your head when you find out the disheartening truth. Often times, guys focus on the damage of their pride or reputation. While it won't be easy, rely on the fact that a relationship should not be built on what a person brought to your reputation. Also, her actions should not shatter who you are, so avoid thinking you are not good enough. Don't weigh yourself down., Avoid feeling alone during this time. Realize that people around you can help. Bottling up anger or doubt might be too much, so find either a family member or friend whom you can open up to about the situation. Seeking a therapist is also a good choice; a therapist is both professional and unbiased.

Investigate.,
Ask the woman that he’s having an affair with, if you know or suspect who she is.,
Ask him.",How to Deal With a Cheating Boyfriend1," Play detective, and notice his suspicious mannerisms. Ask yourself the following:


Has he been less intimate with you? If you notice sex become less frequent, he might be getting something on the side.Has he been dressing to impress? Men do this when they’re first interested in someone, but when things get serious, they tend to slack on their appearance. If he suddenly starts working out or takes an unusual interest in his looks, he’s looking good for someone else.Is he “working late” more frequently? If “working late” becomes more regular, or if he’s spending nights away “on business,” he’s probably seeing someone else. Unless he’s been overwhelmed with work, in which case he probably tells you all about specific things he’s stressed about. If he’s vague about his late nights and business trips, and doesn’t tell you very much about them, there’s a solid chance he’s seeing someone else.Does he check his phone a lot, and is he secretive about it? Some men are simply more private than others, but if he becomes defensive when you ask him who he’s corresponding with, he’s hiding something.






Has he become protective of his personal accounts? More so than usual? If he suddenly installs a password on his cell phone or computer, or starts intercepting the mail to open bank statements in private, he is likely having an affair.Has he been withdrawn and distant from you lately? If he’s behaving anxious around you, there’s a chance he’s having an affair. But remember, men can be distant for many reasons, so don’t go jumping to conclusions. But if he is being unfaithful, he will most likely be nervous, whether it be out of guilt or paranoia.
Has he been snide to you in front of company? He may try to justify his infidelity by convincing himself you’re the bad guy.Has he been mentioning a female acquaintance or colleague a lot more lately?This may mean he has a crush, whether he knows it or not. The good news is, if he still mentions her to you, he may not have acted on those feelings yet, since they’re still tantalizing him. If he did the deed already, he’d probably never mention her again.;
, Most women will sympathize and tell the truth. Oftentimes, this is exactly what she wants—for you to know. She may want you to leave him, so she can have your man all to herself. Many women are offended to be somebody’s secret, or second choice.

, He may not answer honestly, but you can still infer by his reaction whether he is hiding something.


If he reacts defensively or nervously, and fervently denies all accusations, he's hiding something.
If he ""doesn’t dignify your question with an answer,"" it’s usually because he doesn’t want to lie to you, but he really doesn’t want to tell the truth. If instead of answering, he asks, “How could you think that? Don’t you trust me?” he’s probably just avoiding your question.






If he comes clean, it is for one of two reasons. Either he is telling you because A) he wants to leave you, or B) the guilt of the affair is killing him. If he breaks down and cries, or keeps his head down when he tells you, it’s because he’s ashamed and he regrets his actions. Ask him what his intentions are in telling you, whether he wants to work things out with you or not.

First and foremost - take a deep breath and some time.,
Talk to someone.,
Do not blame yourself.,
Determine whether you were actually cheated on.,
Talk to your partner.,
Ask yourself if you will ever be able to look at your partner the same way.,
If you decide this is irreconcilable, don't break up with your partner and later take him/her back.,
If you are married and pretty sure a more-than-casual relationship is happening, you might need to consider an attorney or a reputable detective in the area that specializes in domestic cases.,
If you do use an investigator, do not confront or accuse your partner.,
Get tested for STD's as soon as possible.,
If you can, collect evidence (receipts, emails, photographs, etc.),
Don't start rumors.,
Look at your own personal actions, too.,
Turnabout is not fair play.",How to Deal With a Cheater," Do not let yourself have a knee-jerk response. Think! This is especially important in long-term relationships. Sudden reactions without thought can lead to consequences you might regret. Give yourself some mental space before you take any action.;
, You are not alone. Statistics are sketchy and vary widely, but many surveys have been done on cheating and they indicate that between a fourth and half of all married people will or have cheated at one time or another.

, It's easy for people to start looking at themselves for reasons why their partner cheated... nothing good will come of that. Issues that lead to cheating sometimes involve both people, but that's certainly not always the case. However, it would, help, at a later date look inwards too to find out why your partner looked elsewhere for comfort. There could be certain grey areas in your behavior which could have led to such actions. You have remember that most humans like a monogamous lifestyle, as it brings about so much of happiness & security. However, there are a few who would not conform to this.

, Ask yourself these questions: Were you officially boyfriend and girlfriend at the time this ""cheating"" occurred? Were you officially monogamous? If not, you cannot be sure that your significant other knew what he or she was doing would offend you, in which case you might want to consider less confrontational options.

, Let your concerns and fears be known. It might come out that nothing at all happened, or perhaps something did happen and coercion was involved (workplace sexual harassment, for example, which needs to be discussed openly and immediately to ward off future occurrences). There could be a substance abuse or psychological issue that needs to be addressed (sex addiction is very real). If help is warranted, you might want to support your partner in getting help - that could prove therapeutic for both of you. However, substance abuse is not a valid ""excuse"" for inappropriate behavior and you absolutely must not permit the ""yeah but I was drunk so it doesn't matter"" argument - stand very firm on that.

, Infidelity doesn't mean much for some, and some people have more than one physical relationship and it doesn't suggest a shortcoming in their relationship with their steady partner, but this is rare. Infidelity often indicates boredom and dissatisfaction with the present relationships. Dealing with a partner who doesn't want you in the first place, or one who doesn't mind hurting you, is ridiculous. Dump him/her if this is the case.

, This will only give you more emotional stress. If you break up, make it a clean break. However, a trial separation is a valid option. If you do take a break of any kind (permanent or trial) don't talk to your ex after breaking up with him/her immediately. Give yourself some cooling off time first. If there are children or critical financial issues this might not be possible. In that case, set specific ground rules (time frames, meeting places, etc). This can be difficult, but it's important.

, Check references.

, Let the investigator do his/her job first (if you confront them they may continue in an even more cautious way, which will make the investigation more expensive).

, Not knowing will cause you extreme stress. Early treatment is critical.

, of the paramour. Keep this information at a friend or family member's house. This will be less work the investigator will need to do later on your dollar.

, If you share your suspicions with more than one close friend, it is likely to create gossip that can have very negative results in many areas. If there is an investigation underway, that kind of talk can hamper the case.

, If you are also cheating, then it might be time to have an open discussion with your partner and clear the air. Perhaps couples counselling is in order. If divorce is the chosen option, remember it can get very ugly, very quickly, and your indiscretions will be brought into the limelight as well.

, Don't start a relationship just because your spouse has done so. This is pure revenge and nothing good will come of it.

Gather any kind of evidence.,
Make sure your relationship has been established.,

Ask friends and pay attention to your girlfriend's actions. Keep track of things as they happen. Wrongfully accusing her will cause relationship problems., Times have changed, and people accept open relationships. If your relationship has only begun, perhaps she didn't see it as cheating. Reflect upon your history together and be open to her perspective if there is a misunderstanding about the relationship. People need to choose the relationship model that best suits them., In order to verify if she is cheating, you will have to talk to her in person. It won't be easy, but it is a must. Be confident in your questioning, and be ready to hear her out. Ask her What went wrong with our relationship? Is this an ongoing incident? How did this happen in the first place?Listening to each other will be very key in order to know what lies ahead for the two of you.One meeting might not be enough. Be ready to talk about this over several meetings., If you get your hard evidence and plan to bring up her cheating without warning, you will catch her off guard. Chances are she might deny it. Have questions ready along with your proof. Ask her to explain specific days in which the incidents occurred. She might take some time to admit it especially if she is still cheating or seeing the other person. Bring that up, too. Either case, approach her when you are absolutely ready as possible. , The issue going on between you and your girlfriend should be the focus. Realize that the root of the problem stems from your girlfriend and her actions.

Move forward.,
Seek counseling if needed.",How to Deal With a Cheating Girlfriend3," The relationship will not move on without an apology. If she hasn't given you one, ask her. It might be difficult to tell if the apology is heartfelt, but ask your girlfriend for some time to process all that has transpired. When the time is right, your acceptance will begin to mend the relationship., If you decide to work through the incident and keep the relationship going, talk about trust. The hurt that occurred will drive a huge wedge between you, but deciding to be together means regaining that closeness. Communicate with one another and express changes that should occur in the relationship.Avoid stripping each other of any and all privacy (i.e. checking cell phones, demanding social media passwords); the relationship must have the enjoyable will of being with each other.

Stay true to your decision. Help each other by looking forward to a new and better relationship., Do not dwell on the past. If your relationship is going to work, do not take any fight as an opportunity to bring up the mistake she made. Your decision to be with her should be driven by better communication and future-oriented thinking., Discussing issues with her might be difficult. Even though you you are moving towards a better future, an incident of cheating can be too big for you to handle on your own. Seek a professional therapist or relationship counselor if you feel as though you can't get something off your mind. Don't force your girlfriend to go counseling as well, but invite her with the best interest for your relationship."

Depending on how many times he’s cheated on you, how long he’s been unfaithful, how invested he is in his affair(s) and how many women he’s been with, you may be able to salvage your relationship.

If he’s exclusive to one mistress and he sees her frequently, and buys her things, and does romantic things with her, this means he’s in love with her and your relationship is over.






If he’s slipped up several times, but always with different women who he cares nothing about and hasn’t kept in touch with, he may be fixable, because this means you still give him something other women don’t, if you’re the only one he’s with repeatedly. But you will have to make a change if you want him to change his ways, or it won’t work, and he’ll fall back into old habits.






If he only cheated once, and it was out of character, and he sincerely, utterly regrets it, he deserves a second chance.







, Where will you draw the line? When you find out how seriously he’s been cheating, at what point will you be through with him? How willing are you to forgive him and move on?

, Obviously, his actions are inexcusable, but they may be the result of something deeper, and you may be part of it. Ask yourself if you’ve been driving him away. Maybe you’ve been snapping at him, putting too much pressure on the relationship, getting serious too quickly, or not getting serious enough. It could be any number of things, but you may not be satisfying all his needs, and if you want to work things out, there may be aspects of yourself you have to change.

, If you approach him angrily, he will immediately be on the defensive, and he won’t be rational or honest with you.


Be as understanding as possible. Let him be heard. Listening to him may relieve some of the tension that led him to betray you in the first place.

How frequently?
How long has it been going on?
Has he cheated in past relationships?
How serious is he about these women/this woman?

, Should you stay or should you go?


If in your heart, you can't fully forgive him, and you don't think you'll be happy if you stay with him, it isn't worth your misery to try to work through it, no matter how much you wish you could.
If you believe in him and trust him to stay faithful from hereon, you should give him a second chance.

Tell him what he needs to do to earn your trust back.,
Ask him what he needs from you.,
Communicate.",How to Deal With a Cheating Boyfriend3,"


You may feel it's necessary for him to stop going on facebook or remove some of his female contacts from his phone.
Be careful of forbidding him from speaking to someone entirely, because this may drive him to want to do it.
You are fully justified in asking him to remove his password from his phone. If you feel it's necessary, you may ask him to disclose his Facebook password, or for access to his personal email, but like I said, this may lead him to feel trapped and cheat again.

, Something may have been missing from your relationship that drove him to pull away from you.

Satisfy him sexually.,
Be careful not to play the blame game with him.,
Don't partake in power struggles.",How to Deal With a Cheating Boyfriend4," Don't smother him. If you're clingy or possessive over him, he may push you away. If he feels trapped with you, he may resort to cheating as a means of freeing himself.

, If he doesn't feel his needs are being met, he will find a way to meet them, and if you can't satisfy those needs, he'll find someone else who will.


Be adventurous in bed and open to do the things he wants to do, as long as his demands are reasonable.
Boring or repetitive sex can drive him to find somebody else to satisfy his urges.
Genuinely enjoying sex makes all the difference. If he thinks he isn't satisfying you, this may cause him to reassure his ego that he is good in bed by satisfying someone else.

, Blaming and accusing him for every little thing will push him to seek acceptance elsewhere, not just sexual acceptance, but emotional as well.

, Love is not a competition, so don't try to win. Dismissing everything he says or being condescending with him will cause him to retaliate.

See how they’re acting differently.,
Confirm that they aren’t doing something else.,
Keep a journal of your partner’s activity.,
Prepare yourself for what you might find.",How to Catch Someone Who Is Cheating Online1," A cheating spouse might be acting differently in a number of ways, including being physically distant or uninterested in sex; politely distant; hostile, critical or mean; or absent entirely. Pay close attention to their online activity, which might also indicate attempts at hiding something: they close internet browser windows as soon as you enter the room; they demand privacy when using the computer; they spend lots of time online after you go to bed; and they start new email accounts, among other activities., Someone who is acting distant or strange may not be cheating; they may be preoccupied with work or a family issue. They also might be engaging in other damaging activities, such as buying or selling drugs or gambling online. These are serious issues that can dramatically affect a relationship and they should be addressed by you with the help of a professional and your support network.

, Keep track of their movements as much as possible, including internet activity, travel, late nights at work, ATM withdrawals, phone calls, emails, and so on. This will help you keep track of details, which will become important if your spouse is trying to cover up something.

, Have a plan for what you will do in the event that you discover your partner is cheating. Finding out this information can ruin relationships – not just the relationship between you and your partner, but between other family members, children, and friends. It can have financial impact on you as well. Figure out where you stand regarding infidelity and where you draw the line. What level of physical involvement counts as cheating for you?


Have a confidante. Choose a close friend or family member who will be a good sounding board for you. If possible, choose someone who will not be misconstrued as a romantic partner of yours; your own relationships may undergo close scrutiny in the process.
Secure a support network of family or friends who can help you through the situation. In a situation where one person is cheating, families and friends often find themselves torn. To whom should they remain loyal? Think about who will be the most supportive people in your life.
Consult a family or matrimonial lawyer. You will also likely need the advice of a family lawyer if you are married or if you share resources or finances with your partner.
Visit a counselor or therapist. If your suspicions are correct, you might find yourself being faced needing to make life-changing decisions. This is also very emotionally traumatic and a professional can help you through. Get referrals from trusted friends to find a counselor who suits you. It may take visits with a few different counselors before you find the right fit.

Take note of his body language.,
Listen to his tone of voice.,
Notice his word choice and language.,
Keep in mind the three reasons individuals lie.,
Avoid blaming yourself for your boyfriend's lies.,
Consider the context around his lie.,
Confront him with honesty and openness.,
Discuss reasons why he may have lied.,
Make it clear you do not appreciate being lied to.,
Consider how the lies are affecting your relationship.",How to Deal With a Lying Boyfriend," According to behavioral specialists, people who are lying tend to exhibit certain body language cues. Look for these body language cues to determine if your boyfriend is telling a lie. For example:He may itch his nose often and his nose may turn red. This is known as the Pinocchio Sign, as a lie causes your cells to release histamine, which can cause your nose to itch and become swollen.
He may also exhibit negation cues, like covering or blocking his mouth and rubbing or putting his hand over his eyes, his nose, or his ears. He may also avoid making eye contact with you or turn his body or head away from you as he speaks.;
, You may notice that your boyfriend’s regular tone of voice changes or shifts when he is telling a lie. He may also stammer, pause for long periods of time, or have unusual intonations. A sudden change in his speech patterns when he is talking about a certain subject, person, or event may be a sign that he is telling a lie., Similar to the physical Pinocchio effect, your boyfriend may demonstrate a Pinocchio effect in his word choice as well. Often, people who lie tend to use many more words when lying in an effort to hide the lie or distract you from the lie.According to a study by the Harvard Business School, liars tend to use more swear words when they speak, as they are so focused on the lie they neglect to use proper terms or clean language.Your boyfriend may also use the third person when lying to distance himself from the lie he is telling you and he may try to change the subject quickly after he has told a lie to avoid drawing attention to it.

, Though people may lie for many different reasons, in general, people tell lies to hide something from another person, to hurt another person, or to make themselves seem greater or better than they really are. It may be helpful for you to consider which reason may be motivating your boyfriend to lie to you.If your boyfriend is lying to you to keep something from you, it may be useful to approach his lie as a way to reveal a truth he is hiding. If you and your boyfriend are just starting to date seriously, he may lie to you to hype himself up to you and make himself seem more worthy of your attention. However, if you think your boyfriend may be motivated to lie to you to hurt you, you may want to consider if his lies are a red flag that there are other issues in the relationship that need to be addressed.

, If you have complained about your boyfriend's behavior before, you may feel like you are partly to blame for him covering up his bad habit or behavior. But it's important to remember that you are not to blame for your boyfriend's lies, as only your boyfriend can be responsible for his behavior. Part of being an adult in a mature relationship is being willing to take responsibility for one's own actions. Your boyfriend should be willing to take the blame for his lies and you should not feel you are responsible for his choices.


No one can be ""made"" to lie, it is a choice they make and it is their responsibility to own up to their choice. Keep this in mind as you try to deal with your boyfriend's lies.

, If you catch him in a lie, or notice tell tale signs he is lying when he is speaking to you, think about what you were talking about together that triggered the lie or motivated him to lie. You could be discussing an event you were both supposed to attend together, but he backed out at the last minute, or you may be talking about a person he works with.Thinking about the context of the lie may also help you determine why he felt the need to lie to you. This way, when you confront him, you can explain why he think he is lying and be honest and open about your feelings.
There are many different reasons why people lie to their partners, and it may be useful to consider common relationship scenarios where someone may lie. For example, maybe you criticized certain bad habits your boyfriend cultivates, such as smoking or spending too much money. He may then lie to avoid disappointing you or to avoid receiving another lecture from you. He may also lie to avoid conflict or to avoid having to stop his bad habit.

, If you have caught your boyfriend in a lie, you cannot simply demand he stops lying to you. You cannot control your boyfriend’s desire to lie to you, or his ability to lie to you. However, you can control if your boyfriend gets away with the lie. Confronting him calmly and clearly will ensure you control how the conversation goes between you both.Rather than tell him, “I know you’re lying” or “You are a liar”, you should give him the opportunity to be honest with you. Tell him: “I think there is something going on that you’re worried about or that you do not want me to know about. I think it’s time that we bring it out into the open so we can handle it together.”
This will indicate to your boyfriend that you want to be honest and open with each other and that you are not trying to accuse him of lying. Instead, you are letting him make amends and come clean on his own about the lies.

, Allow your boyfriend to provide reasons for his lies, but be wary of excuses. He may have felt pressured not to be honest about his behavior because he knew you would not approve or that you would get upset if you found out. He may also be hiding an addiction or a personal problem that he does not want you to know about. Focus on ways that you can work together to try to help him deal with his issue or problem so he no longer feels the need to lie to you.


If your boyfriend is lying due to an addiction or a personal issue, you may suggest that he go for help in the form of AA or substance abuse counseling, or that he consider talking to a therapist about his issues. This will give him other ways to work on his personal issues without having to lie to you or to anyone else in his life.

, Once you have given your boyfriend the opportunity to come clean, give him time to consider his response. If he explains that he did lie to you and the reason why he lied to you, you should let him know you do not think it’s appropriate that you are being lied to. This will show you are uncomfortable and unhappy with his behavior and that you expect it will not happen again., At the end of the conversation with your boyfriend about his lies, it may be useful to take a step back and analyze your relationship. Though your boyfriend may offer good reasons for his lies, if he lies to you regularly, you may want to consider if his lies are signs of deeper issues in your relationship.You may ask yourself some questions, such as: Does your boyfriend lie to you often? Do you have difficulty trusting your boyfriend? Have you confronted him about his lying before, and seen no change in his behavior? If you answer “yes” to all of these questions, your boyfriend’s lies may be part of a destructive pattern in your relationship and you may want to consider if it is worth it to be lied to by your partner on a regular basis.

Your therapist can help you learn effective communication techniques.Learning more about the incident will remove some of the mystery – if you don't know what happened, you may obsess over what may have happened. Until you can begin to make sense of what happened, you cannot begin to rebuild the relationship, if you decide that's what you want.In every case, try to learn:


Why the cheating occurred
With whom it occurred
How often it happened;
, Although it can be hard to broach this topic, you need to know and decide what lies ahead. Whether or not you stay with your partner depends on many factors: your feelings, the legality of your relationship, the duration of your relationship, children, etc. If you are open to reconciliation, discuss what that will take.


For example, you might consider going to regular couples therapy.
You could opt for a temporary separation.

, Whether this is your partner’s first time cheating or he/she cheated multiple times with many partners, it is important that he/she also receive individual counseling.

, Your partner has broken your trust and violated your relationship. You are not responsible for your partner’s behavior.Even if you feel you could have been a better boyfriend, wife, etc., your partner still made the decision to cheat.

High levels of conflict or dissimilarity in couples.The person works in an environment that involves a great deal of touching, intimate discussion, or one-on-one time., Even if you are in couples counseling, it can be valuable to have counseling alone.

This is unhealthy. Your partner chose to cheat. He or she is responsible – not you. Let go of the past and the things that are done. Try to live in the present and also enjoy what is going well around you.If you find yourself dwelling on your present situation, try the following:


Take a walk and try to engage your senses (sight, touch, hearing, smell). Think about what you see and what you hear. Listen for the birds or the sound of laughter. Feel the crunch of leaves underfoot.
Remind yourself of how strong you are, and that you’ve handle hard times in the past and you have the skills to handle hard times in the present and future.
Set aside time to worry. Give yourself twenty minutes to think about all your concerns. Then, shut your worry box and move on with your day., Although it will take a lot of time to trust your partner again, share with him or her what needs to happen. For example, does your partner need to check in when leaving work? Perhaps you might want your partner to be accountable for his or her internet use. Another condition might be having established therapy or date nights. Whatever your conditions, state them clearly. It is your partner’s job to re-win your trust and respect.It is important that you communicate to your partner what you need from him or her to be able to build that trust.

, In order to create new memories, it can be useful to do something new. Whether a ballroom dance class or taking up scuba diving, making new, positive memories will fill your mind with different thoughts. Additionally, this will give you time to re-bond.

, Once you reach a certain point, offer to forgive your partner. This does not mean that you forget his or her offense. This does mean, however, that you will not hold the past against him or her indefinitely. Instead, you are willing to move forward., If you decide to reconcile with your partner, your future relationship will be different than what you previously imagined. You will still remember that he or she cheated. Although you might not achieve the same happiness as what you had previously, you can grow in your relationship.

Your thoughtfulness, kindness and compassion will make you unforgettable. If the relationship should end up not working out, the chances of your partner considering you “the one that got away” is almost a given.
The downside of giving without expecting anything in return is that it can eventually wear on you. You may become disillusioned and feel like you aren’t good enough to be a part of the relationship. Once these feelings start to be constant, it may be time to end the relationship. However, your actions and kindness before ending the relationship will not be forgotten and will still make you “the one that got away."";

This doesn’t mean you have to have the same level of interest in the subject as your partner, rather you’re showing you care by paying attention to something that is important to your partner. If your partner feels something is important enough to talk about, you should consider it important to pay attention.

If you are aware of a specific subject your partner views as important (for example, classic cars), make the effort to point out and notice that subject to your partner. In the classic car example, if you are on a drive with your partner and notice a classic car, point it out and ask an interesting question about it.

, Even if you are mad at your partner, try to avoid negative thoughts that may make you even more angry. Avoid thinking the worst possible scenario where your partner is involved. For example, if your partner forgot to pick up milk on the way home from work, chances are they did not do it on purpose, so don’t assume they did. Instead, assume it was simple forgetfulness or that there is something distracting going on.When something positive happens to your partner (e.g. a promotion at work) respond in a positive and constructive manner to the news. Acknowledge the achievement and only add comments that show your support or happiness. Avoid comments that are negative or critical.

, The concept that communication is vital in a relationship is cliche, but also true. Being able to have open and honest conversations with your partner is critical. However this communication should go deeper than simple discussions about groceries or what restaurant to eat at. This type of communication should include talk about how you and your partner are feeling, what is on your mind, things that may be bothering you, or things that are making your very happy.

Communication with your partner should also include topics that may be difficult to talk about. Not talking to your partner about something that is bothering you (e.g. the fact that your partner is constantly going out with friends instead of being with you) will only end up leading to resentment and anger.
Some of this communication may lead to arguments, but that’s okay. You aren’t expected to agree with everything your partner says and does. However, good communication with your partner means that you work out your disagreements respectfully and honestly. It may also mean you may need to make a compromise.
This type of communication is vital even if your partner does not contribute. The fact that you are open and honest with your partner means you are being the best partner you can possibly be. If the relationship doesn’t work out your partner will probably remember you as someone who was up front and honest and “the one that got away.

, Most people don’t mind doing “the same old thing” over and over again for a period of time, but it can get boring if it lasts too long. Most relationships need to be “stirred up” every now and again with something new, interesting and fun. This can be anything from taking a night off and going on a date, or spending a weekend together without cell phones and the internet.Regardless of whether your partner instigates any new and interesting things in your relationship, you should do this regularly. To make the events even more interesting, relate them to something your partner loves.
Should the relationship not work out, your ex-partner is going to remember you as the person who was always coming up with new and interesting things to do and keeping the relationship fun and exciting. This is definitely something that would make you “the one that got away.""

, In many relationships one or both partners attempt to change the other partner somehow. Society often makes jokes of this, especially when it comes to women changing men. Unfortunately it doesn’t really work that way. You may be able to influence small changes in your partner (e.g. saying please and thank you, holding the door open for you, etc.) but you are never going to be able to change who they really are — nor should you want to. You should be with your partner because you like (or love) them for who they are, what they stand for, how they act, etc. Don’t go into a relationship thinking your partner will be perfect if you can only make a few changes to them.If the relationship should end, your ex-partner is going to look back and realize you were the ONLY person who never attempted to make them change. If that doesn’t make you stand out as “the one who got away,” nothing will!

, If you had someone break up with you, one of your first thoughts might be that of revenge, especially if you didn’t see the breakup coming. You may think that getting revenge on the person who broke up with you might make you feel better, or at the very least give you a sense of justice, but it won’t. Revenge will just end up making you feel worse.

Don’t make any decisions after a break up until you are calm and rational. Give yourself time to heal before you ‘do’ anything.
You most likely want revenge because you feel your trust has been broken, but getting revenge is not going to help to restore any of that trust.

, Whether you were the one who initiated the break-up, or someone broke up with you, you need to let go of any regret you may harbour. If someone broke up with you, you likely had little or no control over the event, so it is a waste of your time to dwell on what might have been. If you broke up with someone, you probably had a good reason. Remind yourself of that good reason when you start to feel regretful in order to demonstrate to yourself why you shouldn’t be upset you broke up with someone.Regardless of what happened, take the time to look at what weaknesses you might have that lead to the breakup.
Whether you discover weaknesses or mistakes, realize that this is your change you learn from them. How can you do things differently in the future?
Focus on things you can control and change. Try not to worry about the things out of your control.

, Whether you broke up with someone, or someone broke up with you, it is really easy to think of all the negative things that came from the breakup — things like feeling depressed and lonely. Try not to focus on these negative things, instead look at all the good and positive things that can (or have) come from the breakup.

Write your feelings in a journal. Write specifically about the positive things that have happened because of the breakup.
These positive things might be things you learned while in the relationship, or they may be the good reasons why the breakup was necessary. They can also include the positive outcomes that have resulted because of the breakup.

, Before you started to date this person you probably had a routine that you followed regularly. That routine was probably dropped or changed once you started dating. Now that you no longer have anyone else to worry about, get back into your routine.Start up your normal exercise routine again. Get back into the shape you were before the relationship.
Spend more time working on extra work or home projects, anything you put aside during your relationship because you had no time.
Plan and cook healthy meals regularly.
Schedule and attend any missed or delayed appointments such as the dentist or the eye doctor.

, When in a relationship you always have two people on the top of your priority list — you and your partner. Now that you’re no longer in a relationship you can concentrate on just taking care of yourself and making yourself the priority. Avoid sacrificing your time for others, make yourself the priority everyday., There is absolutely no rush to start dating again. If you’ve constantly been in relationships for years, maybe it’s time to be alone for a while and concentrate on yourself. Not only do you need to be ready to start a new relationship, you need to know you have the time and energy to dedicate to both the relationship and your new partner. There’s nothing wrong with wanting a little bit longer if you aren’t sure., While it may be tempting to jump back into the dating market again without a lot of thought, you’ll find yourself having more success if you take some time to think about what you want first. Think about what you do and don’t want in a new partner. Think about the type of relationship you want to have with a new partner., When it’s time for you to start dating again, start by making some new friends. You never know if one of your new friends may one day be your new partner. When looking for new friends, look for the good in people. Don’t judge new friends on the way your old friends or partners once treated you., It may be tempting to get back into the dating world by contacting your ex-partner and seeing if you can reconcile. If you are to be the one who got away, you can’t be the one who is chasing someone else. Instead you want to be the one who is chased.

, If and when you start to date again, don’t spend any of your time with your new partner talking about any old partners. They’re in the past, so keep them there. Your new partner will not appreciate you focusing on someone else, instead focus on your new partner.Spend your time learning about your new partner. Ask questions, tell funny stories, talk about family or work or school, etc.
If you new partner asks about any of your old partners, don’t spend your time complaining about all the bad things you remember. Stick to the interesting stories and basic facts.

Most communities offer shelters for victims of domestic violence. Couples and families may open up their homes to victims, too., Victims of domestic violence may be ashamed by their abuse and unwilling to receive help. They may not like it if you put them on the spot with a group intervention. However, it may be helpful to enlist a few allies to talk to your loved one and offer their support in a way that doesn't make the person feel pressured.If you can show your friend that there are others in the community who want to help, they may be more motivated to stay away from their ex.

Be prepared for new relationships.",How to Be Friends After a Breakup," If you're going to remain friends, you can't have a dramatic, no-holds-barred breakup. When you're breaking up with each other, you need to resolve any major issues without slinging mud and hatred at each other.

That doesn't mean that you need to breakup without any sadness. Of course you're both going to be upset and sad. It's hard to let go of something so important to your life. However, it does mean that you need to be respectful of each other to the end.
Before deciding if you want to be friends, consider how you broke up. If you were constantly fighting, didn't like to be together, and stopped having good conversations, you may not want to continue any kind of relationship.;
, Once you break up with each other, you need to take some time away from each other. You can't just jump from being lovey-dovey to being friends. You can't rush this period; each of you has to be ready to move into a different type of relationship. There is no set amount of time to determine how long the transition to friendship will take because it is unique to every situation and each person involved.

, While you're apart, figure out how your new life is going to look. Time once filled with being with your significant other now has to be filled with something else. Find ways to make your life joyful, from spending time with good friends to picking up a hobby like painting or rock climbing.

It doesn't matter what you do, you just need to figure out new habits, so you don't slip into old ones with your ex., Letting go is a grieving process, and that's fine. However, you need to make sure you are still taking care of yourself and your health. Try to sleep on a schedule, and eat well. If you're feeling down, treat yourself to something fun, such as a nice dinner, a pedicure, or a ticket to a basketball game.

, While it may be tempting to rehash old arguments, once you're friends, it's time to let it go. You don't have a right to criticize how he spends his time or how she likes to dress. Be supportive, and try not to move into old patterns of criticism.

, That is, if you were friends before you got together, think about how you interacted then. That can help you forge ahead with a new relationship.

, Don't jump into going out three times a week. Stick with a couple a times a month at first. Too much too quickly could force the friendship to break apart.

, If you try to do the same things you always did as a couple, you're likely to find it awkward. You associate those places with the romantic side of the relationship, and you're trying to create a different type of relationship. Therefore, it's best to pick new things to do together, especially things that won't leave you alone together.

Try going out with a group of friends, for instance, or heading to somewhere with a big crowd, such as big concert., You don't have the same conversations with a lover that you do with a friend. If you want to keep your ex at a friendship level, you need to keep the conversations there, too.

Focus on general topics such as current world news instead of very personal ones like your dog passing away., Your ex may decide he or she doesn't want to be friends with you, and that's fine. Sometimes, you just have too much history with a person to move on in a different capacity.

, If you're constantly having to deal with questions about why you're still friends with the person, it can hinder your friendship. Tell your friends and family that you are going to be friends with the person, and you expect them to support that decision.

, You both need to make boundaries about when it's appropriate to call or stop by. You also need to decide where you're willing to go together. Basically, any form of contact with each other needs rules that you both need to respect and follow.

You may decide to no longer go to the same restaurants you used to dine at while you were a couple., That is, to truly be friends, you can't be hanging on to the idea that you can still get back together with your ex. Examine your feelings and see if you think you are over the person enough to hang out with him or her without being more involved.

, It will be hard to see your ex with someone new, but you need to realize it's going to happen. While neither of you needs to rub it in the other's face, it's bound to happen sooner or later that one of you gets with someone new. You'll only be able to be friends with the person if you realize that he or she has the right to be with someone new.

Stay away from him.,
Avoid his friends when you can.,
Avoid places and activities that may trigger temptation.,
Stay polite but distant when you can't avoid contact.,
Don't view your relationship through rose-colored glasses.,
Don't devote yourself to getting revenge.",How to Avoid Falling for Your Ex Boyfriend1," When it comes to dealing with the fallout of a breakup, follow the motto, ""Out of sight, out of mind."" The less you run into your ex, the better. There may be times when you're forced to see him or you run into him by accident. Outside of these times, do your best to avoid contact.In today's world, ""staying away"" also means cutting off contact via social media. Unfriend him, stop following his posts, delete his number in your phone. Break the chain that connects you, at least temporarily. You can possibly reconsider making some new connections later on.Avoiding him isn't a way of showing that you hate your old partner. Instead, you're showing that being around this person makes you feel confusing, uncomfortable emotions (which is most likely true).;
, Breaking up can be especially hard if you were used to spending lots of time with his friends. However, if you can, limit your exposure to these people. Being around your ex's friends will only remind you of the memories you shared with your ex and you will have trouble getting over him.Cutting off contact with these friends will probably only exacerbate your sense of loss, but it is a pain you need to go through in order to get past your ex and move forward. You may be able to reconnect with some of these friends later on.
If you don't have many friends who aren't close to your ex, hang out with a few of your most trusted friends that you can count on to be sympathetic. You may also want to try to focus your efforts on making new friends (though this can be tough if you're feeling blue).

, It may be hard to (at least temporarily) give up your favorite restaurant, or listening to your favorite band, or doing the crossword in the Sunday paper, but if these are things you shared with your boyfriend, they could become temptation traps. You might associate such things so strongly with him that you can't help but pine for him.


Remember, you're trying to break a type of addiction, and if you were trying to quit drinking, you wouldn't hang out at your favorite bar.Eventually you should be able to reclaim favorite places and things for yourself, but it is best to play it safe by not risking temptation while your breakup is still fresh.
The worst-case scenario would be running into your ex at your favorite restaurant or the first spot where you kissed, so avoidance is the most prudent option.

, Sometimes, you may be forced to see your ex face-to-face. Maybe he's in your biology class, or lives down the street, or works at your local grocery store. In these cases, it's not worth your effort to make a scene or try to hurt his feelings. Instead, smile and be pleasant, but keep your conversations short. Doing this will help prevent him from bringing back any difficult emotions.Despite its common existence in sitcoms and other forms of popular culture, it is rarely a good idea to be ""just friends"" with your ex. If he was at fault for the breakup, you are only minimizing or even validating his mistreatment of you by deeming him worthy of friendship. Even if the breakup was mutual or faultless, you'll find it even more difficult to escape the ""addiction"" of your romantic feelings for him if he's always around as a friend.
Remember, happiness is the best revenge. If you're angry at your ex over the breakup, showing him that you're doing well without him is a great way to subtly show him the mistake he's made.

, In the time after a breakup, it can be difficult to think about your old relationship logically. Give yourself a few days to mourn, but then try to see things how they really were. The simple fact that you broke up in the first place means that your relationship wasn't perfect. Remembering the bad parts of the relationship alongside the good will make it a lot harder to fall for your ex again.Not sure what went wrong? Search your heart. Be honest with yourself. Was one of you unhappy? Did you have different life priorities? Was there a lack of trust? Were you treated with respect? Were you betrayed?
Honestly examining a past relationship can not only help you move on from it, but also better prepare you for the next one by helping you to identify potential problems and ""warning signs"" ahead of time.

, After a nasty breakup, the urge to get even with your ex may be strong. You may start to think that bashing up his car or embarrassing him in front of his new partner are good ideas. They aren't. This sort of behavior shows that you're still obsessed with your old partner. To others, it can seem petty and childish, leading to embarrassment for you in the long run. Don't give in to hate. Instead, work to get over your ex so that you never have to think about him again.Depending on why you broke up in the first place, you may even feel guilty after a mean-spirited prank. If your boyfriend cheated on you, you may indeed hate his guts. If he never betrayed your trust, though, and you broke up after a fight or something similar, you may not really want to see him unhappy.
The minuscule rush you may feel after exacting your revenge on your ex can never make up for the extra time you wasted obsessing over him instead of moving on with your life. In almost every case, revenge is not ""a dish best served cold""; it is a dish best not served at all.

Recognize that not all exes are friend material.,

Don't pretend that nothing's changed.,
Tell other people that you're just friends.,
Show that you still care about him.,
Know the signs that show he's still into you.,
Explain things very clearly to a new BF.,
Don't fall into old patterns.,
Make sure your ex and you aren't still hurting.,
Allow your relationship to gradually deepen.",How to Be Friends With Your Ex Boyfriend," There are are a variety of reasons for not becoming friends with an ex-boyfriend. He may still have his heart set on you - in this case, hanging out with him as a mere friend is cruel. The opposite may be true - if you're still into him, you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment. Finally, your breakup may have been because of something so serious that it's impossible to look at each other without resentment. If either of you has been deeply hurt, give each other a wide berth.


Even if he's calm, emotionally stable, and your history doesn't contain any gaping wounds, you simply might not want to see your ex again. This is fine. Exes don't necessarily have to be friends.;
, Even the cleanest breakups can be the cause of hard feelings for both parties. Immediately after a breakup, there's a chance he'll be sad or angry. This is no time to approach him as a friend. Wait for his emotional waters to settle before proceeding.


Similarly, listen to your own heart. If you've still got lingering anger or you're a little depressed, give yourself some time to settle before you make contact.
The length of time you spend apart from each other after a breakup will likely depend on the circumstances of the breakup itself. ""Messier"" breakups can require months or even years before your feelings have calmed to the point where a normal, friendly relationship is possible.

, The period after a breakup is a great opportunity for reflection and self-improvement. After you've given your emotions some time to normalize, spend the time you previously spent with your boyfriend on yourself instead. Devote yourself to your hobbies or schoolwork. Spend time learning a new skill. Do things you like to do, alone or with friends. By improving yourself, you're also restoring your self-confidence and your sense of self-reliance, which will make it much easier to start new friendships (and, coincidentally, romances.)


After a few weeks of self-improvement, you may find that you don't even think about your ex anymore! This will make it much easier to either start a new friendship with him or ignore him entirely - whichever you choose.

, After you've spent some serious time on yourself and you feel ready to take the plunge, call, text, email, or otherwise contact your ex. Test the waters gently - you may want to talk to one of his friends first to get a sense of his emotional state beforehand. Keep things as light as possible - don't talk about your old relationship or your break up. Just say that you haven't seen him in a long time and you'd like to casually meet up. If you're truly ""over it"", this should be the truth!


If your ex doesn't immediately respond to your attempts to make contact, don't try again right away. He may not have progressed past the relationship as quickly as you have. Give him more time.
Whatever you do, don't leave dozens of messages on his phone! If you feel the temptation to do this, you're almost certainly not ready for a friendship yet.

, Hang out with your ex on small social outings. At first, keep hang outs short and modest - a trip to a cafe or an art museum, for instance. Keep a full schedule (or at least pretend to.) If things get awkward, you can always use the excuse that you're running late for something else to get out of there!



Definitely don't do anything together that can be construed as a date. Don't stay out late, drink alcohol, or go dancing. You could find yourself falling for each other again, and if you haven't fixed the things that led to your breakup, you'll be setting yourself up for future heartbreak. Worse, you could ruin any new romances either of you has started with other people.

, Your ex might be confused about your intentions if you're not perfectly clear with him about what you want. Simply say, ""I hope we can still be friends"" or ask the question ""We're still friends, right?"" Don't leave this issue unaddressed - if you're vague about what you want from your new relationship, he might think you're trying to get back together with him. Spare yourself some terrible drama by being open and honest with him from the get-go.

, One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to act like nothing's happened after a breakup. Doing so gives off the impression that you never cared. It can really hurt his feelings - at this point, that shouldn't be something you're trying to do. After you make contact, acknowledge your breakup without dwelling on it. You might try using phrases like these:


""I'm so glad I got to see you again.""
""I really hope you're doing better. I am.""
""I want to move on and start over as friends.""

, If his friends knew about your old relationship, they'll be curious to know what's going on. If you have any reason to suspect he won't be honest with his friends, don't let him spin them a lie. Tell them you're looking to be friends with him and nothing more. If they hear from him that you're desperate to get back together but they hear from you that you're not, they'll probably (correctly) assume that he's the desperate one.


This has an added benefit - he'll probably talk to his friends, and they'll tell him that you said your relationship is only a friendly one. If he sees that you're defining your relationship in platonic terms in front of other people, he'll have a greater incentive to respect your opinion.
If you have a new boyfriend or he has a new girlfriend, be sure to make your friendly intentions clear to these people right away. Even if you do, feelings of jealousy may be unavoidable - if so, you'll have to weigh these against your new friendship with your ex.

, Make sure that he knows he can still turn to you when he's feeling down. If he is having a bad day, talk to him. Show him that you still care for his feelings. However, do this as a friend would - don't hold him, hug him, or do anything else that might rouse old feelings. Instead, offer to talk to him - often, he'll appreciate being able to talk about his problems to someone who understands him well.


Conversely, let him (respectfully) show that he cares about you. He probably does. Accept his good wishes and talk to him if you need to, but don't let him use your vulnerability as an excuse to get into your heart again.

, It's difficult for anyone to suddenly view someone they used to love as a mere platonic friend. Some people simply can't do it. If your ex boyfriend is showing any of the following behavior, you may want to consider giving him more time to move on:


Calling or texting you regularly without a specific reason
Constantly talking to your friends
Making inappropriate, overly-intimate jokes or references
Bringing up things about your old relationship
Touching or brushing up against you, accidentally or otherwise

, If you've gotten a new boyfriend since you broke up with your ex, the situation becomes substantially more complex. Even the most understanding boyfriends will likely be a little jealous at first. Some may never stop being jealous. The best you can do is to clearly and calmly explain that you're not ""into"" your old ex. Explain to your current boyfriend that you love him only and that you're just looking for harmless, inconsequential fun with the ex - nothing more. Make it very, very clear that you don't (even better if you say that you can't ) think of your ex in ""that way"" any more.


Your ex will also need to have this conversation with his new significant other, if he has one.
Don't do anything to give your new boyfriend any reason to suspect foul play. For instance, don't stay out later than you said you would until he becomes comfortable with you hanging around your ex. However, if your new boyfriend is acting very paranoid about your new friendship (constantly texting you for updates while you're hanging out with the ex, etc.), it's OK to dress him down. If you've given him no reason not to trust you, you deserve his trust.

, If you want to be friends with an ex, do not do the things you used to do when you were dating. If you do, you're inviting inappropriate feelings of infidelity (if you have a new boyfriend) and setting yourself up for a ""relapse"" and possible heartbreak. Start anew - take the opportunity to experience new sights and activities as friends.


Avoid locations you used to visit - don't go to the restaurant you used to get breakfast at or the bar where you first met.
Refuse to participate in the activities you used to do together - if he invites you to feed the ducks at the park like you used to do every Sunday, tell him you'd rather meet for coffee.

, Initial interactions with your ex can be tense, but, with luck, this will soon give way to cordial politeness. Once you've let your guards down, however, you may discover that one or both of you still harbors emotional wounds. Deep-rooted feelings of betrayal and heartbreak can take time to emerge. If you encounter these things, they may be signs that you and your ex aren't ready to be friends yet.


If you get sad or angry around your ex despite both of you projecting a happy exterior, or if you always feel that you want to say more to him than you can politely say, your problems might not be sorted out yet. Take some time off from your friendship.
Conversely, if he seems moody or irritable or he won't talk to you about anything meaningful despite his willingness to meet, he's probably thinking about your old relationship and/or the things that led you to break up. You can ask him if he is, but be warned that this can push him towards irrational anger or sadness.

, Over time, you may grow close to each other again. Take things slowly - only allow your friendship to mature when doing so seems natural. Establish boundaries for yourself early on - things you won't do or talk about with this person - and only lift the boundaries when you're sure you can trust him


Equally likely is the possibility that you find you don't like being friends with your ex! In this case, just stop hanging out with him, but be warned - he might not give up as easily. Awkward feelings of clingy-ness are, unfortunately, a very real possibility when trying to start a friendship with an ex.

Distract yourself with things you enjoy.,
Stay off the topic of boys when you're with your friends.,
Focus on the positives of being single.,
Keep active.,
Don't be afraid to check out other guys.",How to Avoid Falling for Your Ex Boyfriend2," After a breakup, it's OK to treat yourself a little. Not only will this make you feel better, it's also good for resisting the urge to spend time with your ex. When you're at home feeling down and starting to think that a reunion would be a good idea, divert your attention to something you know you love. Basically, you want to replace one ""addiction"" for another, healthier one.For example, you can try putting on your favorite music, baking your favorite pastry, or playing your favorite sport. With luck, you won't be thinking about your ex for long.
Consider relying on portable distractions when you get wistful for your ex outside of the house (like, for example, on the train). Playing music, movies, or games on your phone, or putting a good old-fashioned book in your backpack, can be very useful for this.

, Spending time with your most trusted friends is a fantastic idea after a breakup. However, some topics of conversation aren't very helpful. Try to avoid talking about boys when you're hanging out. Your ex is especially off limits, but boys and romance in general should also be avoided. Hearing your friends talk about their partners can make you miss your ex, even if he has nothing to do with these people.


This can, understandably, be a little awkward to bring up. It's OK to say something like, ""Hey, do you mind if we don't talk about boys tonight?"" Your friends should get the idea, but if they don't, you might follow up with something a little more pointed, like ""I'm just trying to get my mind off the subject.""
Watch out for what is known as the ""white bear"" example, though. (The name comes from the idea that if someone tells you not to think of a white bear, the first image likely to pop into your head is a white bear.) If you make too big a deal about not talking about your ex or boys/relationships in general, you may inadvertently steer the conversation that way., Though it may not seem like it at first, being without a partner can have some major benefits. Keeping these in mind will make getting back with your partner seem much less appealing.Here are just a few things the newly-single you can be happy about, guilt-free:


You now get to spend more of your money on yourself.
You now have time to pursue more of your favorite hobbies and interests.
You no longer have to do things that you don't like just to make your partner happy.
You don't have to hang out with any of your partner's unappealing friends.
You are now free to pursue other, even better guys.

, Breaking up can leave you feeling depressed and sapped of energy for a while. As soon as you can, take the opportunity to get up, get out of the house, and start being active in all of your favorite ways. Physical exercise is especially valuable as it has proven anti-depressant effects.However, almost any sort of activity is a good idea. Simply venturing outdoors and doing something can make you feel better.Keep your mind and body busy by volunteering, tackling a home improvement project, or some other tasks that force your mind away from your ex. Eventually, by giving your mind other options to focus on, the urge to think about your ex will diminish and vanish.

, Even if you broke up on good terms, your ex isn't the only good guy in the world. There are good people everywhere, but it's up to you to meet them! Don't let yourself get into the mindset that your ex was the only one you can ever love. As soon as you feel those familiar ""sparks"" with someone new, you'll realize just how wrong you were.You may be concerned about getting into a ""rebound"" relationship, perhaps with someone who isn't as good as you deserve or someone who is too much like your ex (and acting almost as a replacement). You may want to take some time before getting involved with someone else, but that doesn't mean you can't look! Have fun ""scouting"" the area before you decide to wade back into the dating waters.

However, neglecting your health at this time will only worsen your situation, and can result in sickness or injury. To cope with the estrangement of your child, sibling, parent, or other loved one, strive to take care of yourself. Good health can be accomplished by:Eating between 3 and 5 balanced meals of whole, real foods, including vegetables, fruit, lean meats and protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. Avoid processed or refined foods.Getting regular exercise. Speak to your physician about a workout plan that suits you age, gender, and physical abilities. Perform this routine regularly for better health and an improved mood.Sleeping 7 to 9 hours each night. Develop a sleep routine that includes time to unwind with a novel, magazine, or journaling. Shut off all electronics an hour prior to bedtime. Abstain from alcohol or caffeine as they effect the quality and quantity of sleep you get.Avoiding unnecessary stressors like work piling up or being late by preparing for each day the night before. Make to-do lists and check off tasks as they are complete. Practice deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation to minimize stress.;
, When your relationship is fizzling out with one person, turn to others you trust for support and a listening ear. You may want to vent about the other person, or explain your point-of-view that was never heard. Calling on a friend or family member who has your best interests in mind can help you get through this difficult time in your life., That's not true. You can express to the person you are estranged from - or another person who is in contact with them - what your boundaries are. Maybe you want it to be known that this person cannot alienate you from their life, and then call on your for financial assistance. If this is what you expect, say it.


Use ""I"" statements for boundary setting.For example, ""I will not be able to pay for your housing any longer"" or ""I will not tolerate you making unauthorized charges on my credit card"".

, Just as you want your own boundaries to be respected, you must demonstrate respect for what the other person needs at this time. Abide by the boundaries this person sets forth, without breaking them. If your daughter says she needs time to think, avoid reaching out to her - wait until she contacts you. This ensures that you don't worsen the situation by not valuing the other person's needs.

, Journaling can be a great way to unload the painful thoughts and feelings you are having regarding the estrangement. In some cases, you may feel numb, and the only way to truly know what you feel is by writing it out on paper.There are many ways you can journal.One option is to distract yourself from the current negative feelings you have about this person and write, in vivid detail, about a good time you shared.
Another method for journaling - and better understanding your feelings about the estrangement - is to describe them in unconventional ways. You might describe the feeling if it were a color, a sound, weather, or a landscape. For instance, saying what you feel is bright red might help you to analyze this feeling as anger or possibly intense hurt and rejection.

, If you have been in a relationship with another person that is unhealthy, destructive, or abusive, you have every right to distance yourself from that person. People often become estranged from those they love due to criminal behaviors or lifestyles, betrayal, addiction, mental illness or differing religious beliefs.


If you have tried on countless occasions to get help for an addicted, mentally ill, or abusive loved one with no success, distancing yourself may keep you safe both physically and emotionally. No matter how much it hurts, it can be the only way you can limit the pain.

, When relationships fall apart it isn't usually all one person's fault. Forgive yourself, and try to forgive the other person, too. Forgiving does not mean forgetting. It only means choosing to accept the situation as it has happened, and not giving it power of your future well-being. You can learn to forgive yourself by:


Recognizing that all humans make mistakes
Identifying when you are beating yourself up
Challenging your unrealistic expectations
Practicing gratitude

, Let go of past hurts, let go of failed promises, let go of your future hopes. Do a small ritual to symbolize the end of the relationship or your pain about the relationship failing.


One idea for a letting go ritual is to write a letter to the person who offended you or whom you offended explaining your side of things and asking for forgiveness. You can choose to actually mail this letter or you can throw it into a fire or rip it into shreds. Either way you have gotten it off your chest and you are choosing to move past it.
Other ideas include boxing up mementos of that person to represent the end of the relationship. You might also say a long, heartfelt prayer about the individual, wishing them love and light in the future. Finally, you can either collect some flowers and let them float away down a stream or light a lantern and let it float away in the sky.

, If you are the estranged, and have been excluded from the life of someone you love, give them time. Depending on the hurt, it can take months or even years to move beyond the pain - if ever. Just extend your love and hopes that you might resolve the issue in the future. Maybe send a card or letter to the person you love and miss, letting him or her know that you will be happy to see or talk to them if they ever want that. Don't pressure the person. If your loved one wants to mend the relationship, she will, in time.


It may be nice to send a note or card once, but, if the other person specifically demanded that you not contact him or her, it may be best to respect their wishes and not make contact at all.

, If the pain regarding your estrangement, distracts you from your everyday life, or you find yourself unable to participate in normal responsibilities, consult with a psychologist or therapist. This professional may help you resolve feelings of guilt, shame, or confusion associated with an estrangement.

, Going through an estrangement is difficult enough without you having to endure the pain with no support system. Friends may be helpful in offering consolation, but you may choose to get advice and companionship from others who are going through similar circumstances.


Search for Family Estrangement Meetups in your area in order to connect with locals who are dealing with estrangements.If you can't find a local group, join an online support group., However, reflection performed after a significant life change such as estrangement can help you become aware of your personal strengths and faults. The estrangement may not have been your choice, but you still played some role in it. Bringing awareness to the role you played may help you to recognize the good and the bad in your behaviors, and help you to make positive changes for the benefit of future relationships.


Think about accusations that the other person made. Move aside your anger and resentment and take a clear, accurate look at yourself and your behaviors.
Is there any chance that this person was speaking the truth? Were you over-protective or constantly guilt-tripping the other person? Take a moment to reflect on your actions and decide if these are traits you want to improve about yourself.

, After an estrangement, focus on making good changes in your life. Is there anything that you have wanted to do, but put off? For example, maybe you always wanted to teach an art class, learn a new language, or start a business. Seek out the resources to guide you in accomplishing personal goals. This will help you to feel better about yourself, and keep your life moving in a positive direction.

, A quality social life is one of the key factors of reaching optimal health.You may feel like a horrible parent, sibling, spouse, or friend, but you cannot give up on the other people who love you because one person chose to terminate their relationship with you. Take extra time to improve your other relationships.

, Fill your social calendar and your schedule so that you do not have so much free time to think about the estrangement. Research shows that people actually prefer to be busy, and are happier for it., Challenge yourself to try something new. Doing so can give you greater confidence in your abilities and, depending on the chosen activity, help you foster new relationships. Painting, traveling, gardening, writing, playing bingo, or learning to salsa can all be rewarding hobbies that make your life feel more fulfilling and purposeful. Find something you enjoy doing, and engage in this activity often."

This step is absolutely crucial; talk it out if necessary. While this is an extremely emotional time, it is important to ensure you are both certain on where the other stands.;
, This is very hard to do, but not impossible. If you feel like giving in and begging your ex to take you back, give a caring friend your phone, or generally avoid contact with you ex, if only for the moment. The desperation will pass and you'll feel better for not letting your emotions talk for you. There is a reason you broke up; getting back together immediately will not be healthy for either of you in the long run.

, Try not to think about the sadness of the break up, either. You need to focus on the current day and nothing else; give yourself goals and try to achieve them, like tell yourself you will clean your room or finish that last chapter of that book you wanted to read.

, If this means texting them asking how they are or what they're doing, that's okay (but make sure you pick up the signs, you will know if they don't want to be disturbed). It is pretty important here to keep a normal routine.

, Maybe even take a few days for yourself to cry whenever you need to, without judgment or feeling embarrassed. Take a sick day from work, or skip school or uni for a day. Grab a box of tissues, some chocolate, and a friend or a stuffed animal, and go to town. Crying is healing, and after a day or two you will not want to cry any more.

, All that crying and stressing can play havoc with your body, and it is essential that you look after yourself as much as possible.

, Go to bed early and get a sleep in. Sleep is very, very good.

, If you think about something upsetting, come up with a con for it, e.g: ""I'll miss sharing a bed"" could instead be ""But I don't have to fight for the blankets!"" Thinking is what can hurt you the most, so be careful.

, Deep breaths work like a charm. If they are as keen as you are to continue being friends, they will be trying to do the same thing.

, Be polite, answer their questions, and ask questions if you want to. Try to stay away from touchy topics, as both of you will still be upset; that is normal. Smile as much as possible. They will know you're upset, but it's good to act like you're not.

, That way you will both be more inclined to keep seeing each other as friends, and that's the overall goal!

Do not try to interact with a violent or otherwise abusive ex.",How to Act Around Your Ex," You’re used to being emotionally and physically intimate with each other, so don’t expect to establish new relationship patterns right away.


Don’t seek your ex out socially, especially at first. Experts recommend taking at least eight weeks without any sort of contact.Seeing your ex right after the breakup can make it more difficult to move on.;
, Be friendly and respectful without indicating too much closeness.Keep your interactions light. Especially if you have not seen each other in a while, resist the urge to address long-simmering relationship issues.You: Hi, Dave. Did you catch the game last night?
Him: I did. They need new management.
You: The relief pitcher looked pretty good. Maybe he should have started.
Him: Yeah, I didn't understand that decision.
You: Well, good seeing you. Hopefully they make it to the post-season.


If your ex brings up a contentious issue, try changing the subject to something you agree on.Him: Hi, Melanie. Did you try the pierogies?
You: I did. They remind me of the ones your mom always made.
Him: How would you know? You never went to visit her.
You: I think we both appreciated her cooking.
Him: That's true.



, Emotions will already be riding high. If you’re drinking, you’ll be less inhibited and more likely to say something that you’ll regret.

, Unfriend him on Facebook and avoid him on other forms of social media. Yes, keeping tabs on an ex online is tempting—you want to know if he is miserable without you, if he has started dating someone new, etc. Research shows that it is better to avoid this temptation, though.It’s easy for these behaviors to get obsessive, turning into what psychologists call “interpersonal electronic surveillance” and the rest of us call Facebook stalking.
It’s also bad for your own emotional health. Like seeing your ex in person, interacting with him online can make the heartbreak last longer.If you do insist on continuing to follow your ex on social media, remember that what you are seeing is a highly selective view of his life. Don’t think that you’re struggling more than he is just because he doesn’t post about it.

, Many people want to stay friends after a breakup, which makes sense—you enjoyed being around your ex at one point, and he was a large part of your social life. Why shouldn’t you continue to act as you did before, going to baseball games together, calling him to vent about your boss, or asking for his jacket when you get cold? Plenty of reasons, it turns out.


Maintain physical and emotional distance to avoid ambiguity. Behaviors like flirting and touching can cause confusion for both of you.Limit your interactions. You shouldn’t be checking in multiple times a day, or even once every day. It’s fine to be friends, but your ex should not be the person you turn to first with good or bad news.You should not pursue a friendship with your ex as a guise for trying to get him back. If you want to rekindle the romance and he does not, you are better off cutting off contact entirely.

, With overlapping social circles, you and your ex will likely run into each other at special occasions including birthday parties, graduations, and weddings, probably for years to come. Be prepared for this inevitability. Don’t ignore each other at big events, but don’t sit together, either. If you’re not on the best terms, you run the risk of making a scene. Plus, don’t want to have to answer questions all night long about whether you two are back together.
Divide up smaller events. You can both go to your friend’s play, but you might not both want to go to the intimate dinner she’s having afterward. No one likes to miss out on fun events, but it can be preferable to the alternative of a huge confrontation.

, Try to keep your relationship issues separate from your career or education. Ideally, you have been doing this all along, but if not you will have to have a conversation about it. You don’t want fallout from a breakup to jeopardize your success at work or in school.If seeing your ex makes you emotional, consider changing up your routine to avoid her. Take your breaks at different times, and plot out different courses to the copy machine.
Imagine that your boss is watching you whenever you interact with your ex. This will add extra motivation to stay professional.

, If your ex breaks the “be professional at all times” pledge and starts discussing relationship issues with you, ask her to table the issue until later, or simply choose only to respond to professional communications. If this is absolutely impossible, make sure your discussion is taking place behind closed doors or via personal (not professional) phone or email.You: Do you have that report ready to give to the boss?
Her: I do. But before we talk about that, I really need to know when you're going to give me my stuff back.
You: Can we talk about that later?
Her: I really need it soon.
You: OK. Please call me or email me after work so we can come up with a plan.

, If you’re worried about being caught alone with your ex while you’re microwaving your lunch, consider taking colleagues with you. Any awkwardness between the two of you will be less visible in a bigger group.

, When you hear that your ex is dating someone new, resist the urge to look her up online. At the same time, accept that you will run into them eventually. Whether this is a planned or chance meeting, approach it with confidence.


Face the situation head-on. You won’t want to, but it’s actually better for you to deal with them than it is to pretend not to see them and duck into a store when you’re out for a walk. You WILL survive the situation, and once you do you will feel much more confident in your ability to move on.
Know that confidence can sometimes work from the outside in. If you know you’re going to be running into your ex and his new partner, wear whatever you feel most comfortable and confident in. This will make you feel more relaxed and at ease on the inside, as well.

, You can be polite and civil without pretending that you are going to hang out regularly, which could come across as fake.You: Hi, Kate. Nice to meet you.
Her: Hi, Rachel. I've heard a lot about you.
You: How long have you lived in Chicago?
Her: I moved here for college.
You: Where did you go?
Her: Northwestern.
You: Me too. I wonder if we took any classes together.

, Know that the meeting is awkward for everyone. Your ex is probably not trying to hurt you by moving on. In the meantime, his new partner probably feels that you are the one she is being compared to in terms of looks, career, personality, etc. Everyone wants to get through the interaction as calmly—and probably quickly—as possible, and in that way you are all on the same side.

, It can be difficult, but seeing your ex with a new partner can be a useful guide to your own recovery. This is especially true when it comes to evaluating whether or not you are ready to start dating again., Know that you will have to interact with each other, probably a lot. Break-ups get even more complicated when children are involved. More people’s emotions are at stake, and you cannot simply avoid your ex as you might wish to. Researchers believe that co-parenting is best for children.Co-parenting involves sharing both time and decision-making, which requires maintaining open and frequent communication with your ex.
If it is too difficult to communicate openly and directly, consider passing a notebook back and forth that includes any important information about your children’s time with you., As you make these arrangements, try to maintain amicability toward your ex. Shouting, name-calling, and other forms of conflict can negatively affect your children and undermine their relationship with their other parent.You: John, I know this is difficult, but I need you to tell me what time you will be picking up the kids.
Him: Stop nagging. I'll pick them up after work.
You: I understand that this sounds like nagging to you, but I have things I need to do tonight.
Him: Fine, I'll pick them up at six.

, Take whatever action is required to protect yourself and your children."
"
Deal with your feelings.,
Examine your motives.,
Give yourself time.,
Practice calming techniques.",How to Be Nice to an Ex1," Before you can be nice to your ex, you will have to address any feelings you have about the relationship or about your ex.It will be difficult for you to be nice if you still resent your ex for something they did or if you are still hurt from the breakup.


Keep in mind that it is important to release your feelings of resentment, anger, pain, and frustration. You can do this any way that is helpful to you, such as by using self-talk, talking to a close friend, or journaling. The most important thing is to let it go. Hanging on to feelings of resentment will do you no good.
Write in your journal about how you honestly feel about your ex and the relationship. For example, you might write, “I’m over her and the relationship. I’m happy with my new love and just want to be cordial with my ex.”
Admit to yourself if you still have feelings that might make being nice to your ex difficult. For example, if you are still angry at your ex for cheating on you, then being nice may take a lot of effort.;
, In some situations, like when children are involved, being nice to an ex is almost necessary. Other times it’s simply your choice. Determine if you want to be nice to your ex simply because you are a nice person, or if you have an underlying motive for your actions. It may be harder you to be genuinely nice if you know that you are only being nice to reach a secret goal.


Ask yourself if you are being nice because you are secretly trying to get back together. Ask yourself if that’s really a good idea.
Are you wanting to be nice to your ex just to prove to them that you are over them (even though you aren’t)?
Trying to prove that you have moved on by being nice can backfire, especially if doing so causes your ex to do or say something to upset you.
Do you want to be nice because you truly are over the relationship and just want to be polite and considerate?

, Being nice is generally a good thing. But, immediately after the breakup and for some time after it, it may be too painful for one or both of you to even be in the same room without problems.If you give yourself (and your ex) time, however, you will be able to be nice your ex.


For the first few days, or even weeks, after the breakup, you may need to avoid your ex just to give both of you time to heal.
Don’t feel like you have to be nice if you aren’t ready to. It’s okay to give yourself time to get over your ex before trying to be pleasant.
Make sure to take plenty of time to work through the anger, hurt, and pain. It is important for you to learn how to live without depending on the other person. Spend time with friends and work on building these connections. After some time has passed, you may even be able to have a friendship with your ex.

, These strategies can help you acknowledge and process your emotions. Practicing calming techniques can also help prepare you for your interactions with your ex.If you become stressed when you see your ex, you will already know how to calm yourself down.


Strategies like deep breathing can calm you so that you can work through the emotions that you feel about your ex.
Practice taking deep breaths by inhaling through your mouth slowly. Hold the breath in your belly a few seconds, and then release it slowly through your nose.
Other strategies like mindfulness meditation can help you work through your emotions and calm you down in a stressful situation.
Focus on your emotions and how your body is feeling when you’re using mindfulness techniques. Don’t resist what you’re feeling. Just allow it to pass.

"
Keep interactions brief.,
Set boundaries.,
Stay calm.,
Ask for support.",How to Be Nice to an Ex2," It will be much easier to be nice to an ex if you don’t spend too much time together. Remember, you aren’t trying to get back together. You’re just trying to be nice. So, keep conversations short. Be polite, courteous, and no flirting or complaining.


Greet your ex when you see them, but avoid extended conversations.
For example, you might say hello when you see your ex at the local café. But, you don’t need to sit down and have an hour-long talk.
You might say, “Hi, Carlitta. Nice to see you” and then go ahead to your table and sip your latte.
If, and when, you do need to have longer interactions, be polite, but stick to talking about the topic at hand.
For instance, if you all are working on a project together, you can politely talk about the project, but limit the conversation to that.
You could say something like, “Hey, Michael. Mrs. Hasim said we’re working together on the report. Which section would you like to have?”

, Although you want to be nice to your ex, you also have to set some limits to your kindness.Without boundaries you could find yourself in an awkward situation, or even back in your old relationship.


It’s okay to ask your ex how they are doing, but it’s crossing the line to talk about your old relationship or who each of is dating now.
For example, it’s alright to say, “Hello, Alicia. How have you been?” But, it’s too much to add, “Are you dating anyone right now?”
Don’t allow your ex to take advantage of you or treat you bad because you are trying to be nice.
For example, you shouldn’t be picking up their weekly dry-cleaning or washing their car.
Make sure that the things you are doing and saying to be nice aren’t beyond the scope of casual friends or acquaintances.
For example, saying ‘hi’ to your ex when they come in the room is being nice. Saying ‘hi’, saving them a seat, and copying your notes for them is too much.

, Even though you want to be nice to your ex, they may still do or say things that upset you, even if they don’t mean to.Instead of losing your cool, stay calm and remind yourself that you are trying to be nice.


For instance, if you see your ex out with their new love, don’t explode or burst into tears (right then). Calmly give a nice hello to them both and then walk away.
You could smile and say, “Hi, Tasha. Hi, Marie” and then continue on your way.
For example, if you ask your ex how they are doing and they respond, “I was fine until I saw you”, then take a deep breath and remain calm.
You could then politely say goodbye and walk away. For instance, you might say, “Oh, ok. Have a nice day then.”

, Depending on the situation, you may want to have someone close to you around when you interact with your ex.Having someone there for support can make it easier for you to be nice to an ex by diffusing any tension and offering you encouragement.


For instance, if your ex dumped you and want to punch him, you might ask your friend to go with you to get your belongings from your ex.
You could ask your friend, “Would you mind going with me to pick up my stuff from Ron?”
Or, for example, if you know your ex will be at a party and don’t know if you can handle seeing them, then ask someone to join you.
You might say, “Brittany is going to be at this party. Could you come with me for moral support?”

"
"
Maintain your maturity around kids.,
Keep your composure around your ex’s new love.,
Prepare for repeated interactions.",How to Be Nice to an Ex3," Being respectful and polite to your ex when you are in the presence of your, or any, children is within the best interest of the children. Being mean to your ex will not only make you feel bad, but can also upset the kids.So be nice to your ex when you are around children.


Avoid saying mean or hurtful things about your ex to your children. It can confuse them and cause them emotional stress.
If you and your ex are having a disagreement then calmly end it until the children aren’t around.
For example, you might say, “This is a conversation we should have a later time when we both can speak freely.”

, Seeing your ex with their new love can be difficult to handle. You may feel hurt or angry, but don’t let it show. Any response other than being nice will make your ex think you aren’t over them.


Maintain your composure, keep the encounter short, smile, and then move along.
For example, if you see them at the grocery store, don’t run and hide behind the soda display.
While you are walking to the checkout, smile, say hello, then pay for groceries and leave.

, In some situations you may have to see your ex on a regular basis. For example, you might have class or work together. Thinking about how you will handle these situations in advance will make it easier for you to be nice.


Think positive thoughts before you see your ex to get yourself in a generally happy and friendly mood.
Plan a way to limit the interactions you do have with your ex.
For example, you could arrive to class exactly on time so you don’t have an opportunity to do anything other than smile at your ex.

Is the job easily replaceable or temporary? Some reflection may show you that working with your ex is doing more harm than good, keeping you in a place of pain and confusion that the job is not necessarily worth.;
, When we try as hard as we can not to think about something, it becomes impossible not to think about it. This is called the ""white bear effect"" and works the same for all kinds of temptations.So, don’t push your ex out of your mind when they pop up unexpectedly. By doing this you are eliminating the ""forbidden fruit"" feeling that can distract from work and cause you to dote on the past relationship. Also, letting yourself think about your ex, you may access some thoughts that give you greater clarity about the relationship (and thus, more closure).


The less you resist the fact that your ex is still in your life, the better. Sharing a workplace means that you must accept your ex’s presence and the feelings that will unavoidably come with seeing him or her regularly. Allow these feelings to wane naturally rather than forcing them out of your head. Trying to force feelings away creates passive aggression, moodiness, and the feelings are likely to come back with a vengeance when you least expect them to.
Just because you are letting yourself feel things in relation to your ex, this does NOT mean that you must share these feelings in the workplace. Stick close to your journal and if you need to share what comes up, try talking to friends or family that have some distance from your workplace.

, Writing in a journal, outline the goals you have related to your career. Start small, thinking about how to do your work more efficiently each day, gradually increasing scale to goals for the month, the company, etc.Make sure you include how your career goals also play into the wider scope of what you want for yourself (like happiness, physical well-being, and freedom from stress). By making these connections you will see the connection between your career goals and your broader personal happiness. This will help you see your career goals differently, motivating you more and more to spend your time at work really nurturing these goals.

, Since your ex is so nearby, you might be tempted to call him or her to vent about an especially bad day or to share an exciting new achievement or opportunity. But, these are moments to share with someone who you want a deeper relationship with instead.


Continuing to give your ex this position in your life will keep you more emotionally attached to him or her than is necessary for a successful working relationship. This can keep you feeling as though you rely on his or her presence, at work or otherwise. The trick is to be able to see your ex while keeping in mind that they do not serve the purposes for you as they did while in a relationship. So, delegating these roles (person I can vent to, friend who can help me with tech issues that my ex used to handle) will keep you supported and strong in times of stress or excitement.

, Especially during hard days, it can come naturally to look at your ex and idealize how great things were when you were together. No matter how over your ex you are, our instinctual minds are set up to seek out the best possibilities for short-term comfort and hope.Learning mindfulness techniques can help you focus on the present moment and redirect your daydreams about times when things were different.


Continually remind yourself that things have changed between the two of you by focusing on what’s going on in the immediate interaction. Is your ex giving a presentation at a meeting? Notice that your attention is shifting from the business of the meeting to your ex’s pretty eyes and all the memories they bring up. Then, without judging yourself for having wandered off, bring your awareness back to the task at hand. You may want to ally yourself closely with a diligent co-worker whose attentiveness will help bring you back “in the zone” of work duties.

, Take the first chance you have to honestly address the situation at your workplace and the role the past relationship plays in it. Initiate the conversation away from curious co-workers, and preferably outside of the workplace entirely. Let your ex know that you intend to keep drama from the past outside of work. Be sure to put your best foot forward, and mention that having a cordial working relationship is important for both your jobs and your happiness. If you make strong efforts to be civil and respectful, beginning with this talk, your ex will very likely follow suit. Try to come to agreements about the following:


Socializing together with co-workers.
Being involved in (or trying to avoid) working closely on projects together.
Leaving baggage outside of the workplace.
Opening the possibility to address serious problems outside of work, if they come up at all.

However, the situation of the workplace does require that you remain somewhat flexible to surprise hallway run-ins with your ex. Be aware that there are some things that you can control, like the terms of engagement between you and your ex when you are interacting, but others that you can’t. You may not be able to control how often you see your ex.



, If you find yourself wanting a break from the proximity you are maintaining, don't be afraid to take it. Give yourself the same respect as anyone else in a difficult situation. Even though you may have already discussed keeping a safe distance with your ex, you are responsible for being direct and acting on your wishes. This includes making your intentions known when other people are also involved. By communicating your desire for distance, you will leave no room for people to speculate and gossip about what might be going on.


For example, say you have been asked to have drinks with your co-workers after work and you know your ex has been invited too. Instead of taking the opportunity to let everyone know that you don't want to be around your ex for an extra minute, graciously let them know that you do not wish to go out because you'd like time to yourself. Remind yourself that not wanting to socialize won't be permanent.

, The way that you stand, position yourself in relation to others, and gesture can be the clearest signals of discomfort or awkwardness. So, by noticing your body language you can show yourself what others see and adjust yourself accordingly.


For example, say you are discussing a work-related issue with your ex. You may notice that you are not making eye contact or that you have started to fidget with your hands. Both of these actions send signs that you are uncomfortable in the situation. At this point you can ""act as if"" and adjust your body language to make you and your ex more at ease.
If you begin to see that your body language frequently signals anxiety and discomfort, you may want to spend more time reflecting on how you're feeling.Correcting your body language in the interaction is a useful way to get by, but ultimately it may clue you in to deeper issues that can be addressed outside of the workplace.

, Even after you and your ex are clear about wanting to create a civil work environment, issues may arise that bring up old frustrations. If this happens, don't be afraid to pull your ex aside and let them know what isn't working for you. Be sure that you are owning your feelings rather than criticizing or judging your ex.Depending on the scope and urgency of the problem, you may want to talk outside of the workplace or make arrangements to keep even more distance


Before talking, think deeply about whether it's truly an issue that cannot be addressed on your own. A good rule of thumb is to only bring up an issue if you have a clear and reasonable request that you feel you need to make.If you would like to request that your ex honor your space by not entering your office unexpectedly, then your need for space is not being met and you have grounds to make a request. If you cannot think of a reasonable request to make (and ""stop being a jerk"" is not one), chances are good that you are just looking to vent about your discomfort.
If you do decide to bring up an issue with your ex, make sure that your demeanor is professional, intentional, and realistic about your role in the problem.

, Is your ex doing everything he or she can to sabotage you at work, like circulating embarrassing information or withholding information about a deadline? Take the high road and offer an opportunity to get more closure and clarity about the nature of your relationship and the breakup.


This may not be something you enjoy, but going to the root of the issue will show your ex that there are better outlets for their resentment than treating you poorly. Since it is your ex who needs this and not you, be willing to concede things that you normally would not. The goal here is to put an end to workplace sabotage, not to express your deep feelings.
Talking about money is always awkward at work. So, if your ex starts talking to you (or in range) about a raise or a bonus, resist participating by keeping quiet or making it known that you are uninterested in the topic. Avoid indulging your ex's attempts to ""one up"" you.

, Another option for dealing with an extremely disgruntled ex is to have a private meeting with a trusted higher up where you can show evidence of workplace harassment. Keep in mind that this option, while likely allowing you to keep your job, may temporarily hurt your professional reputation.

, Having an ex around the workplace means that you’ll have to think twice about your other workplace relationships, too.If you’re tempted to flirt with another co-worker, consider how messy the current situation would get by adding jealousy and contempt to the mix.


To gauge whether or not your current actions might trigger excessive negativity between you and your ex, think about how you would feel if the shoe was on the other foot. Wouldn’t want to see your ex leaving with the co-worker he or she has always been smitten for? Avoid doing the same out of sensitivity for the situation and a desire to keep it running smoothly.
What about having to ride the elevator with your ex? Not all friendly conversation have to begin with your juicy life outside the office. Try bringing up a work-related frustration or joke circulating around co-workers that the two of you can share in without issue.

, If you and your ex are working together on a project, make sure that you are not bringing in any sense of guilt or blame for whatever happened in the relationship.Be extra mindful of the decisions you are making and how you are acting and ask yourself if you are being motivated by residual feelings or by the work itself. Imagine that your professional aspirations are your sole guide, and make sure that all of your decisions keep you on track with them.


For example, your ex is making coffee for everyone and brings you yours, fixed exactly how you like it. Simply smile politely, thank them, and then let them know that you are not looking for any special treatment. While it's a nice gesture, it's more important to avoid reinventing your old way of acting together.

, To avoid relying too heavily on your ex, make sure that you have other people who make you feel supported at work. This does not mean finding someone to vent to whenever you feel uneasy about seeing your ex. The most important thing is that you see someone regularly who you can connect with over something, and the more removed it is from your ex, the better. Seek out someone who has a similar sense of humor to yours, or better, someone with similar professional aspirations. After all, that's what you're at your job pursue.

, They may even begin to take sides, re-creating an old drama that doesn't apply to what's currently going on. Other co-workers might feel excluded or embarrassed by your situation and could start shying away from you in general. It's much better to keep your affairs to yourself and your support system outside of the office. This way you can prevent your life from being turned into the office soap opera.


This is not to say that you have to be overly secretive about your past, just that you avoid making the topic ""open"". If it feels absolutely necessary to note that you were once in a relationship, be absolutely clear that the relationship is over and that you will not discuss further details. Let others know that you appreciate your privacy and that the topic is not up for conversation.

, The best part about working with your ex is the fact that you will be highly motivated to devote all your efforts to your work. If you find yourself drifting into memories you've shared with your ex or all the things that you miss about him or her, remind yourself to dedicate time away from work to address whatever it is that keeps entering your mind. You do not need to resist thinking about your ex, but you do need to make sure that you make other time to spend acknowledging your feelings and honoring what's past.


Remember that it might be best to avoid sensitive topics altogether. Because it can be difficult to say what will spark lots of emotions surrounding the breakup, try disengaging from sensitive topics. At least initially, you may want to shy away from discussing romance, breakups, and experiences that you know you and your ex have shared.

, Go ahead and re-connect with a friend you don't see often enough or make it a point to frequent a new bar. If you are satisfied with your social life more generally, you will be less tempted to mix it into your work or to see work as an opportunity to spend meaningful time around others.

Give your ex some time and space.,
Start with a text.,
Call your ex for a short chat.,
Ask your ex to meet.,
Tell your ex that you miss them.,
Explain that you still have feelings for your ex.,
Respect your ex’s feelings.,
Apologize for things you did wrong.,
Avoid re-hashing painful past details.,
Be discrete about what happened after the breakup.,
Move forward, with your focus on the present.",How to Ask Your Ex Out," After the initial breakup, both you and your ex will doubtlessly need time and space away from each other to process the breakup and recover emotionally.Even if you decide the next day that you want to get back together, give your ex at least a month or two before you start making new overtures.


If you like, use this time as an opportunity to meet and even date other people. If you date someone new, you may find that your desire for your ex fades with time.;
, If you still want your ex back after a couple of months, keep things low-key and send a friendly, short text. This can be a good way to judge if your ex has any interest in talking with you. It’s still too early to flirt, and certainly too early to say anything sexual. Be brief and sweet, and say something like:“I just walked by the bakery where we used to buy baguettes together and it reminded me of you. I hope you’re doing well.”
“I heard our favorite song on the radio together and thought of some good times we’ve had. Hope you’re great.”

, If your ex replied to your text and the two of you have had even a short texting conversation, you can take the next step by calling your ex. Keep the conversation light—don’t mention the breakup and don’t bring up any long-term plans to get back together. Your ex could register these as red flags and decline your invitation to see one another.This will show that you’re willing to put in effort, that you have an interest in reconnecting with them as a person, and that you’re not just looking for a quick hookup.

, It’s a good sign if your ex seems willing to talk with you on the phone. At some point during the conversation, ask them if they’d like to meet and do something brief and light. For example, you could bring up attending an art gallery, visiting a farmer’s market, etc.Say something like: “I heard that there’s a new photography exhibit at the art museum. I’d like to go and it should only take about an hour. Would you be interested in joining me?”
If your ex agrees and the hangout goes well, ask them if they’d like to do another similarly fun, light activity. This will also work as an effective way to gauge their interesting in rebuilding the relationship.

, Your ex will doubtlessly be curious about why you’re reconnecting with them. Be honest.This is also the time to be a little romantic even, although your ex may not be interested until they see that you’re sincere in wanting to reconnect. Say something like:


“While we’ve been apart for the past couple of months, I’ve realized how much I miss you.”
“I’ve processed things emotionally after we broke up, and I figured out that I’m not happy when you’re not a part of my life.”

, This is a delicate subject to bring up, and you shouldn’t do it on the first date. Wait until your ex has agreed to see you a second or third time, and then talk about your feelings. It’s best to be open and honest: state that you still have feelings for your ex, and that you’d like to consider getting back together.Reconnecting and getting back together with an ex can be a time-consuming process. Don’t expect your ex to immediately agree to jump back into a relationship.
Depending on how your ex feels, they may still harbor anger towards you, or may have moved on altogether.

, Once you’ve explained your romantic feelings to your ex, your ex may make it clear to you that they are not interested in getting back together and do not have any lingering romantic feelings.In this scenario, honor their wishes and abandon your plan to reconnect.


It may be appropriate to make a final appeal. Say something like, “I’m not asking for us to get back together right away. I just want one more chance to show how much I care for you.”
If your ex still declines, move on and give them the space they want.

, If you were the one who ended the relationship, or if you said hurtful things to your ex, you need to explicitly apologize. Don’t try to skirt around the issues that lead to your breakup. Own up to your mistakes and take responsibility for ways in which you may have wronged or offended your ex.On the other hand, you will also need to forgive your ex for any emotional harm they may have done you. If you reconnect with your ex but still harbor resentment or bitterness, the relationship is bound to fail again., While you and your ex will need to discuss and somehow resolve core issues that lead to your prior breakup, there’s no point in dragging one another through the emotionally painful details. Focus on good things about your ex, and express these in conversation.For example, say things like:


“I was out with friends the other night, and I started thinking about how funny you are and how much I love the way out senses of humor work together.”

, In the best-case scenario, you and your ex can get back together as if the breakup never occurred. It may make your ex unhappy or jealous, though, to hear stories about any indiscretions you committed following the breakup. For example, don’t tell your ex unnecessary details about other people you’ve dated.Looking to the past can result in the second relationship with your ex going just as badly as the first time around.

, If your ex agrees to re-kindle the relationship, start making new memories, going on new dates, and re-forging your emotional connection. It can be tempting to bring old relationship baggage with you when reconciling with an ex, but don’t give in.It can be helpful even to form a couple of new friendships that you and your partner both enjoy. This will help you both get over the breakup by interacting with more people socially.

It turns out that “heartbreak” is a very real physical sensation: the pain from rejection activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for things like your heart rate and muscle tension.It’s natural to feel hurt if you love someone who doesn’t return the feeling. Accepting that your feelings are normal can help you process them.


Romantic rejection can actually trigger the same response in your brain as withdrawing from drug addiction.Psychologists estimate that about 98% of us have experienced some form of unrequited love. Knowing you’re not alone may not make the pain go away, but it may be easier to bear knowing that you’re not the only person to go through this.Rejection can also cause depression.If you notice any of the following, get help from a mental health professional immediately:Changes in your eating or sleeping habits
Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness
Changes to your normal mood
Trouble controlling negative thoughts
Thoughts of harming yourself

;
, There's nothing wrong with having to grieve, as long as you don't get stuck there. In fact, it's healthier to let yourself be sad than it is to try to suppress those emotions.Denying or minimizing how you feel -- such as saying “It’s no big deal” or “I didn’t love her anyway” -- will actually make it worse in the long run.If you can, take some time out of your life to process your sadness. This will help create a healing space for you to deal with your grief. For example: when you first realize (or are told) this person will not love you back, then you should take some time to be alone somewhere, even if it's just going for a 15 minute walk at work.
Avoid wallowing in despair, however. If you haven't left your house in weeks, you aren't showering, and you're wearing that ratty old sweatshirt that should really just be burnt, you've gone overboard. It's natural to feel sad, but if you don't try to get focused on your life again, you'll just keep thinking about and loving that other person.

, Your immediate reaction to learning that the other person doesn’t love you in the way you love them may be to think, “I will make him or her love me!” This type of thinking is very natural, but it’s also incorrect and unhelpful. The only thing you can control in life is your own actions and responses. You can’t persuade, argue, or bully someone into feeling something s/he doesn’t. It’s also a good idea to remember that you can’t always control your own feelings, either. You can work to control your responses to those feelings, though.

, Part of creating space for yourself to grieve and to move on is not having this person as part of your life. You don't have to cut this person out of your life completely, but you do need to take a break from him or her.You don’t have to be unkind or cruel. Just ask the other person to give you a little time to get past the feelings you’re working through. If the person really cares about you, s/he’ll give you what you need, even if it isn’t the most pleasant experience.
If the person you're trying to stop loving is someone that you've relied heavily on in the past for emotional support, find a different friend to help fill that role. Ask a friend if you can reach out to him or her when you get the urge to talk to the person you're trying to avoid.
De-friend the person on social media, or at least hide his/her posts. Delete the person from your phone so you aren't tempted to re-initiate contact. You don't want to be constantly reminded about the other person and everything s/he’s doing. It will make it harder to keep your distance.

, Expressing your emotions, rather than bottling them up and waiting for them to explode, can help you accept that you’re going through a painful experience.When we experience loss or disappointment, it’s natural to have trouble dealing with it, at least at first. Don’t belittle yourself for feeling this way or try to ignore the feelings in the hopes they’ll go away. Express them openly and honestly.Cry if you want to. Crying can actually be therapeutic. It may reduce feelings of anxiety and anger, and can even reduce your body’s feelings of stress. If you want to grab a box of tissues and cry your eyes out, go for it.Avoid violent actions such as screaming, shouting, punching things, or breaking stuff. While this may “feel good” at first, research suggests that using violence to express your anger -- even towards an inanimate object -- can actually increase your angry feelings.It’s healthier and more helpful to reflect on your feelings and examine why you feel this way.Expressing your emotions through creative pursuits, like music, art, or a favorite hobby, can be very helpful. However, it’s a good idea to stay away from things that are very sad or angry, such as death metal music. These may actually make you feel worse when you’re feeling down., It doesn't matter how great the person is, if s/he doesn’t love you, you could not be happy with that person. It’s very easy to idealize someone, especially if you have invested a lot of energy in falling in love with him or her. Stepping back to examine the reality -- without being cruel or judgmental -- can help you get some distance from that feeling of unrequited tragic love.It may also help you to think about the aspects of this person that would have created a difficult relationship between the two of you.For example: maybe their extreme social anxiety would make it nearly impossible for them to give you the validation you need in a relationship.
Studies have even suggested that acknowledging negative things about the other person can help you get past romantic rejection more quickly.Don’t fall into the trap of saying mean things about the other person to make yourself feel better, though. Ultimately, this type of thinking can make you feel even more bitter and angry, rather than helping you heal.
Rejection temporarily lowers your IQ, believe it or not. If you’re having trouble thinking about your feelings in a rational way, accept that it may just take a little time to get yourself back to “normal.”, Just as you have no control over falling in love with this person, s/he has no control over not falling in love with you. If you go around blaming him or her for ""friend-zoning"" you or thinking s/he’s a terrible person for not loving you, you’re being unfair to the other person. This emphasis on bitterness will also hold you back from healing.You can feel upset about the person not loving you without blaming that person. Don’t let your friends play it either. Your friends may try to villainize the other person for not loving you. If this happens, thank them for their support, but say that ""it isn't fair to blame him/her for something s/he can't help. Let's focus on me getting over him/her.""

, You can cry over giving up the mementos, but it's an important step in the healing process. Having those mementos around will only make it harder to move on and that's not what you're after!


As you go through each item, think of the memory associated with it, then imagine putting that memory in a balloon. As you get rid of the item, imagine the balloon drifting away never to be seen again.
If you have physical objects that are in good shape, consider donating them to a thrift store or donate them to a homeless shelter. Imagine the all the happy new memories that oversized sweatshirt / teddy bear / CD will make for its new owner, and then let these new associations symbolize the transformation you’re undergoing in your own life.

, Particularly in the beginning, you may feel desperate to contact the other person.Your willpower may be enough to get you past this urge when you’re sober, but we all know that alcohol impairs judgment.Drunkenly berating the other person for not loving you, or crying about how hurt you are, can be embarrassing for you and uncomfortable for the other person. It may even hurt your chances of developing a genuine friendship with the person later. If you think there’s a chance you may do something you regret, ask your friends for help.


Give your phone to your friend (preferably the designated driver) with strict instructions not to give it to you, no matter what excuse you give or how much you drunkenly beg.
Delete the other person from your phone. This way you won't have the option to call or text him or her.

, While it’s impossible to not think about something, it is possible to divert your thoughts elsewhere whenever you start to go down that rabbit hole. Every time those memories bubble up, distract yourself with another thought, activity, or project.Call a friend. Pick up a real page-turner of a book. Watch a hilarious movie. Build something. Work in the garden. Do math. Find something to engage you for long enough to get the person off your mind for a while. The more of a habit you make of not thinking about the person, the easier it will become.
A handy trick is to set aside a certain amount of time that is designated for you to think about that person. Don’t make this a huge amount of time; 10-15 minutes will do. When you do find thoughts about the other person creeping into your head, you can say to those thoughts: ""Not now. I'll get to you later."" When your “appointment” with yourself comes around, allow yourself to think about the other person. When your time is up, move on to other thoughts and activities.

, It may feel like your pain is the only thing in the world when you’re first rejected. However, research suggests that the person who can’t/doesn’t return your love is probably hurting too. Most people don’t enjoy causing others pain.Remembering that the other person may feel awful for not being able to give you what you’d hoped can give you some perspective. Usually, when a person doesn’t love you back it isn’t because s/he’s a villain who hates you or wants to hurt you.

, Rejection can convince you that your nasty inner critic was right all along. Don’t allow yourself to believe that just because this one person doesn’t love you that you aren’t worth love. Studies show that when you remind yourself that you are worth loving, you’re more likely to get past rejection faster and deal with later rejections better.Write down every awesome thing about yourself that you can think of. If you’re having trouble thinking of things, ask a friend for help.
Express love to yourself for these things. For example, “I may not feel strong right now, but I am killer at roller derby, and I love that about myself.”, It's hard to heal from unrequited love if you're constantly reminding yourself about the other person. Avoid seeking out that song or place that reminds you of the person or a wonderful time you had together.Memory triggers can be anything, from seeing a picture of that person on your Facebook feed to hearing a song that you associate with a wonderful time that you had with him or her. It can even be a smell (like apple pie, because you one time had an apple pie making contest with him or her, for example).
If you do unexpectedly encounter a trigger, as you probably will, it's best to acknowledge the moment and move on from it. Don't linger over the feelings that it will inevitably bring up. For example: if the song that you associate with them comes on the radio, turn the radio off or change the station. Acknowledge the sadness and regret that comes over you, and turn your attention to something positive or neutral (what you're going to have for dinner, that trip you have coming up).
Remember, you're not going to have to avoid these triggers forever. You just want to make the healing as easy as possible and constant reminders make that process more difficult. When you've moved on, the triggers might still recall the other person but it will be less painful.

, It's best to get the emotional and difficult aspects of the healing process off your chest. If you cling to those emotions, it will make it harder to release them in the long run. Find someone to talk to about what you're feeling and what you're going through.Make sure that it's someone that you trust. This could mean a friend that you know won't try to speed up your healing. It could mean a family member who lets you call them when you're feeling upset. It could even mean a therapist, especially if this is a long term love that you're really struggling with or that is tied up with other issues.You can also journal about your feelings if you don't feel like you can or want to talk to another person. One good thing about journaling these feelings is that you'll be able to track your healing process, which will give you proof that it's possible to get over your unrequited love.
Talking with someone who’s gone through something similar can be very helpful. You can ask them about their own experiences and how they coped.
The people who have gone through the same experience,can really understand one another's problem.You will have to describe less to them than others and they would be able to understand even more.
Don't expect everyone to understand. People who have not gone through what you're experience may not be able to empathize the way you would like them to.
Develop your spirituality. This can really prove to be a very strong weapon for you and can also help you to make you very resilient in your tougher times., One of the big side-effects of rejection of all sorts, but especially romantic rejection, is feeling disconnected or isolated from others. You may not be able to have the relationship you want with this one person, but you can strengthen your relationships with the other people in your life.Studies show that interacting with people you love can help speed up your body’s recovery time. Since emotional pain often manifests physically, spending time having fun with loved ones can help you recover from that unrequited love.
Fun is particularly important because of how it works on your brain. Having fun reduces your feelings of anger and can help you feel positive.Laughter really is the best medicine: it releases endorphins, your body’s natural mood-boosters. It can even increase your body’s ability to tolerate pain.So go see a silly movie, sing drunken karaoke, bounce on a giant trampoline -- have fun, laugh, and learn to heal.

, Certain patterns of thought can sabotage your healing process and make it far more difficult to move on.Remember that you can live without the other person, and that he or she is not perfect. You are fully capable of loving someone else.
Remind yourself that people and situations change. What you feel now is not how you're going to feel for the rest of your life, especially if you're actively working towards feeling differently.

, Nobody wants to have their heart broken. However, if you can reframe this romantic rejection as an experience to learn and grow from, it will become more than just a sad time in your life. You can use it to motivate positive growth for the future.For example, find things to honor about your experience. Sure, you put your heart out there and the other person didn’t want it. But you were strong and brave enough to be vulnerable! Without the willingness to accept vulnerability, we can’t connect with other people or experience deep emotions such as joy and love.Consider whether this is part of a larger pattern. Some people may repeatedly fall for others who reject them, especially if you didn’t feel secure in your emotional attachment to your parents as a child.If you’ve fallen for people who rejected you more than once, you may be subconsciously choosing people who repeat the same issues you had with your parents. You may find it helpful to talk through this with a therapist.
Remind yourself that through this experience, you’re learning things like strength and self-reliance. Being rejected isn’t the most enjoyable ways to hone these skills, but if you focus on learning rather than wallowing, you’ll emerge stronger on the other side.You may even come to a better understanding of your emotions and needs., Studies show that doing something new, such as going on vacation or even taking a different route to work, is one of the absolute best ways for you to break old habits and replace them with new ones.If you can’t afford to do this in a big way, make little, everyday changes. Visit a new part of town. Try a new hangout on Saturday night. Rearrange your furniture. Get into a new band. Learn a new hobby, like cooking or rock-climbing.
Try to avoid doing something super drastic, unless you're sure you really want it. This is a time when a lot of people chop all their hair off, or get a tattoo. It's best to wait until after the initial healing before making this sort of change.

, Because you've been so caught up in loving someone, you may have forgotten what it's like to be just you. Healing from unrequited love is a great time to find out who you are aside from your feelings for another person.Work on your personal growth. Don’t change things about yourself simply because the other person may not have liked them.However, if there are aspects of yourself that you’d like to develop, go for it. Learn a new language. Develop a new gym routine. Take up flamenco guitar.
Develop the things that make you unique. While you've been spending so much time obsessing over this other person, important aspects of you have been languishing on the side of the road. Get involved with the things and the people you didn't have as much time for while you were dealing with this unrequited love.
Resist the urge to personalize this rejection. It’s easy to feel like the other person rejected you because you weren’t pretty/smart/buff/whatever enough. Learning to avoid this type of fallacy will help you feel less emotionally damaged. It will also keep you from trying to “fix” yourself in an attempt to win the other person’s love. Remember: it isn’t about you., Trying new things will help get you out of your normal routine and won't have associations with the person you're trying to get over. This will make it so that you're too busy trying new things to obsess over that person who didn't love you back.Pushing yourself past your comfort zone has other benefits, too. Too much comfort has been shown to reduce your motivation to make changes. A tad of uncertainty will help you transform things in your life that need work.Learning to push yourself past your comfortable boundaries also makes it easier to deal with uncertainty next time. Taking (controlled) risks and challenging yourself allows you to accept vulnerability as a fact of life, making you less likely to feel destroyed the next time something unexpected happens.If you give in to the fear that this rejection was because of you, you may never try anything again. Pushing yourself to take risks, even small ones, will help keep you from withdrawing into a shell of fear., There's no set time period for moving on from unrequited love. Everyone goes at a different pace. However, there are some signs that you're ready to move on from the person who wasn't interested in loving you.You start noticing what is going on with other people. A lot of times when you're in the grieving stage you tend to get a little self-absorbed. When you start taking an interest in what everyone else has been doing you'll find that you're well on your way into the healing process.
You've stopped wondering if it's the other person every time you get a call (especially if it's from a number you don't recognize).
You've stopped seeing your own story in songs and movies about unrequited love. In fact, you've started expanding your repertoire to include things that aren't about love, or the pain of love.
You've stopped fantasizing about your unrequited love suddenly coming to the realization that s/he does in fact love you and always has.

, Even when you're ready to move on, you can sometimes hit a relapse if you're not careful. It's like taking the stitches out of a wound too early. It's healing up nicely, but it's not ready for strenuous exercise quite yet.


Avoid doing things with the other person or letting him/her back into your life until you're sure that this won't cause you to get back on the swoon-train.
If you do find yourself relapsing, don't sweat it too much! You've already put in a lot of work to get over them and that work will pay off. Setbacks happen and if you give up right away, it will be harder in the long run.

, Put yourself out there, meet new people, flirt, and remind yourself how great it feels to be a catch. Your confidence surely needs the boost – and in the meantime, you’ll meet interesting new people. In fact, every time someone is better in some way than the person you’ve been chasing – better looking, funnier, smarter, more down to earth – make note of it. It’ll put things into perspective.


You don't necessarily have to be on the look-out for a new relationship. Just enjoying the presence of new people can be a big pick-me-up.
Be very careful with rebounding. While sometimes a rebound is just what the doctor ordered, it only works when you’re emotionally ready for it, you’re honest with yourself about the fact that it’s a rebound, and you’re honest with the other person about the fact that it’s a rebound. Don’t make this new person feel as miserably in love with you as you are with the person you’re trying to get over., Getting over someone you're in love with isn't easy! Any steps you make towards getting over the other person should be celebrated. You should also remember that just because this person didn't return your love doesn't mean that no one will.

Give yourself a day or so to experience your emotional reaction to a disappointment. You do not have to act on your emotions at this point and, in fact, it is better not to act. You can simply let yourself take a low-key day to consider how you're feeling. Do you feel angry? Confused? Afraid? It can help to do some light journaling, jotting down how the disappointment made you feel and why.It's important to experience your emotional reaction to an event. Your emotions can offer you insight into how much something meant to you. If you feel mildly annoyed that your boyfriend cancelled date night at the last minute, your disappointment may not be that significant. However, if you find yourself emotionally distraught all day over the let down, there may be deeper issues at play you need to address.;
, While disappointment feels very personal, it's not always a shot at you. Even if it's hard, try not to take another person's failings personally. It's not necessarily a reflection of how that person feels about you.


Many people have a tendency to internalize life's setbacks. You may feel if someone else let you down, you must have done something to bring that letdown on yourself. You may feel like you deserved it, attracted it, or are simply not good enough to have experienced a different outcome.Try to silence that negativity. This narrows your point of view in a way that's simply inaccurate. There are a variety of factors that may lead to a disappointment. The person who let you down did not, in all likelihood, intend to hurt you. Before personalizing disappointment, consider all the factors involved.Remind yourself that you don't know all the facts. If your best friend suddenly cancelled a lunch date, this can sting. However, maybe she was having an off day. Maybe she experienced a disappointment of her own, at work or in her personal life, that affected her mood. She may have just wanted some time alone. While it's okay to be disappointed, try to remember you don't have all the facts., Oftentimes, when we're feeling disappointed we may jump to thinking something like, ""I would never do that to someone."" However, is this really true? In reality, we all disappoint others all the time, whether intentionally or not. If you know anything about the other person's situation, put yourself in his or her shoes. How would you have acted?For example, say you're feeling let down because your friend went out to a club without you. The two of you had plans to stay in and watch a movie, but a co-worker your friend wants to get closer to invited her out at the last minute. If you initially feel hurt, you may feel your friend acted poorly and that you would never cancel plans like this.However, put yourself in the other person's shoes. Say your friend is new to the city. She's been struggling to make friends for awhile and feels somewhat lonely. Maybe, given her situation, she was worried about alienating this co-worker and missing the opportunity to aggregate to a new community. Also, consider yourself from your friend's point of view. Are you the kind of person who enjoys going to clubs? If not, your friend may have decided it was better not to invite you as she figured you wouldn't have fun.

, If you're feeling a great deal of pain after a disappointment, it's important to practice some self care. Anger, resentment, and sadness are common emotions to experience in the wake of disappointment. Do something nice for yourself. Watch a movie, take a warm bath, or oder dinner out. Giving yourself a small treat can help you better regulate your emotions., If you're unable to get over a disappointment, it's important you talk things out with the other person. Having a conversation about how someone hurt or disappointed you can be stressful. You should try writing your emotions out ahead of time. This way, you'll have your thoughts somewhat organized going into the conversation.Try to write down what you're feeling. After spilling your thoughts out onto the page, consider how you can best articulate them. Reword your thoughts a bit, tying to phrase them in a way that would make sense to another person.Also, keep in mind what you want to accomplish. Do you want an apology? Do you want the person to explain his or her actions? Do you want this person's behavior to change in the future? The answers to these questions can help guide your writing., If you're going to have a difficult conversation with someone, enter the conversation with empathy. This will prevent you from coming off as combative during a discussion. Try to consider the other person's perspective as much as you can. Be open to listening to their side and genuinely considering it. Remember, the point of a conversation is to resolve a dispute and not to win it. There are two sides to every story and it's important to be open to the other person's side., You should abandon any expectations you may have going into the conversation. If you expect things to go a certain way, you may feel disappointed or frustrated when they turn out differently. Allow the discussion to unfold naturally. Remember, you don't know how the other person will feel. It's unproductive to make assumptions ahead of time., ""I""-statements are statements phrased in such a way to emphasize personal feeling over objective truth. When you use an ""I""-statement, you make your feelings the main point of a sentence. You are not blaming or judging a person for his or her actions. You are simply stating how those actions made you feel and why.


""I"" statements have three parts. They begin with ""I feel,"" followed by the emotion you're feeling. Then, you explain the action that lead to that emotion. Finally, you say why you felt the way you felt.
The point of an ""I""-statement is to minimize blame and judgement. You are not saying the person on the listening end is objectively wrong. Instead, you're saying how their actions made you feel. For example, if you're talking to your boyfriend and feeling frustrated, you may be inclined to say something like, ""You make us late to every social event we go to and that's incredibly disappointing to me.""
The above statement can easily be rephrased into an ""I""-statement. Your boyfriend will feel less judged, and may be more inclined to listen to your perspective if he understands he hurt your feelings. Using an ""I""-statement, you could say something like, ""I feel disappointed when we end up late to social events because I feel like you don't respect my need to see my friends.""

, Once you've explained how you feel, listen to the other person's perspective. Even if someone's behavior has disappointed you, there may be reasons for that behavior you do not understand. Try to be positive. The point of a conversation is to heal and move forward.


Returning to the above example, maybe your boyfriend simply does not understand time tables like you do. He may say something like, ""I guess I didn't realize 7 o'clock meant exactly 7 o'clock. When I go out with friends, we have a general time to meet and then people just kind of trickle in.""
The problem is an issue of communication rather than disrespect. Your boyfriend simply interprets timing for social events more loosely than you. In the future, you can try to be clearer about when precise timing is important.

, Sometimes, people may have unrealistic expectations of a relationship. If you're feeling disappointed with someone a lot, look at your own expectations. Can you see where your expectations may not be particularly realistic?Oftentimes, we may have expectations that seeped in from past relationships. For example, say your last girlfriend moved to a city to be with you. She did not have a lot of friends there and, as a result, hung out with you a lot. Your new girlfriend has been living in this city for awhile. She may go out more and be less reliant on you for entertainment and socialization. If your expectation is that social events should always be done together, this may be a leftover expectation from your old relationship. It's not really reasonable, considering your new girlfriend's situation.You may also have expectations that are unrealistic in other ways. For example, your girlfriend may give you a ""maybe"" if you ask her if she wants to hang out later. For you, a ""maybe"" might come off as a ""probably"" or ""definitely."" You may find yourself consistently disappointed when your girlfriend lets you know she can't make it that night. Maybe your expectations are unrealistic. Many people, especially people with busy schedules, may simply be unable to commit some days. You can start seeing a maybe as a maybe, and expect that you may have to find something else to do that night., If your expectations do seem unreasonable, work on reframing them. Sometimes, future disappointment is less likely if you learn to accept certain things about another person.


Let's return to our above example. Your new girlfriend is clearly more independent. She has her own life, her own career, and her own social circle. She may not be the type of person who needs a significant other to feel complete.
In this case, try to reframe what you expect of a romantic relationship. In this relationship, you may not spend all your free time together. Your girlfriend may go out with just her friends a few times a week. Try to accept this is just your girlfriend's personality and it's not a bad thing. Next time she's going out for drinks with coworkers, you may be less disappointed that she can't come over and watch a movie after work., Once you've reframed expectations, try again but on a different track. In any relationship, you have to be willing to compromise. If a friend, family member, or romantic partner has a different way of doing things, it's important that you allow that person that freedom. Proceed with the relationships, but with your expectations slightly altered. Try to be more accepting of the other person's perspective and more direct in how you communicate your own wants and needs., When reeling after disappointment, it can be easy to get stuck going over one incident. However, keep the big picture in mind. Is this relationship important to you? Does this person bring more good into your life than bad? If so, the occasional disappointment is not worth getting upset over. Everyone disappoints another person on occasion, and it is usually unintentional. Try to let go and move forward., Oftentimes, a sense of disappointment in a relationship comes from the fact relationships change. It's possible you're holding on to past expectations that are no longer feasible. Try to allow a relationship to evolve and acknowledge that changes do not necessarily indicate something is wrong with a relationship.


For example, look at a typical romantic relationship. At the beginning of the relationship, you and your partner may have sex more often, spend more time together, and talk constantly. As the relationship progresses, things may calm down some. You may have moments of silence, for example, and sex may be less frequent.
It's natural for the excitement of a new romance to fade with time. The intensity of the first few months of dating usually calms down. This is not necessarily a bad thing. While you may miss the thrill of a new romance, there are benefits to falling into a routine. The two of you are more comfortable together. You're both able to be yourself. Try to look at your changing relationship as an indicate of stability rather than stagnancy.

Find things that you know your partner will like and find funny.


Remember things from your day that made you laugh to share with your partner when you get home.
Find a TV show that makes both of you laugh and have a standing date to watch it together.

, Even if it’s not a long conversation, checking in with one another is vital. Remind the other person how you feel and that you are there when he or she needs you. Sending messages to show your level of engagement in the relationship can also help build intimacy.Don’t forget to say:


“I love you.”
“I admire you.”
“I miss you.”
“I’m sorry things are going badly today. Is there any way I can help?”
“I can’t wait to see you.”
“I hate to see you like this. Can I do anything?”

, Move away from dating clichés like dinner and a movie. In a long-term relationship, it’s important to try new things to keep the magic alive. If you do go out to dinner, make an effort to try new restaurants and get dressed up from time to time. Try out the following ideas:Go out dancing.
Host a party.
Hit the beach.
Go ice skating.
Visit hot springs.
Do karaoke.
Take a cooking class together.

, Little things can include writing notes to show your affection, taking the trash out, or cooking dinner when your partner is exhausted. These small gestures show that you are attentive to your partner. The ‘little things’ are often couple specific, meaning no two couples will enjoy the same things. The important thing is to be sincere in your gestures and come from the heart. If you and your partner appreciate movies, plan a special movie night for the two of you, with your favorite snack foods.
Surprise your partner with a small gift, such as flowers or a hobby-related item.

, While it might have been hard to pull away from each other early in the relationship when you could talk all night long, intimate, engaging conversations may tend to dwindle over time, turning to finances, kids, and to-do lists. Make time to connect and discuss topics that you both are passionate about. Find things that you genuinely connect on, and discuss them.


Start a book club for just the two of you.
Learn something new about each other by asking “how” and “what” questions.For instance, “What was middle school like for you?” or “How was it for you when you moved?” Use open-ended questions that allow easy, natural conversation. Then, truly listen and connect to your mate's feelings once again.
Don’t criticize your partner for not talking to you. Instead, do something positive like inviting your partner to tell you about his or her day over dinner, a cup of coffee, or a glass of wine. Try saying something like, “I’d really like to know about your day. Let’s sit down and you can tell me all about it.”, Being in a long-term relationship may cause you and your partner to take each other for granted and forget to do or say the sweet things that you used to in the beginning of the relationship. Complimenting your partner will show that you care.Be specific. Instead of saying “You look nice,” say something like, “I love the way that dress shows off your curves” or “I love the way you look in that shirt.”
Rather than saying, “You are so smart”, say, “I admire how intellectual you are and the way you discuss issues so genuinely.”

, While it may be easier to focus on the negatives in your relationship, highlighting the positives will help your relationship thrive. It is especially important to focus on why you and your partner fell in love.For example, you and your partner might have bonded over a shared interest in running, a common faith, or a shared desire to help others.
Make a list of all of the things that made you fall in love with your partner and ask your partner to do the same. Then, you can sit down and share lists and reconnect by reliving the beginning of your relationship.

, Skin-on-skin contact releases a hormone called oxytocin, which increases feelings of intimacy.Don’t just physically touch as a prelude to sex. Instead, kiss each other goodbye in the morning, embrace when you meet again, and give each other massages as you unwind from a long or trying day.


Engage in hand holding and feel free to embrace for long periods of time, especially if either needs to destress.

, If you live together, remove some of the clutter from your bedroom: this includes kids' toys, paperwork, and clothes strewn on the floor. Get some candles, buy new sheets, and do anything else it takes to transform your bedroom into an intimate environment.If you fall asleep to TV, consider taking the TV, laptop, and other electronics out of the bedroom. Create a sense of intimacy by agreeing to disengage with technology while together in the bedroom.

, Tell your partner how excited you are to see him or her and reminisce on the last time you spent a night together. Or send a racy picture of yourself. Messages like these can really get your partner revved up!


Remember to only send texts that you are comfortable with; never feel pressured to send anything, even to your partner.

, Having low self-esteem can manifest as feeling like you don’t deserve to be treated well or that things will take a turn for the worst. These thoughts can sabotage the relationship and will eventually become a reality.Instead of sabotaging your relationship, work on building your confidence and your confidence in your partner.


If you’ve been hurt in the past, heal those wounds and validate your worth, knowing that you are deserving of giving and receiving love.
Instead of avoiding sexual intimacy because you’re self-conscious about your body, learn to accept yourself as you are. If you choose to make changes to your body (such as losing weight), recognize that being your ideal weight may not change your insecurity and that it’s up to you to feel comfortable in your own skin.

, Nothing kills a relationship like holding onto a grudge. If you and your partner have an unresolved issue that is putting a strain on your relationship, then it’s time to forgive each other and move on. Talk to each other openly about it and try to move past it. If you haven’t had success in letting it go before this, it might be time to see a couples’ counselor to help you get your relationship back on track.There’s nothing wrong with going to counseling, and it can be immensely helpful in finding ways to relate to each other and grow closer emotionally.

, Just because you are committed to one another, doesn't mean you have to spend every waking second together. In fact, spending some time apart will usually improve your relationship by allowing you to blow off some steam, reconnect with friends, and relax. Agree with your partner about how much time you want to spend together versus apart, such as having one night each week of time apart, or one weekend each month. This choice show be arrived at by mutual agreement.

Take a girls' or guys' night out every once in a while, or take a spa weekend away to unwind.
Being apart temporarily often sparks up the relationship, raising the anticipation and excitement of being reunited.
Don’t drop your activities and hobbies when you’re in a relationship. Continue to paint, dance, draw, or go to the gym, even if your partner doesn’t participate.

, Experiencing a trip together can bring couples closer, especially when the focus is on each other and the relationship. A trip allows you to shift your focus from everyday stressors to each other.You can try for a dream trip, or just a nice weekend out of town. List out places you both have always wanted to see, and choose one that excites both of you. Every day, take steps to get closer to you both getting there. Finally, aim to create new memories, snapping photos and taking videos so you can re-live the memories later.


You can go backpacking or camping to enjoy the great outdoors or plan a ritzy vacation away at a high class resort. International travel can be an exciting experience for the two of you!
If you have kids, try to at least take one kid-free vacation every year., Take the time and talk to your partner, and more importantly, listen. Engage your partner by asking open-ended questions, then leisurely reflect upon what he or she says. Be open with sharing your feelings, and allow your partner to do the same.You can practice reflective listening by saying, “I hear you saying that things are difficult between you and your parents” or, “It sounds like you’re feeling really stressed about work.”

, With jobs, families, and other issues that require your time, sometimes the relationship is the part that suffers the most from time taken away. Stress is a normal part of life, but chronic stress causes a spike in cortisol, a hormone that can reduce the desire for physical intimacy.Needless to say, this can cause damage to your relationship in the long run. Eliminate stressful elements from your life if possible, and combat stress by exercising regularly, doing yoga, or meditating. Encourage your partner to do the same, especially if he or she struggles with stress.


Manage your time to avoid the stress caused by rushing to meet a deadline. Take care of tasks as they come up rather than letting them pile up, and use a planner to keep track of obligations.
Spend more time doing things that you enjoy. Life can’t be all work and no play, so make it a point to devote at least one day each week to doing what you love.

, Find something that will interest both of you and work toward it. Having a long-term goal assures that you will spend time together during your week and can lift you out of the work-family life rut. Some possible projects might be:Train for a sporting event together such as a triathlon.
Learn a new language together, then visit a country where it’s spoken.
Build something like a boat, a shed, or a garden.

, Trying something novel can increase intimacy.Choose an activity that neither of you has done before, and maybe even one that’s a little scary. Sharing the experience of having trepidatious misgivings and then going through with an activity anyway will probably bring you closer in ways you never imagined. Plus, the experience will provide a great conversation topic among your friends.


Try rock climbing, skydiving or paragliding.
Go on a backpacking trip.
Take a wild and native foods cooking class.

, Being in a long-term relationship can lead to focusing only on yourself and your partner. To rekindle your relationship, it may be necessary for you and your partner to get out of this mindset. You may need to find a way to expand your horizons and connect through this experience.


Try to engage in a spiritual practice together. If you and your partner share a spiritual belief, then you could attend services together. If not, then perhaps you can explore spiritual beliefs together. Engaging in a spiritual practice may help to reignite the spark between you and your partner.Consider volunteer work. Volunteering with your partner may also help you to get out of yourselves and bond over the experience of helping others. Try volunteering at a local food bank or animal shelter.
Work together to raise money for charity. You and your partner might also be able to change your focus by working towards a charity’s financial goals. Consider helping out with a telethon or run a charity 5K with your partner.

No matter how shocked, panicked, and in pain you are, don't beg him for another chance. It's very hard to do, but try hard not to cry too much - of course, it may be impossible not to cry. But crying a little, then saying, ""I'm so sad about this, but if that's your decision, I have no choice but to accept it,"" is much more dignified than screaming, ""No, don't leave me! I'll do anything you want me to!!"" Let him leave and then pitch your hysterical fit.;
, Now is the time you need your friends and family, more than ever. Call them and tell them you've broken up with your true love. They will hopefully come flying to your side to comfort and keep you company while you nurse your broken heart back to health. Don't try to go it alone.

, He may keep calling you, trying to let you down easy, saying he still cares about you, or many other things. But he still won't commit himself fully to you, doesn't really want to be your boyfriend any more, etc. Let him go, girl. It's no use. His attempts to communicate with you after the fact are not about lingering feelings he has for you - it's all about him. He's trying to not be seen as a bad guy, but the reality is, he's done with your relationship and moving on. It's time for you to try your hardest to do the same thing.

, He's told you he plans to date other girls, and maybe he's even said he will ""keep you in mind, just in case things don't work out."" Even though you still love him, this is a losing proposition for you. This man wants to have his cake and eat it too - he wants to keep you in his pocket as a consolation prize, in case his plan to find a Playboy Bunny fails. You are the backup plan. What a jerk! No matter how much you love him, tell him this will not work for you, and let him know that it's over. Period.

, Once the big breakup is over with, don't keep on letting him get to you. Even if you don't feel like it, go get dressed up and go out with your friends. You don't have to get drunk, or try to pick up guys (like they may be doing), but just to go and hang with pals is a good thing. Try to avoid going to places where you will be likely to run into him. If you do see him while you're out, just smile and nod. If you feel like you might cry, excuse yourself and walk to the restroom. Do your crying in there, and don't come out till you look strong again (even if you feel shaky inside, you must try your best to look like you're okay).

, There's a good chance that now that he's gone, you can look back and realize there may have been warning signs about this guy. Reviewing the relationship and recognizing where the problems began can be valuable in later relationships - they can clue you in to danger signals in new men, or let you have a chance to adjust your own behaviors, if you really believe you had some fault.

, It helps fill you with a positive feeling of power to hear songs like ""I Will Survive,"" and ""You Oughta Know."" It can help to hear your friends tell their breakup stories, too. Just knowing that others have gone through similar heartaches can help you feel less alone. Crank up your stereo and rock out - it'll help, too, knowing that someone wrote a song you can relate to now. You go, girl!

, A lot of guys break up with girls, then want them back later. This may or may not be a good idea. If you do decide to try again, try one more time - don't try again after that. Going back together time after time may be a bad idea for a number of reasons:


It may let him know you can accept being treated badly and still let him come back, so he's more likely to treat you badly again (assuming, of course, he treated you badly in the first place).
It may make you seem weak in his eyes - that's not good if he's controlling or dominating to begin with or if you know your confidence and self-esteem are not as high as you would like.
It lends an aura of inevitability to the relationship - in other words, you can start to feel like this is your destiny and your doom, that no matter how you try to break away, you will always end up with him, again, if your confidence and esteem levels are low.
If he was disrespectful to you, it desensitizes you to his disrespect of you.

, If you don't respect yourself, you're giving others the go-ahead to treat you like dirt. Don't you dare do that to yourself! Stand up and insist that you be treated with dignity, the way all human beings should be treated. Allowing a guy to walk all over you is the worst disrespect in the world.

, That puts you one step closer to Mr. or Ms. Right. And whatever you do, never shoot for Mr. or Ms. You'll Do.

Asking an ex to take a look at repair project is one thing. Asking your ex to house sit while you and your new boy/girlfriend go away for the weekend may be cruel.;
, Before you ask a favor ask yourself if the request could be insensitive in any way.

, If you only ask favors when you absolutely need them and keep the favors reasonable and in good taste, you stand a better chance of getting help when you need it.

, An unexpected medical expense for a child is a reasonable financial request. Asking for money every week so you can buy jewelry is not reasonable for most people.


If you must continually ask for money to feed your children it may be time to return to your attorney and seek help from the courts.

, By giving them time to adjust their schedule, their budget or their mood you may have more success.


If you're required to go out of town for work next month it is better to ask your ex to switch weekends now than the week of your trip.
Dropping a financial bombshell on your ex may make them resentful. If you know your child needs dental work or new glasses, it's best to discuss it before hand with your ex and make a plan. Calling them the day of and asking for money could leave both of you upset.
By asking for reasonable favors with a reasonable time frame you can keep your relationship more friendly. It also allows you some latitude should you ever have an emergency and really need their help.

If your ex helps you cut down and put up the Christmas tree you can offer to wrap his presents for him, bake cookies for him to take to work or send him home with a gift card to his favorite store.
If your ex wife picks you up when your car dies you should send her some flowers or maybe a gift card to a salon.

, Remember, you should treat them as a friend and not a servant.

, Don't just call them when you need something. This doesn't mean just calling to chat since that could be strange, but you should definitely remember birthdays and holidays and send a card.

, They didn't have to help you, but they did.

, If they go through the trouble of helping you out be on time to meet them, don't constantly change the time or place and do what you can to make it easier on them. If the plans must change, give them as much notice as possible.

, If your ex makes you feel guilty, helpless or makes your life difficult you should look elsewhere for help. Start networking with other parents, co-workers, etc. Get a good support system and only call your ex when you absolutely must.

, It may be inconvenient, but if you want to keep your ex in your support system you should return the favor whenever possible and reasonable.

, Your ex may still have feelings for you. Asking for help or using their feelings to your advantage is in poor taste. If necessary you should be very specific about your intentions and do not let them think it is part of a reconciliation.

, You shouldn't feel that asking your ex to take on certain responsibilities is a favor but part of the team parenting approach.


Keep the communications open and communicate often about plans, events, appointments and finances regarding the children.
Do not confuse team parenting with walking all over your ex. If you do ask them to go out of their way for something that is your task you should consider it a favor and thank them appropriately.

, Speak with your ex and mutually agree. Never expect and never make plans for them before discussing it first.

, If they can't help you out, you should just move on to another option. Trying to make them feel guilty for not helping you can damage the friendly relationship. Just because you were a couple once doesn't mean they are required to help you.

, Be understanding. Offer to help them with a project and perhaps you can develop a post break-up relationship that will allow you both to call on each other for a helping hand from time to time. If you want your ex to be in your support system you should take some initiative and make the first steps.

, Try not to overstep your boundaries and participate too much, showing up unannounced or using it as an excuse to spend time around your ex. You should always call and make sure it's ok.

, This is especially important when working out complex issues. Nuances are often missed in texting and emails. Pick up the phone, have a conversation and make sure everyone is informed. It will prevent misunderstandings and protect your cordial and sometimes fragile new relationship.

Choose the right time.,
Set aside the time to talk.,
Open up with a question.,
Share information relevant to your relationship now.,
Answer questions.,
Emphasize what you like about your current partner.,
Address any potential embarrassments.",How to Talk About Your Dating History1," Wait until things become a bit serious with someone before discussing your dating history. You do not need to talk about your exes on the first date, and doing so will likely not land you a second. But, if a month or so has passed and you want to progress with them, now could be the right time., Talk about your past in a nice, quiet location when the two of you have plenty of time to chat. You might choose to go on a walk or to sit out on the balcony with a glass of lemonade.

Avoid having this discussion during times when they are stressed at work or school.

, Ask something like “What is the most important lesson that you learned from a past relationship?” Once they share their story, you can begin to share stories of your own.You might say something like “I learned to never take my partner for granted. When I dated my ex, she was always asking me to spend time with her and I rarely did, so she broke up with me. I don’t want her back, but I did learn that you can’t maintain so much distance from people.”

, Talk about the lessons that you learned from past relationships that can help with how you date now. Avoid going off on long tangents about exes; instead relate things back to your current partner.You can say “When I dated Trevor, I learned to be more open minded about politics. That’s why it was important for me to watch the debates with you and learn about your views.”

, You may have told your new partner something pretty heavy about a past relationship. This may leave them with several questions or concerns. Be honest with them, but also let them know if you feel uncomfortable.For instance, perhaps you shared that you were abused by an ex. They might begin to ask a lot of questions which bring up painful memories for you. Let them know that you can talk more about it later.

, In order to make your new love more comfortable, use this time to compliment them. You do not need to bash your exes, but you can talk about how your past has brought you to a more bright and hopeful present.You might say “After dating Chris, I knew I could never date another smoker. Dating you, I appreciate how concerned you are about your health. I really respect that.”

, If you have a limited dating history or have had only short-lived relationships, you might feel uncomfortable discussing your past. However, take what you have learned from these experiences and use them to improve your current relationship.

For instance, if you haven’t dated much, you might have used that time to focus on work or school, but have learned that life without love isn’t much fun.
From short relationships, you might have learned exactly what you don’t need from a partner, or you may have corrected some of your own faults because of them.

Gauge your emotional reaction if you see your former love.",How to Let Go of Someone Who You Deeply Loved," These stages could more accurately be described as cycles. You may skip stages, never experience other stages, and you can find yourself stuck in stages. But you may experience some or all stages in waves repeatedly. These stages are:Denial and isolation: This stage involves denying the reality of the situation. It is a natural response to overwhelming pain caused by grief.
Anger: This stage emerges once the denied pain starts to surface. Anger can be aimed at inanimate objects, strangers, family or friends. You may feel angry at the person who died or left, and then you may feel guilty for feeling angry.
Bargaining: In this stage, you may feel like you need to regain control from feeling helpless. You might worry about how you should have been a better person, or you should have gotten help sooner, and so on.
Depression: This stage brings sadness and regret that comes with the realization that the loved one is truly gone. You may feel overwhelming sadness, crying, and so on.
Acceptance: This stage may be characterized by reaching a state of calm and withdrawal. Some people may never reach this stage of grief.;
, The relationship has, in fact, died. Therefore, it is okay to feel as though someone precious has died. You are entitled to feel your loss. Ride the waves of grief without getting pulled under or lost in them. Don’t fight them. Recognize them for what they are: waves of emotion that will take you through some strange currents for a season all the while giving your heart space to heal. Grief is part of healing.


Even if no one else in your life knows what you are experiencing, you can still acknowledge your own pain to yourself. When you feel down, take a moment and say, “I’m sad, and it’s okay. It gets better.”

, While those around you may not understand the depth of what you are feeling, don’t be afraid to share your grief with a couple of people you know you can trust.

, If you are concerned that you may be grieving unhealthily or that you are depressed, you may want to seek professional help. A therapist can help you understand your grief and whether you are becoming depressed.


Read “How to Get Rid of Depression” to better understand depression.
It can be useful to talk with a therapist even if you’re not depressed. A therapist can help you understand how to work through your grief.

, The old adage “time heals all wounds” is true.However, healing is promoted by realistically facing the emotion and giving yourself time to recover. We may want a quick fix, but ultimately quick fixes don’t exist where real love did. Accept the healing time offers and commit to not rushing yourself.

, Tackle that mountain of time in small bites. You can push the pause button on planning long-term goals. This is truly a time for one day at a time.

, You may still feel pain, but you may soon notice that it is less intense. Recognize the monumental step of healing for what it is. It’s a promise of better days.

, Find the balance that is healthiest for you of allowing sad moments while letting in new happy ones. When a wave of negative emotion hits, give yourself a moment (literally maybe just a single minute) to feel what you feel. Then, choose to move your thoughts on to something more positive.


For the record, it’s okay to laugh when grieving. Your emotions are merely recalibrating. Believe it or not, your emotions are doing exactly what they should be doing. That said, sometimes the recalibration process hits a snag and we may find ourselves dealing with depression, which is a serious matter.

, Once you get over the initial grief of losing this person, it is a good time for a truthful look at your former relationship. Start by recognizing what existed. If you have lost the loved one because of death and are trying to move forward with your life, you may discover that you have idealized your relationship with your loved one, overlooking the times that weren’t so great in favor of the times that were. You are not dishonoring your loved one by recalling these less than ideal times. You are, instead, remembering the real and true person. If love existed between you, then part of what made the love so special was all of the in-between moments, and the ways you were able to work through differences.


Don’t place this person unnecessarily on a pedestal in death. Holding him up so high can keep you from holding him close in your heart and moving forward, which is not what he wanted for you.
If, your loss was relational rather than from someone passing, the same applies. Your relationship was not perfect. If it had been, you wouldn’t be trying to move on. Even if they were the one to cut things off, it still reveals some frailty to the relationship, and that is okay.

, Your relationship, like most, probably had a series of high and low moments. If you were not the one to end the relationship, you may find yourself idolizing it a bit. It is okay to look back and remember the good times. But it’s important to be realistic. There were not-so-good times as well.


Appreciate the positive aspects of the relationship, and how the other person contributed to who you are now.

, It’s important to acknowledge the characteristics of the relationship that brought out the worst of you. This doesn’t mean that the other person was bad. But it can show you that there were some toxic elements when you were together.


Once you have recognized these toxic elements, you can appreciate the chance to “detoxify” a bit. This will give you a chance to work on avoiding those pitfalls in other relationships. It will also help reframe your perspective of what you have lost. It helps you to give it a proper place in your thinking so you are free to move on.

, Being honest about the relationship and the other person is important in reconciling your current emotions and your attempt to let go and move on. But it is important to avoid vilifying the other person, even if he treated you poorly. Too much dwelling on the past can be harmful.Assigning negative connotations or dwelling on particularly darker moments can strengthen emotional ties to the thoughts of that person, making them hard to let go. In fact, your love can turn to resentment. This doesn’t free the person from your heart. It only frees him from your kindness. You deserve to be totally free to move on, so be cautious about giving him even the negative pieces of your heart.

, Isolation is normal and okay for a short time. But it is vital that you don’t isolate yourself from your closest supports for more than a short time. They love you and need to know you are alright. They know you better than you do yourself at times. They can help you get back to who you are at your best.


These are the people who know how to be silent with you and know when to push you to step out and have fun. They know how to make you laugh, and they are supportive when you need to cry. You don’t have to let everyone in, but trust those closest to you.
These people can also help you recognize if your grief goes into depression and if you need professional supports.

, Your friends and family might tread over the topic of the other person without realizing how much you are struggling. It is okay to let friends know when you need a change of subject. Just be honest and let them know that you need time. Be specific about what hurts you and what you would like to avoid for the time being., It’s important to know your pain threshold and protect yourself. Perhaps you agreed to be friends with your former loved one, but the “friendly” phone calls are painful. Be honest about how you’re feeling. You may need to totally separate while you give yourself time to heal.

, Most likely you have coworkers, classmates, or even friends and family who are just outside of the “close supports” category. They may not be the ones you spill your guts to, but they still play a part in your life. It is perfectly fine to turn down your coworker’s invitation to lunch for a spell, but then it will be time to let these people be the lighthearted, friendly, distraction-from-life they were before.


These supports generally come with natural boundaries you have already established. You tend to avoid deeply personal conversation, and keep things fun and on the surface. They won’t expect you to trudge into emotional trenches over your 30-minute lunch break.

, This isn’t about replacing what was lost. Rather, it’s about moving on. Once you find yourself dealing less and less with your grief, you find your mind less preoccupied with the person you’re letting go of. Now it is time to be open to new people. New people are exciting.You do not, under any circumstances, have to get out there and date in order to move on. In fact, even thinking that way may terrify you at the moment. So let’s dial back the intensity and reframe this in a comfortable way. Instead of diving into the dating scene, dive into the possibility of new friendships. Friendships can take on so many wonderful forms. Some friends are more like family. Sometimes friends move past friendship and become romantic partners. Sometimes friends simply remain friends. Regardless of where a new friend fits, you can’t go wrong by being open to having more of them.

, Emotions can overwhelm and even silence a person. It is time to find your voice. Talk things over with a family member, friend, counselor or minister.


There are times when something is so personal that it can be hard to open up to those who know us. You may consider making an appointment with a counselor or clergy member. Feelings have a way of jumbling up, making them difficult to articulate. An objective third party individual can help by asking you the right questions to untangle your emotions without inserting their own opinions.
The important part here is to simply start talking, rather than getting stuck in your own head where there is no one to help validate or correct your thoughts.

, Write a letter to your loved one. Then, let it go to signify your own mental choice to let him go. Some people find it cathartic to burn their letter, signifying a definitive end. Or you may prefer something more considerate of the place this person will always hold in your heart. This may be more appropriate if you are letting go because this person has passed.


You might prefer placing your message in a helium filled balloon and setting it free.
Another option is creating a sky lantern with words of love written on it and sending it off as though mailing your loved one.

, You may also choose to journal your feelings. Give space to the feelings you feel now, as well as the ones you hope to restore.Journaling allows you to be completely honest with yourself because your words are for your eyes only.


This practice also helps you to identify patterns in your thinking, your actions and behavior.

, Changing even the slightest thing in your life can help you feel refreshed and remind you that life is still fun. Rearrange your furniture. Try a new haircut. Drive a different way to work. Eat dessert first. Whatever you choose to change, no matter how small, pick something enjoyable. It may only be a temporary mood lifter, but that may be all you need to remind yourself that you can still smile and enjoy life.

, You’ve grieved and you’ve used your time to honestly consider the relationship. You have learned to honor your emotional limits as well as to challenge them. You have begun to let people in and you have found your voice. Now it is time to move on. Honor your loved one’s life by living your own. His love impacted you because of how he lived, not how he died. Continue his legacy of love and live by giving yourself to the paths of love and life in front of you.


Too often, people allow their grief to drain them of the best characteristics they shared with the one who passed. Instead, let their love with you continue on by allowing them a happy place in your memories. Learn to smile again and laugh again when recalling your loved one. They can continue to bring you joy in those memories. Humor heals., While it is important to give yourself time to heal from the broken relationship, at some point you will feel ready to let someone else in. However, you don’t want to be the one carrying old baggage into a new relationship, whether the relationship is friendship or romantic. Think about whether you are free from thoughts about this former love. If you still think of him even a couple of times a day, then you could still find yourself in a rebound relationship. Even rebound friendships can be a problem because you are experiencing a temporary gap in your emotional needs and may be gravitating to someone who fills that need. But this relationship will not likely be a good overall fit. In fact, he truly may have nothing else to offer you.

, Are you able to go to places you used to frequent with your former love and not immediately think of him? If your world still screams his name, then you probably need more time.

, Until you are ready, it is okay to avoid places that still sting of the person you are learning to let go of. But keep in mind that pain is layered. While avoidance is okay in the beginning, eventually you’ll want to challenge yourself to heal completely. Consider revisiting old venues with a trusted friend. Then you can start to create new memories and associations. Start with where you are comfortable, and slowly begin to rewrite your own memories and stories. Those places can still be special.


When that one song comes on the radio, do you still think of that person? If so, it may be too early to move on. You may need to reclaim that memory by tying it to new experiences. Try sharing the song with your friends and ask them to help you give it new meaning. Make it funny. Remember, humor heals.
If you love the view from a certain restaurant, then meet a few of your best friends there. Laugh, enjoy yourself and start connecting that place to joy again. Peel back the layers bit by bit, and give them new and positive meanings in your life.

, When someone says your former loved one’s name, do you still feel a stab of pain? When you notice that feeling of pain, remind yourself that you wish him well. It may seem silly, but this can help reprogram your automatic thoughts about that person.

, If you were to run into your former love with his new love, how strong would your emotional reaction be? Would seeing him happy feel hurtful for you? Are you free to be happy for him? Have you let him go?


A little bruising is to be expected, and like a physical wound, you may be healed, fully functional and ready to get back out there. Just make sure it’s no more than a little bruise before you do.

For some, these things might be dealbreakers.Share information like this on the first or second date.

, Talking to your current partner about your past can be tricky if you are still friends with any exes. But, they deserve to know. Be sure to let them know how often you communicate and whether you spend time together.You might say “I’m still friends with Gabriella, who I dated two years ago. We text every so often and sometimes have lunch. We don’t have any romantic feelings for one another anymore.”

, In some cases, you may have had a relationship or fling with someone your new partner knows. If they are friends, coworkers, or close acquaintances, then you should share this information as soon as possible.

Say “I noticed from your social media that you know Frank. He and I dated for about three months last year. I don’t know how close the two of you are, but I thought you should know.”

, You and an ex may have shared a home, car, or business together. Or maybe you two have the same friend group and have to be around one another often. Whatever the case, be sure to let your new partner know of any unfinished business the two of you may have."

Tell them what they want to know and avoid lies of omission. If you feel uncomfortable with a certain topic, tell them you don’t want to talk about that., Discussing your dating history does not mean that you need to discuss how your ex’s silvery blonde hair glistened in the moonlight.

However, be open minded with them and avoid judging them on their past. We all make mistakes, but if you can see that they’ve grown, give them the benefit of the doubt.For instance, if they tell you that they cheated a few years back, you might want to give them a chance. However, if they have cheated on everyone they’ve dated, this is a red flag.

, Discussing the number of sexual partners you’ve had or sexual experiences in general can be tricky. You want to be honest with your partner, but being too honest can spark jealousy. Keep talk of your sexual past to a minimum.However, if you have an STD, you should disclose this before having sex with anyone.

Do you want a hookup situation, or a steady girlfriend, or a long-term partner? Think about where you are in life, and what your goals are beyond these two girls. It can be easy to let your judgment be clouded by passion. It may help to take a step back from the girls in order to understand what you're really after.


Maybe you need to focus on your career right now. Maybe you need a certain stability or casualness that only one of these girls can provide. What do you need?;
, Think about what they have in common, and try to understand how they're different. Consider what each of these girls offers, and envision how each of them makes you feel. If you're going to choose, you need to fully understand your choices.Consider which girl you have better conversations with. Consider who is the most fun, and who inspires you to try new things. Perhaps you enjoy being with one girl more than the other.
Think about which girl you can trust. Maybe one girl is a lot of fun, but you can't see yourself building a relationship with her. You may need to consider whether you want something more stable or something more exciting.
Determine whether you communicate better with one girl or the other. Communication is incredibly important in any relationship, and you may want to choose the girl with whom you can speak most truthfully.

, Perhaps one girl makes you feel strong, capable, and worthy, while the other girl belittles you and makes you feel like a stranger to yourself. Maybe one lady makes you feel happy and carefree, while the other only stresses you out. Look for the changes in your own personality when you spend time with each of these girls. Consider which aspects of yourself you want to feed., If you can't bring yourself to give a definitive ""Yes!"" to either girl, then perhaps you shouldn't be getting serious with either of them. You don't need to force a serious relationship, of course, but it's important to understand why you're having so much trouble choosing., Maybe neither girl is looking for an exclusive relationship, or maybe one of the girls isn't even interested in you! This doesn't mean that you should ""play"" the girls at the same time; only that the situation might be simpler or stranger than you think. Try talking to the girls (individually) to better understand what they're looking for.


Don't be afraid to think outside the box. There are many ways to make relationships work. The important thing is that everyone's on the same page, and that you aren't hurting anyone's feelings.

, Set up one column for each girl, and list as many good qualities as you can think of. If you find any qualities that both girls share, cross them off the list. Review the unique qualities, and compare which ones you like best. The girl with the most and best unique qualities may well be the one you should choose. Consider also listing negative qualities; the girl with the fewest bad qualities might also be the girl to choose.


Good qualities might include: fun to hang out with; great conversations; amazing lover; good listener; trustworthy; intelligent; jaw-droppingly beautiful; gets along well with your friends; lives in the same area; loves to travel; makes you smile.
Bad qualities might include: quick temper; different values; not a resounding ""Yes!""; not your ""type""; lives far away; poor physical connection; stresses you out.

, Remember that the list is just a tool. Don't make your decision based on a number; instead, use the number to better understand how you feel. One girl might look great on paper, but that doesn't mean that you feel passionately about her. If the numbers don't feel right, then maybe they aren't right. Once you've listed all of the good and bad qualities, take the time to think about how much you realistically like each girl. Let your passion guide you., It's important to be sure in your decision. However: if you keep these two girls waiting in limbo for too long, then you might wind up losing both of them. Try to make your decision as soon as possible so that you can clear everything up. The situation will be much simpler once you've chosen a girl (or chosen not to pursue either of them) and made your peace with the girl you didn't choose.


The exact time is dependent on your exact situation. If you're seeing these two girls every day, then your decision is urgent. Are you prepared to run into both of them at the same time?
Remember that these are human beings with real feelings. It isn't fair to string them along just because you like to keep your options open unless, of course, they are doing the same, and they're fully aware of the situation. Think about how you'd like to be treated in this situation.

, If both of these ladies are equally amazing, it might never feel like the ""right"" choice, but you will eventually need to make a decision if you want to keep either of them. The honest road can be the hardest road, but it may also be incredibly rewarding. Make your choice, tell the girls, and simplify your life. Ask yourself which girl you'd most regret letting go.


Consider talking it over with friends and family. If you can't decide, you might need some outside input from someone who's seen you with both girls., This means that you need to be honest and clear with the girl that you have chosen as well as the girl you have not. If you aren't clear, things can get messy, and you may as well not have chosen. Don't leave anything hanging. If you want to proceed wholeheartedly with one girl, you'll need to close the other door.


Consider writing down your thoughts beforehand, or practicing your speech with a friend. If you aren't sure what to say, it might help to prepare.

, It's important to tell this girl first if you want to make a clean break. You may have made your decision on paper, but it won't become real until you put it into action. This is especially important if the girl you choose knows about the girl you didn't choose. It will add weight to your profession of love (or commitment, or exclusivity) if you can prove to her that you have cut off your relationship with the other girl.


You might be tempted to first profess your love for the girl you have chosen, for the sake of contingency: in case she says no, you can always choose Girl Number Two. Consider, however, whether you will truly be happy going with your ""second choice"". Better to be with someone wholeheartedly, even if that someone is neither of these two girls.
Letting this girl down will force you to confront your feelings for both girls. Perhaps, in the moment, you'll decide that the girl you ""didn't choose"" is actually the girl for you. Perhaps you'll relapse and spend the night with her, and this will give you the resolve you need to cut things off for good. No matter the situation, this may help keep you from breaking any promises to the other girl.

, Once you've tied up your romantic loose ends, you're free to focus on your relationship with this one girl. Be simple, honest, and pure. Tell her exactly what you want from her, and tell her that she's the only one you want provided that you are, indeed, prepared to commit to her and only her for the time being.


Take it slowly. If you've had this much trouble choosing between the two girls, you might need to give yourself some time to adjust. Don't expect to leap into a deep, committed relationship; let things unfold naturally.

, Stick with the decision you make, and don't waste time second-guessing yourself. If you break your promises, then neither of the girls will trust you and word might get around! Do not flip-flop between the women (because then they will both leave and you'll be back to square one), and do not go back on your decision unless you are absolutely sure that it's the right choice. Remember the adage: actions speak louder than words.

The fear of abandonment can kick in. While it’s not your role to provide assurance, you can understand the behaviors and motivations behind clinging.


If your partner starts to worry about you leaving, remind him or her while neither of you can predict the future, you are both happy now, and now is where the focus is best placed.;
, Sometimes you choose people whom you share a great attraction, yet trigger your deepest insecurities. This can be true of your partner, too. Without you realizing it, you can trigger insecurities in your partner that have never been explored before.Realize that this may mean one person wants to pull closer or wants to pull away. While it’s tempting to run, it can also be worth it to stick with it and work through the issues.


Perhaps you’ve had clingy people in your life before (like a younger sibling or an ex) and your current partner’s behavior is triggering those memories, causing you to want to run. Before you go blaming your partner, take a few moments to reflect on your own life.
Have there been previous relationships when you’ve clung? What made you cling, and how did the other person respond to your behavior?
What is it about the clinginess that upsets you, and how do you respond to it? Do you respond in anger, frustration, or distancing yourself?

, There’s a distinction between neediness and manipulation. Manipulation often involves you giving up something for the other person.A manipulator may use weaknesses against you, blame you for things, or suggest that only you can help him or her. Especially if you tend to be a genuinely helpful person, be careful not to be taken advantage of by your partner. Ask yourself whether your partner’s actions or needy or if they are manipulative.


Manipulation can be punishing you when your partner doesn’t get his or her way (giving the silent treatment, not performing household chores), or as extreme as threatening to hurt the self if you don’t do what he or she wants. If you find yourself feeling punished when you don’t comply with your partner’s demands or neediness, it may be manipulation.
If you feel like you are being manipulated, be careful in how you interact with your partner, especially when talking about offering help, money, or giving up something.
For more information, check out How to Pick Up on Manipulative Behavior, How to Recognize a Manipulative or Controlling Relationship, and How to Deal With a Manipulative Person.

, Your partner can't necessarily help he or she feels clingy. Remind yourself of all the things that make your partner great and that make the relationship great. Be patient and empathetic toward your partner for why he or she feels this way. Perhaps your partner has felt abandoned in the past or there are things you don’t fully understand about him or her.


When you feel angry or frustrated, remind yourself to be patient, loving, and gentle toward your partner and his or her emotions.

, If you tend to run away, imagine yourself in a secure, equally balanced relationship. If your partner tends to cling, have him or her imagine the self in an equally balanced relationship. Even imagining a safe, healthy relationship can be helpful, especially when under stress.Set aside some time with your partner for this exercise. Close your eyes and imagine what a healthy relationship looks like to you (and your partner). Imagine feeling calm, centered, and happy at the thought of this relationship. What does it feel like? What do the two of you do together, and not do together? Then, shift your attention and imagine that that is the relationship you have. When you are finished, open your eyes and discuss.

, Often there’s something about the relationship that’s beneficial to both people and not just one person. So, if you have a partner that you perceive as clingy, is it possible that somehow you benefit from or play into the clinginess? Some signs of codependent relationships include an inability to find happiness outside of one person, staying with someone even though your partner has some unhealthy or destructive behaviors (like drug abuse or alcoholism).Do you find yourself giving to your partner (emotionally, physically, financially) even at the cost of your own health or well-being?Ask yourself if you give up your own needs to fulfill the needs of your partner. This can lead to short-term and long-term consequences.Ask yourself whether you are genuinely happy with your partner or if you stay with him or her based on what you’d lose if you broke up.

, Remember there will be times that you will be needy and times when your partner will distance from you.This is the normal flow of relationships. When you care about someone, you choose to love and support him or her during the ebbs and flows, even when it influences your life. Remind yourself that circumstances and situations can always change, and that relationships are fluid.


Is your partner being clingy because of a situation or life event? If so, you may need to give your partner a momentary break and focus on being supportive. There will be times you will need extra support, too.

, While it may seem simple, think about what it is that really bothers you. Are there specific situations when your partner feels clingy? Are there any factors you bring in, such as you get upset with the clinginess when you’re tired, stressed, or frustrated? What thoughts and feelings come up when you think about your partner being clingy?


Do you tend to run from relationships when they become serious? Or have you been the clingy partner in the past? Reflect on your own dating history and think if this has anything to do with how you feel.
Try to look at things from your partner’s perspective. He or she might be afraid of losing you or may feel depressed.
You may want to write down what bothers you, when, and why so you can better understand how to express yourself.

, It’s not fair to you or your partner to hold these feelings in and keep them to yourself. Have a talk with your girlfriend or your boyfriend and let him or her know that you feel overwhelmed. Your partner may not know the way you feel and unintentionally smother you, and by you holding in your feelings, you may begin to resent your partner.Plan to have a talk with your partner and gently let him or her know what bothers you. It can be difficult to have these conversations, but remember that it’s important to communicate your feelings to your partner.


Don’t accuse your partner of being clingy. Be gentle in your approach, saying, “It’s important to spend time with you, and yet it’s also important for us to have our separate lives and interests, too.”
Say, “I feel a healthy relationship includes spending quality time together, and also time apart. It’s important to me to keep my interests and friends while still being in a fulfilling relationship with you.”
Instead of only expressing your concerns, try to think of some actionable steps you can bring up in order to offer some solutions, which can be found in the next section.

, You may feel like pinning the problem all onto your partner, saying “You make me feel….” or “I hate it when you…” Avoid this trap, which may lead to hurt feelings or escalation of blame. Instead of potentially placing blame or accusation onto your partner, state the way you feel.


You can start by saying, “There are times I feel overwhelmed by how much time we spend together.”
Say, “My concern is…” to state the source of the feeling.For instance, say, “When you want to spend all your time with me, I feel overwhelmed. My concern is that we will get so wrapped up in each other that the rest of life will slip away.”

, After you discuss how you feel, set some healthy boundaries with your partner.Ideally, you want to come up with the boundaries together so that you both agree on them. If you’re feeling smothered by your partner, you may want to designate one day a week when you choose to spend time with other people; you can make it a friends day, family day, or self-care day.


You can set boundaries on physical time together, time on the phone, texts, etc. You can say, “I love receiving texts from you throughout the day and knowing you are thinking about me. Sometimes I can feel a little overwhelmed, though. Can we cut back on texting while I’m at work?”
Keep boundaries healthy. You don’t want to be controlling or feel controlled by your partner. Ideally, boundaries should benefit both partners by giving you some space and allowing your partner to not rely heavily on you or your support.
If your partner calls you for help constantly, you can set a boundary, as this can burn you out.While it’s not a bad thing to offer help, it can deplete you. Discuss with your partner ways he or she can help herself, call other people, or work through difficult situations without relying on you.
Remember that boundaries help to create a healthy sense of self, they aren’t there to push your partner away.

, While it’s fine to set boundaries, the real test comes in enforcing them. Especially when you set in a new system, your partner may feel like you are abandoning him or her, and make more effort to contact you or be with you. When you set boundaries, also discuss ways to enforce the boundaries. You may need to turn your phone on silent or off completely, or say “no” more often. Remind yourself and your partner that you set these boundaries to help you, and that they need to stay.


Of course, it’s okay to re-negotiate boundaries once they are no longer serving you.

, If you find that you and your partner spend all of your time together by default, find ways to enjoy activities on your own.Maybe you are interested in learning to sew but have never gotten around to it, or your partner wants to learn to dance. This is a great opportunity to explore your own interests without feeling like you need to be around your partner.


Having your own hobbies helps you and your partner make friends independently while doing activities that you enjoy.
Some hobbies you may want to check out include hiking, snow shoeing, knitting, painting, or reading.

, Sometimes love can sweep you off your feet, and then several months later you may realize you no longer spend time with your friends and family. It’s important for your mental and emotional health to surround yourself with friends and have friends in your life.If you’ve cut out your friends from your life, invite them back in.


Organize a guys’ night or a girls’ night to spend with just your friends. Plan a weekend getaway or a movie night.

, Joining a gym or a sports team is a great way to blow off steam, challenge your mind and body, and sweat a little bit. Exercise is good for mental, emotional, and physical health, and should be performed 30 minutes or more, several times each week.Many gyms offer classes. If you’re interested in weight training, yoga, pilates, or other group fitness classes, check out your local gym and see what they offer.

, Start an endeavor that you’ve never done that’s currently out of your reach. Having a goal and working toward it can be motivating, exciting, and challenging. Perhaps you want to run a marathon or complete a difficult craft project. Find a goal that excites you, and go do it.


Go hike Mount Whitney or do a week-long backpacking trip. Teach your dog how to do complicated tricks. Bike 100 miles in one day. The possibilities are endless!

Deal with jealousy when it arises.",How to Date Multiple Women at Once," Never lie simply to keep a woman interested. If you’re only looking for casual hookups, let her know. You may be surprised to find that she’s also interested in that.


You can ask her what she’s looking for before you disclose your own interests. You can say, “So we’ve never talked about what we're each looking for. I’m curious what you think about that.”
Choose an opportune moment and keep it casual. If the subject of past relationships or future plans comes up, you can say something like, “Since then I haven’t been ready for a girlfriend” or, “I have a hard time imagining being ready to settle down any time soon.”;
, It’s much easier to date multiple people if you feel casually about them. Once deeper feelings get involved, people may feel jealous or require more emotional support.Eventually, you may develop strong feelings for one or more women. If this happens, you’ll need to be honest with yourself and the people you’re dating.
Casual doesn’t mean callous. You should always treat the women you’re dating with respect and consideration, no matter how casual the relationship.

, Sometimes, the way that you present something can have a big influence on how it’s received. If you appear to be direct and honest, women are more likely to be open to a non-exclusive relationship.Respond to texts or calls relatively quickly. If she senses that you’re too busy or disinterested to be in touch, she may feel disrespected. It also may seem like a sign that you’re not being forthright.
Don’t share unnecessary information. For example, if she asks if you’re free on Friday, you can say that you “have plans” rather than saying, “I have a date with someone else.”
If she presses you to find out whom you have plans with, or what you’re doing, you should be honest. But don’t give more information than she specifically asks for.

, This goes for the women you’re dating as well as the other people in your life. Your family or coworkers may not understand your need to date multiple women. Never lie about your situation, but keep the details to yourself unless pressed.Use discretion when talking about your love life. You may want to omit the women’s names from stories if you’re talking to someone who likes to gossip.
Don’t share your feelings about one woman with another. Women don’t want to hear that you’re gaga over someone else. They also may think you’re inconsiderate if you tell them what you dislike about other women you’re dating. If you need to vent, talk to a friend.
If one woman presses you for information that you don't want to share, you can say something like, ""I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable discussing that with you,"" or, ""Do you think it's really important that we talk about that right now? Because I'd rather not."" If she does think it's important, you can decide whether or not you want to honor that.

, You’ll need to have this discussion with each of the women you’re seeing. You are not making a monogamous commitment to any of them, but you can still make other commitments. These rules will help avoid misunderstandings in the future.


Rules may include things like who you may or may not date. For example, it may be off limits to date a friend of the woman you’re seeing.
A woman might say it’s okay for you to date other women, but not to have sex with them.
You don’t have to agree to the same behaviors. For example, it may be fine with her if you date her friends, but you wouldn’t want her to do the same.
If you can’t agree on a set of rules, the relationship may not be viable.

, There are many reasons you might be dating more than one woman. You may have just gotten out of a long, difficult relationship, or you may be someone who is naturally polyamorous.It’s good to know whether you imagine dating multiple women as a long term plan or as something that simply suits you right now.
It’s okay not to know what you want in the long term. But be ready to be honest about that with the women you’re dating.

, If you’re looking for long-term polyamory, look for other women who are also interested in that. If you are simply looking for hookups, try to find women who want that as well.


Most online dating apps allow you to state what you’re looking for. If you’re looking for hookups, don’t get involved with women who are looking for marriage.
If you’re looking for hookups, don’t plan elaborate getaways or very romantic dates with a woman, or she may get the wrong idea.

, If you’ve never dated multiple women before, you need to spend some time getting used to balancing more than one relationship. Don’t try to go from being monogamous to dating five women at once.You can read books or blogs about polyamory and other lifestyles that accommodate dating multiple women.

, Over time, and depending on who you meet, your interests may change. If they do, be honest with yourself about your feelings. Don’t try to deny them, or you and others are likely to get hurt.If you begin to fall in love with one person, or multiple people, you may need to have a serious conversation about that with all of the people you’re dating.
Having strong feelings for someone doesn’t have to mean you stop dating the others, but it may mean that the relationships change in some way.

, When you’re with one woman, dedicate all of your focus and energy to her. If she perceives you as a good boyfriend (or at least boyfriend material) she may forget while you’re together that there are other women in your life.


While you’re together, don’t discuss the other people you’re dating unless it’s absolutely necessary.
Don’t get sucked into your phone or social media while you’re on a date. Keep your focus on the person you’re with. The other women you’re seeing can wait.

, Remember that non-exclusivity often works both ways. You should always assume that a woman you’re seeing is seeing other people as well.


Eventually, you will need to have a very explicit conversation about exclusivity. Sometimes that conversation happens very quickly, sometimes it takes months.
If you get jealous easily, it may be difficult for you to handle the knowledge that someone you like is seeing other people.

, Juggling multiple relationships can mean tricky scheduling. Keep a private calendar where you can keep track of the dates you have planned. This way, you can avoid double booking yourself., This can be hard and can take some finesse. Try to avoid commenting or liking every photo or post by the women you’re dating. While you don’t need to hide the fact that you’re seeing multiple people, you don’t want to feed anyone’s insecurities or jealousies.Don’t post photos of yourself with the multiple women you’re dating.
If women tag you in photos with them, you can remove the tag and then talk to them about it. You can say something like, “I’m not really comfortable being tagged in photos right now. I’m seeing a few different people, and it feels awkward to post photos of myself with one person.”

, Jealousy can affect non-exclusive relationships and exclusive relationships alike. However, by dating more women, you're creating more opportunities for jealousy. The best way to deal with jealousy is to be honest without going overboard.If one of the women you're dating expresses jealousy, say what you can to reassure her, but don't lie. For example, if it's true, you could say, ""It's true that I have a strong connection with that other woman, but that doesn't diminish how much I enjoy spending time with you.""
You can also use this as a chance to be honest if the jealousy is well-founded. You could say something like, ""I guess I have been spending more time with her. I think that relationship might get more serious at some point, but I am still excited about seeing you right now."" This can help a woman know where she stands in your eyes, but may cause some women to end or slow down the relationship.
If you find yourself being jealous because one of the women is seeing someone else, let her know. Don't make a big deal out of it or lead with anger. Simply say something like, ""To be honest, I've noticed that I'm kind of jealous of the other person you're seeing. I think I'd like to have more of your time and attention.""
No matter who is feeling jealous, being honest about it is a great way to start a conversation. It can help you both understand more about what you want and what helps you feel secure.

Examine your place in the love triangle.,
Discuss what happened.,
Consider the purpose the love triangle serves in your life.",How to Deal with a Love Triangle1," There are two primary forms of love triangle: the ""rivalrous"" and the ""split object."" In the rivalrous, you are one of two people competing for the exclusive love of the third person. In the split object, you are the person whose affection is divided between two lovers.Split-object relationships can also be imaginary. This occurs when someone imagines that they're in love with a romantic partners they've never met, or idealizes a relationship from their past.You may not have initially chosen your role in the rivalrous love triangle. You may instead consider yourself a victim of another person's adultery. While this may have initially been true, if you've decided to try to stay within the relationship, you are actively choosing a role. It will help you to be honest about this.;
, While talking about or hearing about a love triangle is difficult, it is important to be open and honest.Do all three people know about the triangle? While being honest about a love triangle may be difficult, it is ultimately recommended by most experts. Lack of honesty within a relationship can be corrosive and damaging to everyone in the triangle, including yourself.

, All chosen relationships serve some purpose in your life, even if it’s not a healthy purpose. It’s important to determine the purpose of your participation. Does your love triangle give you the attention you desire or distract your from your life choices or other relationships? Professional counseling may help you better understand the way a love triangle is serving your psychological needs.


Choosing to continue a split object love triangle can provide the illusion of security, that you won't be left alone. However, sometimes a split object love triangle allows a person to fulfill more of their sexual or emotional identity than is possible with only one person. Only you can truly know the difference.Choosing to continue a rivalrous triangle prevents you from developing more genuine intimacy. A rivalrous triangle thrives on interpersonal drama, rather than trust.Knowledge of a betrayal, or the act of betraying another person, may also generate unexpected sexual excitement. Of course, this won't always be the case, but people are psychologically complex. It's helpful to be as honest as possible about your role within the love triangle."

Examine your relationship for any thrill seeking behavior.,
Ask yourself if you have based the relationship in competition.,
Discover any issues with trust that you may have.",How to Deal With a Married Boyfriend2," The hidden nature of your relationship may be what keeps one or both of you interested. Sneaking around, keeping secrets and hiding the relationship can all be exhilarating and boost the attachment between the two of you.


Understand that if you are interested in your boyfriend because of the thrill, an exclusive relationship with him will likely lose its appeal., Some women are highly competitive and this competitive nature can express itself in relationships as well. Women who desire a married man may do so because they feel that they are a superior woman to the man's wife. This can cause them to pursue the husband in order to prove to themselves and others that they are the “winner”., Some women may have difficulty trusting a man. The appeal of seeing a married man is found in the fact that they can't be cheated on because they are the one doing the cheating. Women who have a married boyfriend are also not likely to be restricted in who they themselves are allowed to see romantically. A lack of trust can be the reason behind your relationship."

Consider your options.,
Take responsibility for your decision.,
Explore the reasons for your suffering.",How to Deal with a Love Triangle2," Remember that you do not have to stay in a love triangle, but neither do you have to leave. You have options, and you have choices: you can act according to what you think will be best for you.


If you aren't the one who initiated the love triangle, it can be difficult to not feel like a victim. However, to remain in the psychological position of a victim will ultimately cause more harm than good.
Victims often think in terms of ""shoulds"" and ""rights"" - ""It wasn't right that she flirted with him, when she knew we were married."" ""He should understand that I'm exhausted because of the kids and my work schedule!"" While there may be some very good reasons for explaining what should have happened, and what actions might have been ""right"", love doesn't operate on objectively logical basis. It will help you to set these reasons aside while you make your own decisions about how to live.You may not be able to leave for reasons of financial insecurity, cultural taboo, lack of social supports, or other reasons. However, if you can leave a love triangle, it's often easier to do so than to stay.
You may choose to seek help in making this decision. Even someone who's left a relationship due to a love triangle may benefit from professional counseling.
If you're the target of emotional, sexual or physical abuse as a result of the love triangle, this is called domestic violence. Seek help from a trusted friend, your health care provider, a crisis shelter, a counseling center, or the court system.If you are in danger, contact your local police.

, It may be painful, but being in a love triangle does not make you a bad person.You may choose to stay in the love triangle. While unconventional, polyamory may be the option that works best for you, and that is fine. The important thing about remaining in a love triangle is that it's chosen by all three parties - but the same thing is true of two-person relationships as well! Consensual non-monogamy is a valid option.Whether you choose to leave or stay, remember that this is a choice you made, not one that's forced upon you. While finding yourself in a love triangle might not have been your choice, you have control over your response to it.

, Common emotional responses to being in a love triangle include confusion, guilt, division of love, constant pressure and loneliness. These are valid responses, and they don't make you a bad person.


Feelings do not have to be justified. They are not right or wrong. Feelings can change over time, so before you decide to act on your feelings, take some time to consider the consequences of your actions.
When the pain you feel upon trying to leave the love triangle is greater than the pain you feel for staying, you may take this to mean that this person is ""the only one"" for you.But that's not likely the case.
Remember that the pain of leaving is not a reliable indication of true love. Your painful feelings might be based on fear of being alone, or memories of the relationship the way it used to be.

"
Direct your emotions appropriately.,
Don't believe everything you think.,
Explore the factors that contributed to the love triangle.,
Move on from your relationship.,
Seek counseling.",How to Deal with a Love Triangle3," It's easy to blame the third party, whether that person is the unassuming partner of your beloved, the interloper to an existing relationship, or even a faithful, monogamous spouse. However, it's likely that your anger is based in rationalization of your own actions.Your anger may also be covering up shame, guilt, confusion, and other hurt feelings.


Write your feelings in a journal, where you are safe to explore your emotions without hurting another person.
It's okay to cry, or to hit something soft, when your feelings are overwhelming. This doesn't mean that you're wrong, weak or bad. It just means you're human.

Maintain perspective.,
Remind yourself about the person's flaws.,
Take care of yourself.,
Ask your crush how they feel.",How to Avoid Obsessing over a Guy1," When you’re feeling uncertain or insecure, it’s easy to get caught up in the details. You might catch yourself over-analyzing every little aspect of your guy’s behavior: What did that shrug mean? Why is he laughing? Take a step back and get some perspective.


Look at the bigger picture instead of stressing over every little thing. Put simply, if your crush or new guy keeps coming around, he obviously likes you. There’s no need to interpret every aspect of his behavior.;
, Your feelings about a crush or new beau are often skewed. You may find yourself idealizing the person, only seeing the positives. Make the effort to recognize and acknowledge the person’s flaws to remind yourself that they’re not perfect. Doing this can help you stop obsessing.Say aloud some of the flaws you’ve noticed about the person. This might sound like, “He’s terrible at calling me back. Plus, it annoys me that his clothes never match.”

, If you’re obsessing about a guy, you may need to get some space from him. Shift the focus from him onto you. Pour all that energy back into yourself by engaging in self-care.Set aside some time daily to do things you enjoy. You might catch up on your favorite TV show, polish your nails, or spend time with friends.

, If you are unable to get perspective and just let the relationship be, then have a talk with your guy. This is basically the equivalent of doing the thing you fear. If you ask him about whatever you’re obsessing over, those thoughts won’t have power over you anymore.Schedule a time when you both can talk without distractions. Bring up the subject by saying, “I’ve been going crazy lately about things and I figured it’s best to just talk to you about it. How do you really feel about me?”

Determine your personal limits.",How to Calm Down a Jealous Girlfriend," When someone is feeling jealous, you want to let them express themselves. Even if the jealousy is baseless, do not tell your girlfriend she's being irrational. Allow her to tell you how she feels and listen in a non-judgmental manner.Remember, your girlfriend may very well know her jealousy is irrational; therefore, responding with something like, ""Not this again,"" or, ""You know you have nothing to worry about"" is not a good means of deflecting jealousy.
Instead, allow her to discuss her insecurities frankly. Your girlfriend may be more willing to move past her insecurities if you allow her to talk to them through rather than cutting her off. You can even encourage her to share, by asking her something like, ""Can you tell me what you're feeling insecure about right now?"";
, You do not want to tell your girlfriend not to feel what she's feeling. If your girlfriend is being jealous, your natural inclination may be to get defensive; however, this will not help diffuse the situation.Instead of responding defensively, show your girlfriend she is heard. Do not, for example, say something like, ""You know Melissa is just a friend.""
Show your girlfriend you're hearing what she's saying, even if you don't agree with it. For example, ""I understand you feel a little threatened by my close friendship with Melissa.""

, Oftentimes, another person's jealousy can cause you to retreat. If your girlfriend is being jealous, you may get frustrated and feel she's being unfair; however, keep things open. Respond to what she's saying, even if it's frustrating. If you shut out someone who's feeling jealous, this will make the problem worse.Resist the urge to retreat or ignore your girlfriend when she's being jealous. Even if her accusations are unreasonable, remind yourself you need to let her speak. If necessary, take a few deep breaths.

, ""I""-statements are statements made in a way that deflects blame. You focus on your own feelings about a situation rather than making an objective judgment. After your girlfriend has expressed herself, calmly address the situation using ""I""-statements.""I""-statements have three parts. They begin with ""I feel..."" after which you immediately state your feelings. From there, you explain the behavior that led to that feeling. Lastly, you say why you feel the way you do.
For example, ""I feel frustrated when you interrogate me about spending time with Melissa because I want to be able to see my female friends on occasion.""

, Oftentimes, jealous people have underlying insecurities. Instead of responding to jealousy with anger, reassure your girlfriend how much you value her. Remind her that you love and care.For example, say something like, ""I get that it must be weird for you that I'm friends with my ex, but she's my ex for a reason. I really love you, and really cherish our relationship.""

, An open dialogue about the roots of jealousy can help you both overcome the problem. When your girlfriend is feeling jealousy, try to ask her directly about her fears. If your girlfriend is able to talk through her fears about the relationship, she will be better able to overcome them.Ask your girlfriend what she feels insecure about in the relationship, or in general. This may explain why she feels jealous.
People feel jealous for a variety of reasons. Your girlfriend may be afraid of losing you. She may also simply fear being left out. Ask your girlfriend something like, ""What exactly are you afraid is going to happen when you get jealous?""

, Though the end result may look the same — possessive, paranoid, controlling, etc. — trust issues are actually very different from jealousy. Jealousy is envy that comes about through comparison and is likely unfounded, while a trust issue is usually something that has developed due to a partner's behavior or is rooted in past experiences. For instance, if you cheated on your girlfriend in the past and she gets upset when you spend one-on-one time with another girl, this is not jealousy. She is experiencing trust issues because of choices that you made. Dealing with jealousy is different than dealing with trust issues.


Ask yourself if you have done anything to cause your girlfriend to be mistrustful. Have you cheated in the past? Do you have a history of lying to her?
Trust issues may relate to her personal history as well. Think about things like your girlfriend's family. People who did not have strong ties growing up tend to be more jealous, as they're more nervous about losing their partner.
If you have trust issues in the relationship and not jealousy issues, consider speaking with a couple's counselor and encourage your girlfriend to seek individual therapy to work through these issues if they are due to previous relationships.
Notice if what you say and the way you act are in alignment. If you find that you don't back up your words with your actions, you can use this new awareness to make sure you start doing the things you say you will do.
Be honest, straightforward, compassionate, and assertive when communicating with your girlfriend. Tell her what you want from an open relationship and be willing to listen to what she wants, too.
If the relationship is built on trust and your girlfriend still gets very jealous, then she needs to work on developing more self-esteem and dealing with her own insecurities.

, Once you've evaluated the relationship, keep what you've learned in mind when dealing with your girlfriend's jealousy. When your girlfriend becomes jealous in a situation, remind yourself of the root of her jealousy. Do not become defensive.Instead of getting angry, try to remember why your girlfriend is jealous. For example, you can think something to yourself like, ""I know Maddie is being unreasonable, but a lot of her exes have cheated on her.""
Do not become defensive. Remember to empathize with your girlfriend. Try to talk to her calmly and offer to help solve the problem. For example, say something like, ""What can I do to help you calm down?""

, There may be certain things you're doing that trigger your girlfriend's jealousy. While you can't completely cater your behavior to her insecurities, there may be certain behaviors you can tone down in her presence.Ask your girlfriend something like, ""Is there anything I do that makes you feel jealous?"" See if there's a way you can help her feel more secure in moments where you inadvertently trigger her insecurity.
For example, your girlfriend may sometimes feel jealous if you make plans with friends and do not invite her. You can try explaining to her that you sometimes need time alone with your friends, and this has nothing to do with how you feel about her. You can agree to remind her how much you value her when you make plans without her.

, Remember, jealousy can be very damaging to a relationship long-term. After listening to your girlfriend, you need to state your needs. She needs to take responsibly for her actions as well. Tell her how her jealousy affects you.Say so gently. You do not want to provoke an argument. Say something like, ""I know you don't like that I'm friends with Melissa, but I've known her since third grade. I feel controlled when you don't want me to spend time with her because I value the relationship a lot.""
Be clear with your girlfriend about what you are and are not willing to do to reassure her. For example, you can agree to text her more often when you're out with friends; however, let her know you're not going to put up with her calling or checking in on you every five minutes.

, Jealousy is often the result of insecurity. Building up your girlfriend's self esteem can help ease some of her jealousy. Instead of getting angry when your girlfriend gets jealous, encourage her to work on bettering herself.Allow your girlfriend to pursue her passions. Respond excitedly when she tries something new and pushes herself out of her comfort zone.
Compliment her regularly. Let her know if you think she looks great in a new outfit, for example.

, Jealousy is a normal part of most relationships; however, jealousy can easily cross the line into unacceptable. You do not want to remain in a relationship with an unreasonably jealous partner, so learn to recognize the signs of over-the-top jealousy.Does your girlfriend use jealousy to control you? Some people will use jealousy as an excuse for unreasonable demands. Your girlfriend may, for example, use her jealousy to keep you from seeing friends or loved ones.
Unreasonable accusations are also a sign of over-the-top jealousy. Does your girlfriend accuse you of cheating without evidence? Is she constantly checking up on you or going through your stuff?
If you believe your girlfriend is unreasonably jealous, seriously evaluate whether or not you want to stay in the relationship.

, Remember, you cannot control someone else's emotions. Know what your limits are. If your girlfriend's jealousy is pushing you over your limits, it's okay to walk away from the relationship.If your girlfriend is draining you emotionally, this is not fair to either one of you. If you feel like you're, say, answering insecure texts for days on end, it's okay to take a break from the relationship or end things altogether.

Be prepared for haters hating on you.",How to Be a Gold Digger," Unless you're looking for a fly-by-night sort of thing, you're probably limited to those millionaires and billionaires in your area. Find out who they are (by name, that is) and study their habits. Essentially you're developing a plan for how to ""run into them"" time and time again.


You'll want to know where they work, where they hang out, if they have pets, their favorite artists, charities, music, and even vacation spots. Don't know where to start? Well, it's illegal pretty much everywhere to stalk someone in person, so Google is a good bet.;
, Once you do find out where the elite hang out (or where your specific target hangs out), go there. Start walking your dog on the same path, shop at the same grocery store (if they do their own shopping, of course), and hit the same clubs. Eventually the haven't-I-seen-you-around question will become imminent.


Make sure that whatever you do, you dress the part. No sugar mommy or daddy wants to take a scrub from rags to riches. They want someone that can appreciate the finer things in life and knows a bit about them. If you're on their turf, do your best to fit in.
This might mean getting a job. Many millionaires and billionaires work insane work weeks, and getting at them may mean getting a job with them. Heck, some women go to college to get an MRS degree, and this is their back-up plan.

, It's a little insane (literally) to mirror your target's schedule down to the T, so spice it up with living like they do. Or if you don't have a target, this is a good way to find one! Attend fancier events like gallery openings, theatre galas, and VIP nights at clubs and restaurants. Sprinkle in open houses throughout your day and you're bound to make a few connections – if you can hold a conversation, of course.


This is just half the battle – once you get there, you have to have something to say. And unfortunately, life isn't a Disney film: it's unlikely Prince or Princess Charming is going to just come up to you and offer up their pockets full of gold. Something standard like, ""How come we've never met? I see you walking your dog at the park all the time,"" is sturdy and not at all creepy. Let the sparks fly from there.

, It certainly says something about our culture that gold-digging is slowly becoming acceptable. The number of websites devoted to it that are springing up reflects that, too. If you can't find one of your own accord, go online. There's singles websites for Christians, for farmers, for Christian farmers, and there are definitely a handful for those looking for a pretty penny, too. Suggardaddyforme.com, anyone?Just be careful you don't become ingrained in a scam. Doing anything online is dangerous – never give away your private information and never give anyone money you don't absolutely trust.

, To round out your plethora of options, you could also get a little more personal. Let's discuss these three things:


With gold-digging becoming a veritable phenomenon (just look at reality TV), seminars are cropping up all over the place that will give you pointers on hooking just who you're looking for. Most of the time, they're not free.
Coaches are out there that can give you the aforementioned seminar on a more personal level, working with your ""weaknesses"" and developing your strengths. Unfortunately, these tend to be even more expensive.
A matchmaker can get you started as part of his or her database full of rich clients. Sometimes there's an exorbitant fee and sometimes there isn't. Do your research before you commit to a specific matchmaker and always read the fine print.

, You want to repel the broke, blue-collar class, right? Then you'll need to look like you belong to the elite. High society tend to only blend with other members of high society, so to get in, you'll need to fit the suit, if you will. You can take that t-shirt and jeans and put it in the back of your closet right now.


In addition to wearing the right clothes, your body will need to primped and pampered, too. Styled hair, manicured nails (even if you're a guy), perfectly tanned and toned skin – there's a definite look to being of the elite, and it sure is pretty.

, So you've got the look, but now you need to talk the talk. If you walk into that art gallery and you start talking about how that Picasso reminds you of that one scene in Titanic, God, wasn't Leo just adorable in that? People might get a hint that you're not really there for the art. You'll do better if you can keep up in conversation, so learn up on the habits of the leisure class. You'll feel better with something interesting to say, too.


Start with what you're actually doing. Attending open houses? Get familiar with your local real estate market and the process of buying a house. An art exhibit? Learn up on the artist at hand and his or peers. Did you mention you once vacationed in the Seychelles, but you didn't really? Come up with that backstory, too. In essence, cover your tracks. Be smart about it.

, A gold digger isn't someone who finds a target and bleeds them dry. A gold digger is someone who finds someone with money and expects to be lavished in material goods. The last thing you want to do is find an average Joe and take him for all he's worth. That just isn't right.


And make sure he or she is unmarried, too. You don't want to be the other man or woman in addition to being a gold digger – that's just bad karma. And besides, if they're already married, half their goods are signed away already, you know?

, Though this is generalizing, self-made millionaires and billionaires typically come from a different fruit, if you will, than the ready-made rich. Self-made persons are successful, driven, and motivated – and they have the work they've done to prove it. Ready-made persons are typically more wrapped up in their own world that mommy and daddy handed to them. At the end of the day they all have money, but you may want to know their background to know what's in store.


Self-made millionaires are able to ""come back to reality,"" in a manner of speaking. Ready-made millionaires don't have and have never had that reality, so it's not an option. You may be in for a more interesting ride when it comes to the ready-made variety, and take that with a grain of salt.

, Let's face it: you're not dumb and neither are they. You want money and to be taken care of and they want someone cute and fun to take care of and parade around. So talk about it. Be open and honest. You're both adults. Putting your expectations on the table is admirable and starts your relationship off on the right food.


If you don't know what to say, try something like, ""If you can support me, I can support you. If you can't, then I can't. Can you?"" It'll take some brash honesty, but it'll be hard to say no to your argument.

, Even if they've bought you a yacht, a condo in the Bahamas, and the Hope Diamond, it doesn't mean you have to put out. Feel it out. When you're comfortable and when you want to show you're appreciation, you can. But if you're not, don't feel like you have to. Make them work for it. If they want it, they'll keep trying. Sex should never be a mandatory stipulation.


It's a good idea to keep them thinking that it's ""in the future."" You're not a square or a prude, you just want to ""get to know them better"" and ""spend more time with them"" before you take that leap. And who could blame you? That's what a respectable person would do.

, Alright, time for real talk: some men and women are going to expect you to fall in love with them, and some won't. Some are looking for true love and some just want some arm candy. What kind of situation are you in? You'll need to find out.


How do you find out? You'll probably have a gut feeling and be able to tell if your sugar sweetheart is head over heels or not. If not, just ask. Do they believe in true love? What's their idea of a perfect relationship? You can dance around the topic to get a feel for their feel on you.

, There's nothing sexy about seeing a watch in a window and pouting about how you can't afford it. Instead, tell your darling that you have a sexy outfit to wear to tomorrow night's gala and you know just the thing that would bring it all together. Don't break eye contact and smile. Now when can you two go buy it?


Don't bother playing coy – both of you know how this relationship works. Don't overextend your welcome – that is, don't ask for everything under the sun – but if you want something, say it. They likely want you to be happy and be happy with them.


, Men and women don't tolerate gold diggers for the fun of it. They'll likely expect you to be bubbly, social, and easy to get along with – especially when they take you to all of their elite extravaganzas. And when you're not in the mood, well, you're going to have to act like you are. That's part of the contract. If you won't, they can likely find someone who will.


Even if you're not (though hopefully you are), do your best to be interested in the world going around you – even if you know nothing about it. Talk to their friends, ask questions, and flash that pearly white smile of yours. Make small talk, laugh, and your date will be glad you came.

, Let's be honest: you came into this relationship for money. The other party came into it for their own reasons. More often than not, this kind of intimate agreement doesn't involve fidelity. After all, your hearts aren't in it. Is that okay with you? Is it an understanding between the two of you? Since they have the money, can they cheat, but you can't? What's the arrangement? In situations like this, sadly, it's not often understood that monogamy is involved.


Many men and women seek out personal, material goods because now even if the other party does cheat, they have something to show for it. It somehow manages to lessen the damage. This could be an exchange you're okay with – you just have to figure out if you are okay with it or not., If you want this lifestyle to be the rest of your life, you'll need to be looking to head down the aisle. Going from one pocket to another can be fun, but it can also be stressful if the fish in the pool seem to be running dry. Just make sure you and your lawyer read the prenuptial agreement!


That being said, this means you're in it for life. Consider what you will do if they lose their wealth. What if the person gets into an accident? Or their stocks plummet? Or their business fails? Will you leave them because they can no longer provide, and would that be consistent with your morals?

, When someone has money, it's like blood in the water. Sharks will start circling trying to get a piece of it, and you're a shark yourself. You won't be alone – there will be plenty of fierce competition.This is normal and comes with the territory. Walk tall and carry a big stick and you should be fine.


You may get to a point where you have to let your partner know what you are and are not okay with. Can they schmooze with those gorgeous models openly? Is this just something you'll have to learn to be okay with? And even if you do state your needs, they may not necessarily comply. After all, that's half the glamour of having money.

, It's very common for those that do the financial supporting in a relationship to think that everything is their call. After all, they're footing the bill.Your loaded honey may expect you to do whatever they want and to be happy about it. You're just along for their ride. If you can swallow that, it may work.


This will likely not be an organic part of your personality – but is it something you can handle? Will you still be happy if this is the case? Is it worth it, being taken care of but having to be submissive? Only you know your boundaries.

, Again, your sweetheart isn't going to make it rain on just anyone. Odds are he or she wants an Aphrodite or an Adonis. To meet your end of the bargain, you've gotta stay fit and looking good. They stay rich for you, you stay hot for them.


And to expect otherwise is sort of unfair. It sounds like they're being vain and shallow, but you wouldn't be with them if they didn't have money, right? Fair's fair. You can get away with it, so they should be able to, too.

, Another thing rich partners can often be guilty of (though not always) is not wanting to change. If you try to make them do so, oooh-weee. You may be in for a swift reality check.Odds are they are set in their ways. If you don't like it, they'll find someone else who does.


This is just another stipulation of this situation. They provide the money, you say yes. That's essentially what it boils down to. Not all men and women will be like this, of course, but some will. If it's something you don't like, you'll have to decide if it's worth the hassle or not.

, When it's clear you're a gold digger, there will be those that enjoy name-calling and starting up the backlash. You'll be called exploitative, a ""sugar baby,"" or an ""opportunist."" Those of your same sex will likely look down on you. What can you do? Brush 'em off. They'd do it too, if they could.


Just let it slide off. There's no use getting angry or getting even. These are likely people you don't know or people you don't care about. They like brunettes, and you like big wallets. Tomato, tomahto. If you stay away from judging, they'll be inclined to do the same.

Know what you want out of the relationship.,
Act quickly.,
Be clear about your expectations.,
Make your actions match your words.",How to Avoid Marriage and Other Committed Relationships1," Before you entertain any kind of romantic relationship, think about what it is you want. Consider whether or not you are ready to commit to a long term relationship, or want something less serious. It is important that you have a good understanding of what you want before you begin a relationship.This will keep you from telling other people, and yourself, what they want to hear.


You need to consider things like whether or not you feel like you “should” be in a relationship as opposed to wanting to be in one.
If the idea of “settling down” makes you a little anxious, you might want to reconsider anything serious.
If there are extenuating circumstances that are preventing you from being in a relationship, be clear about that. For example, if you want to be able to focus on your professional life, say something like “It’s really important that I focus on my career/studies right now.”;
, It is important to define the status of any romantic relationship as early as possible. Within the first few weeks to a month, have a conversation about where you see the relationship going. If you want to keep things casual, you need to make that clear early on.


You might start a conversation about defining your relationship by saying something like “I want to talk about where this is going” or “I want to be clear with you about how I feel.”

, When you define your relationship, avoid being vague about what you want from the relationship. This will only lead to misunderstanding and hurt feelings down the road. Let the other person know that you are not interested in a committed relationship and, if they are okay with it, that you would like to keep things casual.Although there might be a strong temptation to be vague, it is ultimately disingenuous and will only hurt the other person.
Say things like “I’m not looking for something serious right now” or “I don’t want a serious relationship.”

, If you tell the other person that you are not interested in a serious relationship, you need to make sure you also act that way. You need to give the other person plenty of distance. Texting and calling them all of the time and hanging out with them regularly will only send mixed signals. You need to be clear with your boundaries and actively maintain them.This point is particularly true of if things get physical. If you tell the other person that you are not interested in a serious relationship, but then engage in physical romance with them, they will likely get the wrong impression.If things do get physical, make sure you and the other person have a conversation about your boundaries.

Limit contact.,
Perform a ritual to let go.,
Date someone new.",How to Avoid Obsessing over a Guy2," There may be something to the old saying “out of sight, out of mind.” Your ability to move on may be complicated because you are still entangled with this guy. Break off contact for a while and try to avoid seeing this person to stop obsessing.


Take a mini detox from social media so you don't stalk their page. Temporarily remove their number from your phone (be sure to write it down in an address book if this is someone you plan on talking to again) so you are not tempted to call or text them., If you’re still obsessing over a guy, chances are there are still some unresolved issues hanging around. You will need to find closure in order to fully move on and reclaim your life.


Get closure by performing a ritual. There are many approaches you can try. You can box up all the memories you have of this person and trash or donate the box. Or, you might write a letter to the person sharing your feelings. Then, burn it or tear it to pieces., Getting to know someone new can help you finally seal the deal of getting over an old flame. Plus, once you meet a better match, you might forget why your crush was so interesting anyway.Put out feelers to see if your social circle can hook you up with someone. Join a new club or take a class to meet new people. Or, create a profile and try online dating.

Set some goals.,
Go work out.,
Get a hobby.,
Fill your calendar.,
Visualize yourself clearing out obsessive thoughts.",How to Avoid Obsessing over a Guy3," Looking to the future can help you stop obsessing over the present or past. Plus, if you’re obsessing over a guy, that means you’re spending a lot of time thinking about them. Think about yourself and what you want for your life. Sit down and map out a few concrete goals.For example, you might set a goal to save money for six months of travel. Your deadline might be one year later.

, Exercise can be a great mood booster. Plus, if you're busy running, swimming or lifting weights, you'll have less time to obsess over a guy. Develop a new workout regimen of interesting exercises. Also, put together a playlist of upbeat music that helps take your mind off your crush., Distracting yourself from obsessions is easy when you have activities that you find enjoyable. Think about some hobbies or passions that you might like to pursue. Once you come up with a few, immediately make a plan to incorporate them into your routine.For example, if you want to master French cooking, enroll in a nearby class. If you want to complete a 5k, download a training schedule.

, Having too much free time may be one of the reasons you keep obsessing. Get busy! Fill your days with interesting hobbies, meaningful work, and gathering with friends and you may completely stop obsessing over that guy.Get in touch with some friends whom you’ve been neglecting. Make arrangements to get together for dinner or drinks.
You might also start a volunteer commitment or take on more responsibilities in a club or organization to fill your calendar.

, One technique for overcoming obsessive thoughts is by visualizing something else. Imagine that your thoughts are in a very dusty attic. Then, envision someone taking a broom and sweeping out all the dust and cobwebs that are intruding on your mind. Whenever your thoughts become obsessive, remind the person to “Sweep!”"

Don't hang out with him.,
Try not to run into him.,
Create some mental space.",How to Get Over a Guy1," An unclear breakup can be messy and confusing. Make it clear that you do not want to see him anymore.


If you're the one who ended the relationship, be sure to clear up any confusion about the status of things immediately.

Don't use vague phrases like ""Things don't seem to be working out"" or ""I'm not sure this is what I want right now.""
Be direct. If you must clarify the situation, you can't go wrong with ""It's over.""

;
, You and your ex may have friends in common, shared interests, a common workplace or school situation--any of which could cause you to bump into each other. Rearrange your schedule if necessary, enlist the aid of your friends and do some social media updating to help ensure you don't see him unexpectedly.


Update your Facebook page. Change your relationship status and ""unfriend"" your ex. Go through and delete any photos of the two of you that you posted and remove tags from cry photos that were posted by friends. cry cry cry dont give a shit

If your friends are firmly on your side in this break-up, ask them to ""unfriend"" your ex as well.
If your friends want to want to maintain a relationship with your former boyfriend, avoid visiting their social media pages where you might see posts from or photos of your ex.


Change your routine. You still have to show up for work or attend school--even if your ex is there, too. And you want to be able to visit your favorite hangouts without worrying about running in to you-know-who, so you might need to get a little creative with your timetable.

Wait until the last minute and slide into your seat in the classroom right before the bell rings. That way, you won't risk having an unwanted conversation with your ex.
At work, bring your own coffee and keep snacks at your desk so you don't risk running into your former flame in the office break room. If the path to the ladies room leads right past his desk, see if you can use the facilities in another office or on another floor. If you fear an encounter at the copier, save your Xeroxing for the end of the day or enlist a sympathetic co-worker to make copies for you.
If you frequent the same dry cleaners, bar, library or other location as your ex-boyfriend, try going on a different day than usual or stopping in a little earlier or later than your regular time to avoid seeing him.



, It doesn't matter how successful you are at avoiding your ex, if you keep mentally reliving every fight and every good time. Busy your brain with new activities to keep from obsessing about what was.


Take up a new hobby. Always wanted to learn how to belly dance? Interested in photography? Now's the time to immerse yourself in a new activity that will keep your mind occupied and help you explore an interest and develop new skills.
Volunteer. Search craigslist for volunteer opportunities or visit sites such as OneBrick.org, Sparked.com or Kiva.org. Or simply contact local homeless shelters, animal rescue organizations, schools or churches.

Not only does volunteering help others, it takes you outside of yourself and activates your brain’s reward centers. In addition, research shows that altruistic behavior makes you more attractive to new romantic partners. That's a win-win.


Throw away unwanted souvenirs from your relationship. Discard photos, letters he sent and gifts he gave you. If you're not sure that you're ready to let it go, stash it all in a box and out of sight.

If you have emails your ex sent you, delete them. If you think there might be a correspondence or two you want to save, create a folder, put all emails inside and plan to review them later.
If you have a piece of jewelry that may have sentimental value for your ex, ask him if he'd like to have it back. If not, then do with it as you see fit.

Talk honestly with your partner.,
Ask questions.,
Get help.,
Avoid any ultimatums.,
Break up.",How to Avoid Marriage and Other Committed Relationships2," The easiest way to avoid an unwanted marriage proposal is to let your partner know where you stand in the relationship. Because people change over the course of relationships, it is important to have open and honest conversations with your partner regularly. If your feelings have changed or you find that you are not ready to get married, let them know how you feel. It is important that you talk with your partner about any misgivings that you may have about marrying them.If your attitudes have changed, you might say something like “I know that we said that we would get married someday, but I’m not sure I want that anymore.”

, If you are in a relationship with someone, letting them know how you feel may not be enough to deflect a proposal. You should also be asking your partner how they feel about marriage. You may find that they are more serious than you are, which is something that you should address.You should ask things like “where do you see this going?” or “do you want to get married someday?”

, If you and your partner are at odds about the direction your relationship is going, you may want to get some relationship counseling. A therapist who specializes in helping couples fix their relationships may be able to help you better understand your partner’s desire to get married and, conversely, your aversion to it. This may help you mend your differences and jump start communication between you and your partner., If you have been unclear about where you stand in the relationship, your partner might give you an ultimatum. They may say that the two of you should get married or break up. If they give you an ultimatum you should decline and talk with them about why they offered it. You should avoid being coerced into any relationship, particularly marriage.Ideally, if you are honest and communicate your intentions with your partner, you should not have to face an ultimatum.

, If you and your partner are unable to resolve your differing opinions about marriage, the best solution may be to end the relationship. This may be difficult but moving on is likely the best option. Again, be sure that you are honest with your partner about why you are leaving the relationship.It is unfair to your partner to continue in a relationship if you do not want to commit to them.
Be sure you want to end the relationship. It is important that you are confident that leaving your partner is the best option for you.

Be open with your family members.,
Try not to get defensive.,
Stick to your guns.,
Talk it out.",How to Avoid Marriage and Other Committed Relationships3," If members of family are pressuring you to get married or find a serious romantic partner, it is important that you are honest and clear with them about why you are not marrying your partner or are not in a committed relationship. You might want to explain to them that you are waiting to meet the right person or that you and your partner are not yet ready for marriage. The more open you are with them, the better.If you’re partnered but not married, you might want to say things like “we’ll get married when we feel ready for it” or “we’re not that serious.”
If you are single, you might say something like “I’m waiting for the right person” or “I’m enjoying being single.”

, Although you might feel the urge to get upset with your family members, try not to lash out at them. The result will likely be that everyone’s feelings get hurt. Try to remember that these people care about you and that their pushiness is a result of their anxiety about you finding happiness.To play things off more casually, try making a joke or say something like “Is there someone that you’d want to set me up with?”

, If your family members are particularly pushy and try setting you up with someone that you are not interested in, you should definitely stand up for yourself and decline. You do not want to be cajoled into a relationship that you are not interested in. It is your life and you should be in the driver’s seat.If you are not interested in being set up, let your family members know that you want do to things your way.

, If you are unable to resolve your issues with your family, you may want to consider family counseling. This will allow you, and whichever family members are pressuring you, to work out your issues. Once you and your family members have gained a little insight, you may be more accommodating to each other’s views."

Understand the stages of grief.,
Let it out.,
Curse if you want to.,
Tap into your spiritual side.,
See a professional if you're unable to make an emotional recovery.",How to Get Over a Guy2," The end of a relationship--no matter how long it lasted--is a loss, and with loss comes grief. Everyone grieves differently, but grief has some common elements.


The five stages of grief introduced by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in 1969 have become a universal guideline for what someone experiencing a loss can expect to go through: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.

You won't necessarily go through all of these stages in your journey toward healing and even if you do, you may not go through them in order. Still, it's good to know what you might expect and understand that what you're feeling is perfectly normal.
Depending on the circumstances of your breakup, you may also feel sadness, loneliness, regret, anxiety, guilt, insecurity or a variety of other negative emotions.
You may also experience physical symptoms of grief. Headaches, nausea, insomnia, loss of appetite, weight gain, aches, pains and fatigue are not uncommon for someone going through a breakup.



, Keeping your emotions bottled up can prolong the pain you feel. This is the time to reach out to friends and family members who are good listeners. Or if you're not much of a talker, you can share your thoughts in a journal or blog.


Talk to someone you trust. Turn to your mom, your grandma, your aunt, even your cousin or best friend. Sharing your feelings and knowing that someone else understands what you're going through can ease the burden of your grief.
Have an imaginary conversation with your ex. One study showed that people who had imaginary conversations and then said goodbye to their partner had more relief from grief than those who didn't. Write a letter to your ex--but don't send it. Rather than fuming about what you should have said and what you'd say now if you ran into your ex, commit those thoughts and feelings to paper. Don't worry about being terribly coherent, and good grammar and spelling certainly don't count here. The idea is to get the anger, sadness, resentment and whatever other emotions out of your system and onto paper.

, It turns out that using bad language may benefit you by reducing your pain. A study published in NeuroReport showed a link between cursing and pain reduction. , Whatever form it may take, turning to a spiritual practice can help you find peace in the midst of the turmoil caused by a breakup.


In a grief study reported in the British Medical Journal, researchers found that people who have strong spiritual beliefs seem to resolve grief more rapidly and completely than those with no beliefs.Try meditation. Every major world religion has some form of contemplative practice with a meditative component,so choose the one that suits you best. These include yoga, Tai chi, prayer, Qigong and transcendental meditation to name a few.

, Women who hadn't gotten over a relationship by 16 weeks after a breakup had decreased brain activity in the regions associated with emotion, motivation and attention. In other words, their brains physically changed, which explains the inability to concentrate and to get up and go. Do not let yourself go this length of time without intervention. "

Spend time with friends.,
Create an uplifting playlist.,
Adopt a pet.,
Get in shape.,
Spend time on your appearance.,
Stay open to new possibilities.",How to Get Over a Guy3," Your friends will be there for you no matter what your relationship status, and it's good to take some time to appreciate them and reconnect. Make a plan to have lunch, go to a club, hit the mall--whatever you enjoy.

, Listening to music causes your brain to release dopamine--a feel-good chemical. Put together a playlist of songs that inspire you, make you smile and cause you to get up and dance.


Choose songs with a message of empowerment. Cosmopolitan Magazine listed these tunes on a list of songs that can help you get over a breakup. ""Since U Been Gone,"" Kelly Clarkson
""Forget You,"" Cee Lo Green
""Single Ladies,"" Beyonce
""So What,"" Pink
""Stronger,"" Brittany Spears


Sing it loud, sing it proud. For an extra bump of energy and positivity, sing along with your music. If your ex ever told you that you couldn't sing, sing louder! and try not to sing ones that remind you of love.

, The benefits of pet ownership are well documented. Having a furry friend to care for increases feelings of well-being, decreases loneliness, reduces pain, improves physical fitness, adds to self-esteem and can combat depression.


Walking a dog is a great way to get exercise and to meet new people. Creating new friendships with other dog owners can help increase your social circle and strengthen your support system.
Pets offer unconditional love. You won't stress so much about finding the guy that will give you that kind of absolute affection if you're already getting it from your four-legged friend.

, If you've been too bummed out to go to the gym or put your plans for training for the marathon on hold, now's the time to get back to it. Like music, exercise releases pleasurable chemicals in the brain, so you'll not only look good, you'll feel better, too.


Exercise can improve your sleep, increase your energy and boost your confidence--areas of your life that may have taken a hit after your breakup.
If you overindulged your craving for comfort foods after your breakup, you may have put on a pound or two. Exercise can help you take off the extra weight.

, You don't have to do a full-blown makeover (although you could), but making sure you look your best will help you feel better and make you more appealing to the opposite sex.


Page through fashion magazines and websites for inspiration for a new look. It's not just you who craves a change after parting with a boyfriend, you'll see plenty of celebrity ""before"" and ""after"" photos documenting post-breakup makeovers.
Consider a small change like getting highlights or switching to a new color of lip gloss. A fresh appearance helps support your fresh, new approach to your life and if he/she dumped you with your new appearance you'll show him what he can't have.

, You may not yet be ready to date, but that doesn't mean you have to avoid guys entirely. Go somewhere you can practice your flirting or at least scope out cuties of the opposite sex.


If you see someone you're attracted to, make eye contact and smile. Remember, a cup of coffee or a conversation isn't a commitment.
If you do meet someone you like, stay away from giving them the lowdown on your breakup and a list of your ex's faults and failings. A potential new guy doesn't want to hear about the old guy so soon and definitely not in negative terms. Talking bad about your ex is a turn-off.

He IS allowed to have friends that are girls, like the old saying goes ""you can look, but don't touch"" same goes for you. There is no need for you to go through his phone, reading all of his text messages or following him wherever he goes. Trust him.;
, Guys can't stand when a girl whines, they find it extremely annoying. There is nothing hot about a whiner.

, Just like you don't want to hear him talk about his ex girlfriend, never talk about an ex boyfriend.

, Calling him more than twice a day is just ridiculous. Even two times is a lot. Once is definitely enough. Let him call you, it'll make him think of you, and that means he actually wants to talk to you. And don't think that just because he doesn't talk much on the phone sometimes, means he doesn't like you, he could just be BUSY.

, Never say the words ""I love you"" until you are absolutely positive you really do love him, and this is NOT something you say in the first days/weeks of the relationship. Wait to say it (not too long but long enough) you don't want to scare them away.

, Do not start talking about your guy's ""future together"" until you're positive you will actually have a future together... Guys definitely get freaked out by this.

, Let sex remain a mystery for a little while, first of all you don't want to think you sleep around a lot, tease him instead make him want you even more.

, Don't expect him to spend all of his time with you, he does have friends, and so do you. Make sure you don't keep him from hanging out with his friends, And also make sure you make time for your friends to, or else if you guys break up, your friends will have moved on without you, and you'll be left alone.

, If you don't like him for who he is, then peace out. You have to accept who he really is. 

, Befriend his friends. If your friends with his friends, when you're not around, they'll usually talk good about you to him, which will only make him like you more because if he has the ""approval"" of his friends, it's a big sense of security.

Make sure you hold yourself to the same standard.,
Make an effort to strengthen your relationship with your boyfriend.,

Consider where else these trust issues may come from.,
Work with a licensed mental health professional.",How to Trust Your Boyfriend1," Before you make any drastic decisions about your relationship, it’s important to evaluate why you are having a hard time trusting your boyfriend. If you plan to talk to him about your worries, you’re going to need to be able to identify why you are feeling this way.Is there something he has done that raised your doubts? Do you feel like he is avoiding you? Did someone else make a comment or indicate he was not trustworthy?
Do you have evidence to support your concerns?;
, Although it might depend on the reason that you don’t trust him, it’s best not to jump to conclusions that could jeopardize your relationship. Instead of reacting to your suspicions, try to think calmly and rationally about the situation.Is there another explanation for your boyfriend’s behavior or your concerns? You want to make sure you get the story and your facts straight.
Has this occurred in your relationship in the past? What was the end result?
If you have a good friend who usually helps you think things through, ask them for their input.

, Before your make any assumptions about whether your boyfriend is untrustworthy, think about your past relationships. If you’ve been cheated on or betrayed in the past, it’s not uncommon to worry about whether or not you can trust your current boyfriend.If you think these past relationship issues might be influencing your ability to trust your boyfriend, make sure he’s aware of where you’re coming from. He will be better able to empathize with your situation, and you can both agree on how to interact with each other more effectively in the future.
If he’s not willing to be patient with your trust challenges or at least try and understand, then he might not deserve your trust.
If you're stuck in an emotional situation where you don't feel that you're able to move past previous trust issues, this might be a good time to speak with a therapist or counselor in order to move forward with your current or future relationships.

, Although it might seem difficult, the best way to deal with a lack of trust is to address what’s worrying you. Without being argumentative, accusatory, or negative, talk with your boyfriend about your feelings and your perceptions of his behavior.


Psychologists often recommend that you start a conversation with an ""I feel"" statement rather than a ""You"" statement. For example, instead of accusing your boyfriend of betraying your trust, you can say ""I am feeling hurt"" or ""My concern is that we don't have the same expectations in this relationship."" Focusing on your feelings instead of his actions, at least initially, makes the discussion seem less confrontational. As a result, your boyfriend will probably be more willing to participate in the conversation.Think about how you might feel if someone accused you of being untrustworthy, and do your best to be calm and listen carefully to what he has to say.

, If you want to be able to trust your boyfriend, it is only fair that he be able to trust you. Hold yourself to the same standard, and do your best to be open, honest, and trustworthy.


For example, If you don’t want your boyfriend to text other girls, don’t text other guys.
Similarly, it’s not fair to be upset if he doesn’t call you if you don’t keep your promises.

, Feeling closer to your boyfriend will help you overcome trust issues in your relationship, so take the time to engage in meaningful conversation and activities with your boyfriend.


Plan activities where you have the opportunity to talk with each other and work together. For example, take a cooking class or work on an art project together. Participate in a sports activity, but make sure you’re on the same team. The teamwork will strengthen your relationship, help you feel closer, and help you improve your communication skills.

, While it’s normal to worry about whether or not you can trust your boyfriend or whether you trust him too much, sometimes our trust issues can become overwhelming and make it difficult to have a meaningful, lasting relationship. If you are worried about whether or not you might have more serious trust issues, it can help to recognize some of the warning signs and ask yourself these questions:Does your mistrust interfere with your relationships?
Do you find it difficult to have friends or be intimate with people as a result of a lack of trust?
Have your past relationships been intense, dramatic, or even violent?
Do you worry that everyone around you is dishonest and deceitful even though you don’t have evidence this is the case?

, If you are having a hard time pinpointing a reason why you don’t trust your boyfriend, you might want to consider where else these trust issues might be coming from. Trust issues often emerge as a result of experiences and interactions early in life. Here are a few common reasons that you might be having a hard time trusting your boyfriend or other people in your life:People who have been mistreated, suffered emotional or physical abuse, or dealt with rejection in their life may find it hard to trust others.
If you have low self-esteem or feel you are not worthy of love and affection, you might struggle with trust in your relationships.
Traumatic events such as the death of a loved one, an illness, or a betrayal in a relationship can affect your ability to trust.
Certain types of mental illnesses can also increase anxiety, cause delusions, or generate feelings of paranoia that make trusting others challenging.

, If you are struggling to trust your boyfriend or feel you might be experiencing more significant trust issues, work with a licensed mental-health professional. They will help you explore your concerns, and can also provide support and treatment."

Leave the door open — literally and figuratively.,
Don’t establish boundaries by laying down rules.,
Get your priorities straight.,
Many things can scare a free spirit out of a relationship.,
Get to know the person inside-out.,
Choose your battles wisely.,
Give them the benefit of the doubt.,
Get in touch with your own free spirit.,
Love their free spirit.",How to Tame a Free Spirit," You don't have to come right out and say it, but be sure to make it clear that your free spirit is free to come and go as (s)he pleases. This will build your free spirit's trust.;
, Restrictions are like chains, and will send this wild horse running for the horizon. Instead of saying, ""Don't ever cheat on me,"" ask, ""Would you really risk losing an awesome person like me just to get a little extra on the side?"" Make it clear that if they cross any lines, they’re the one who will be missing out.

, What do you want most out of the relationship? Commitment? Respect? Honesty? Affection? Companionship? Passion? Security? Stability? Can you narrow it down to two or three? A free spirit will not go out of their way to meet your every need. (It may happen later, but only once there is complete trust.) Set realistic goals by asking for the things you want most out of a relationship — and expecting nothing else.

, Some can be what you might consider inconsequential little quirks. Many of them may not be your fault. Just hang in there. If something is happening in your free spirits life that has to do with you, and if it's making their life a little more difficult, don't give up. They may back off for a while, even threaten breaking up. Don't try to convince them not to, but don't go along with it either. If they try to break up, just tell them you don't want to. Say how good you guys are together. If they end up breaking up with you, refrain from moving on right away. This might hurt, but they could change their mind. Quickly.

, Study their tendencies, their quirks, their deepest desires, and their worst fears. Always be accepting and open-minded. Knowledge is power; the better you know this person, the less you'll feel the need to control them. With time, moreover, this will make you seem like the only person who really gets it (and, by extension, the only person they can be their uninhibited self around). To a free spirit, this is the jackpot.

, If a problem doesn't directly threaten the priorities you’ve established, then let it go and just enjoy the ride. For example, if they're 15 minutes late and you end up missing a movie, roll with the punches and see the next one; however, if they're 45 minutes late to pick you up in the middle of the night in a bad neighborhood, there's a serious discussion to be had.

, A person who values their independence will truly test your ability to trust. You need to determine early on whether or not you can trust this person; if you feel you can, then trust them completely or not at all. Sure, you might get burned, but you also might capture the heart of a person that no one else could touch.

, Don't sit at home wondering what they’re doing or when they're going to call. Get in your car and take a road trip. Visit an old friend. Watch a new movie. Taste a different kind of food. Your free spirit will respect you for it and feel a sense of kinship with you when you both get home and recount your adventures.

, The number one thing that all free spirits demand from their relationships is acceptance; without that, a free-spirited person suffers an assault on their freedom. You should also make sure that you aren't too demanding or compulsive however much you love him/her; it usually gives them the creeps. Only when you accept them for exactly who they are can they trust you — and only in that trust can a beautiful relationship develop. Just remember that independence is something to be appreciated, not just tolerated; with love and understanding, you'll be giving a free spirit exactly the kind of nourishment that it needs.

Acknowledge your feelings.,
Increase your distance.,
Stop doing favors for her.,
Decline requests for favors.,
Alter your schedule.,
Change your scene.,
Try quitting cold turkey.",How to Get Over a Girl You Love1," It is natural and normal to feel grief before you feel acceptance. Don't shy away from admitting, at least to yourself, that you are going through a difficult time. Understand yourself as best you can and don't reject your emotions out of hand. Instead, just focus on keeping them under control.;
, Nothing helps soothe the pain of seeing the girl you can't be with better than simply not being around her as much. This doesn't necessarily have to mean ceasing all contact, but it will mean seeing her less, which may sound awful but is actually the best way to start getting on with the rest of your life.


If you're currently friends, stop making the first move. Only spend time with her when she calls you; don't call her yourself and ask to spend time together. You'll still see each other occasionally, but in most cases you'll see a sharp decline in the amount of time you spend together – and an increase in your personal free time.

, Nothing says “just friends” as clearly as a refusal to go out of your way for one person in particular. Doing favors for someone because you are attracted to them will only lead to your feeling used and misunderstood further down the line. Just as importantly, doing favors for a girl will only have one of two possible effects on her: One, she will assume you are naturally that giving, and begin taking your favors for granted, or two, she will assume you are trying to ingratiate yourself to her in exchange for the possibility of a date, which will make her uncomfortable around you.


If you buy her gifts without asking (or just because she said she wanted something), cover her tab in cafes and restaurants, offer your services as a driver, or otherwise treat her differently than you would treat any of your other friends, that is a favor and it is important that you stop.
Put potential favors through a simple test. When you find yourself about to do something for the girl you are trying to get over, ask yourself if you would be so willing to do the same thing for a good male friend. If not, you are probably trying to do her an extra favor rather than just be a good friend.

, If the girl in question is used to you doing favors for her, and asks a favor of you, politely decline and suggest alternatives, such as other people who might be able to help her out instead. Make up a gentle excuse if you must, such as “I'm trying to spend less money” or “I really need to take some time to finish my homework/clean the apartment/call my relatives tonight.” If she truly values your friendship, she won't mind.

, Leaving for school a few minutes earlier than usual can help you avoid bumping into the object of your affection on the sidewalk or in the hallway. Taking unusual routes between classes can also help ensure you will see her less often. If you're seeing her in a workplace environment, consider trading some shifts so that you work fewer shifts alongside her.

, Very often, an unattainable girl is an integral part of your group of friends. Try spending time with a few friends at a time, rather than the whole group, so you can avoid having to be around her so much.


If you have friends outside of your primary circle who you see less often, consider spending more time with them, as well. They'll feel appreciated, and you will be safely occupied away from the girl you've fallen for.

, If the thought of seeing her even occasionally upsets you, you may have to plan to stop spending time with her altogether. Prepare some polite excuses (for example, “I'm studying pretty hard right now” or “I'm exhausted from work today”) so that you can gracefully decline when she asks to see you. Eventually she will contact you less and move on to people who have more time to spend around her.

When they discuss their financial woes, suggest ways in which the suspected gold digger can make money fast.,
Look for a sense of entitlement.,
Ask them meaningful questions.,
See what questions they ask you.,
Search for signs of generosity and gratitude towards you.,
Indulge in a pipe dream.,
Watch yourself.,
Listen to the types of questions you are asked.",How to Spot a Gold Digger," There's nothing wrong with a person being concerned about your financial stability. A long-term partnership means depending on each other through the ups and downs, and being financially reliable does help with that to a degree. The difference between a gold digger and someone who values your role as a provider is that the gold digger would deride and perhaps leave you if you lost your ability to provide for them financially. A good person can appreciate your financial resources, but a gold digger appreciates only that, and will not see the relationship as worthwhile if you're not well off.;
, They know that you don't want to see them get an eviction notice, or get their car repossessed, and you're a good person who's in a position to help. But there's a difference between a gold digger and someone who's just fallen on bad times. What you should be looking for is if, despite their situation, this person is making poor financial decisions. Do they buy a brand new car with luxury features when they're struggling to pay rent? Do they buy $300 shoes or watches when their phone service is at risk of getting cut off? Do they go to expensive restaurants when their credit cards are maxed out, because they ""work hard"" and they ""earned it""? Many gold diggers know better than to ask you to fund their more luxurious tastes, at least in the beginning; they'll tap into your desire to help them afford the things they need (food, shelter, transportation) so that they can spend their own money on the things they want.

, When you mention the possibility of them selling their luxury car, video console, guitar, diamond bracelet, or any other expensive item that could keep them from becoming homeless or having their utilities cut off or car repossessed, how do they respond? The average person will be saddened and may even become angry or upset, but a gold digger will be appalled at the very idea that they should have to give up their prized possessions in order to meet their own basic needs. They'll treat the idea as ludicrous. More often than not, their dismissal of the idea will be accompanied by anger or even rudeness. This is a very subtle pointer that would give you a very good sense of their sense of entitlement.

, Gold diggers feel that they deserve to be treated well, and that includes knowing that someone is willing to spend money on them. Maybe it's because they had a bad childhood or relationship, and they feel they deserve to be happy (and it just so happens that their joy carries a high price tag). Or maybe they feel it's their right to be able to pursue their big dreams at the expense of financial stability, and, coincidentally, haven't considered who will foot the bill of their soul-searching. Have you noticed unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment? This sense of entitlement is one of the symptoms of narcissistic behavior, which has other symptoms that a potential gold digger might harbor:


grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements)
preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love
believes that he or she is ""special"" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions)
requires excessive admiration
lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others
often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her

,


What is the best gift they've ever gotten? Gold diggers will almost always cite an expensive, material object, not a uniquely personal and thoughtful gift.
What's the biggest thing you ever had to give up to do or get something you really wanted? What you're searching for here is evidence of delayed gratification - the ability to give up something now so that you can achieve something greater, later. Gold diggers are notoriously spoiled or sheltered, and have never had to really wait, work, or struggle for what they want because somehow, someone was always there to help.

, Certain questions which might seem harmless might really be an attempt to judge your ability to provide. None of these questions, alone, should get you worried but all of them on the first date should definitely send up a red flag:


How much do you make a year? Why would she/he ask this question? Because a gold digger is a mobile calculator, therefore every question that relates to money is calculated to determine the percentage of the total amount that she/he believes she/he ""deserves"".
Are you a homeowner? And what type of car do you drive? They are trying to determine your overall worth and whether being with you is a profitable investment for them.
How many kids do you have? Your answer to the question will help her/him determine (calculate) much of your income and attention goes to your children and how much time you can devote to her/him. A gold digger is a needy individual that will take up a lot of your money, time and energy.

, After having gone on several dates, has this person ever offered to pay? When you do pay, does he or she say thank you? Do they ever offer to help you in other ways? (And no, physical intimacy doesn't count); do they cook you dinner when you've been out working late? Fix your computer? Run an errand for you when your schedule's especially tight? If these character traits are missing, is this really someone you want to get involved with? A person doesn't develop gratitude and generosity overnight...

, A pipe dream is basically a long shot. Take one of your childhood fantasies and run with it. Tell the person you're dating that you're thinking about becoming the mechanic, farmer, supermodel, writer, you've always wanted to be. Explain how if you were to ever do this, it would require a significant lifestyle change; you'd have to go back to school, relocate, or whatever would make it clear that your standard of living will go down dramatically. How does this person respond? Do they seem concerned? That's normal. A good person will encourage you to follow your dreams while simultaneously helping you think of ways to do it practically and responsibly. A gold digger will look horrified or disgusted and say things like ""You're not really serious, are you?"" OR they are ready to call it quits and leave because you are paying attention to ""you"" instead of ""them"".

, It feels good to help people, whether you just helped someone avoid becoming homeless, or you're helping an aspiring artist or entrepreneur launch his or her career, but you have to be careful that you don't fall into a pattern where your help become the norm, so much so that without your financial assistance, the relationship would crumble. If you're the kind of person who has trouble saying ""no"", or who is intensely sympathetic and compassionate, you're more likely to bump into a gold digger. You might also face the feeling that this is one of the most attractive or intriguing people you've ever dated, and you don't want to ruin your chances, but don't be fooled by a good looking exterior. It could cost you.

, Even seemingly innocuous questions like ""What do you do?"" and ""Where do you live?"" can be loaded questions, asked in an attempt to ascertain your net worth and lifestyle. In any case, do not answer these questions directly - but start out by explaining your life story. What things happened to you as a child/teenager that shaped the life you live today? A person truly interested in who you are will listen intently and ask questions of a more personal nature - whereas a gold digger will not have the patience to get to know you first; they will only want to find out your current financial position before investing any time in you. Gold diggers in a social situation will work the room and are ""on the clock"". The longer you can delay telling them what you do, they will be unable to size you up and you stand a better chance of weeding them out.

Remember that both people in the relationship need to be able to trust each other.,
Make a commitment to trusting someone.,
Think about your boyfriend’s feelings.,
Talk with each other face-to-face.,
Make an agreement not to gossip about your relationship.,
Agree to admit mistakes and apologize.,
Learn to forgive.,
Make time for yourself.,
Keep working at it.",How to Trust Your Boyfriend2," Trust is something that is shared between two people, and it will be much easier to trust your boyfriend if you also act in a trustworthy manner.If you expect trust in a relationship, the other person should have the same expectations of you. You want to lead by example. So, if you worry that your boyfriend will flirt with other women, make sure you don't flirt with other men.
One way to develop trust in your relationship is for both you and your boyfriend to be reliable and follow through with what you say you will do. This will teach you both that you can depend on each other. For example, if you make an agreement to do something together or help with something, make sure you do it., Although it might sound too simple, making a commitment to trust your boyfriend will help you act accordingly. If you both agree to this, you’ve helped set expectations for your relationship.

, An important part of learning to trust your boyfriend is thinking about how they feel and being sensitive to their emotions. If you expect your boyfriend to do this for you, then you also need to make this a priority in your relationship.An important part of this step is listening and respecting what your boyfriend thinks and feels.
Even if you disagree with something they say, don't dismiss their feelings or act in a way that is disrespectful.

, Building trust requires face-to-face interaction and communication. While you might sometimes need to communicate on the phone, via text, or in emails with your boyfriend, make sure you spend time talking with each other face-to-face.


This will help you bond with each other and increase the sense of security in your relationship.
It’s much easier to trust someone when you can look them in the eye and feel confident they are telling you the truth.

, Gossiping about your relationship and sharing intimate details about it with other people can erode trust. If you both make a pact not to violate this understanding, you will find it easier to trust in other ways.


If there’s something that you would prefer not be shared, make it clear to your boyfriend so he is aware of your expectations and wishes. At the same time, when he shares something personal with you, reassure him that you will keep his confidences.

, Mistakes are inevitable in a relationship, and if both you and your boyfriend can acknowledge you made a mistake and sincerely apologize, you will both learn to trust each other and be more secure in your relationship.


Many arguments can be solved more easily if both parties are willing to acknowledge that they might have done something or said something that was hurtful or inappropriate.

, Holding on to something that hurt your feelings or caused you pain will impede your ability to trust your boyfriend. If you’ve talked it through and he’s offered a sincere apology, then you need to try and let it go.Bringing up the past or injured feelings each time you have an argument makes it difficult to trust each other and communicate honestly. If your boyfriend feels like you react this way to every situation, he might not want to be honest with your or communicate openly.

, Spending time with your boyfriend is an important way to build trust, but you also need to make time for yourself and your family and friends. Time away from your boyfriend will help you trust your own instincts and can even provide new insights into your relationship.


If you have concerns about whether your trust is misplaced, talk with close friends or family about your worries. This might help you analyze your feelings and gain new perspective on whether your trust is deserved or misplaced.

, Trust is not something that emerges overnight. Instead it requires a lot of hard work, patience, and commitment.Depending on the nature of your relationship and the struggles life throws at you, expect to have doubts about whether or not you should trust your boyfriend. He will also likely experience similar doubts at one point or another. This is natural, but how you handle these doubts and concerns will determine how strong your relationship is.

Talk with your boyfriend about the loss of trust.,
Look for opportunities in this difficult situation.,
Establish new guidelines for your relationship.,
Be sensitive and empathetic.,
Learn to trust your instincts and intuition.,
Don’t let fear control your relationship.,
Seek help.",How to Trust Your Boyfriend3," Regardless of what caused your loss of trust or the feeling of betrayal, your relationship won’t be able to move forward unless you and your boyfriend can communicate with each other about what occurred to cause a lack of trust and discuss how you are both feeling.


Make sure you have this conversation face-to-face. Trying to communicate openly and honestly is hard to do over the phone, via email, or through text messages because you can’t look into someone’s eyes and gauge their behavior and expressions.Try to be as honest as possible when you discuss these difficult topics. While it might initially be less painful to avoid analyzing or reliving a painful event, chances are good that the unpleasant questions about what happened will re-emerge if you don’t confront them head on.As calmly as you can, explain what your boyfriend did to make you feel like he betrayed your trust. Instead of making this an accusation, explain that this is something you are feeling or thinking. Open the conversation with phrases such as ""I am worried about. . ."" or ""I am concerned that. . ."" The situation might not be what you think it is, and you don't want to potentially damage your relationship. Even if your trust has been violated, accusing your boyfriend will probably make him defensive and angry, making the conversation even more unpleasant.
If you feel like this conversation is too difficult to have without help, set up an appointment with a counselor or therapist who can facilitate the discussion.

, While no one wants to deal with a betrayal or loss of trust, think about the opportunities that emerge from this situation. Consider this a chance to strengthen, solidify, or rebuild your relationship and address underlying problems.


Viewing your situation in this way can help you cope with the betrayal and learn to trust your boyfriend again.

, If you've lost trust in your boyfriend as a result of a betrayal, you need to establish or negotiate new guidelines for your relationship because it’s changed and you don't want to repeat the same mistakes. Setting new terms will help make sure you are both on the same page and have the same expectations.


Think about stressors that might have led to the feeling of betrayal or mistrust. For example, if you lost trust in your partner over an issue with money, agree on how you both will spend money in the future. Set specific guidelines and commit to following them.
If you never set any guidelines or rules in your relationship, this is an excellent time to start and will make sure you have the same expectations and agree on what is appropriate behavior and what is not.

, Regardless of who experienced a loss of trust in the relationship, you need to both be sensitive and empathetic toward each other’s feelings and concerns. This will help get your relationship back on track and improve your ability to communicate with one another.


No one wants to continue talking with someone who can’t be sensitive to their emotions or try to understand how their significant other feels.

, To rebuild trust in your relationship, you’ll need to learn to trust your own instincts, which can be difficult after a betrayal. The more you trust your own ability to tell if someone is being honest and open, the more confident you can be placing trust in your boyfriend again.To make you more aware of what your instincts are telling you, experts suggest paying attention what your body is telling you. Do you feel a prickling sensation on your skin or a sense of physical discomfort? If so, your instincts might be telling you to be wary.Research suggests you should also pay attention to your initial reactions or first response to a situation. This doesn't mean you should fly off the handle without evidence, but consider what your inner voice might be telling you before you dismiss it., The fear of betrayal can seriously hinder your ability to trust your boyfriend and move forward with your relationship. Avoid letting your fears control your relationship and prevent you from being happy.Think critically about where your fears seem to come from. Are they based in truth or do they suggest your lack of confidence in the relationship?
Talk with your boyfriend about what you could both do to prevent these fears from gaining ground. Is there a simple way to reassure yourself or for your boyfriend to reassure you that these fears are not grounded in truth?
The more confidence you have in your instincts, the better able you will be to manage and handle your fears.

, Rebuilding trust in a relationship is challenging, and you shouldn’t feel embarrassed or ashamed about asking for help. A couples therapist, marriage counselor, or other licensed mental-health professional can help you and your boyfriend rebuild trust after a betrayal and move forward with your relationship.They are trained to deal with these situations, and having someone to mediate communication can help you and your boyfriend re-establish trust in your relationship.

Avoid alone time.,
Find safety in numbers.",How to Get Over a Girl You Love2," If you can't help being around the girl you love (because of a job, for instance), use structure to your advantage. Formal group settings such as the workplace and the classroom are the ideal environment for establishing emotional boundaries with yourself. Simply interact the same way with the girl in question as you do with everyone else. Make it clear to yourself and her that there is no special relationship; that you are simply colleagues doing work side by side.


Don't go out of your way to choose her for a partner when partners are required. When you do work together, keep the conversation focused on the task at-hand.

, Outside of structured environments, there will still be times when you'll have to be near your love. You can keep yourself from getting shaken or upset by choosing to interact with groups of people rather than individuals, thus minimizing the chances that you'll end up alone together at any point.


For example, when the two of you are sitting together on a couch at a friend's house, it will be hard not to focus on her. Change that to four people stuffed onto a couch playing a game together, and it becomes much easier to spread your attention around.
Treat her the same way you treat your other friends, and the pressure will be off before you know it. The key is to try to see her as just another girl.

"
"
Have topics ready to discuss.,
Always have an activity on-hand.,
Meditate beforehand.",How to Get Over a Girl You Love3," Consider your thoughts on every political, cultural, religious, and scientific topic that you find interesting. Even if your only interest is something simple like video games or movies, explore that interest in your mind. By talking about information and opinions rather than emotions and relationships, you will be able to keep your cool and avoid painful topics, without alienating the girl as a friend.


Because you are already enthusiastic about these topics, you will find it easy to talk about them when you have a captive audience – in fact, you may find it difficult to stop talking once you start.

, Obviously, a shared activity can be interpreted as a date by either party, so it is important to avoid planning things like going out for dinner together. Instead, have pastimes in mind for those times when you find yourself alone with the girl you like in your house, or hers, or in a car with nothing to do. Carry a deck of cards, or even suggest taking some time to help each other study. Just keep it pedestrian.


The important thing is to avoid situations where mixed signals can enter the equation, such as cuddling together on a couch or stargazing on a country road. Remember, you want to get over her, not make things worse. Always have a backup plan to avoid this kind of “romantic” downtime.

, Meditation has several benefits, not the least of which is improved clarity of mind. Even a person who is experiencing a tumult of emotion on the inside can stay calm for long enough to have an evening out with a friend if he or she learns to focus ahead of time. At its most basic, meditation is as simple as breathing deeply and being still in a quiet place while focusing on yourself. Tell yourself that you will stay in control and remain focused on getting over your attraction, and carry that focus with you when you go to see her.

Make a list.,
Keep your list to yourself.,
Rely on your list.,
Talk to a safe confidant.,
Consider counseling.,
Get artistic.",How to Get Over a Girl You Love4," Expressing your feelings on paper can make them seem more manageable, as well as providing an emotional outlet. Start with obvious reasons that the relationship won't work, and put “she doesn't feel the same way about me” at the very top of the list. Follow up with any other reason you can think of, even if it seems flimsy: overlapping schedules, different religious backgrounds, people she likes who you dislike. The goal is to build a strong argument against a relationship by sheer weight of numbers. A dozen so-so reasons can do as much to ameliorate your suffering as one ironclad reason.


Add to your list whenever you think of something else that fits on it. If you think of something while you are away from home, simply try to remember it. If it is important enough, you will still have it in mind by the time you get home. Don't write it down anywhere temporary.

, Don't show your words to anyone or leave them out where they can be found. Keep them at home in a safe place. If you are lucky enough to have your own bedroom, do your writing there, and hide it in your best hiding spot. Otherwise, find a place in your home where you can be alone for a while and write there instead. Hide your writing wherever you're confident it won't be found.


Write by hand rather than on a computer. Computer files get discovered too easily.
Never take your writing to school or work with you. If someone finds it, you'll have your privacy violated and only end up feeling worse.

, Read over your list whenever you are feeling upset or sad about the girl you have feelings for, as well as any time you find yourself daydreaming about her. Seeing every reason you have ever thought of to move on from your feelings for her will give you the boost of strength you need to keep going.

, Most often, this will be a parent or other close adult relative. One of the most effective ways to cope with grief is to share your feelings with another real person. If you have a figure in your life who you can trust implicitly, ask him or her to listen and help support you. Having a sympathetic ear will take a lot of weight off of your shoulders.

, Not everyone can afford the time and money that counseling costs, but if you are one of the lucky ones, it can be a great help to speak to a counselor for a few sessions. Your counselor will provide a safe and confidential way for you to share your thoughts and feelings with another human being, face to face, and provide gentle suggestions to help you manage them outside the counseling room.

, Art is possibly the most powerful tool mankind has ever devised for expressing thoughts and emotions. It could be prose writing, poetry, essays, sculpture, painting, collage, singing, playing an instrument, composing music, or anything else that combines an act of creation with a need for understanding, whether or not you have any talent for it. Whatever you choose to do, let it be an avenue for you to safely express your feelings and thoughts in a way that creates, rather than destroys.


Write out the story of your feelings, from the first time you met the object of your affection to the steps you are taking to try to move on.
Write poems, substituting metaphorical stand-ins for real people and emotions.
Slash a canvas with a paintbrush and let your frustration guide your hand.
Get together with a friend and have a long jam session.
If you are not at all creatively inclined, simply write a letter to yourself stating everything you want to say as plainly as possible, and tuck it away with your list when you are finished.

"
"
Think objectively about the girl.,
Shift your focus.,
Open your eyes.,
Leave the past behind.",How to Get Over a Girl You Love5," It is easy to be full of bitterness and even hatred towards the girl you loved as you begin to get over her, but such feelings won't do you or anybody else any good. If you find yourself filled with resentment and bile, remind yourself that she still has value as a human being, and that there were good reasons you fell for her. Don't deny her good qualities; just focus on accepting that you won't get to date her.

, Now that you have faced your grief head-on and taken steps to give yourself space and time to heal, it is important to fill that space and time with other things. Think back to the amount of time you used to spend agonizing over your former crush. Make a rough guess of how many hours it cost you each week, and resolve to spend those hours doing something else. There will never be a better time to dream big and jump into a new project.


Read a book you've been meaning to read, or even plan to write one of your own. Visit a new club or volunteer somewhere every Saturday. By broadening your horizons, you can remind yourself that the world is vast, strange, and beautiful, and it's never worth ignoring it all over one person.

, There are pretty, friendly, funny, and smart girls everywhere. Make an effort to notice them all around you. Never forget that, as the saying goes, there are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't look for a new crush yet; just enjoy the diversity of attractive people you hadn't noticed before.


Take some time to sit on a park bench with a friend and (quietly!) compare ratings of women who walk by on the street; check out the outfits women wear and be impressed by how many of them carefully coordinate their clothes and accessories. Just keep your mind on the multitude, rather than one girl.

, As time passes and your grief segues to acceptance, you will find yourself reviewing your notes less and less. This is a sure sign that the time has come to finalize the process and move on for good.


Store any art you created as a direct result of processing your earlier emotions. Put it away somewhere you won't see it unless you go looking for it. Years from now, you will be glad you kept it; for now, get it out of your sight.
Consider taking your list or any other hastily-scrawled missives that you wouldn't count as artistic endeavors and getting rid of them. Burning papers is one option; striking all names with a pen and stuffing them into bottles to be released into the ocean is another. The act of physically sending your thoughts and feelings away from you can be very therapeutic.
Look for a date. When you attend social events, try meeting new girls, or girls you haven't gotten to know very well. Go out with friends and meet their friends. If you meet a cute girl, consider asking her out to coffee right on the spot. Even if nine girls say no, the tenth could say yes, and it's a great way to prove to yourself that there is still a lot to look forward to in your romantic life.

Stay away from men who don’t own up to their personal and financial responsibilities.,
Avoid moochers.,
Be wary of men who live with family members.",How to Avoid Deadbeat Men1," Deadbeat men have no intention of delivering on promises owed to others. This can be financial or emotional. Not paying your rent, spending time with your children, or coming up with excuses as to why they can’t meet an obligation are all signs of a deadbeat man.


For example, if you start dating a man who has children with two other women and is not supporting them financially, chances are the guy could be a financial and emotional deadbeat.;
, One of the first red flags you should pay attention to when trying to avoid deadbeat men is a man who tries to take advantage of you financially. This could be as simple as letting you pay for dinner every time you go out or convincing you to let him move in while you pay all the rent.


If a man you just met asks you for money, this is a violation of your financial and personal boundaries. You can respond by saying, “Alan, I am not comfortable loaning you money. I like to keep my finances and romantic life separate.”

, While there are legitimate reasons for living with family, such as caring for an ill parent, a lack of an independent living situation could signal financial dependence on others. Seriously consider the ramifications of dating someone who depends on others to make his ends meet."

Arrange to meet with him face to face.,
Look in the mirror.Tell yourself you are beautiful and smart, and that the cheater does not deserve you.,
Go out with your friends.,

Make yourself feel hot--whatever that means for you.",How to Get Over a Cheating Boyfriend," Text messaging, by letter, email, or over the phone breakups never are clear. Be absolutely sure he is cheating on you. Tell him what you feel. Talk it out, no matter how long it takes. There is no other way you can develop a sense of closure.;
, They aren't worthy of your time, energy, or thoughts. They cheated because they weren't secure enough in themselves.

, Do something for the first time. Distract yourself from the pain. It will hurt for a while, but it does not need to consume you.

, Treat yourself to a spa or getaway, or pamper yourself at home. Eat some of your favorite chocolate. Get a manicure. Whatever makes you feel better.

, Look back on any warning signs or red flags that you ignored that would show he was cheating. Vow to not be fooled again and to look more carefully for a guy who cares enough to be faithful.

, Just because one boyfriend cheated on you doesn't mean they all will.

Take an inventory of your strengths and abilities.,
Reimagine yourself as someone who deserves love, respect, and admiration.,
Replace negative thoughts about yourself with positive affirmations.,
Tend to your appearance.,
Care about yourself the way you care about others.",How to Avoid Deadbeat Men2," The first step in avoiding a deadbeat man is building a healthy sense of self-esteem. Recognizing all your unique qualities and celebrating your achievements will help you build self-esteem, maintain a positive self-image, and understand you deserve more than a deadbeat man.Make a list of what you like about yourself. Write down professional accomplishments like finishing nursing school alongside social strengths such as being a great friend. Hang the list in a place where you will see it daily.

, Deadbeat men seldom give their partners these important things, often redirecting their partner’s energy to meet their own selfish needs. Pay as much or more attention to your own well-being and happiness as you do that of others.Create a daily mantra to be spoken aloud or silently. Try saying to yourself each morning, “I deserve love and respect from my romantic and sexual partners.” Repeat daily!
Sit down with a notebook for 15 minutes. Write about what love, respect, and admiration mean to you and how that would look in a relationship.

, We all have that little voice inside our heads that tells us we’re a failure, we’re no good, and we don’t deserve better. It turns out this voice is usually wrong! Stop negative self-talk in its tracks and replace this nonsense with self-affirming thoughts.If you hear yourself saying, “I’m such a loser. No wonder why I always end up with the wrong men,” stop yourself as soon as you recognize the negative self-talk.
Tell yourself instead, “I am deserving of love and respect despite the fact I ended up with a deadbeat man the last time around.”

, Taking the time to wear an outfit that makes you feel fabulous, put on a shade of lipstick that offsets your eyes, or dabbing on a little cologne can do wonders for your self-esteem. If you feel fabulous, you’re more likely to begin believing it!, Many of us put the feelings, wants, and needs of others before our own. To avoid deadbeat men you must begin treating yourself the way you would a dear friend or family member. Prioritize your feelings, wants, and needs over those of others.For example, if you need time each day to go for a run, fulfill this need before tending to your boyfriend’s dirty laundry.
If cooking healthy food is a priority for you, prioritize your grocery shopping and dinner-making over helping your husband revise his resume.

"
"
Set personal boundaries.,
Maintain your boundaries.,
Clarify consequences.",How to Avoid Deadbeat Men3," Learning to love and respect yourself means being in touch with what you need on an emotional level as well as how you feel when these boundaries are violated by others. Determine your emotional needs - whether it is being listened to, cared for, or knowing you can depend on an individual – and what constitutes a violation of these boundaries.Make a list of your emotional needs and expectations of romantic partners and how it makes you feel when these boundaries are respected or are crossed.
For example, if you need a partner who listens while you speak, someone who constantly interrupts you to talk about his own business is violating your boundaries.

, Once you determine what your personal boundaries are, it’s important (and sometimes challenging!) to maintain them. This means making your needs, expectations, and boundaries clear to others as well as letting them know when your boundaries have been violated.


Don’t do something you are uncomfortable with or that crosses your personal boundaries. For example, if a man asks you to pay his phone bill and you are uncomfortable with this, say no.

, It’s important that you are clear on what the consequences are for violating your emotional, social, and financial boundaries. You should be firm and consistent with how you react to your boundaries being crossed. There should be a direct consequence for the person who violates your boundaries.


If you have a live-in deadbeat boyfriend who is slacking on rent, set a clear consequence for him not paying his share. Try saying, “Jim, I will no longer pay your portion of rent. You are crossing my financial boundaries. If you don’t pay rent this month, you will no longer be living here.”

Get a new image!,
Don't feel too sorry for yourself.,
S-M-I-L-E. Show people that you are happy and smiling is the easiest thing you can do to make people notice you.

,
Listen to music.",How to Get over a Boyfriend or Girlfriend,";
, You've been hurt, and lets face it you're probably thinking it's the worse thing that's ever happened to you.

, Listen to feel good music, eat yummy food (but don't binge eat) watch movies (maybe not rom-coms, they might make you feel worse) and have some alone time, maybe write your feelings in a journal or scrap pieces of paper as long as you're letting your feelings flow. Even cry, believe it or not it does ease the pain. Do hobbies, paint/draw, read, visit friends or consult in a good friend of what has just occurred.

,, Texts, emails any embarrassing notes you may have written in your diary or school books. Even put away those pictures of you two, but don't bin them, keep them for remembrance, but if you feel its best to throw them all out do so. Its only been the first week so you're probably full of mixed emotions and probably feel like a roller coaster, one minute your sad, the next you're alright. Maybe you're sad that you two broke up or angry that girl never gave you the time of day to talk to her or never gave you a chance. Delete them off your Facebook. It is a clean break.

, Don't think why things went so bad. Never feel that you screwed up massively and that you're never going to find anyone special ever again. There are more than 6 billion people in this world, and you're perfect guy/girl might show up when you're least expecting it. Consider what was wrong in your relationship, why you and your crush would never happen. Remember the good times you had and that person shared but if your partner wanted more than what you were prepared to give to his/her life, it probably was going to end sooner or later.

, Start a new hobby, meet new friends. You never know, you might just find that kinda girl/guy you've always wanted. Just because your last relationship/crush never worked out doesn't mean you're doomed for loneliness and being a singleton for life!

, Was your confidence knocked by that rejection? Did you think you were not worthy enough for anyone else or that that you thought that you had freckles and your ex-crush didn't go out with you and talk to you, because you thought he wouldn't like you because of the way you looked, doesn't mean that other people might think you're cute! Everyone is beautiful in there own way, inside and out! The guy/girl that didn't choose you is the LOSER and always remember you're the PRIZE.

, Learn a new instrument, you never know if you're good at something until you try! Anything to help you take your mind off things!

, Get a haircut and go SHOPPING! Maybe try out a bob, bangs or side bangs? Make sure you look after yourself and to wash every 2-3 days. Try to to become more fashion interested! Trying out a new image will make you feel BETTER.

, The worst thing is to Try to get pity from people. You'll get the odd person who will be there for you and for you to confide in, but don't go and depress everyone else about your sad breakup! Guys in your class/work may also notice and will be instantly put off by you.

,, Music is absolutely brilliant to get over a breakup. Listen closely to the lyrics and you may become familiar with the lyrics and the way the artist/band is singing about. Try to listen to Pop/R&B/Indie/PopRock/Electro. Nothing too depressing like MCR or Marilyn Manson!

Ask for an apology.",How to Get Back at a Guy for Hurting You," You do not want to post anything incriminating or very embarrassing. However, an unflattering photo can be a great way to make your ex squirm a little.Go through old pictures you have of your ex. Does he look heavier in certain pictures? Do you have any where he's making a weird face? Find a few extremely unflattering photos.
Post them to a social media site where you know he will see them. If you're still Facebook friends, for example, you can tag him in the photos so he'll get a notification about it.;
, If you have his email address, sign him up to receive spam. Do not use services that will attempt to get his personal information. You do not want to do anything illegal. However, you can find spam sites that are simply annoying. You could sign him up for a daily horoscope, for example.

You can also give out his emails to stores he would not be interested in. If your favorite makeup store asks for your email, give them your ex's address. This will spam his inbox with irrelevant promotions.

, If you still see him at social events, try flirting a little with his friends. This may make him feel jealous or insecure. Strike up a conversation with a friend of his and behave flirtatiously. Casually brush the friend's arm, for example, while smiling and making eye contact.Be careful not to lead his friends on, however. It can be fun to get a little flirty, but you do not want someone to think you're interested in a relationship when you're not.

, Prank phone calls can be a fun and relatively harmless way to annoy your ex. Have a friend call him and pretend to be a credit card company inquiring about a late payment. You can also pretend to be a utility company threatening to shut off services.Try to stay quiet while your friend is making the call. If your ex hears you giggling in the background, he may figure out it's you.

, If you see your ex is on a date, do something to embarrass him. You can go up to him and loudly ask him about something embarrassing he left at your apartment, for example. You could also pretend to politely introduce yourself and work in an embarrassing anecdote about your ex.Do not be mean to the new girl, however. Remember, your ex hurt you and not her. You do not want to take out your anger on someone who does not deserve it.

, This is a simple way to hurt your ex back. If he tries to contact you or maintain a friendship, you should simply ignore him. Do not return texts, emails, or phone calls. This will send a message that you're mad and have not forgiven him for mistreating you.Consider deleting him on social media. Many people feel stung if they find they've been de-friended or un-followed.

, You may not feel better after seeking revenge if the guy doesn't understand why you're mad. The aim of revenge is to make someone see how they hurt you. Try to make this apparent so you actually feel better after getting back at the guy.There are many ways to make the guy understand why you're lashing out. You could tell him directly. For example, ""I'm not returning your texts because of how you treated me.""
If you're not on speaking terms, you could try posting something on social media you will know he will see.

, Do you really need to seek revenge? Before you take any action, carefully consider your motivations. What will you gain through trying to get back at this person?Revenge can actually increase anger rather than decreasing it. If you end up hurting your ex back, you may feel guilty, sad, or empty afterwards.
Wait and consider your actions for awhile before lashing out. Make sure you know everything about the situation to make sure revenge is warranted. Think long and hard about whether you'll actually feel happier if you get back on the guy.
Try to accept your urge for revenge is natural. However, remember that the anticipation may feel better than carrying out the act. You may be better off fantasizing about revenge than actually indulging in it.

, If you're your best self in the wake of a breakup, this is a great means to revenge. You want your ex to feel like you only got better after he left. Start a workout regimen so you can look and feel better.Pick a form of exercise you enjoy that you're likely to stick to. If you love riding your bike, for example, start taking long bike rides a few times a week.
Be careful getting into a new workout routine. Always talk to a doctor before starting a new program, and ease into any form of physical activity. You want to avoid strain.

, If you're reeling from heartbreak, this is important. You should accept what you're feeling and take some steps to cope with your own pain.Allow yourself to experience and deal with your emotions. If you need to feel pain, do so. If you need to cry, have a good, long cry.
Do things that make you happy. Go out and see a movie with friends. Go visit your family.
Sometimes, being happy can be a form of revenge in and of itself. Imagine your ex seeing happy social media posts of you thriving without him. That may hurt him more than any directly vindictive action on your part.

, Live in the now rather than the past. Remember, you can't undo the past. You can, however, work on making the most of the present.It's natural to focus on the pain now and again. When you feel yourself doing so, find a way to gently pull yourself back into the present moment. Think to yourself, ""That was then and this is now. I want to move forward.""
Think about all the good things in your life. Focus on your hobbies, your career, and your social life. Do not get sidetracked by petty thoughts.

, After awhile of healing, you may want to think about forgiveness. Forgiving the person who hurt you may help you find closure.You don't have to agree with what the guy did to forgive him. You can simply acknowledge that negative actions do not make him a bad person overall. Think to yourself, ""This guy made a mistake, like we all do. I'm ready to let it go.""
Remember, forgiveness is not a sign of weakness. It actually takes a lot of strength of character to forgive someone for hurting you.

, Sometimes, letting someone know why and how they hurt you can make you feel like you got back at them. If possible, let your ex know you want to talk. A productive confrontation may make you feel better. Prior to the conversation, try to write down your thoughts.Write down how you feel and why. Try to find the best way to articulate how you were hurt.
Focus on what you expect to get out of the situation. Do you want an apology? Do you want your ex to understand how he hurt you and feel bad?

, Expectations can skew how you behave. When you're hurt and angry, it can be especially difficult to control your emotions. If you go into the conversation expecting your ex to react a particular way, you may find yourself becoming angry or frustrated if things unfold differently.You want the conversation to flow naturally. You do not want to react with surprise or frustration if things unfold slightly different than you imagined.
Go into the conversation acknowledging you're uncertain what will occur. This way, you'll be better equipped to handle unexpected turns.

, ""I""-statements are statements phrased in a way to reduce blame. They put focus on your feelings over an outside judgement of the situation. An ""I""-statement has three parts. It begins with, ""If feel..."" after which you immediately state your feeling. From there, you state the action that led to that feeling. Lastly, you explain why you felt the way you did.

For example, you may be inclined to say something like, ""It was incredibly hurtful that you lied to me about needing time to yourself. You immediately started dating someone else. You could have just told me you weren't interested in me romantically.""
Rephrase the above sentiment using an ""I""-statement. For example, ""I felt incredibly hurt when you told me you didn't want to be in a relationship and then had a new girlfriend in a week because I wish you have been honest with me.""

, An apology can really help make you feel better. It lessens the need for revenge and helps you forgive someone who hurt you. End the talk by politely asking for an apology.You can end the conversation by saying something like, ""I know you maybe don't think you did anything wrong, but I need you to apologize.""
You will feel a lot better getting your feelings out and receiving an apology. Once your feelings are vindicated, you may be better equipped to move on.

Once you've made your decision, talk to him and make sure he understands where you're coming from and why you've made the decision you did.,
Stick with your decision.",How to Deal With Someone Who Doesn't Want to Be With You," When you're in the moment, play it cool and say something along the lines of, ""Oh, I didn't realize you felt that way. I just remembered _____(insert important thing here)_____ so I have to go."" Or, ""I appreciate your honesty. But actually, I just realized _________(excuse to leave)______ can we actually talk about this a little later?"" Or if you're on the phone even a quick, ""Oh no, my cat set itself on fire, I'll have to call you back."" is better than breaking down. After you've made your excuses, get away quick. The point is to get yourself out of their eyesight and earshot so you can freak out in private.;
, Cry, feel sad, angry, confused, hurt, and maybe even a little psycho. Fantasize about stabbing that ex that he is like, totally obviously still in contact with. Get all of those emotions out in the open. Really, just freak out for a little bit.

, Think about what it is that made you fall so hard for this guy. Was it his smile? His compassion? Was he extremely fit? Recognize that several of these things are traits you can find in another person. Someone who wants you in return. Evaluate the situation and then make a decision whether or not you can handle the situation you are now in.

, Can you be with him knowing that he doesn't want a relationship with you? Is it better to revert to friendship without the benefits? These are things you have to decide on. If you are okay with being friends with benefits, you have to be so knowing that someday they are going to date someone else and the ""benefits"" are going to have to stop. If you can't handle being friends with benefits, can you handle being friends? It all depends on your level of comfort--you might have to be his friend knowing that he's going to date and potentially marry someone. Can you accept the fact that it won't be you? If not, you might want to start weaning yourself off of having him in your life.

, It is unfair to hold a grudge on him just because he was (brutally) honest with you. If you want to remain friends with benefits, you can tell him that you like what you have and until one of you finds someone else, you think you've got a good thing going and don't want to lose it. If you want to revert to just being friends, you have to tell him that you really care about him, and that you personally can't handle anything more than just being friends with him right now. If he's a good person and cares about you too, then he will understand. Lastly, if you can't handle having him in your life anymore, you need to tell him why. Tell him that it just hurts a little too much and you need some space. You will always care about him, and you really enjoyed what you two had while it lasted, but you want something that he just can't give to you and you just want him to be happy. If that's not with you, then you'd rather have yourselves both move on than try to force something that's just not going to happen.

, It might be hard, but whatever you decide on, you can't just change because of a whim. Ultimately, it was better that he was honest with you from the get-go, because it allows you to move on without damaging the past you had with him. Everything happens for a reason, even if it's just becoming a stronger, more confident person in the end.

Practice letting go.It's normal to have difficulty getting over a guy who rejects you.",How to Deal With Rejection from a Guy You Asked Out," As much as you may want to convince him to change his mind, this will only cause embarrassment. Avoid arguing with him or trying to get him to see what he's missing out on.

For example, say ""I'm sad that you're not interested, but I understand and respect your decision.""
Additionally, this will show him that you're mature and self-sufficient.;
, You may feel dumb for asking him in the first place. You may feel devastated because you really thought he was the one for you. You may be angry at him (maybe he led you on) and need some space. All of these reactions are okay. Give yourself permission to feel whatever pops up in your body after the rejection. Avoid suppressing your emotions for his sake or because you feel like you should feel something else. You can't control how you feel, but the best way to move on from these feelings is to give them space and let them pass.

Acknowledging your feelings doesn't mean you have to accept them as true. For example, you can acknowledge that you feel stupid in the moment without thinking that you're actually stupid in reality.

, If you are friends with the guy, you may be worried about things being awkward between you after the rejection. This doesn't have to be the case, especially if you have a close friendship with the guy.You may want to let him know your intentions so he can feel safe rather than pressured in his decision. Here are some things you can say to let him know how you're feeling:


""I hope we can still be friends even though you don't want something more.""
""I need some time, but after that would you like to hang out as friends?""
""I don't want it to be awkward between us. I'd still like to be friends. How about you?""

, If you're really sad about the rejection, don't force yourself to stick around. Make an excuse for needing to leave. You can go home and handle your emotions there, or call a girlfriend to talk with. Whatever you do, avoid using him as a shoulder to cry on, because he will be in too awkward a position to comfort you.


If you're really nervous, you can even tell a friend to call you at a specific time, so that if you do get rejected they can ""save you.""

, This isn't the same thing as asking him to support you emotionally. Being honest about your feelings will show him that you're still interested in communication and that you respect him enough to let him in on your own emotional process. Also, since he was honest with you, it's good to match that honesty in your response.

, When we want to be in a relationship with someone, it usually means there are things we want from that person, such as care, intimacy, and companionship.Try to figure out what you were wanting, and then see if there are other ways to get the same things.


For example, do you have a close friend you can spend more time with? Is there someone else that would actually be a better fit romantically for these needs? Once you've discovered what it is you need, you can address those needs directly.

, Just because one guy rejects you doesn't mean everyone else will. Avoid over-generalizing and thinking that you're undesirable just because it didn't work out with one person. It's possible he doesn't even dislike you; sometimes guys are just not ready for a relationship or the timing is off. Avoid making assumptions about your self-worth because of a rejection.

, When a guy rejects you, it says nothing about you. All it does is show that you two weren't compatible. There are other guys who will appreciate what you have to offer. Make a list of these things to remind yourself of your worth and desirability. Here are some potential examples:


Are you a great cook?
Are you confident in yourself?
Are you financially independent?
Are you pursuing an education? Do you already have one?
Can you deal with spiders and insects? Some guys are afraid of them!

, There are guys who will accept you for who you are, so don't think you need to change in order to be appreciated and loved. If a guy rejects you, he wasn't the one for you.


A common mental mistake that people make is called ""personalization."" This involves thinking that everything someone does is a reaction to you personally. Avoid personalizing the guy's reaction by thinking that it reflects directly on you and your self-worth. Him saying no does not mean anything about your self-worth.

, It may sound silly, but social rejection activates the same pathways in the brain as physical pain. If you're experiencing a lot of pain over the rejection, take some acetaminophen (Tylenol). It may not completely eliminate the hurt, but studies show that it can help.

There's no replacement for engaging your support network of friends and family, though.
Avoid trying to cope with intoxicating drugs or alcohol. This won't help in the long-run.

, Are you in middle school? High school? College? Focus on what really matters in your life, like completing your education and becoming a more informed, more capable, more mature person. You'll encounter guys all along the way, but you probably won't have endless opportunities to educate yourself.

, Have you always wanted to travel to Europe? Would you like to start an exercise routine? You can distract yourself from the pain of rejection by focusing on things in your life that are meaningful and will make you happy.


It's also okay to mope for a little while. It's natural to feel bad after rejection. Don't be too hard on yourself if it takes you a few days to get on your feet again.

, Where rejection really hits us is in our sense of social belonging.Rekindle your relationships with friends. Find a community you can attend such as church or a reading group. Even joining a chat room can be helpful for your sense of self-worth and belonging. Surrounding yourself with good people and communities will help you feel better about the rejection.

, Rejection can cause other painful, destructive emotions such as anger and aggression. There are ways you can deal with these emotions, such as:

Expressing yourself in words. A journal can be a good idea, or posting on an online forum, or talking to your best friend.
Practicing deep breathing. One way to reduce anger and other powerful emotions is to remember to breathe. If you calm your body, your mind will follow.Seeing a counselor if you need additional help. Psychological counselors can help you learn to handle your emotions and promote your self-esteem so that rejection won't be so hard in the future.

, If you feel like you're obsessing or you just can't get him out of your head, practice these techniques to make a speedy recovery and get on with your life:


Write down what attracted you to the guy. Was he smart, funny, cute? Was he a good listener? Acknowledge what made you want to be with him.
Let yourself grieve the loss of not going out with him. You probably imagined possible future experiences with him, but those futures are closed off now. It's okay to be sad about that.
Ask yourself what isn't closed off now. Are there other guys that you're interested in? If not, maybe you'll have extra time to work on yourself and your other relationships? Maybe you'll have more free time to have fun or take care of responsibilities? Shift your imagination to the future rather than mourning the past and would could have been.

You might beg your boyfriend not to leave or resort to a variety of embarrassing tactics to prevent him from going through with the break-up. Research shows that emotional pain can often resemble a physical pain. You will do virtually anything to make it stop.This is a common reaction after a sudden break-up. Therefore, you must set a few precautions to prevent any dramatic actions on your behalf.


Avoid your boyfriend at all costs until you have fully come to terms with being dumped. Refrain from showing up at his doorstep and questioning his motives.
If you must, delete his cell phone number and email address from your contacts list. Sure, you may remember them by heart, but the simple action of pressing ""delete"" can bring you some closure. Plus, the shock of scrolling through your contacts and not seeing him listed may be just what you need to remind you that you shouldn't be reaching out.;
, When someone breaks your heart, and you don't see it coming, you are bound to experience a range of emotions. You may have a desire to push these emotions away. You may tell yourself ""He's not worth my tears"". Having loved someone at all means you should, at least, allow yourself to properly grieve the relationship. There are seven stages you can expect to go through while grieving.Questioning - You are consumed by a desire to understand what happened or what went wrong. You may try to seek out your ex. You may argue with friends and relatives. You may even consult absolute strangers to find clarity about what happened.
Denial - You have trouble accepting that your relationship has truly ended. You may continue to hope that your love together can be saved. You may refuse to believe otherwise.
Bargaining - You offer up any and every solution just as long as you two can stay together. You promise to change. You will be the perfect girlfriend. You try to take responsibility for the entire relationship.
Relapse - You manage to convince your ex to give the relationship another shot, only to go through the same break-up process all over again. Afterwards, you are finally convinced that it cannot be saved.
Anger - This stage occurs when you have released some of your fears about being single and can now recognize that you deserved better than what you got. Your anger may be directed at yourself, your ex, or the circumstances.
Initial acceptance - At this point, you are ""going along"" with the break-up because you have no choice. You are starting to see that the two of you just aren't meant to be. You finally stop trying to resolve things.
Redirected Hope - As you come to accept the circumstances, you start to assess the possibility that you may be okay on the other side of the break-up. You begin to feel some level of hope that your future--whatever it includes--will be brighter.

, When a relationship ends, you often feel resigned to just get by in life. You may lie around in sorrow. Eat your share of junk foods. Rewatch your favorite TV shows or movies. Yes, you have to grieve, but recognize that the wallowing isn't a requirement.Set a precise deadline for yourself--it can be a week, two weeks, or a month (depending on the seriousness or the length of the relationship). Tell yourself, after that deadline, you will no longer sit around wasting your days in misery. Make an active choice to lead a meaningful life, alone for now.

, As you are trying to successfully grieve your relationship it's a good idea to temporarily purge your life of any reminders of your doomed relationship. Holding on to personal items basically demonstrates that you expect him to come back some day. Toss these out in order to move on with your life.Getting rid of these things doesn't have to mean throwing them away. Toss pictures, gifts, love notes, and such in a box to tuck away in storage or in an attic. Later, when you have fully grieved and come to terms with the loss of the relationship, you can decide what to do with these items.

, There are few situations that damage our egos as being dumped. From the moment your boyfriend told you it was over, you have been analyzing yourself with a microscope to identify all the things that went wrong. To counteract that, the time has come for you to acknowledge all the wonderful things that you have to offer.


Grab a pen and paper and list some of your best qualities. If you have trouble coming up with these traits, you can ask close friends or family to give you a few. You can also find a list of positive traits online by conducting an internet search.With your positive traits at hand, start a journal that details specific situations in which you have exercised those positive characteristics in your life.For example, if you listed ""considerate"" as a positive trait, you might write in your journal about the time you spent a beautiful summer day doing crafts inside because your best friend had a broken leg and couldn't go outside.

, Getting to know yourself on a deeper level can strengthen your self-worth. It also does double-duty of helping you recognize what qualities you value in a mate. Treating yourself just as kindly as you would a lover will help to rebuild your self-confidence and even connect you with better suitors in the future.Make a reservation to a nice restaurant. Dress well and enjoy a lavish dinner on your own.
Treat yourself to a spa visit. Get a facial, massage, pedicure or manicure.
Buy yourself a gorgeous bouquet of fresh flowers, just because.
Go see that movie you have been dying to watch.
Take a new class, such as cooking, dancing, or exercise.

, A great way to maintain your self-esteem after being dumped is presenting your very best self to the world.Many people do this as a way to show their exes what they're missing. However, you should do it for yourself. Do this to remind yourself that you are an attractive and worthwhile person, with or without a date.


Plus, dressing and looking your best naturally makes you feel better.

, It may not be a good idea to immediately jump into a new relationship. However, it can be perfectly okay to casually date. The important thing is to believe in your heart that there are better days ahead for you--because there are!

, During this transitional state of your life, it's important to take good care of yourself. Spend time with good friends who support you. Listen to soothing music while taking a warm, bubble bath. Spend a leisurely afternoon shopping in your favorite boutique. Hibernate at home with healthy snacks and a good book.


It doesn't matter what you do. Simply engage in activities and be around people that pour into your cup rather than taking from it. Be gentle with yourself and indulge in your favorite pastimes., You might think that a pint of ice cream will soothe your woes. An indulgence here or there is fine, but too many indulgences can leave you feeling guilty later. Make a commitment to avoid self-sabotaging behaviors and eat healthy instead.


Fuel your body with real, whole foods like lean proteins, veggies, fruits, and whole grains while avoiding processed, sugary, and salty foods. A healthy diet can improve your mood., In some ways, exercise can be one of the best forms of therapy.You start a session feeling somber and down, and 30 minutes later you are bounding with energy and enthusiasm. Take advantage of nature's feel-good chemicals, endorphins, and schedule regular physical activity into your day.


Double the benefits by asking a friend to come along when you work out, or joining a group fitness class. Being with others who are in a bright mood can also influence you to feel better.

, If you notice that no matter how many strides you take to move on, you keep returning to the past, you may need to forgive. Holding on to bitterness or resentments against your boyfriend can keep you from fully recovering after being dumped.You can reach a place of forgiveness by trying to understand your ex's reasoning. Have you ever been in a bad situation and didn't really know how to get out of it? Have you ever handled a situation badly and ended up hurting someone? This is not to say that what happened to you was right, but allowing yourself to at least empathize with your ex can help you find emotional closure.
Another method is to write a letter. You might start by simply outlining the break-up from your point of view. Then, you can move into your thoughts, feelings, and the way you reacted to being dumped. Feel free to express any anger or resentment in the letter. Get it off your chest. Finally, close the letter by telling your ex that you are choosing to forgive and move on (this doesn't mean you are forgetting!). Afterwards, you can burn the letter or shred it to pieces."

Get closure (if you haven't already gotten it).,
Accept the negative feelings that can come with rejection.,
If it makes you feel better, indulge yourself a little.,
Talk to members of your social support network.,
Avoid contact with your ex for the time being.,
Take the opportunity to learn from your breakup.",How to Deal With Getting Dumped1," If you've already had a long, honest conversation with your ex about why you've been dumped, you can skip this step. If not, try to get in contact with your ex one last time. It's hard to move on following a breakup if you don't fully understand the reasons it happened in the first place. Listen carefully to your ex's explanation for dumping you. Even if you think s/he is being unreasonable, it's important to know your ex's thought process. Offer your own thoughts about the relationship as well, doing your best to avoid unhelpful insults or cruel remarks.


If your ex won't talk with you or is too emotional to discuss the breakup rationally, back off. Forcing the topic can cause tempers to flare. If you're brave, you can try asking your ex's friends for an explanation.;
, For most people, getting dumped can lead to sadness and/or anger even if it was obvious that the relationship was not going well. Acknowledge these emotions. Let yourself cry, punch a pillow, or rant to a friend. Do whatever you need to do to ""let it all out."" Getting past a breakup is a little like losing a friend or family member. You need adequate time to grieve before healing can begin.


Remember: all emotions are temporary. You might feel bad right now, but by accepting your emotions you take the most important step to recovery. Time will greatly reduce your pain, but only once you accept that you are hurting in the first place.

, It's practically cliche that people who are dumped will ""let themselves go"" for a brief while, but this cliche exists for a reason. Giving yourself reasonable treats after a breakup can make managing your emotional pain easier and help you feel valued. You might, for instance, try enjoying your favorite dessert after dinner for a few days after your breakup. Alternatively, try dedicating a day off purely to the hobbies you haven't had time for lately.


Note that bad habits that are dangerous should not be indulged. Don't use drugs or alcohol to dull the emotional pain you're feeling. Don't turn to reckless behavior for an emotional ""high."" These things do nothing to address the root cause of your pain and can put you in very dangerous situations.

, You're never alone after a breakup. Don't be afraid to vent to your family and close friends if you're feeling sad or frustrated. Simply talking about your problems can have a calming effect and make them seem much more manageable. You may also be surprised by how knowledgeable the people you talk to are. If they've been through breakups in the past, they may have valuable advice.


While friends and family members can be a big help, never, ever be afraid to talk to a professional if you don't start to feel better after a week or two. Counselors and therapists can help you work through issues that are affecting your ability to work, study, or enjoy your life. This sort of help isn't just for ""crazy"" people — more than a fifth of Americans have seen a therapist., Breaking up with someone doesn't mean that you never have to see this person again. However, if you can, you'll want to minimize the time you spend together for a while simply to avoid sparking old grudges or arguments. Everyone gets past a breakup at a different pace, so take as much time away from your ex as you need until the idea of talking to this person doesn't make you feel tense or angry. About one month is enough for many people, but longer is fine.


If you're forced to interact with your ex (like, for example, if you are stuck doing a project together for school), keep your conversations short and polite. Don't talk about your relationship. Just say what needs to be said to get through whatever you're doing. Be pleasant, but not overly friendly.

, As hard as a breakup may seem, there is almost always a silver lining. Breakups are great learning experiences for future relationships. They give you a chance to reflect on what went wrong and why. They allow you to grow as a person and change the way that you handle your relationships. Even if you did nothing wrong, you can still learn which traits to avoid in your next partner. Try pondering the following questions:


Why did the relationship end? Were there problems in our communication? Was I not being treated the way I deserved? Did I treat my partner unfairly?
Whose fault was it? Mine? My partner's? Both of ours?
What things about my partner did I dislike? What things did I like?
What things about myself made the relationship less likely to succeed?

Get rid of reminders of your relationship.,
Focus on yourself.,
Get some physical exercise.,
Be comfortable as a single person before you enter another relationship.",How to Deal With Getting Dumped2," Thinking about your ex more than you have to will prolong the healing process. To help get your mind off of this person, remove reminders from your daily life. For example, get rid of pictures of this person — whether they're on your desk, your phone, or your computer. If your ex gave you any mementos or presents, consider throwing them away. If they are valuable and you'd like to keep them, box them up and put them somewhere out of the way for at least a few months.


You'll also want to remove your ex from your social media. Consider blocking your ex, or removing him or her from your friends list. Change your profile picture if your current one shows the two of you together. You can also take a break from social media altogether if you frequently see posts from this person's friends.

, Being single can be hard at first, but one bright side is that you now have more time to spend on yourself. Use your extra time to improve yourself any way you wish. Try picking up a new hobby or revisiting one you didn't have time for before. You can also try teaching yourself a new skill, learning a new language, or anything else that you consider constructive.


This sort of self-improvement has the added benefit of making you more attractive to potential partners when you do jump back into the dating pool.

, Exercise is one of the absolute best things you can do for yourself following a breakup. An ambitious new workout routine can help you look your best, boosting your self confidence and making you more attractive to others. In addition, exercise can have a positive effect on your mood — it's often one of the first things doctors prescribe for depression.See our exercise article for specific workout tips. With simple changes to your diet and physical routines, you can make a major transformation in as little as two months.

, Ironically, you shouldn't jump back into another serious relationship until you're confident that you don't need one to be happy. In other words, make sure that you're happy and secure on your own before you start a new relationship. You need to be able to love yourself before you can love someone else. Using a new relationship to fill the hole in your heart from an old one isn't fair to yourself or your new partner. It can easily be a recipe for future heartbreak.


While some couples manage to get back together after a breakup, be wary of starting a new relationship with your ex. This is especially true if it was your ex's behavior or infidelity that led to the collapse of your relationship in the first place. You should look for concrete proof that this person has made changes in his or her life before you even consider getting back together.

Think about what rejection really means.,
Remind yourself that rejection does not indicate failure.,
Give yourself credit.,
Develop your problem solving skills.,
Put yourself out there.,
Set yourself up for rejection frequently.,
Give yourself time.,
Put a cap on the process.,
Smart small.,
Ask for honest feedback from teachers and coworkers.,
Question the consequences.,
Don’t just brush it off.,
Turn it into a positive.",How to Embrace Rejection," The first step to getting over your fear of rejection is to consider the concept clearly and thoroughly. Ask yourself: what does it say about me when I get rejected? What feeling causes me the most discomfort when it happens? Once you’ve identified and sorted through your feelings about rejection, you can start to overcome it.


It can help to write about your feelings in order to organize your thoughts.If you already keep a journal or a blog, devote an entry to your reflection about rejection. If you have neither, jot down your thoughts in an old notebook.;
, It’s easy to confuse the two things because both feel so painful and personal, but remember that they’re actually different. Rejection is just an intermediate step on the road to success, and not a finalized failure with no way out.Instead of focusing on rejection, try to focus on what you have learned in the process of pursuing your goal. How might you use what you have learned to help yourself grow?
For example, if you received a rejection letter from your top pick for college, then you might try thinking about the application process you used. How might you improve upon it? Could you have someone proofread your entrance essay? Could you submit the application sooner? Try to identify as many things that you might do differently (even if only slightly) to improve your outcome in the future.

, Your fear will seem less insurmountable if you look at the process in a positive light. Whether you approached your crush or applied for a big promotion, remind yourself that it took guts to try it out in the first place. Applaud yourself for your bravery and initiative rather than reproaching yourself for how it turned out.Studies have shown that a good way to think about it is to assess your effort and not the result. Congratulate yourself on any effort you put a lot of time and energy into, regardless of whether it turned out as a success or failure. In the same way, dismiss any success or failure which you earned through halfhearted endeavors.If you need a reminder as to how brave it is to risk rejection, consider how many people quit due to the experience. Rejection is so scary because it's powerful, but this power also means that it takes out a lot of your competition., Problem solving skills can help you to work through difficult situations in a methodical way, which can make them less stressful and also lead to a better outcome. Try to develop your problem solving skills so that you feel better prepared for rejection in the future. Some things you can do to improve your problem solving skills include:Writing out the problem in detail.
Making a list of all of the solutions that are available to you.
Analyzing your options to determine which solution is best.
Choosing an option and following through with it.
Reflecting on the outcome of the situation to determine if you made the right choice and using this information to improve your problem solving skills in the future.

, Once you’ve reevaluated your feelings about rejection and are ready to take real steps toward overcoming your fear, find an activity that lets you ease into embracing it. Do little things that take you out of your comfort zone and your fears will start to fade.For example, if you’re wanting to make new friends, start by signing up for a low-key group like a book club or gym.
If you’re wanting to start dating, give yourself small goals like approaching two strangers and talking to them for five minutes each time you go out with friends to a bar or club.

, Often times, the people who have the hardest time dealing with rejection are those who have a long history of personal and career-related success. They’ve received very little negative feedback over the course of their lives, so they find the experience especially jarring and hurtful.It follows then, that you can get better at getting rejected by getting rejected more often. The sting will fade over time as you stop expecting unadulterated praise and success at every turn.


If you’re on the dating scene, try high-intensity activities like speed-dating or meeting up with matches from dating apps and sites. Such things can be nerve-wracking and awkward, but the heavy dose of patently superficial rejection will provide valuable practice in the art of rejection.
If you’re trying to expand your social circle, join a bunch of different clubs and groups, including those whose members you are unlikely to have much in common with. This will show you that it’s not the end of the world when new friendships don’t work out and you have to shake it off.

, Even the most seasoned dater can reel from a hit from time to time, so don’t beat yourself up if you’re having a hard time coping.You’re not weak or pathetic for feeling pain, so be nice to yourself and don’t compound the injury from rejection with further self-abuse.


You can treat your recovery as you would any other personal emotional setback. Do things which make you feel comfortable, pampered, and happy. Go out to a movie with your friends, order your favorite pizza, or treat yourself to a bubble bath.It can be particularly helpful to use the coping time to reunite and strengthen bonds with close friends. This reunion will help to re-build your self-esteem while distracting you from the painful experience., While you should analyze your experience in order to learn from it, you can’t keep agonizing over it forever. Once you’ve given it some good thought, turn the page on the experience and move on.It can be especially tempting to overanalyze a personal rejection if it comes from the crush you’ve been obsessing over for weeks or someone you’ve been dating for a while. The problem with this is that there are too many factors that are out of your control and that you’ll never understand, so it’s counterproductive to remain preoccupied with it., Taking professional risks can be scary and, consequently, hard to get yourself to do. It can help to remember that, just as Rome wasn’t built in a day, your career won’t skyrocket upward or plummet downward after a single success or pitfall. Buckle up for the long haul and start your journey by taking little steps.


For example, if you’re wanting to change jobs, register for a networking cocktail party or alumni event before you start handing out applications and taking interviews.
If you’d like to throw your hat in the ring for a promotion, try asking for and taking on more responsibilities at work. Be up-front about the fact that you want to advance in the company, and the eventual application and interview can come around a lot more quickly., While at work or school, try to establish a culture among your friends and colleagues where you give each other honest and thorough feedback on your work. Even though you’re not rejecting one another’s work outright, you’re practicing the feeling of hearing and processing assessments which are not unequivocally positive.

, Ask yourself what the worst thing that can happen is if you get rejected. Often times the dread of rejection is so strong that it seems like a bigger deal than it really is. Upon further reflection, you’ll realize that the real-life implications of getting a professional rejection are not nearly so catastrophic as you had worried: no matter how much it stings, it’s definitely not the end of the road.Try to envision the worst possible scenario. This can be scary at first, but once you follow the scenario through to its logical conclusion, you'll see that not getting the job or the promotion was not life-or-death.

, It can be easier to recover from rejection if you tell yourself that it’s the other person’s loss and nothing personal. But brushing it off in this way also keeps you from taking full advantage of the opportunity and learning from the experience.Rather than dismissing the experience, ask yourself how you can use it to improve yourself and efforts.


Feel free to ask an interviewer for constructive feedback. They might not get back to you, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. Their feedback will provide you valuable insight from the perspective of the interviewer, and you can use it to tweak your application materials and interview strategy in the future., It’s natural to feel bad after a rejection, but you can soften these negative feelings by turning it into something positive.For example, use a publishing house rejection as a way to become a better writer, or use your job or school rejection to make your next application stronger.


It can help to remind yourself what you can and can’t control. You can’t control the fact that you got rejected, but you can control how you respond to it. Focus on the your own actions and response to the rejection rather than obsessing over what happened."

Understand that the world is full of differences, and not everyone is the same.,
Know that changing for the better is good.,
Understand that by tagging to them makes both of you uncomfortable.,
Wonder if there is any flaw within you that's making others reject you.,
Stop thinking that you are the only imperfect person present.,
Stop using good adjectives for yourself and the bad ones for others.",How to Deal with People Who Don't Accept You1,"


Most importantly, don't grumble if your friend is not the quintessence of your idea of perfection. Just because she is your friend, doesn't mean that she has to be what you want!
Always know that you do not have to be 'perfect' to be a friend. 'Perfection' is non-existent. You just have to be kind, helpful, and trustworthy to be a good friend.
Learn to love yourself, and stop comparing yourself to others. You are what you are! Love yourself for your strengths and love yourself for your weaknesses, and work on improving them. Know that as long as you do not harm anyone, as long as you behave in the way humans should behave, you are alright.;
, However, changing yourself completely to be accepted is not good, bad in fact. For example, if you have a spiteful nature, you might try to be not spiteful, but changing yourself completely is not good.


There is a thin line between changing for the better and changing completely. You should not change yourself just for some people. Learning not to tell lies, trying to help others will not only win you more friendships, but also keep you peaceful. But, watching more movies instead of reading books which you like just to get accepted is wrong.
Maintain a balance in life. You can't say, 'I will be a loner, I will not make friends, I will not change', because having friends is a must! Friendships play an important role in life. But changing yourself completely, instead of doing small amounts of both is horribly wrong!
Getting accepted because you have changed yourself is crime and punishment. Changing yourself is crime, and getting accepted by someone who doesn't accept your differences is punishment!

, So being yourself and being with yourself is best!


If they show plainly that they don't want to be friends, don't beg for friendship.
However, if they welcome you pleasantly when you try to talk to them, make friends happily, but don't push it too far. You are still new people!
Don't stick to them like a limpet. Even if they seem friendly, maintain a distance. You don't want to scare them off! You don't want to be like a friendship-hungry person who follows the unfortunate new friend like a puppy dog.

, If they are correctable, correct them, if not, leave!



Be more friendly and look approachable. Having a mean look or a scowl on your face will deter most people from talking with you.
Stop responding with short, curt answers when meeting new people. Ask questions about their life and stop boasting about yourself.
See if you appear rude. Sometimes, when you might be preoccupied with a pressing problem and refuse to come out of your shell, you might be seen as snobbish.

, everyone has their own faults, as well as their own strengths. You have to learn that you are human, and not perfect, nd so is everyone.


Also, stop seeing only the negative things in others. Before blaming anyone, see if you have wronged.
Learn to accept blame when you deserve it. Accept your fault, and promise to not repeat it. Keep your promise, and be nicer. Do not try to blame others for your faults.

, These adjectives have the same meaning, but are superficially different.


Avoid things like, 'I am passionate about reading but my friend is obsessed with it', 'I eat healthily, but my friend lives to eat'. Here, passionate and obsessed, and eating healthily and living to eat are the same, but the adjectives used for 'I' are different.
Instead, say 'we both love reading'. Avoid the use of negative, if possible. Have a positive, bubbly personality. Being positive makes you more fun to be with.

However, avoid wearing clothes that look like you stitched them from pieces of different bedsheets, and earrings like dinner gongs. Something tasteful and elegant would suffice.
Brush your hair and bathe frequently. Polish your shoes and look neat. Smell good, but don't put on perfume in such a way that people gag around you.

, It shows them that you are helpful. Be cheerful and accept their thanks. It puts you in a more positive light.


But never feel that you have to help them. Don't be afraid to ask for help, and don't let anyone use you.
Lend your notes willingly to someone who missed class, or go and help that person who is having a problem with his computer program. Make sure that you wrote good notes, and you are aware of the coding, for if you get it wrong, they will be even more angry than before.

, It always gets back to them and they will desert you more than ever.


If possible, don't tell them about what others gossiped about your new friends. Even though they might be happy about you telling them, you lose their respect, and they get suspicious about what you are telling about them. For if you gossip about A to B, you might gossip about B to A!
Behave in a way that people will think that you are trustworthy and believable. keep their secrets safely. Don't talk about them to anyone else, and they will respect you. Remember, liking comes from respect!

, No one likes a whiner. Even if people offer you sympathy, tell them that everything is fine. The moment someone starts talking to you, don't start telling them everything about your life starting from the hospital in which you were born, and also don't complain about your little sister. No one wants to hear your grumbles, everyone has got heaps of their own!


If you really want to unburden yourself, talk about the people who mistreated you, but keep the complaint to a bare minimum, and don't put them down horribly.

, Don't keep shooting them daggers when they wish to be alone.


Don't be jealous and clingy when you find them talking to other people. It just irritates them and makes them wish that they were rid of you! If you are not clingy, and behave nicely, they will automatically prefer you!
Don't follow them around They will see you as a nuisance. talk with them, but don't disallow them from talking with others.

, Be nice, don't just tell them that even your great-grandmother looks more stylish than them.


Instead, compliment them, and start off with 'I saw an item which would look great on you' and take it from there.
However, don't flatter them. There is a difference between a crisp 'this watch looks great and a gushing 'wow! This watch looks simply awesome, and it compliments your hand perfectly. You have such great taste!'.

, When they talk about a teacher and say some bad things about him/her, don't run to that teacher with tales. It isn't very nice.


Always avoid talking about other people before you are sure that your new friend won't give you away. Err on the safe side.
In fact, avoid complaining in general. Not only does it make you a whiner, it also tells them that you are not in control of your words and emotions.

, Have a tissue box ready to comfort them.


Gently ease them out of suicidal thoughts and plans to do something dangerous. Just because you are their friend, doesn't mean that you have to go and help them in wrong things. Even if they are angry with you, they will be thankful later!
If they tell you to get lost rudely, keep your emotions in control and head away. never sit there, and never answer rudely. Don't let anyone insult you. Just because they were rude, you don't have to be as impolite as them. So don't let yourself be dragged down to their own level!

, For a more descriptive guide on avoiding swear words, click here.


Swearing is a disgusting habit and makes people want to distance themselves from you. If you want to tell how bad someone behaved, tell them in a formal way, not letting your emotions show in your words.
Instead of saying something bad like 'that ******* is behaving like a ***** ***! Man, I hate him!', say 'he is behaving a bit badly. I don't know if he is conscious of this, for I don't think he wants to behave like that'.

, Having a dreadful, victimized expression on your face is not very encouraging for people who want to be friends with you.


Look trustworthy, but not like you want to help each and everyone. Going about with a 'mama's kid' expression on your face is sloppy and unprofessional.
Don't apologize for everything and everyone. You should have some self-respect, and over-apologizing damages it.

However, don't take 'revenge' and try to defame them or hurt them. Remember, the best revenge is letting them see you get on with your life better than before.

Be positive about the future, but never let optimism take over your common sense. Being positive doesn't mean that you go and make friends with every person you set your eyes on.

He or she will need time to get over the former relationship and you won't be very happy if you end up being the ""rebound"" person who also doesn't last.

, If you do still like him or her enough, then pluck up the courage to ask him or her out. The answer may be yes, it may be no. If yes, great, proceed as needed. If no, realize that he or she still needs time or simply doesn't view you as an appropriate match. It's part and parcel of growing up and everyone experiences rejection as well as acceptance.

Throw out old gifts and mementos from your relationship, or at least put them in a box and keep them out of sight. Avoid listening to music or watching movies and TV that remind you of your significant other. One day, you may be able to look back on reminders and feel happy. However, when the wound is still fresh, it's best to get rid of them., While you may want to stay friends with your ex, this is hard to do directly after a relationship ends. It's a good idea to limit contact as much as you can in the wake of the breakup. If seeing your ex is unavoidable, like if you go to school together or work together, then this might be difficult, but try to have as little contact as possible while you heal. If you can, cut off contact completely, if only temporarily. This will help you move on.If you're friends with your ex on social media, it's a good idea to block his updates or unfriend him for a bit. This way, you won't speculate about what he's doing and whether he's seeing someone else.
You may decide that you don't wish to be friends with your ex at all, and that's okay, too. Staying friends with an ex can be confusing, and you may find yourself second guessing the break up if you stay in touch.
The amount of contact you have with your ex may be influenced by other factors, such as if you have children together or if you shared a bank account. If this is the case, you and your ex will have to work out a firm and detailed agreement about how you will manage these issues, whether it's figuring out a schedule for child care or sitting down and separating out your finances.

, Reigniting and strengthening friendships can help after a breakup. Try to make plans as much as you can right after breaking up with someone. This can help you focus on the present over the past.Try calling up a friend you haven't seen in awhile. Friendships often falter when you're involved with someone, so think about anyone you could would like to reconnect with.
You can also try to make new friends. Try to ask a co-worker to get coffee or grab drinks with someone you know from the gym.
If you and your ex have mutual friends, it might be a good idea to step back from those relationship for a little while. You don't want to put your friends in an awkward position, and you may be tempted to ask them about your ex or want to vent about him. These friends may also take sides or try to influence you to get back together with your ex.

, A new hobby can help you keep your mind in the present. It also may be an opportunity to make new friends. If you knit, for example, you can try joining a knitting circle.If you stopped any hobby during the relationship, try to take up that hobby again. For example, if your boyfriend never wanted to go hiking, start hiking again.

, Sometimes it can help to see someone else has moved on. If you get news your boyfriend has a new girlfriend or boyfriend, try to accept this. Remind yourself some relationships are temporary and that you will move on too. This can also help with guilt if you're the one who broke up with him., When breaking up with someone, it's important to go into the situation with some kind of plan. If you're breaking up with your boyfriend, spend some time identifying your feelings and figuring out how to best express them.Figure out your own feelings. Why do you want out of the relationship? Think about why it has not been working for you and how to best convey this to your boyfriend.
Think about what you might say. You should be honest without being brutal. For example, if you think your boyfriend is boring, say something along the lines of, ""I'm not sure we're compatible in terms of personality,"" instead of outright saying you're bored.
Try to predict how your boyfriend may react — think about how you would feel if you were him. This can help you go into the situation from a place of sensitivity and empathy.
It may be helpful to discuss this with a trusted friend. Talking it over can help you clarify your feelings, and they can let give you an outside perspective on your approach. For instance, they may point out that you're not being direct enough and that it might confuse your boyfriend and give him false hope.

, It's never easy to break up, but it's always best to be honest. Go into the conversation from a place of directness. Open it by saying, ""I've been thinking about it, but I think we should see other people."" From there, you can offer more of an explanation.Remaining calm, explain your reasons. Remember, you don't have to be hurtful. However, it will give your boyfriend closure to know why the relationship ended.
For example, ""I care about you a lot, but we're both going to different schools next year. I think the distance won't be good for us or our relationship.""

, There are often hurt feelings or resentments accompanying breakups. It's okay to feel angry, frustrated, or hurt about things your boyfriend has done and said in the past. However, try to avoid blaming him for the relationship's end. It's best to walk away from a relationship from as positive a place as possible.Try not to bring up the past too much. You can certainly make generalizations based on past events. For example, ""I feel like we've always been on a different page in regarding our social lives.""
However, there's no need to rehash old arguments. Do not, for example, say, ""I was so upset when you made us leave Sophie's birthday party early.""

, Try to end the conversation on a good note. Let your boyfriend know what you gained from being with him and talk about positive things in the future.Express gratitude for the relationship. For example, ""I will always treasure everything I learned from being with you.""
You should also try to frame the relationship in a positive light. For example, ""I think this will be good for us both in the long run.""

Look at both the good sides and the bad sides of the relationship. It's almost always easier to remember the good times; it's a promise that the pain will pass.;
, It's all right to feel the pain.

, Feeling angry? That's good. Anger can bring out those bad memories and if they are there. Why waste them? And check out the warning about revenge.

, If this person has ever affected you negatively, look at why this person was motivated to do this. Is it possible that they are or were having problems with themselves, such as immaturity, inability to commit or work stress? Consider the possibility that this person is 'damaged goods.'

, And equally, know that you cannot change a person who does not want to change. While it is possible to help people who want to change, the motivation needs to exist on a case-to-case basis and it is not your role to save someone or make them ""see the light"".

, The past is in fact the past and however badly you wish you could go back and do things differently, it just isn't going to happen. Don't waste your future thinking about what could have been. Think about what can and will be.

Exercise the blues away.

, Give yourself time to know that you are ready to give it a try again. If you jump too quickly, your emotional baggage will jump with you, unresolved and laden with damaged feelings.

, However, forgive and move on - do not hold it against a new person. Be sure to check that you aren't dating the same 'type' of person. This might happen if you don't take enough time to get over the old relationship and find your own groove again.

Be patient.",How to Cope With a Heartbreak," You've been hurt, and you feel sad. These are normal emotions, and you need to accept that they are happening. Don't lie to others, and yourself, by saying ""I'm fine"" when you are not. You may be able to push it down for a while, but something else will bring it up again, and you'll be worse off because you weren't honest with yourself., In fact, it’s okay to feel a whole range of emotions, including sadness, confusion, and anger. The key is not to let those feelings affect your whole life. Do not try to numb yourself to the pain or swear off relationships forever. These activities will only hurt you in the long run. Instead, give yourself time to feel the hurt., Crying is a good way to healthy way to express extreme feelings, so if you feel like crying, let it out. Find a place where you can be alone, or with a good friend, and let the tears flow. It'll be over more quickly than you think, and you'll feel a little better afterward getting those emotions out.There are some places where that is inappropriate, public settings like a store or in class, so you'll want to be able to control your tears in public. Breathe deeply (in through your nose and out through your mouth), and blink a few times to control the tears. You can try to distract yourself with some kind of physical movement like squeezing a stress ball. If a few tears do slip out, cover them with a yawn, or blame something like allergies or feeling sick.

, Avoid letting negative thoughts control your worldview. These include filtering, that is looking at only the negative aspects of your situation, and personalizing, blaming yourself entirely for what happened. Keep an eye on yourself to see if you are looking at your situation this way, and from there look for ways to avoid those negative thoughts.An excellent way to expel negative energy is to meditate. Put yourself in a comfortable seated position in a comfortable place, usually alone and away from distractions like television or other stimulating things. Breath deeply, and let your mind go by focusing on another object, repeating a mantra, or visualizing a peaceful place.

, Think about what went wrong, and why you two broke up. There is always a reason. Also think about what you liked in the relationship, and what things you would want to look for in a future partner. By working through these ideas, you can grow as a person, and find the right relationship later down the line.


You may reach a point where you and your ex are comfortable becoming friends, but don't think too much about that early on. You need to give yourself space after the breakup., Think about your strengths and feel proud of them. Do things that make you feel good about yourself--take time to finish that painting you started or go on a run. Acknowledging that something bad happened to you, and realizing that you are strong enough to deal with it is a key part of getting over your heartbreak.


Make a list of your strengths. Remind yourself of your accomplishments, and the good qualities you have. The act of writing them out can remind you of them, or you can create a list and read it whenever you feel down., You are not alone in the world. Look for a trusted friend or advisor, or a close relative, and tell them how you feel. Sometimes just getting your feelings off your chest can help you work through them. Additionally, you never know what help other people can give, whether it's good advice, or just a shoulder to cry on., Physical exercise causes your body to release serotonin (a chemical that makes us feel happy) and stimulates the growth of nerve cells. On an emotional level, exercising may help you to feel like you are becoming the master of yourself again. Plus, you'll look better too.You don't need a full workout. Something as simple as 10-15 minutes a day doing a simple exercise like jogging or yoga can be enough to get you a good frame of mind. Even work that doesn't feel like exercise, like weeding a garden, gets you up and moving. The most important thing is that you stay consistent in what you do.If you're feeling down, it can be hard to motivate yourself to exercise. Work around that by distracting yourself with something enjoyable. Maybe just walk through a mall or some other place you enjoy. You can also give yourself something to do only while exercising, like listening to certain music you enjoy, or watch your favorite TV show while on a machine. That will keep your mind off the workout and onto something you enjoy. As long as you leave that only for exercising, it can give you something fun to come back to.You can always ask a friend to come with you. Even if you don't talk, or have anything to talk about, it's always nice to exercise with company rather than by yourself. Being responsible to another person also makes it easier to show up regularly than being responsible to yourself for .

, Keep an eye out for the major differences between sadness (a normal and healthy emotion) and depression. When you are depressed, nothing you think about seems to matter in your life, and you are unable to stop thinking about the things that cause you grief. If you think you are noticing these signs, or if your sadness lingers for several weeks or up to a month, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional., This includes pictures of you and your ex, listening to ‘your’ song, and gifts she/he gave you. While you don’t necessarily have to throw all the stuff out (that cook book you two would try recipes from might come in handy in the future) you should move it from your direct line of sight.However mad you may be, it is best not to destroy something that may be of significant financial or sentimental value to him (expensive items or family mementos). If you have items like this, the best thing is to gather them up, and arrange a time for him to come get them. This is not an invitation to reconnect, so keep your messages short and professional.

, Keeping in contact with will make you feel even worse than you already do. Don’t call your ex crying or send passive aggressive texts, and definitely don’t communicate when you've been drinking. Your ex has made it clear that he or she is moving on. The best way to do that yourself is to avoid contact with him or her.


Delete your ex from social media. You don't need the constant reminder of what he is up to that you'll automatically get from Facebook or other social media sites. That kind of avoidance will help keep you from thinking about him.Ask your friends to help. Don't make, or let, them fill you in on what your ex is up to. Instead, ask them to help you get your mind off him, even if it's just by spending time talking about anything else, or keeping you from contacting him.

, The best way to get over the past is to create a new, bright future for yourself without that person. Now is the time to fulfill your dreams of learning new skills or trying different activities. Enroll in a new after school or work class, or join a sports team, even just joining a pick-up game every week will work. The goal is to distract yourself with new ideas and activities, and to meet new people., One of the best ways to get your mind off your own problem is to try to help someone else with a challenge they are facing. Ask your friends about what is going on in their lives, or talk to your family about how they are doing. Don’t let your emotions block you from the fact that other people are dealing with their own sadness.You don't have to just limit your helping to people you know. Volunteering is a great way to put your own situation into perspective. Volunteer at a soup kitchen or shelter and focus your efforts on bettering the lives of others. You may just find that in the process you discover new meaning in your own life.

, After giving yourself some space, get back into the game of love. You shouldn't close yourself off, and losing someone does not mean you are unlovable or can never love again. Use your new activities to meet potential new partners, or even be willing to use online dating. You don't have to actively look for new relationships if you don't want to, but don't immediately reject the possibility if someone asks or offers.Be careful with a rebound relationship. Opening yourself up does not mean rushing into a new relationship immediately. If you move too quickly, you may mistake the easy intimacy with real feeling, and create greater pain for yourself and the other person., These processes take time, and while on the way to recovery, you may come up against days that are harder than others. Don't beat yourself up over feeling sad when you thought you were recovering.Occasionally fantasizing about your ex is normal. The surest way to think about something is to tell yourself not to think about it. Sometimes that will happen. Rather than suppress these thoughts, accept them, and look for something else to think about instead."

Enjoying a favorite hobby, such as playing an instrument, painting, or baking.
Taking a long bubble bath.
Going for a long walk or bike ride.;
, The reasons for being turned down don't necessarily have to do with you exclusively. Rather than immediately picking apart all the things that you did wrong, take a step back. Sometimes you won't know all the details of why you were rejected. Focus on what you can do for the future.When a negative thought keeps popping back up in your head, recognize this. Redirect your thought to something productive and positive.
Avoid making assumptions that small personal details like the wrong handshake, the wrong word, or the wrong outfit can define what happened. While what you do matters, fixating on every detail will make you anxious and stressed.

, In life, we all take risks in order to find work, love, and success. No one is immune to mistakes. The difference is what you do after being turned down. While in the moment you may feel like a failure, think about the strength you had to ask someone out, seek a competitive job, or get noticed for a talent. Being turned down is part of life's risk-taking. It shows that you're willing to push your limits and not afraid to go for it.
Putting yourself out there may mean that you'll be even stronger and more confident in the future.

, Being turned down is not the end of the world, literally. It can feel in the moment that way, but this too will pass. While you may feel like others are judging you or noticing what happened, the most likely scenario is that no one really cares what happened except you.Being embarrassed is something that happens to everyone. While it feels bad in the moment, this feeling is temporary.
Focus on how you can control your negative thoughts. For example, if you're turned down for a date, focus on what that person is missing out and what you have to offer, rather than thinking you're no-good.

, Love yourself. While you are not perfect, no one else is either. See yourself as having worth and value. Surround yourself with people and things that bring you joy.Practice self-affirmation. Make a list of qualities that you like about yourself--both external and internal. Choose one quality to write about. Write a brief paragraph about one of your strengths and what you have to offer.
Say these words of affirmation to yourself, ""I fully accept myself and know that I am worthy of great things in life"" or ""I choose to be proud of myself.""

Understand the circumstances for the rejection.,
Use this as a learning experience.,
Keep trying.,
Build your resilience.",How to Cope With Being Turned Down2," While you may not get answers after being turned down for a date, getting clarification from places that have a lot of submissions may be useful. Reach out to the people involved in the hiring or selection process. See if they can provided insight.Reach out to others that may be applying or seeking the same thing as you. Understand the context of the rejection from their point of view.
For example, many writers may submit their works to publishers, journals, or writing competitions. Find ways to craft your work to the appropriate audience. Some places may be looking for certain ideas or points of view.
Sometimes we all want the same type of thing, but this means more competition. See if there are other places or people that may not have as much name recognition but fit better with your personality.

, Take an optimistic approach. Being turned down may help you to think about what to do differently in the future. Think of each trial and error in life as part of the journey to being a better and happier person.


Use this as a time to be wiser and stronger. After the initial shock, maybe you'll see that being turned down isn't has horrible as you imagined.
Think about your strengths and weaknesses equally. Avoid dwelling on the negative. Before the next opportunity arises, think about what you have learned and how to apply this knowledge.

, Avoid giving up and retreating. Be confident that you can continue to achieve what you want with perseverance and determination. Most people don't get what they want the first time they do something. Sometimes getting what you want takes practice.Being turned down is just one moment in time. Keeping going as one moment does not define you and your worth.
Being more confident afterwards may help you in the future. That person or place that turned you down may see you again, and see that you are resilient and strong in the face of rejection.

, Resilience is the ability to press on despite setbacks and challenges. It involves having a positive outlook on the future and believing in yourself. Being resilient can help make it easier for you to deal with setbacks like being turned down. Some things you can do to build resilience include:Putting things into perspective. When something bad happens, try asking yourself if it is really worth spending your time and energy worrying about. Most things are not worthy of as much time and energy as you might give them. Try to put things into perspective before you waste time and energy being worried or upset about something.Maintaining good relationships with friends and family. Knowing that you have people you can count on no matter what is a great comfort. Make sure that you maintain positive, healthy relationships with your friends and family so that you will feel supported during difficult times.

Looking for lessons when things don’t go your way. Instead of focusing on the negative aspects of a situation, you might find it helpful to think about what you can learn from the experience. For example, if someone turns you down, you might try to look for a lesson. It might be something simple like, “He/she is not my soul mate. That person is still out there.”

Challenging unhelpful thoughts. Resilient people also know how to alter their thinking to stay motivated and positive. Try to challenge any unhelpful thoughts that cross your mind. For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I am a loser,” then you might challenge this thought by saying to yourself, “I am an intelligent person who has value.

Be honest with yourself about your faults, you need to meet someone who will find your faults minor and forgivable but prize your strengths. Sometimes they are the same thing - a determined go-getter can be described as stubborn by someone who doesn't like her. Try turning every criticism anyone ever gave you inside out, find the compliment version and ask if it's true.


Really knowing yourself will make you much more ready to meet someone else. Though personal growth is a lifelong process, if you're struggling to figure out who you are, it'll be much more difficult to figure out what you want in a relationship.
Being aware of your flaws, and being ready to address them, will also make you more ready to address the issues that arise in a relationship. If you're convinced you're perfect, you'll be much less likely to compromise.;
, If you find it, all the better. But, admit it; you're not perfect. No one is. If you're looking for a 100% perfect man, you will never find him. So be quick to forgive those little mistakes or annoying habits that don't matter, and hopefully he will overlook your imperfections too. Understand what types of annoying habits rile you so much they're a deal-breaker and be up front about those, as well as those you don't think of as a big deal. If you can't stand a forgetful man, you may have to bend on something else to find one who never forgets an anniversary or errand.


If you expect perfection, then you'll be too picky to be able to see whether the man in front of you is right for you after all. Let's say you go on a first date with a guy who you think is ""okay"" and decide never to see him again; why not have a rule of going on at least two dates with a guy before you write him off?
If you turn away a guy who doesn't meet all the criteria on your ""perfect man"" checklist, you may be overlooking some amazing qualities you didn't even know you were looking for.
Just remember: not expecting perfection does not mean the same thing as being ready to settle. You're better off being alone than ending with a guy who you think is ""good enough"" or ""better than being alone.""

, If you want to be ready to find the man of your dreams, then you have to be content with your own company before you begin your search. Forget the myth of finding the man who completes you or makes you whole; you should already feel like a fulfilled, well-rounded being, whose life will be improved by the presence of the right man, but not completed.


You should have enough meaning in your own life -- through your friendships, work, and outside interests -- to make you a person who is happy on her own but ready for commitment.
To grow as a person and be ready to meet the perfect man, you should always designate some time each week for some much-needed ""alone time."" If you spend all of your free time with friends or family, you are much more likely to be co-dependent.
If you enjoy your own company, you will also be a more fun person to meet, because you'll be excited to talk about all the things that matter to you.

, This is another important point. If you want to be able to find the man of your dreams, you have to love who you are. This doesn't mean that you have to completely love every part of yourself, but that you are confident in who you are and happy with what you have to offer. Being aware of your flaws is part of loving yourself, and it will make you a much more grounded person in a relationship.

You don't have to brag about what an amazing person you are; you just have to know that you are a worthwhile person deep down.
Finding the man of your dreams will not make you automatically love yourself. You'll need to work to build your self-confidence on your own.
Of course, finding the right man will make you love yourself even more. But you need to start with a baseline of self-love for this to work.

, Yes, ladies, you'll need to get some experience before you can find ""the one"" and know what you want. Though if Mr. Right walks right into your arms when you're barely out of high school or college, you shouldn't let him get away, most likely, you'll have to wade through more than a few duds to find the diamond. Dating various men will help you get a better sense of your dating style, and of your real expectations in a relationship.


You shouldn't date people you obviously don't like just to get some experience, but you should think about being open-minded and dating various people, even if means stepping out of your comfort zone a bit.
Getting some experience will also help you see how difficult it is to find ""the perfect man""; every man is different and has a lot to offer, but nobody's perfect. If you expect perfection but never date, it'll be much harder to shatter this illusion.

, Though you may never know exactly who the man of your dreams may be until you see him from across the room and feel like you've had the wind knocked out of you, you should definitely have a strong sense of the kind of man you're looking for as you go about your search. The qualities you want shouldn't read like a check-list that has to be completed for you to find the right guy, but you should strongly consider which qualities are a must-have for you to pursue the ""perfect"" relationship. Here are some things to consider:


The person's relationship style. This is an ever-important and underrated point to consider. If you're the kind of person who needs attention 24/7 (generally not a good idea), then you'll need to find a man with similar needs; if you want to find love but need time to hang out with your own friends and do your own thing, then it's important that you see eye-to-eye with your man on this too.
The person's interests. Is it essential that your perfect man loves books, hiking, running, painting, tennis, or volunteering as much as you do? If you feel like your key interests must be shared by your loved one, then look for a guy who shares these interests -- or is at least enthusiastic about learning about them.
Personality traits. Though you can't say what makes the ""perfect"" personality for you, there are a few traits that you can look out for. Do you love to make people laugh and need a guy who shares your quirky sense of humor? Are you the sensitive type and need someone who understands your emotions? Great. If you can't live without these qualities in a man, don't force it.
Social stance. Are you the shy type, and need someone who brings you out of your shell? Are you outgoing and looking for someone to rein you in a bit, or do you want someone with a similar social bearing so you're understood? Sometimes opposites attract in this category (you may not want to be with someone who craves attention as much as you do, for example), but you should find your social counterpart, whatever that may be.
His ability to get with your friends and family. Do you need a guy who fits right in with your friends and family, or is this something you can take or leave? If you spend most of your free time with your friends and family and needs someone who can join right in, then this should be something you should look out for.
Religion. If you're Jewish and need someone who shares your religion, or who is open to converting, then you can narrow down your search from the start.
Family values. If you're certain that you want to have two or more kids but meet a man who says he hates children, you shouldn't try to work it out and try to change him -- this will be much harder than you think.

, The qualities you don't want can be just as important as the ones you need. If there are a few deal breakers that will mean you can't make a relationship work, no matter how hard you try, then it's better to know what they are up front than to try to stick it out before failing. These qualities have to do with your priorities and what you are not willing to put up with no matter what -- there's no shame in admitting what they are. Here are some qualities that may be your deal breakers no matter what:


If you're missing that physical feeling. However, you may convince yourself that physical attraction can grow over time; this may not happen for you. If your dream man seems perfect but you just can't work yourself up to have the hots for him then Houston, you have a problem.
Disagreement over something that matters to you. If you're obsessed with Mitt Romney and your man is a tree-hugging liberal, then you can either enjoy having the constant disagreement, or realize that this disagreement over core values just won't work for you in the end.
Geographical incompatibility. If you're an actress who has to live in LA, and he's determined to live in Missouri near his family, or to even live abroad, then you may never be able to make it work if this is something you absolutely refuse to compromise on.

, Though you should stand your ground on the things that really matter to you, and be on the alert for any red flags that tell you that the relationship won't work, you should have an open mind when you start a new relationship, even if your ""have"" and ""have not"" list is firmly ingrained in your mind. When you meet the right man, you may find that you didn't even know exactly what you were looking for, so get ready for the ride.


Don't reject the man because he only meets 8 of your 10 most important criteria. He may have other qualities you didn't even know you needed.
If you're with a person but always have a fundamental disagreement that you keep coming back to, then you may be better off moving on than trying to fix something that is too broken.
In the end, you may find that it's all about balance. As long as both of you make each other happy and fulfill most of each others' needs, you're off to a great start.

, Knowing what you're looking for is half the battle; the other half is knowing where to look. If you know what your dream man should be like but spend all of your time at home or in the wrong bars, then you'll never get to meet him. The most important thing is to be open to love no matter where you go, because ultimately, no one can predict where you'll find the man of your dreams. However, knowing where to look can greatly improve your chances of meeting him. Here are some great places to look:


Ask your friends. There is nothing shameful about asking your friends to set you up; if you ask someone who really knows you and has a sense of who you'll click with, then you have a great chance of being set up with a person who is right for you.
Find someone who shares your interests. Join a roadside runners, hiking, or acting club and look out for the guy who loves the same things that matter to you.
Look for him at a party. Many people meet the loves of their lives at the party of a mutual friend; your friend can bring together various people who all generally get along and can click over a few glasses of wine. If your friend invites you to a party at her house, be open to the invitation.
Go online. Welcome to the 21st century, girl. More and more people are meeting their dream men online, so don't knock online dating until you try it.

, What kind of person are you attracted to? What kinds of traits does he have to have? To attract the kind of person you like, you have to have those traits too. Also look at traits that are complementary - if you're very domestic, you may be happier with a man who doesn't putter in your kitchen but never gripes about mowing the lawn or cleaning the gutters.


You don't have to be exactly like your dream man, but if you want someone who is funny and confident, it would help to share these qualities too. He can bring out your best qualities, but he can't force you to take on a new personality.

, Find a hobby or two that makes you stand out. Whether you like to play sports, paint, play a musical instrument, or go clubbing at night, surrounding yourself with people of your same interests will increase your chances of meeting the man of your dreams while having fun at the same time. Don't think you have any hobbies? Try something creative, you may have unexpected talents and discover it's fun. Go out and volunteer in your community.


The more things that interest you, the more likely you'll be to connect with a man you meet. If you have five interests that matter to you, you'll be more likely to find a guy who connects with at least one of them.
The more interests you have, the less likely you'll be to obsess over finding the right guy, which will in turn make you much more desirable.

, Though the guy will get to know you as time goes on, you should start off on the right foot. Make an effort to look nice while staying in your comfort zone when you know you'll have a chance to meet men. Even if you're having a bad day or didn't really feel like going out, you should always be ready with a smile and a joke, because you never know when you'll find the man of your dreams.


If you dress to express a subculture like Goth or medieval recreation or something, you'll stand a better chance of finding someone within that subculture but it may put off mainstream guys. Artists are often attracted to women with paint in their hair, mainstream guys might not be.

, A codependent relationship brings out the worst in both partners and shatters lives. If you grew up in a codependent environment, seek counseling and learn to overcome codependent habits before getting serious about any romantic relationship. You're better off taking your time than enduring the emotional and possibly physical abuse of codependence. That's what it leads to - abuse.


If you're willing to give up everything you love about yourself for the man you're with, then you have a big, big problem.

, Don't try to be someone you're not, or you may get typecast in a narrow role that doesn't include all that you are. If you're normally casual and dress to the nines whenever you meet him, he may reasonably expect you to dress like that all the time and be disappointed once you're together. If you pretend you don't like books and hook up with him, you may wind up spending the rest of your life having an argument every time you want to order from Amazon.


If you try to be someone else just to hook him, he'll eventually find out, and he'll feel like you were trying to trick him.

, This is a key point to staying with the man of your dreams. If you love him instantly, great, but don't blurt it out unless you're sure you've had the most magical chemistry from the start. If you can see him as your husband, the father of your kids, perfect, but don't mention it on your third -- or your tenth -- date. Let things run their course before you both feel serious enough about each other to talk about the future.


If the man is really the man of your dreams, then obviously, you'll want to tell him. But if you reveal this too early, you may look like you're a little desperate.
In the beginning, keep things light. Go on dates once or twice a week at most, but don't call him every day or try to see him as much as possible in the beginning, or you may scare him away.

, Though coming on too strong can be a problem, so can the opposite problem -- not letting the man know how much he means to you. If you've been together for a while and you haven't told him how much he means to you or gone out of your way to complement him, then you may be closer to losing him than you think. Though men don't generally like to be smothered with love and affection, they do like to be told that they're doing something right.


This doesn't mean that you should rush to say ""I love you"" -- or to say it before you mean it. But it does mean that you should be aware that men like to be praised, too.
When you're together, if he likes to hold hands, cuddle, or kiss, return the affection. If he feels like he's always starting it first, then he may not see that you're into him.

, This is crucial for the survival of any serious relationship. Your man may look great on paper, but you should also be compatible when you're together. This means laughing easily, having great conversations without hardly ever running out of things to talk about, seeing eye-to-eye on the small things, and being able to get through a day -- or a week, or a month! -- together without fighting every two seconds.


Compatibility isn't something you can force, but it should be something you can look out for.
If you find yourselves fighting a lot, ask yourself if it means that you're just not cut from the same cloth, or if both of you just like to problem-solve by fighting.

, Give it time, woman. Don't rush to the altar after six months of bliss. If you really want to make it last, then you have to have the patience to go through months, or years, of a good relationship, before trying to force marriage, children, or any serious choices onto your man. For the first year, at least, just enjoy your time together and work on developing a strong bond before trying to leap to the next step.


If you want to quickly doom your relationship, you should talk about marriage as early as possible.
Every relationship is different. Don't worry about your friends who got engaged after just a year together and try to force that on your own relationship if it doesn't fit.

, If both of you want to focus on your careers for the foreseeable future, then great. If you're both ready for the marriage and kids thing, awesome. And if you're okay with living right where you are for the rest of your lives, even better. Unfortunately, it's not often that you can be so in sync with your partner. If you are, then great. But if not, you should make sure that you share as many long-term goals as possible, so you can move forward together.


Of course, you should both be willing to compromise, but this will be much easier if your visions of the future aren't wildly different.
Obviously, the most important shared long-term goal should be developing your relationship. You should both be invested in the relationship 100% to be able to move forward.

If he acts this way, it may be because he’s been hanging out with other girls in other parts of town and doesn’t want to have any awkward run-ins. If you want to know if he’s playing you, you should casually mention that you want to go to to a different restaurant, different movie theatre, or another public park in town to see if it makes a difference to him.


If he’s really playing you, then he probably has his balancing act down to an art. If you try to change his usual schedule, then you may be able to call his bluff.
Ask yourself if he’s always the one who decides where you should go. Of course, he may just want to take charge for other reasons, but this could be a giveaway that he wants to steer you away from places where you’re likely to run in to some of his other ladies.;
, If your guy never wants to meet your friends, it may be because he doesn’t want to make the relationship a serious commitment. If he doesn’t want you to meet his friends, it may be for the same reason, with the additional worry that his friends may say something about the other girls he’s seeing. Whether he’s seeing someone else or not, if you’ve been together for a while and he’s shown no interest in wanting to meet your friends or have you meet his, then it’s a red flag.


If he doesn’t want to become a bigger part of your life, then it’s because he doesn’t want things to get too serious.
That said, if you try to rush him into meeting your friends, or even your family, after just a few weeks of dating, then you may be moving too fast. He may have legitimate reasons for taking things slow, like wanting to make sure he knows where things stand, or giving his friends some time to get used to the idea of him having a new girlfriend because he recently got out of a serious relationship.

, If things are great when you and your guy are alone and he suddenly gives you the cold shoulder when you run into him at the mall or outside a restaurant, then something is definitely up. Either he’s acting weird because he’s seeing another girl and doesn’t want to be seen with you, or because he doesn’t want his friends or anyone else to think he’s dating you. Either way, this should be a cause for concern.


If he really cares for you, then he should be excited to see you and should even show you some affection. Of course, he doesn’t have to be as affectionate in public as he would be in private, but he should act like he really wants to see you.
Check out his body language. Does he make eye contact and move toward you? If so, then that’s a good sign. But if he stands away from you, crosses his arms over his chest, and keeps looking around instead of looking at you, then this means that he’s trying to keep his distance.

, If you two go out on a date but he acts like you’re brother and sister, then you should be asking yourself why. If he’s playing you, then he doesn’t want the world to know that he’s seeing you, either because he’s also seeing someone else or he just wants to keep his options open. Though not all guys are into holding hands, for example, he should want to give you some sort of affection if he really cares for you.


You don’t want to put the pressure on him to be affectionate in public too early, but if you’ve gone on several dates and he still stands a foot away from you any time you’re out together, then this may be a cause for concern.

, If he’s all loving, sweet, kind, and wanting to kiss you one minute and then the next, he acts like he barely knows who you are, then this may be because he’s playing with you. Maybe he’s in the mood to hang out with you on certain days, while he thinks he has better things to do on others. Whether this means he’d rather hang with another girl or spend time with his buddies, if he’s always hot and cold, then he’s definitely playing with you.


Think about it: does he often leave you feeling confused about what he really feels about you or where you stand with him? If so, then this may be because he’s playing with your emotions.

, If the guy is playing with you, then he’ll never think that you come first with him. He would always spend a night out with his buddies, but when it comes to you, he’ll only hang out with you on certain times, when you suspect that his friends might be busy or that he has nothing else on his social calendar. If he really likes you, then he’ll think of you as a priority, not as social sloppy seconds. If you want to know if he’s playing with you, see if he’ll ever give up a night with his friends for a nice evening with you.


If the guy is serious about you, then he should be excited about hanging out with you instead of his friends, at least some of the time. Though you don’t want him to give up his other friends or his social life for you completely, if he makes no compromises for you at all, then it may be because he’s playing with you.

, One dead giveaway that a guy is playing with you is that he’s very secretive when it comes to his phone. If he’s always checking his phone and then texting away from your direction, stepping out to take calls a lot without telling you who called, or goes hours without picking up his phone with no explanation, then it may be because he’s playing you. Of course, some guys are protective about their privacy and that’s perfectly normal, but if he’s always on his phone and you never know what he’s doing, then it may be a red flag that he’s playing you.


Think about it: does he ever leave his phone out, even for a second, or is it always stuck in his pocket? Though you don’t want to snoop through it, if you can tell that he’s freaked out even about the idea of you seeing who is calling or texting him, then you may have a problem.
Another thing you can look out for is if he turns off his phone completely when he’s hanging out with you. Though this may be a sweet gesture to give you his full attention, it may also be his way of warding off other girls who might be calling him when you’re together.

, If you’ve heard him tell you how busy he is again and again, saying that he doesn’t have ten free minutes for anyone, and then you heard that he spent his night out with a bunch of friends, then this may be a sign that he’s playing with you. The truth of the matter is that if a guy really wants to hang out with you, that he’ll find the time to do it. Though there are exceptions if he really does get super busy, if you find out that he’s spending that time with other people, then it should be a cause for concern.


If he says he’s busy studying or doing work and then you find out that he’s been doing something else, even if he’s just hanging out with his brother, then he’s playing you. If he cared for you, then he’d be honest about what he was doing instead of lying.

, If your guy tries to change the subject any time you try to talk about the future, even if you’re only talking about your holiday plans, which are a month away, then this may be a sign that he’s playing you. If he’s serious about you, then he’ll want to see you as a part of his future and he won’t back off when you bring it up.


Of course, if you’ve been dating for three weeks and start talking about your wedding, it’s natural that he’ll freak out, but if you just bring up what you’ll both be doing a month from now, then he’ll have no reason to worry if he cares for you.
Listen to how he talks about you and the relationship. If he never, ever brings up the future or includes you in his future plans, then he may be playing you.

, If you finally meet his friends or run into his friends and they say something like, “I didn’t know he had a girlfriend…” or just look surprised by your presence, then this is because the guy didn’t think your relationship was serious enough for him to bring it up to his friends. If he cares about you and you’ve been seeing each other a while, then he should be excited about the relationship and should want his friends to know who you are.


If he’s sweet to you when it’s just the two of you, but is more buddy buddy or even distant around his friends, then he may just like to flirt with you without wanting anything serious.
Of course, some guys like to act tough in front of their friends, and he may not shower you with kisses when you meet them. But if he’s never even told them about you, then he may just be playing you.

, If you consider him your boyfriend and have been seeing only him for months while you’ve never heard the word “girlfriend” come out of his mouth, then this may be because he doesn’t think the relationship is as serious as you think it is. If he introduces you to people as his friend or even seems like he’s not feeling it when you call him your boyfriend, then it may be because he’s playing you.


Sometimes, words do speak louder than actions, and if he refuses to call you his girlfriend though you’ve been dating for a while, then there must be a reason behind it.
He may be afraid of commitment without playing you. If this is the case, you still need to have a talk about it.

, If you want to know if he’s playing you, then you should see how he talks to the other girls he knows. Sure, he may be polite and not interested when he talks to other girls if you’re standing right next to him, but if you see him talking to a girl out of the corner of your eye from the other side of the room and he’s being incredibly flirtatious, then this may be because he’s playing you.


If he really likes you, then he’ll find no need to talk to other girls in a flirtatious way. Sure, he can still talk to them and he doesn’t have to ignore every girl but you, but if you can tell from the way he talks to other girls that he wants more from them than just friendship, then he may be playing you.
Though you don’t want to spy on him or get too obsessive, if one of your friends is at a party where he’s talking to other girls, ask your friend what it was like. Though your friend shouldn’t be too obvious about watching him, you may get a better read on the situation this way than you would if you were in the room yourself.

, A classic sign of a player is a man who is always full of excuses. He may be so smooth and so convincing that you don’t even notice that he’s completely lying to you. He may tell you about his grandmother getting sick, his dog needing to go to the vet, or about how he forgot your date because he “overslept” or had to comfort a friend. Sure, things happen, but if you find that he has a perfect excuse for every little reason why he’s disappointed you, then he may be playing you.


If you’ve heard the excuse “my phone died” more than twice, then chances are, this is not the real reason he didn’t call you back.
If he seems extra sweet and apologetic when he gives you these excuses, then it may be because he’s covering up the fact that he’s lying.

, Another way to see if he’s playing you is to simply ask him how his night went if he told you he was staying in or hanging out with his friends. While you don’t need to ask about every little detail of the night, if you casually just ask a few questions about what happened, whether you ask what movie he watched when he was staying in alone or which bar he went to if he was supposedly out with his friends, you should check out his body language and words to see if he gets nervous, starts stuttering, or just acts uncomfortable.


Though you don’t want to interrogate him, if you just ask a few questions without making a big deal about it, you may even be able to catch him in a lie.
Ask him while you’re doing something else, like scrolling through your phone, so he doesn’t see that you’re really trying to figure him out.

, If you want to know if a guy is playing you, the easiest way can be to ask him. Though you may not want to know if he’s cheating on you, you can just ask him where you stand with him. If he’s not feeling it as much as you are, then you’re better off knowing sooner rather than later. Simply find some time to be alone and ask him what his thoughts are about you and your future together.


Though this may not be easy, this is far better than wondering for months. You’ll have a definitive answer, once and for all. And if he’s obviously lying, then you’ll be able to see that, too.
If you’re really feeling bold, you can just flat-out ask him if he’s cheating. Point to some shady behavior that has led you to feel this way.

, Though it’s best to just ask him yourself, you can also get some great feedback from your friends, too. They’ve been watching the situation unfold and may have a sense of what the relationship is like from the outside. They may even have a better sense of whether or not he’s playing you because they might have seen him with girls without you and may have a different impression.


Tell your friends to be honest with you. They shouldn’t lie to you just to spare your feelings.
They can investigate a bit if you really want them to. If it won’t look too obvious, you can have one of your friends casually show up in a place where your guy is likely to be and to keep an eye on him to see how he is with other girls. Of course, if he thinks you’ve sent a spy in his direction, he’ll be on his best behavior.

, Okay, so if you really don’t care about being found out or breaking his trust, then one thing you can do is to follow your guy after you’ve been hanging out, or just when you know he’ll be at a certain place, to see what he’s been up to. Whether you’re driving at a far distance away, walking, or taking the bus, try to be far enough away that he doesn’t see you and to have a ready-made story in case he does catch you in the act. This can lead you to see if he’s seeing any other girls—or if he’s just going home to hang out with his cat.


Just know that this is pretty risky behavior that can lead you to get caught. If you’re caught and he hasn’t been doing anything wrong, this can be a relationship ender for you, so make sure you really think following him is a good idea before you begin.

, Another way to find out if he’s playing you is to show up at his place unannounced. You can pop in an hour earlier than you said you’d be there to see if there’s a different woman there or if he’s suspiciously cleaning everything up. You can also just drop by because you’re “in the area” at a time when he’s supposed to be studying or home working to bring him some coffee or a treat. When you show up, see if he’s happy to see you or if he seems nervous, like he’s hiding something—or someone.


Of course, if it’s totally absurd that you would show up at his house out of the blue, then he’ll be on to you. But if you’ve come over there before and it hasn’t been a big deal, just try to make it seem natural.

, Though snooping through your guy’s things won’t win you any trust points, if you’re desperate and feel pretty sure that you want to cheat on him, then you can try looking through his phone or his email, or even looking through his room for suspicious items like female clothing that is obviously not yours. Snooping is a last resort and you should only do it if you feel like you really need answers and nothing else is working.


The problem with snooping is that, even if you’ve found evidence, you’ll have to admit that you’ve been going through the guy’s things if you want to call him out. This will make him angry at you, and will take the focus off the real situation.
If you’re looking through his phone, have an excuse ready in case he catches you. You can say that your phone died and that you were looking up the restaurant where you two were having dinner or that you needed to quickly check your email or something. Though this may not be too convincing, it may be better than nothing.

, You can also try to catch the guy in a lie to find out if he’s playing you. If he’s mentioned that he hung out with his friends or brother the other night, when you see them, you can ask about how the boy’s night out went; if they look confused, then you may know that he lied. If he tells a story about how he had to stay home because his sister was having drama, you can ask him how she’s feeling a few days later; if he acts like he has no idea what you’re talking about, then it may be because he already forgot his own lie.


You can even try asking him simple questions like which movie he saw if he went to the movies with his friends. If he looks embarrassed or clearly doesn’t know the answer, then you’ll know that he’s playing you.

, If you just get the feeling that the guy isn’t sincere even though you can’t find any proof of it through snooping, then it may be time to end the relationship. Maybe he’s not seeing other girls, but he still can be playing with you just because he’s not feeling it as much as you are. As long as you know you’re not the one with jealousy issues and see that you have a real reason to be concerned, if you really think he might be playing you, then it’s time to cut him loose.


When you’re with a guy who really cares for you and who is there for only you, you’ll know. You won’t spend hours calling him and wondering where he is and you won’t have to stoop as low as snooping through his things or following him because you’ll have no reason to do it. You’ll know that he’s there for you 100% and that will be an amazing feeling.

Have fun together.",How to Find Love at 50," Finding love, or the idea of dating even, can be scary and overwhelming. You may find excuses such as work, kids, and other activities in your life. You may also think that you're ""too old"" to find love, or that there is ""no one good to date at my age."" Having the right mindset, and being open to new things is the first step in the right direction. Remove negative thoughts. You're not alone in feeling like it's difficult, or making excuses, as many other people looking for love feel the same way. If you finding yourself worrying about how to find love, change that into a positive thought. Think about the good things that you have enjoyed with love and companionship, rather than the bad.
Start your day with the a daily reminder that you are a new person, ready to start fresh. Remind yourself of the good things that you have to offer. See yourself as open to a new love.;
, There are lots of things that can consume your day, but if you really are in search of love, then love needs to be a priority. If you are genuinely looking for love, don't overlook an opportunity that's available. Maybe someone asks you for coffee, or wants to see if you will join them for an event. Be open to going on a date, or rescheduling it for a time that works best for you both. Be careful not to make love the only thing that matters. Eagerness for love may blind you from making clear decisions.
If you are just starting to date, don't force love, or a more serious relationship, that it isn't there yet. You may feel the need to fill a void, but understand that love can take time.

, Take time to think about what you like about yourself in terms of your appearance and your personality. First impressions do matter.


Dress in a way to present your ""best self"" particularly when meeting new people, or going on a date. You don't have to wear something that goes against your personality, but there may be ways to enhance your appearance.
Take advice from people you trust about fashion tips. While it may be difficult to go out of your comfort zone, be open to other suggestions.
Be accepting of your body as it is now. It may have been a while since you were on the dating scene, and your body has likely changed a great deal since you last looked for love. Don’t let your insecurities keep you from finding love and intimacy.

, Confidence is often more important than appearance alone. Instead of focusing on the negative aspects of yourself, find the positives.Talk with enthusiasm and confidence, by focusing on the things that you enjoy.
While your appearance may initially help to get someone's attention, it is what you do and say afterwards that matters. Be friendly, polite, and respectful.

, We all have ""deal-breakers"" in a relationship. By now if you're in your 40s, 50s, or 60s, you have a better handle of what you're willing to compromise about, and what you're not. Be honest with yourself, and don't let your judgment become clouded about other things that are going on.Define what your needs are, and what truly makes you happy. Be realistic about what your needs are, and how they can or cannot be met by your partner.
Be honest about what type of love you're seeking. If it's a short-term fix for something missing in your life, you may find a partner that makes you feel good for the short-term, rather than for the long-haul.
It will be harder to find the love you're looking for, if you not sure what you're looking for in the first place. Remember that, like you, the people you meet will have a past. This could include children, grandchildren, multiple marriages, divorces, and so on, and you'll have to be prepared to accept that people will have some baggage and history.

, Be open to letting people know that you are single, and looking. Finding a new relationship through friends, or people you know, is the most common way to find love.Be open to doing things outside of your normal routine. By being available to new experiences, you are opening yourself to meeting new people. Consider some of the following activities:


Hanging out at a coffee shop to read
Taking a walk at a new spot
Joining a gym, or a co-ed fitness class
Getting out into nature — at the beaches, at the lake, in a park.
Going to a new bar with friends

, There are many older men and women that find love through online sites. It's not just for younger people. Consider using a site that is geared more towards a common interest or faith, or that is more age specific.Making a profile may seem a bit overwhelming. Consider talking with your friends, or someone you trust, that may have some good advice about how to show-off your personality in an effective way.
Be aware that online dating via messaging or emails is similar to getting someone's attention in person. Be friendly and personable. It's okay to flirt.

, Finding an appropriate match often as more to do with emotional and physiological age rather than a person's numerical age, in and of itself. You want to be able to share similar experiences and values if you're looking for a deeper kind of love. Matching with someone's energy and activity level may also make for a more lasting relationship.


If you're 50, you may find a great match with someone who's 38 or 62. Be open on both sides of the age spectrum.
Some men may want to date someone 10 or 20 years younger than them. Think about if that partner's maturity matches your own. If you're very active, there are many women in their 50s and beyond that may be a great match.
Some women may feel like they are competing with younger, more youthful looking women. Think about how both of the sexes are often attracted to confidence more than anything else. Be confident in your own skin.

, Search online for speed dating events, and talk with a single friend who might be willing to go with you. This can be a quick way to meet new people, and see if there is an initial spark.


When speed dating, it's a brief conversation with a larger number of prospective people, so there's a the benefit of not spending as much time, compare to being set-up by friends, or meeting people one at time through online dates.Think of it as a networking event, or a cocktail party. It's a brief and fast way to meet people.

, With modern technology, there are lots of ways to find activities for singles in your community. Here are some other places that might have single's groups:


A local church, or other place of worship, that has singles' activities.
Fitness groups or clubs, such as a runner's group
General interest groups, such as through Meetup.com
Networking or college alumni events
Volunteer groups
Social dance classes

, If you're just getting back into dating after a divorce or loss of a partner, it may have been a while since you last went on a date. Tune into modern dating norms by asking friend who have been dating. Be open to splitting the bill with your date, meeting at a location instead of getting picked up, possibly dating more than one person at a time, etc. Another great way to learn current dating norms? Just jump right into it!, Being positive and passionate about life is a very attractive quality. While you may feel burned by love in the past, make an effort to put aside old feelings. If you feel like you still aren't ""over"" a past relationship, you may be carrying baggage that makes you less attractive to others. Consider the following:


Avoid turning your past relationships into the main topic of conversation when first meeting someone.
Talk about the things that make you truly happy. Share stories that make you smile each time you tell them.
Find ways to be remain positive about love and dating in a genuine and honest way. Seek advice, or possibly counseling, if you keep running into hurdles about how to get past your ex, or past negative relationships..

, Listen to what your partner, or the new person you're dating, is really saying. Are you interested in what he or she has to say? A lasting relationship is based on effective communication, which often starts with being a good listener. Consider the following:Maintain eye contact when your partner is talking. This shows you are giving them undivided attention.
Paraphrase what you heard him or her say if you are wanting to understand better what they are talking about. For example, ""it sounds like doing _____ was difficult/stressful/hard"" or ""doing _____ sounds really interesting/fun/exciting.""
Avoid the need to interrupt or interject in the middle when your partner is talking.

, In addition to effective communication, this is the key to a lasting relationship. If you are interested in more than just dating, love is founded on core values. If you and your partner are matching in similar interests, that's great, but ultimately is the bigger things in life that will lead to a healthy relationship down the road. You may have learned this already from your earlier relationship, but think about some of these when you are looking for love:What do you think about marriage, divorce, and love?
What are your religious, or moral, beliefs about how to live your life?
How do you deal with money, and make financial decisions?
How do you feel about taking care of someone? Or about making important decisions as a couple?

, Make time to enjoy common interests. It's okay to have time apart, and have your own individuality. Just make sure that you are having time together that is fun and meaningful. Consider the following:


Do activities that are new and different. Not just going out to dinner, or watching TV at home.
Share time together away from other couples, relatives, or kids. See what it's like when it's just the two of you.
Joke, laugh, and be playful. Life is short. You can make even ordinary activities more fun with a little extra attention and effort.

Look around you.,
Prepare yourself for the dating world.,
Meet lots of people.,
Attend events for the nerd in us all.,
Volunteer.,
If someone hasn't caught your eye yet, consider your situation.,
Take it slow.,
If none of the above have worked, consider online dating.,
Don't be afraid to make the first move.",How to Find a Fellow Nerd to Fall in Love with," There are plenty of fish in the sea, and there is some truth in the old adage, 'opposites attract'. Consider why you are looking for a significant other, and evaluate what it is you bring to the table. Don't eliminate the possibility of dating someone solely on the basis of whether you belong to similar fandoms or geek culture. Be prepared to keep an open mind.;
, If you can envision what kind of person it is that you want to be with, look at yourself and be sure that you are the kind of person that others would like to be around. It is super important to be yourself. Don't be someone you're not, but being mindful of your manners, hygiene, and attitude is key. Be willing to try new things, go new places, and look your best. Don't get discouraged if results aren't immediate, just continue to send out good vibes and good things will come back to you.

, Consider joining a club or activity for your favorite nerdy interests. Examples include book clubs, bands, seminar series, community service organizations, film clubs, etc. If you're in school, there are lots of clubs available for like-minded individuals of a similar age. Check out community centers, libraries, local coffee shops, and hang-out spots. If no such clubs exist, consider grabbing a few friends and forming one yourself, and be sure to advertise, open it up to others of similar interests. Speech and Chess clubs are the best to look into, as well as theater.

, Go to Star Wars conventions, start a weekly D&D party, or go to local video game tournaments. Nerds tend to be shy, so you should try to meet them where they're comfortable.

, Check out local museums, theaters, galleries, hospitals or even parks and donate your time to helping others learn more about the subjects you love. It's a great way to meet other volunteers and people with similar interests.

, Are you putting yourself in a position to meet other singles? Look at the times in which you are going out. Most people have work or school, and are relaxing on the evenings and weekends. Of course you should still be making time for your friends and family, but if Friday night is board game night, or Saturday evenings are devoted to movie marathons, on top of your regular obligations, thus you are kept away from meeting others, consider adding a little change into the mix, or organizing outings with friends to new places.


Furthermore, are you approachable? Going to a restaurant, or even the library are great ways to meet people, but looking at your phone, bringing a friend and being 100% invested in them, might have others who are interested in talking to you second guessing themselves, or worse making it appear you aren't single or looking for love.

, Once someone has caught your eye, try spending time in groups or just as friends first to develop a base relationship. Don't scare them, just be friendly, but not too pushy. They really like it better if you're kind, share their interests, and care to listen to them. Bond over shared nerdy interests, and feel free to explore them. ""Oh you enjoy classic literature? Do you get into philosophy? I'd let you borrow my copy of Camus' The Stranger to get your opinion on it."" ""Oh you play The Elder Scrolls Online? Let's play together sometime!"" If things continue to go well, consider asking them out on a date!

, This of course has its own pros and cons. Be safe and be yourself when pursuing this option. On the bright side, it can act like one big filter that says ""Here is who I am, here is what I like, and here's what I look for in a person."" Lots of sites allow for chat rooms and forums filled with mutual interests.

, The worst thing someone can ever do is say no. And even the worst of dating experiences can be learned from. In many cases, you can learn to refine your own dating behavior, as well as assure yourself of what it is you do and don't like or want in others. Keep trying when things don't go your way and don't give up!

Return to school.",How to Feel Good Alone in Your 50s," Yes, you are on our own. However, this does not mean that you need to be alone. There is a difference between being on your own and being lonely; what you choose to do and who you choose to see will make all the difference.;
, Accepting your situation allows you to do something about it. Making plans for the future, which could be another four decades or so, is a vital activity for giving you back a sense of direction and purpose.

, While men in their 50s may be considered esteemed and a ""good catch"", women in this age group often feel invisible and less desirable. Media messaging reinforces the invisibility of older women, through such things as pairing older men with very young co-stars in Hollywood movies, rampant coverage of young female starlets in magazines, yet not showing older women anywhere near as much, while showing older men well into their 90s as powerful and even sexy, and so forth. These are images principally pushed by the advertising and entertainment industries and they do not reflect reality. Whatever your gender and age, you remain an important and valued member of society. Do not allow yourself to feel devalued by the incessant drive to sell aspirational products and lifestyles.

, Embrace this time of your life. Be positive about everything. Smile at everyone.Your life will change and become full of love.

, Look for friends with people of your own gender first. Then consider finding friendships with people of the opposite gender, without having romantic pressure. Let what may be come of its own accord. In time, romance may blossom with someone you've reached out to.


Women may feel that this stage of life turns into a competition for the best guy out there. However, realize that you're all feeling vulnerable and there can be strength in joining together and supporting one another. Just soften a tiny bit and open up to other women who are feeling just as vulnerable as you are; they just have a weird way of showing it.

, This way, you will meet people with similar interests, from all walks of life. When you share an interest with others, age does not matter, so you have the chance to make friends across age groups and to learn from each other.

, It can be depressing and bad for the soul if you feel rejected on it often. In your age group, there is also a risk of coming across people who are misfits and worst of all, married! If you want to find people through this means, be very selective and use your decades of experience to root out the suspicious ones. When actually dating, sum up the date quickly, so that you don't over-invest yourself in somebody who is just going to suck you dry or be a complete loss. That said, it is possible to find someone you really connect with through online dating, so don't dismiss it; it has become the norm for many people now.

, Donate every piece of clothing that does not make you feel attractive and stylish. Buy fashion magazines, watch what people are wearing and make it a plan to be ""on the cutting edge"". Don't go over the top - watch it. But dress appropriately for your figure and add lots of color - scarves, shoes, accessories, ties, etc. Have fun and stay stylish.

, Get a massage, shop for organic fruit and vegetables. Check out vitamins. Buy personal grooming products that are also organic and not full of chemicals.

, Your health is paramount from this point onward. Don't be intimidated by your doctor. If something is bothering you, don't give up. There are lots of doctors out there. Find a good one.

, Take up dancing, join a walking group or buy yourself a bicycle and join a bike club. There is a club for every activity you can think of. Do some research and go for it. You can decide to be miserable or you can decide to move ahead.

, Do research online and pick a cause. Meet real people doing real things to help this planet.

, It's a gold mine. Get to know the staff and invite them to help you find books and resources. You won't believe how much fun the library can be. Plus, there are lots of potential friends at the library.

, Read the newspaper every now and then and watch a bit of the news every day. Not too much. It can be a little depressing. However, it helps to stay informed and aware of what is going on.

, If you live in or near a city, explore it. You could take a walking, cycling or Segway tour of areas of the city. Learn its history in depth.

, Attend more theater, orchestras, cinema, shows and talks. Even movies by yourself can be fun.

, Go and see new places. There is nothing quite like travel to rejuvenate tired outlooks on life. You will return reinvigorated and ready to try new things. Plus, you may make many new friends and some of them might come and visit you.


Visit relatives, long lost friends and other people when you travel. Catch up with people you haven't seen in ages. The way their lives have turned out might give you much perspective.

, If you don't already have a pet, consider getting one. When you're alone, the companionship is invaluable. Plus, many pets need a lot of interaction to ensure their happiness, which feeds your happiness too.


Dogs need exercise daily. Walking your dog twice a day for 30 minutes will get both of you out of the house and can improve your fitness. You may even meet new people!

, Do a night course or a whole degree, whatever you feel would extend your knowledge and give you a new outlook on life. Maybe you would even like to change your career; this could be a way to meet both your need for change and for finding new sources of friendships.

For example, do you prefer to make decisions about pursuing your education, moving across the country, or taking a new job on your own? If you would rather make these decisions by yourself and without having to consider a partner, you might be well suited to the single life., It is important to notice and think critically about your reactions to other couples. Try thinking about how you feel when you are out and see groups of couples socializing. If you find yourself wishing you were part of a couple, then you might be better suited to a relationship. If, on the other hand, you feel happy about being on your own when you interact with couples, a single life might be a better fit for you., When you fall asleep at night or wake up in the morning, take note of how you feel. If you find that you enjoy the flexibility and comfort of waking up in your own bed, on your own schedule, it could indicate that being single is a good lifestyle choice for you. However, if you find yourself longing for companionship as you doze off each night, you may be well suited for an intimate relationship., Research on single men and women reveals that they have a well-developed sense of personal mastery. These single men and women go about life with a can-do attitude, believing they can accomplish nearly anything they set their minds to. Having a greater sense of personal mastery is associated with being less likely to experience negative emotions, and can mean you may enjoy and benefit from living your life as a single person.Ask yourself if you understand your personality, beliefs, values, and why you go about life the way you do.
Try asking yourself if you know where you want to go in life, and if you have a plan for getting there.

, Self-sufficiency means you are capable of and enjoy doing things on your own. Researchers have found that single people who are rich in self-sufficiency are less likely to experience negative feelings. This is the opposite for married people who are also self-sufficient, as they are more likely to experience negative feelings.Try asking yourself, “Do I like to deal with things on my own?”
Ask yourself if you get upset about having to deal with things on your own. If you do, you might have a lesser degree of self-sufficiency.

, Being single often means going to a movie, concert, or foreign country by yourself. This can be liberating for some, but for those who are not suited to being single, these situations can cause anxiety. If the idea of doing things all by your lonesome sounds appealing, you might be well-suited to the single life., It takes a lot of strength and self-confidence to live an unapologetic, single life. Single people are often challenged by others who ask why they are still single, even questioning if there is something wrong with the single person. If you can live with this type of criticism, then singledom might be for you.

Sign up to social sites.,
Keep a positive mindset about your future.",How to Find a Serious Love As a Single Mom or Dad," Things will no longer be the way they used to be. You are now a single parent. By accepting that, you are able to free yourself from worry and regret. You are able to cut those chains that bind you to isolation and potentiality limited experiences.


Accept and think that you’ve made the best decision to a certain scenario that you’ve been through, unless you got dumped.
Accepting is a concrete proof of your ability to let go of the past, thus making peace with your present.;
, After being able to accept things as they are, then it’s time to move on. You must now start living your life. Do it by enjoying the delights the world can offer.


Invite your friends and have some fun––just make sure your children are appropriately supervised at all times.
Eat in your favorite restaurant. Book a babysitter for your children if they are young enough to require one.
Have a movie night, or go to an adventure, with your children possibly.
Visit mother nature. Visitors to mother nature frequently find serious love, especially single parents. Do a little camping––you’ll be surprised by how nature can serenade you with its beautiful music of peace and help you find serious love.


Getting out and living life again can add to your motivation to indeed finally move on.







, You need to become an empowered person, a way of shouting to the world that you are now definitely free and can do whatever you want to and no one will stand in judgment. By empowering yourself, you will live in a constant state of happiness and not feel stressed by all the work, worry and responsibilities of being a single parent. You can start by being more dedicated to your job, if you are able to work and be a single parent, and have a social life.


Love your work more. But don’t ever be a slave to your job by stressing yourself because of it. It’s good to be devoted to it but don’t work too much. Remember that you are doing this as part of empowering yourself.
Spend more time with your kids. It’s vital not to miss having dinner with them. Always ask how their day was and monitor their status in their school. In that way, your kids will feel that you can still be a good and responsible parent despite being separated and that you can still love them unconditionally, thus making yourself enough for them.

Think about why you are involved in a relationship.,
Decide if you’re happy being in a relationship.,
Think about whether you are trying to fill a void.,
Ask yourself if you are making too many compromises.",How to Figure Out if You're Hardwired to Be Single2," Take some time to make a list of the reasons why you are part of a couple. Think deeply about your motivations for being in a relationship. Take note if you think you became involved in a relationship because of social pressure from friends, family, or professional relations. This could indicate you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons, and could be better off living the single life., If you are coupled up and happy with your social, financial, and family life the way it is, you may not be hardwired to be single. But if you are involved in a relationship and find yourself wishing you were not part of a couple, then a single life could be a better fit for you., Sometimes people avoid being single and instead become involved in a romantic relationship because they are trying to fill a void in their lives. If you are in a relationship, ask yourself whether you decided to become involved in it to fill an emotional or social void., Making compromises is an important part of a healthy relationship, but should not be excessive. If you are in a relationship and recognize you are compromising important aspects of your life, such as furthering your education or engaging in risky behaviors that endanger your wellbeing, you might be better suited to the single life – at least for right now.You should avoid making decisions in a relationship that compromise your values, goals, or safety.
It is okay, however, to compromise on where to go on vacation or what movie you’ll watch on Friday night.

Know the signs that someone is interested.,
Glance at him/her frequently during class.,
Watch when someone laughs a lot.,
Notice the way they act around you.,
Be careful with your assumptions.",How to Figure Out if Someone Likes You1," If a person likes you, you may notice them staring at you, smiling at you, or trying to make contact with you.If someone has a crush on you, he/she will probably find excuses to touch you more than usual.If the person is shy, he/she might show attraction by avoiding you. If the person is more confident and forward, he/she might show attraction by giving you a lot of noticeable attention.;
, If you often catch the person gazing back at you, this is a sign that they like you. Do they hold the stare intensely for several seconds? Do they shyly look away? Do they smile at you? All of these are signs that they like you.Read their eyes for interest. If they like you and they're staring at you in class, they probably won't be doing so with a blank expression. See if you can tell whether the person is legitimately checking you out, or simply staring off into space., If someone laughs at your jokes, even when they aren't funny, it may indicate that he/she likes you. It doesn't necessarily mean that the person has a full-fledged crush on you, but it often signals that there is some level of attraction., If someone likes you, you might notice their demeanor change. They will notice when you walk into the room, and they might make an effort to make a good impression on you. He might run his hand through his hair, or stutter a bit, or try extra hard to be funny. He/she might laugh a lot, or make an effort to be especially nice to you.


When they're with their friends, do they shrug you off, or do they invite you to hang out with the group? If they shrug you off, they probably don't like you. However, if they invite you to hang out, they probably at least find you an interesting person – and they may even have a ""crush"" on you.
If you notice her friends giggling and whispering as you walk by, there's a decent chance that she likes you. If you notice him and his group of friends go quiet as you pass, it might be because they're talking about you!

, If you've seen this person staring at you once or twice, don't automatically assume that they ""like"" you. When you are quick to assume, you open yourself up to disappointment. The only way to know for sure is to hear it straight from the source: when a person tells you that they like you. You can use your observations as predictive tools, but you can only figure out so much from clues.

Flirt with the person and see how they respond.,
Befriend them.,
Make an inside joke with them.,
Notice when he/she listens.",How to Figure Out if Someone Likes You2," If the person flirts back, there's a good chance that they're interested in you. If they just nod, but don't engage, they might not be paying attention – or they might be scared they'll say the wrong thing. If they start acting nervous and fidgety, they could really like you and feel anxious that you'll reject them, but they could also be figuring out how to let you down easy. Trust your gut! It can be hard to tell, but your intuition can lead you in the right direction.Bear in mind that some people are naturally flirty. Flirting back does not necessarily mean that the person likes you – it might just indicate attraction, or that he/she is especially outgoing.
Try casually touching the person to see how they respond. Put your hand on his/her arm or shoulder when you're speaking, and sit with your thighs and shoulders touching. If the person seems to respond well to your touch, it might be a good sign., Many strong relationships have begun as simple friendships. If you become this person's friend, you'll learn more about them and they'll learn more about you. If the two of you are compatible, you might start to like each other. This can also help the person feel more comfortable around you.


Try going out with a group of your friends and inviting the ""Someone."" This can make it much more comfortable to be around someone that you like.

, You can't necessarily force this, but you can ride the momentum if it happens. Bring up the inside joke again a day or two later, and see if the person remembers it. This can be a good way to gauge whether the person places significance upon your interactions.

, It may indicate attraction if the person pays rapt attention when you talk about yourself. He/she might ask you questions about your life. As you get to know each other more deeply, you might find yourselves talking about personal preferences and experiences that don't normally come up in conversation. If he/she listens and remembers the details hours or days later, then there's a good chance that he/she likes you.Again, this is not a certain method of telling that someone likes you. However, it can be a pretty good indication.
Try telling a long story to see if the person listens – but don't make it a boring tale. If he/she is hanging off of your every word, he/she probably finds you interesting.

Ask for the person's number.,
Talk to them outside of school.,
Ask the person out.",How to Figure Out if Someone Likes You3," Be casual about it. If you feel comfortable being low-key about it, just take out your phone and start texting, then casually ask, ""Hey, , what's your number?"" It helps to have a specific reason for asking: arranging a study group, for instance, or to coordinate for a party. If the person happily gives you their number, it doesn't necessarily mean that he/she likes you in a more-than-platonic way – but it does indicate that he/she is comfortable enough with you to open up a new means of communication.


Do not ask someone else for your crush's phone number. If you're going to do this, be straightforward and ask in person.
Take notice when this person asks for your number, or gives you his/her number without you having to ask. These forward moves might mean that he/she likes you. Take this as an invitation to text the person.

, Add this person as a friend on Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, or another social network. Message them over text, if you have their number. Start with something simple: ask about the homework, if you need a non-forward opener, or just say, ""Hey! How are you doing?"" Bear in mind that this will feel much more natural for both of you if you already talk to this person a lot in person.

, If you are reasonably sure that this person likes you, ask him/her out on a one-on-one date. Invite the person to a movie, to a concert, or just for a walk to the park. Be calm and confident, and try to act natural.


Make sure that you have a specific day, event, or plan in mind when you ask. Avoid vaguely asking someone ""out."" All ""going out"" really means is that you and another person are going a lot of places together, and making a bunch of specific plans.
If the person turns you down, try to keep it in perspective. There are many fish in the sea, as the saying goes, and it is not always worth your time to persistently woo someone who simply doesn't like you. Consider whether the person might have declined your invitation for some other reason: perhaps he/she is not allowed to date, or didn't believe that you were being genuine.

Choose the location for the hickey.,
Obtain a 2-liter bottle.,
Place the bottle mouth on your body.,
Consider widening the hickey.",How to Fake a Hickey1," Most hickeys tend to be around the neck area, but hickey can also be found on all areas of the chest.


If you decide to place the hickey on your neck, do so on the sides of the neck avoiding the area underneath your chin, and directly in the middle of your neck (on or surrounding you’re your esophagus). A hickey located on the sides of the neck will help make it more believable.;
, The bottle is the instrument you will use to make the hickey. Place the bottle in between your hands, and squeeze the midsection of the bottle.As you prepare to make your hickey, it helps to stand in front of a mirror so you can see what you’re doing.

, Place the mouth of the squeezed bottle on the area you’ve decided to make your hickey. The mouth of the bottle must be flush with your skin in order to create suction. Hold the bottle in place for approximately 15 seconds. After 15 seconds, pull the bottle away to remove the bottle from your skin.


Keep in mind that the less air there is in the bottle (the more you have squeezed the bottle), the more suction there will be on your skin. This increased suction will lead to a faster forming and more intense looking hickey., Since the mouth of the bottle is a perfect circle, consider moving the bottle over a centimeter or two, and making another hickey. This second hickey doesn’t need to be as intense as the first hickey made, so you can try squeezing the bottle less, or holding it on your skin for a shorter amount of time.


Since mouths have more of an oval shape, widening the hickey will make the look of the hickey more realistic.

Choose the location for the hickey.,
Obtain a large eye shadow palette.,
Apply the pink eye shadow.,
Add the purple eye shadow.,
Add the blue eye shadow.,
Set the makeup.",How to Fake a Hickey2," A hickey can be made anywhere on the body, but normally, hickeys tend to be located on either the neck or chest areas.


If you decide to make your hickey on your neck, consider making the hickey on the sides of the neck. Avoid making a hickey in the center of your neck, near your throat, or the area underneath your chin.

, Get a large eye shadow palette that has an array of colors. The colors you need use will be a dark pink, dark purple, and dark blue.Use a small makeup brush to apply the eye shadow.
Keep in mind, if you have a darker skin tone, you might need to use the darker eye shadow colors more heavily in order to have the hickey mark show up., Gently tap your makeup brush once or twice into the pink eye shadow. Stand in front of a mirror to apply the makeup. Bring the brush up to the area you’re making the hickey, and rub the brush in small, ½ - 1 inch sized ovals on your skin.Be sure you don’t add too much color to the brush. You need to build up the color for the hickey slowly and gradually.

, Tap a corner of your makeup brush once in the purple eye shadow, and tap the shadow onto the middle area of the hickey.Lightly continue to use the whole brush to make small ovals to form the hickey. Use the brush to help blend the purple coloring out to the edges of the hickey.


When in doubt, use less of the darker eye shadow colors. You can also add more, but it’s harder to take off the color once it’s added.

, Again, tap a small corner of your makeup brush into the blue eye shadow and dab it in the middle area of the hickey.Rub the brush in small ovals, blending the blue out to the edges of the hickey.


Since the hickey should already be taking form when you add the blue, you don’t need that much blue makeup. Consider tapping the brush on the side of your finger or the edge of a surface to knock off any excess blue shadow.

, Spray a thin layer of hair spray or makeup setting spray to make the hickey last longer and avoid coming off on your clothes. This fake hickey will last until you wash it off.

Choose the location for the hickey.,
Obtain alcohol activated paint.,
Add a small amount of alcohol onto a paint plate.,
Tap a sponge into the alcohol.,
Apply the first paint layer.,
Apply the second paint layer.",How to Fake a Hickey3," You can create your hickey on any part of your body, but hickeys are usually found on the neck and chest areas.

, Alcohol activated paint is used commonly for film and theatre use because they are sweat resistance and last a long time.Grease paints are an alternative option, but they have a tendency to not last as long and melt a bit, due to body heat., Open a bottle of rubbing alcohol and apply a cotton ball to the open top. Tip the bottle upside for one second, then flip it back, right-side up. Squeeze the soaked cotton ball over the middle of a paint plate to create a small puddle of alcohol.


This small pool of alcohol will be what you dip your applicator sponges in to moisten them, activating the paint.

, Tap the stippled edge of the applicator sponge in the alcohol. Then squeeze the stippled edge of the sponge to distribute the alcohol. Dab the stippled edge of the sponge on a paper towel to absorb any excess alcohol.


Be sure to stand in front of a mirror as you get ready to create your hickey.

, Gently tap the dampened applicator sponge into the red paint color.Lightly dab a corner of the sponge on your skin to create a small oval approximately ½ inch long and ¼ wide.


Stipple the coloring as much as you can. The stippled look will make the hickey look natural and authentic.

, With the same sponge applicator, dab the sponge into the dark blue color. The red from the previous application mixed with the blue will create a very bruise-like purple color.Dab the sponge into the center of the hickey very lightly to give the appearance of broken blood vessels.To help blend the colors together, you can tap the sponge into the alcohol, tap a paper towel to remove excess alcohol, and dab the hickey, allowing the colors to blend into each other."

Allow yourself to grieve.,
If the person you miss has passed away, think of the good times you had with this person.,
If the person has cut you out of his or her life, for whatever reason, but you still see this person regularly, have courage.,
Find new friends or support buddies.,
Realize that in the case of someone pursuing a dream, job or hobby, the distance may be essential.,
Strike a deal with your globetrotter spouse or partner.,
Use all the communication methods available to stay in touch with this person.,
Visit this person.,
Send regular updates.,
If you find the pain of missing someone is getting so bad, try doing something to distract yourself from thinking about this person for a time.,
Get busy.,
Be kind to yourself.,
Pretend the person is with you.,
Deal with it.",How to Deal With Missing Someone," Grief is very personal and there is no one right way to grieve. What does matter is that you do find your own way to overcome the permanent loss of someone you cared about, whether they've died, cut you off, moved away for good, etc. Give it time, as healing isn't something you can rush.;
, While it is natural to miss this person and to feel a range of emotions, it's also nice to remember the good times. This can provide some balance to what can otherwise be a very bleak time for you.

, This can be really tough and it is really hard to keep seeing someone who no longer wants anything to do with you. Be friendly and smile and say hello but don't expect an exchange and don't expect any conversation. By being polite, you can show that you don't bear ill will or have any intention of making things more difficult, but you also shield yourself from ongoing internal negativity. You cannot control the other person's behavior but you can put on a brave front, which is something others see too, not just this person.

, If you've lost someone who was always ""there for you"", find someone new who will be a great source of support. In turn, be supportive of this person so that it's mutual. This isn't about replacing the other person; it's about moving on and growing your friendships and support team, continuing to reach out to people who can make a positive difference in your life.

, If the distance is temporary, for a few weeks, months or even years, you know it will come to an end and that you'll need to readjust your life to work for you in the meantime. Whether it's a spouse, a partner, a child or a best friend, people sometimes need to move away for very good reasons. Accepting that the need is driven by something beyond you is part of letting go of trying to control the change, and starting on your way to working out how to manage the distance as best you can. Think about:


How long will this person be gone for?
How will we stay in touch?
What plans can I make to get on with things for now?

, It can be hard to accept that Matt would rather mountain-climb than stay at home with you and do the gardening and it can be equally difficult to accept that Georgia would rather volunteer in Outer Mongolia than working in the local charity shop but realize that chasing a passion isn't necessarily about letting you down. If you got attached to a person who must globetrot, then it's important to seek to accept this person's need to do exciting, monumental or career-driven things as part of this person's makeup. It doesn't mean belittling your own needs but it does mean that the two of you need to set ground rules that allow both of you to lead fulfilling lives while staying connected in some shape or form. It is important therefore, to strike a deal about how the two of you will stay in touch, how much time will be spent apart and how much time will be spent together. In this way, you can look forward to the times spent together, rather than feeling as if you're going to die from the pain of constantly missing this person.

, You can phone or text this person, have regular video link-ups, send emails and instant message. You might even send good old-fashioned letters to each other, inside a parcel filled with treats that show how you remember what this person most likes.

, Whether this person is interstate, overseas, in prison, deployed, living for a year in Antarctica, locked up in a reality TV studio, etc., find out whether it is possible to meet up. For some cases, you may have to adhere to strict visiting times, while for others, you may need to save up your pennies and pay for a trip somewhere else. It's important to at least investigate the possibilities for visiting this person to make the time spent apart seem less onerous.

, If you're not able to stay in touch daily or through the usual channels of communications, see whether it's possible to send regular updates by way of a letter or newsletter. You could even keep a journal that is meant just for this person to read. Save up all of your entries and get them to this person when it is feasible.

, For example, you might plan a trip somewhere with friends, take up night classes or immerse yourself in a new hobby. Do something you've always wanted to do or learn, and make the most of the time apart from this person.

, Try to find activities that keep your mind off that person you are missing. The busier you are the less time you have thinking about that person.

, If the person you miss has passed away then grieve but do not dwell on it for a very long time. Go out and try to make new friends.

, Make believe isn't just for toddlers. Pretend to talk to this person (not out loud unless you're alone or have privacy). Pretend they're on your shoulder talking to you, just as those little angels and devils do in the movies. Ask yourself what you think this person would do in a particular situation and have a lovely private laugh to yourself when picturing their response.

, If nothing works, just own up and admit it to yourself. The secret to happiness is to not feel sorry for yourself. If you can work around this and accept it, then you're going to find that while you still miss this person, you know you're strong enough to cope. You can miss them, but don't let it consume you. Just live life and know that no matter how much a specific moment hurts, it's going to pass. Time might seem to stand still, but it never does.

Stay positive.",How to Deal With Being Single and Feeling Lonely," A romantic partnership is not the only satisfying type of relationship. In fact, being single is the perfect time to focus on building other vital types of relationships that can last a lifetime.


If you are feeling lonely, tell your family and closest friends. It might be hard to admit at first, but the first step to overcoming loneliness is to admit to ourselves that we are lonely, and to let those who care about us know so that can help.Talking on the phone or connecting through social media is good, but try to also meet up outside of the house as well. Sometimes a change of environment can really help to elevate one's mood and create the feeling of positive, forward movement.Offer to help babysit or petsit for your friends and family as a way to stay connected and have fun with their kids and pets!;
, Sitting alone in a dark room with the curtains closed will do nothing for your confidence and will make you feel more pessimistic.


Check out new shops and restaurants in your town and get to know the owners.
If you work a lot from home, consider taking your work out to a coffee shop to work in the presence of others.Become friendly with your next-door neighbors. You can always invite them over for afternoon tea or a weekend barbecue when you feel like company.

, These kinds of platonic gatherings can be great spaces to meet likeminded people and share interests.See if there’s a book club through your local library or coffee house.
If you’re passionate about a particular set of issues or social causes, do some internet searching to see if there are any clubs or organizations in your area that focus on the same causes.
If you’re religious, consider joining a church group and taking up meditation.

, Not only will this help to fill up your “lonely time,” but volunteering can make you feel good about yourself as a person and has been clinically shown to improve one’s mood., Furry companions can be the best of friends and keep one from feeling lonely at home.Pets offer unconditional love and will always be there at home to greet you instead of an empty house.
Studies have shown that having pets can lower blood pressure and elevate mood., Being in a relationship does not make you a better, more successful person. Don't think less of yourself for being single. Rather, this is the time to focus on all the things that make you great, as well as all some little things to make yourself even better.Treat yourself to some new clothes or a new haircut. This can help you feel better about yourself physically, and like you’re making a fresh start.Focus on your career, work, and professional life. Achieving success in this area of your life can help you feel better about yourself overall.

, Being on your own provides “restorative solitude,” which means time to think, refresh, and replenish your creative juices before reentering the world as a more fulfilled and fruitful person.Treat yourself to a movie, play, or concert. These don’t only have to be “date” activities, rather something that you can enjoy all on your own.
Get to know your inner self better with some personal meditation time, or connect to a higher power through prayer.Try writing, journaling, or keeping a diary. Studies have shown that writing can be a cathartic way to work through emotions like loneliness, confront your fears, and be mindful of what you're currently happy about as well as what you want for the future., If you are feeling lonely or depressed, taking up a new sport or form of exercise can really help. This is great for your body, as well as your soul.Running and swimming are great for relieving stress and depression. They release a lot of endorphins, the neurochemicals responsible for making us feel happy and less stressed.Take long walks in nature. The woods or the beach can be especially relaxing environments and the beauty of nature helps to remind one of the good things in life.
Jog along public trails. You might make a new running buddy who also frequents your favorite route.
Take up yoga. Yoga is a fantastic practice for body and soul. It helps to reduce stress while building flexibility and strength, and you can practice it alone or in a studio setting surrounded by others.
Try joining a gym. Becoming a gym member not only provides great motivation for staying active, but it is also a social environment where you can meet people.

, Learning something new can be a rewarding experience and help you cultivate new interests.


Solo hobbies like cooking, gardening, or crafting can also be turned into social activities by joining a group class on these topics.Keep your mind busy with a good book. Try to find something engaging, informative, or inspirational rather than depressive., Our surroundings can have a big influence on our moods and with a few simple changes you can create a happy, vibrant space that can help combat the lonely blues.Surround yourself with bright colors. Give your room a fresh coat of pain in a bright happy color, like sunny yellow or minty green. Try to add some color into your wardrobe, too. If you dress happy, you just might feel happier!Get some flowers or plants to cheer-up your house. Caring for living plants can be a great hobby and add instant ""life"" to your home. You can also treat yourself to some fresh cut flowers, especially those that are connected to specific emotions (for example: yellow carnations are thought to symbolize cheerfulness)., Traveling on your own to a place you’ve always wanted to visit can be exciting. Best of all, you don’t have to negotiate another person and their quirks -- like wanting to stop at an attraction you don’t care for, or not wanting to fly., Studies have shown that mindful living, or focusing on the present moment, can help you overcome loneliness and find more self-satisfaction.Focus on the present moment and leave the past to the past so that you can enjoy where you are, and who you are, in life right now.Don't hold on to past relationships or ""failures."" Accept the fact that you can't change the past. Instead, you have the opportunity to move ahead into a new, better phase of life.
Slow down and take your time doing daily activities. Smell the roses, both literally and figuratively!Don't worry about the future. Have hopes, dreams, and aspirations, but don't let your thoughts of the future turn into negative fears or worries that detract from your present day., Being in a relationship with someone isn't easy, and sometimes people in couples can be even lonelier than singletons., During your solo time, think about what you want from your friends, family, and other relationships in the future.


Think about the qualities or attributes that you enjoy in another person and that enrich your life. It’s okay to have high standards for your next relationship!
Don’t rule out being open to something new, though, and consider going for someone who you wouldn't usually go for when the time feels right.
Remember that it’s way better to be happy and single than in a bad relationship.

, The right person will come into your life when you are least expecting it but are most ready for it. Enjoy your daily life with yourself now rather than focusing on finding someone immediately.

, Be happy and content within yourself and never think that you are not worthy because you are not in a relationship, or that you're a ""loser"" for feeling lonely. Neither of these are true! Instead, remind yourself to look on the bright side of life, and that there's a lot of good things to be gained in moments of singleness and solitude.

Search the Internet.,
Contact hotels.,
View the apartment.,
Check your credit.,
Ask if you can forego a security deposit.,
Get a roommate, if necessary.",How to Find a Home After Divorce with Limited Finances1," Looking for cheap rental options is a little like searching for a needle in a haystack. However, there are cheap apartment rentals out there. Check websites such as Rent.com. A studio or a bedroom in someone’s house will probably be the cheapest to rent.

You might need a small place at first—really small. In expensive cities, you might get a 100 square foot micro-studio for under $1,000.Also consider apartments in slightly shady neighborhoods. Check neighborhood crime rates at www.neighborhoodscout.com. Remember that your first home after a divorce doesn’t need to be your permanent home.;
, You might only need a temporary place to stay, e.g., for a month or so. In some countries, such as Canada, a lease must be for at least 12 months.Your only option for short-term housing might be to stay in a hotel or motel.

Many national chains have extended-stay hotels. Call and ask about rates.
Renting a hotel this way is more expensive than renting an apartment. However, it’s more convenient if you need short-term housing.

, Call up the landlord and ask to see the place. No matter how desperate you are, you shouldn’t rent a place without first viewing it. Some cheap apartments are unsanitary and unsafe.

Make sure the apartment is close to work or accessible by public transportation.
Check your cell phone reception.You can save money if you just use your cell phone and skip the landline.
Also confirm that there is enough water pressure. Flush the toilet and turn on the taps.

, More and more landlords are looking at people’s credit history before deciding to rent to them. Pull your credit score and credit history. If your score is low, try to clean up your credit history quickly.

There may be errors on your credit history that are pulling down your score. For example, your ex-spouse’s debts might show up on your credit report, or accounts might wrongly be listed as in default. Dispute any credit report errors. It usually takes a couple months for inaccurate information to come off.

, Landlords typically want a month’s rent as a security deposit to protect them in case you damage the apartment or skip out before the end of the lease.If you have good credit or a long rental history, you can ask the landlord if you can rent without paying a deposit.

If necessary, check whether you can put your rent on a credit card. It’s not an ideal solution, but it will help you get a roof over your head. You can pay the credit balance down once you get re-established.

, Any apartment is cheaper if you have someone splitting the bills. You can advertise for a roommate on websites such as Craigslist, though it is better if you know the person already. Confirm that the lease allows you to have a roommate, because not all leases do.If you have to advertise, ask any potential roommate for references and one month’s security deposit.
Be very clear about your expectations regarding cleanliness and having guests over.

If you plan on going to a barbeque, ask her if she wants to hang out there. Enjoy yourself regardless of whether she comes along or not.


Say, “Hey, I’m going to this cookout tomorrow if you want to stop by.”
Say, “A bunch of us are going to try this new restaurant if you want to try it too.”;
, You don't need to make lengthy conversations or stumble over words if you see the girl you want to hang out with in public. A simple “Hey” or “Hello” so she knows you notice her is the perfect way to play it cool. Make eye contact and say “Hey”, when you pass her or you’re in the same room., Open-ended invitations don’t tie you to a specific time frame or activity and are a great way see how likely a girl is to accept more specific invitations. Keep it brief and don’t overthink it. Then, look at the girl’s reaction to see how interested she is in hanging out. Plan the invitation around a group activity, if you’re still deciding whether you just want to be friends.


Say, “Do you wanna grab lunch sometime?”
Say, in a group setting “We should all get together soon.”, People like to hang out with happy people they perceive as fun, because who wants to hang out and not have fun? Smile when you ask the girl you want to hang out with to do something. Talk about positive things and keep the conversation light., An easy way to start hanging out with a girl is by introducing her to your existing group of friends. Determine if she has things in common with you and your friends by making chit-chat and asking about her interests. If it seems like everyone shares common ground, invite her along to your next group outing. Say:


“We’re all going out tonight if you want to join us.”
“My friends and I are going to see that new movie. We’d love for you to come too.”
“Hey, we’re cooking out tomorrow. Do you want to stop by?”

, Plan something the girl you’re interested in likes too, so the more likely it is she’ll hang out. Make small talk and be observant when you interact with her to find out about the things she likes. If you both like basketball, invite her and at least 3 to 4 more friends to watch the next big game. Start talking about some of the things you like to do in order to start asking her about what she likes.


Say, ""I can't wait to get on a boat! Have you been to the lake yet this season?""
Say, ""My video game skills are hurting. I have to practice. Are you a gamer?""
Say, ""Soccer is a high-energy sport. Do you like watching it?""

, Whatever girl you want to hang out with will appreciate a venue that is convenient for her to get to. Find out the areas she frequents and ask her to hang out when you’re nearby with mutual friends or acquaintances. Ask her what she likes to do on the weekends to get more of an idea of where she hangs out. You can also ask something along these lines:


""Midtown has such cool shops and restaurants. Have you been down there?""
""Have you been downtown lately? They have some really good bands that play on the weekend.""
""I went hiking a while back and got so sore. Have you been to the state park south of here?""

, Once you’ve tested to see how interested a girl is in hanging out by making open-ended invitations, you may be ready to make specific plans. Ask her to hang out at a certain time doing a certain activity. Never pressure her to make a decision, but try to make specific plans. Say:


“Do you want to go to this concert next weekend?”
“How about lunch tomorrow?”
“Wanna go to the football game on Wednesday?”

, Trying to make spontaneous plans can seem like added pressure, but since they’re so last minute, the sting of rejection may be lessened. It’s totally understandable if someone can’t drop what they’re doing to hang out. Strike up a conversation with the girl you want to hang out with and say something like:


“Do you want to grab some coffee?”
“Hey, are you hungry? I was about to grab a bite to eat. Do you want to go with?”
“The weather is awesome! Let’s go for a bike ride!”

, If you really want to hang out with a girl, you should make the process as simple for her as possible. She could have a busy schedule, so give her choices on times, days and things-to-do. Tell her about something you’d like to do that sounds cool and talk about different days you could get together. Vary the activities you suggest in case she wants to do one thing more than the other. Say:


""This new movie looks so funny. Could you watch it Thursday or Saturday? There's another good movie coming out too, I think.""
""A street festival is going on next weekend, but I think some food trucks are going to be at the art's district this weekend.""
""My favorite band is coming to town next month! There's a new sushi spot opening soon too.""

Leave when asked.",How to Find a Home After Divorce with Limited Finances2," Don’t show up at someone’s doorstep with a suitcase, but call ahead of time. Ask if you can stay with them for a little bit. Give them a deadline when you anticipate moving out.

For example, you can say, “Mom, I need to come home. Is that okay? I’ve only got a few hundred saved. But if I can stay with you for two or three months, I’ll be back on my feet.”

, You can’t sleep on someone’s couch forever, so cut all unnecessary expenses and take on a part-time job if possible. Build up enough money to afford a security deposit on a small apartment.

A part-time job might be ideal since it will keep you out of the house. Check Craigslist for part-time gigs such as dog walker, Uber driver, or bartender., People are doing you a huge favor by letting you crash with them for a little while. Make things easy on your host by keeping your space clean, not making noise, and being respectful when your host has guests.Wash dishes or prepare meals without asking. This will relieve your host’s stress.
Avoid draining your friend’s electricity by charging up your computer and phone on their dime. Instead, find a public café or recharge while at work.
Keep complaints to yourself. Do you think the sheets are scratchy? Consider yourself lucky to have a place to stay., Your friends might have rules that seem weird to you. That’s not the point. You need to follow them if you don’t want to get kicked out. Ask about anything that seems unclear.Some rules are unspoken. Pay attention to your host’s habits. For example, if they only watch TV with the volume down low, do the same.

, You should prepare your own meals so that your host doesn’t feel like they have to wait on you.Ask your friend where the nearest grocery store is and load up on food. Make sure there’s enough room in the refrigerator., You can build goodwill by volunteering to buy food or paying other bills. For example, pick up a large pizza on your way home from work and invite your host to share., Someone might need you to leave before you want to. Gather your things and thank them. Then call up other family or friends to find a place to stay.

Remember to clean up after yourself. Remove any trash and wash the sheets or vacuum the sofa you slept on. Don’t leave anything behind."

If you have no money, you might be best off sitting tight until you’ve managed to save up enough for an apartment. Of course, you’ll need your ex spouse’s permission—especially if they were given the house in the divorce decree.

If your ex doesn’t want you in the house, volunteer to stay in the garage or in a guest house.
Staying in the house isn’t an option if there’s been any history of domestic violence, or if there is a restraining order against you., You should split shared costs, such as property taxes, insurance, electricity and—if you can afford it—the mortgage. Sit down with your spouse and talk about what you will contribute.If you don’t have any money, volunteer to do things around the house. You can cook all meals, make repairs, and clean.

, Try to limit contact as much as possible. Staying in the house will be uncomfortable for everybody, but a detailed routine can make things easier. If your ex thrives on conflict, then limiting contact will be beneficial.For example, you might get up an hour earlier than your ex and come back home an hour earlier. Schedule when you’ll use the bathroom and the kitchen.

, You might have been a slob while married, but now you need to clean up after yourself. Become the ideal roommate. Follow these rules:Wash your own dishes.

Assess your current financial status.,
Tally up your monthly expenses.,
Start saving.,
Make a plan for paying off your debt.,
Keep a watchful eye on all of your bank accounts.",How to Create a Budget for a Single Woman,"


Start by looking at all of your bank account balances as well as getting a handle on how much debt you owe. Remember to include things such as credit cards, student loans and car loans in your assessment. It is also important to make note of how much money you may have in stocks, retirement accounts and any other fund, whether the account is liquid or not.;
,


Make a list of your total bills on any given month. If you haven't been saving your bills, you can go online to view your bank statements on the bank's website. There, you will be able to determine, on average, how much you spend on utilities such as gasoline, water, electricity, cable, Internet and phone, as well as other loan payments or deductions you make every month. At the same time, you should also take note of how much you spend each month, on average, on entertainment, shopping, groceries and other amounts that may not be the same every month, but can make up a large portion of your monthly spending for a single woman. From here, you can adjust accordingly and set a limit for yourself to spend in each of the categories to keep your spending under control.

,


Every single woman's finances should include a savings account. Open one if you don't already have one and start transferring money to. Your savings account should be off limits and be reserved for large, necessary purchases or for emergencies. While you should have money saved in other untouchable accounts such as a 401K or an IRA, it is important to have an account that is accessible in case you should fall on hard times. Financial experts recommend having at least 3-6 months of your salary in a savings account.

,


Determine how much money you can afford to put toward your debt every month. After you have counted up the amount of money you have to spend each month on the necessities, set a reasonable amount aside to put toward your debt. While you are only required to pay the minimum on credit cards and loans, making larger payments will reduce interest payments and the savings will be well worth it in the end.

,


You should know how much money you have in the bank at any given time so there are no surprises. This will also encourage you to make adjustments to your monthly budget if you find you have less in your account then you expected.

Familiarize yourself with your company’s fraternization policies.,
Weigh the pros and cons.,
Don’t confuse work place solidarity with desire or love.,
Have an exit strategy.",How to Ask a Co Worker for a One Night Stand1," Many companies have a zero-tolerance policy for interoffice romance. Make a point to familiarize yourself with written policies on fraternization. Your Human Resources department has these policies on file. , Consider your future goals and be clear to yourself about what your job means to you. If you are uncomfortable with the possibility that this rendezvous could end up negatively affecting your career, then it probably is not a good idea to pursue a one night stand with a coworker. Pros may include: having a one night stand with a person you're familiar with because you work together, having at least one thing in common (work) with the partner for the one night stand, and the exciting, “forbidden” nature of the affair.
Some cons could be: one of you could end up being fired, things could become awkward at work between the two of you, work place gossip may spread, and your reputation might be tarnished.

, Do not pursue the affair in order to escape your day-to-day work struggles. Today, many people are unsatisfied with their jobs, but this does not mean you should sleep with your co-worker who happens to sympathize with you; do not confuse sympathy with love or desire. Sympathy is an understanding or common feeling between people, generally in a negative context. For example, you can sympathize with someone who you do not even know because you share a common negative experience.Love is an intense feeling of affection or desire, where you want to get to know a person on a more intimate level.

, If you do decide to pursue the affair, know your game plan. Consider the worst case scenario, and have an exit strategy if things go south. Think about whether you would be willing to quit your job, and have a possible back-up in case things end up badly. Before the one-night stand, you can prepare your exit strategy by doing the following:


Make sure your resume, website, or work portfolio is up to date.
Contact colleagues and people you know from previous jobs for references and recommendations.
Look into the company’s other departments or job banks online to see if there are job openings you can apply to, or register with a temp agency.

Ensure your coworker is interested.,
Be discreet.,
Move slowly.",How to Ask a Co Worker for a One Night Stand2," Don’t just ask any coworker. Ensure they are interested by reading their body language. If they are giving you signals that they may be interested in you, then proceed.


These signals can be direct, like maintaining eye contact, smiling, or touching you while they speak. Or, they can be indirect, like touching their hair, neck, or face while talking to you.
If they adopt closed body language, for example, turning away from you, avoiding eye contact, or any contact at all, then chances are they are not interested.
If you are truly unsure if your coworker is interested, do not fret. You can try more direct contact like asking for their phone number to see how they react. Or, you could try telling them a joke to see if they laugh, and perhaps a conversation could start from there.

, Make your advances confidential. This will gain your coworker’s trust and increase your rate of success.


Do not make any big moves at the office, like being overly flirty, or suggesting you do something during work hours or at the office. This will likely scare them away.

, Before you attempt to ask them, get to know them first. Try to find things you have in common with your coworker besides work. Ask them about their hobbies or what they like to do on the weekend.
Ask them what their favorite foods are, or ask them about the different places they have traveled to or would like to travel to.

"
"
Bring up the topic.,
Be honest with your coworker.,
Arrange a time and place to meet.",How to Ask a Co Worker for a One Night Stand3," Once you have gauged the interest of your coworker and you have developed a basic level of camaraderie, you can attempt to bring up the topic of the one-night stand.


Your opening line could go something like this: “Hey, I really like talking with you. Would you like to take this conversation back to my place?”
You can be more straightforward and ask, “Would you be interested in sleeping/having sex with me?”

, Be clear about what you want out of the affair. If it is simply a one-night stand that you are interested in, or if you are willing to consider the possibility of something more, be upfront about it. Let the person know your feelings and how you see the relationship developing in the future. An example of how you can approach this is by saying, “Before we go through with this, I would like to be clear about my feelings and expectations.”
This is also the time where you should discuss with your coworker privacy issues such disclosing details with other coworkers and posting things on Facebook about the affair.

, Once you have gotten to know your coworker and you are sure they are interested, arrange to meet them somewhere after work or on the weekend. To ensure privacy and your chances of success, meet at a bar or restaurant that you know your other coworkers do not frequent.

"
"
Stay professional.,
Do not kiss and tell.,
Manage the situation.,
Be upfront yet professional if your boss finds out.",How to Ask a Co Worker for a One Night Stand4," Maintain your regular office routines and be cautious about how you behave around other coworkers. While at work, do not go out of your way to be overly attentive or nice to your “special” coworker. Do not openly flirt with your coworker as this can cause suspicion among other coworkers.
Do not email or instant message your coworker at work about the encounter or personal matters. Limit your conversations to strictly business matters.

, Agree to keep things secret by not telling other coworkers about the affair. If you have to tell someone about the affair, make sure it is a friend who has no connection to your work place.


One of the biggest mistakes you can make here is by posting about the affair on Facebook. Remember, once something is on Facebook, it is hard to take it back., If caught while trying to keep things secret, be prepared to deal with backlash. Have a risk management strategy by thinking ahead about how to mitigate, minimize, and/or manage the situation.


Log more hours at the office.
Take on new responsibilities and projects.
Be proactive about promoting your accomplishments.

, If your boss confronts you about the situation, do not lie about it. Own up to it and offer valid solutions. If it was a one-time thing, let your boss know it is over. If it has developed into something more serious, don’t offer to end the affair but do let your boss know that you are sorry that they did not hear it from you first. "

Forgive yourself.",How to Apologize to Someone You Made Mad," Immediately after a fight or problem occurs, emotions tend to be the highest, but you cannot offer a truly sincere apology unless you have a full understanding of what you did that was wrong. This will prevent you from apologizing for something that you don’t mean and will also help you begin the process of self-improvement.


Be sure to take responsibility for your role in the argument. How you apologize will depend on how you may have wronged the person. For example, you may want to compensate your friend monetarily or by finding another way to correct your mistake along with apologizing for it.
Write a list of every reason your friend could possibly be upset.Meditation can also be helpful. After an argument, your mind can be in a frenzy. Take a few moments to quiet your thoughts. Sit in your room in silence and close your eyes. Think about the problem that occurred and your role in it. This will provide you greater clarity on the issue.;
, Sometimes, merely thinking about the issue is not enough. Get out your journal and write out your feelings including, how you feel about your friend, yourself, and the fight. This can help you gather your thoughts in an organized and constructive way.In addition to writing these lists, you could also consider writing a poem or a song to express your feelings.

, Sometimes, the greatest clarity can be provided by those who are outside of the situation. Parents and grandparents often have greater wisdom from all of their life experiences and have very likely encountered a similar situation. They will be able to give you insight on how to apologize and rectify the situation.


You might say something to them like “Me and my friend just got into a fight and I was wrong and want to apologize. Do you have any advice on how to fix it?”
They will also be able to provide you greater insight about yourself. Perhaps they have noticed that you have a tendency to be hotheaded, and your fight with your friend was rooted in this particular behavior of yours. Take the time to listen to those older and wiser than you to gain perspective about yourself so that you can improve.

, In preparing for a truly genuine apology, consider the situation from your friend’s perspective. There is a tendency in arguments to be very “me” focused, but this is never helpful in restoring and improving your relationship. Instead, focus on how you friend might be feeling and respond to those feelings when you apologize.For example, if you lost your friend’s favorite pair of shoes, they are likely not only just upset, but may also feel that they can’t trust you any longer with their things. When you apologize, you should acknowledge that your friend may not trust you anymore but that you intend to restore that trust and be dependable in the future.

, It is important that in considering this issue in your relationship that you don’t think of it as an isolated incident. Often times, indicators of problems exist before the problem ever actually occurs. Take some time to reflect on the events that built up to this situation and how it could have been prevented. This can also be helpful when you apologize as you will need to not only apologize for this last incident but for your role in what led up to it as well, especially if you have done something similar to them in the past.


For instance, if your friend is mad at you for telling one of their secrets, think back on if you have ever gossiped about others before. Telling other people’s business is a gateway to doing that to someone that you love.

, Now that you have thought fully about the issue and what you did wrong, it’s time to reach out to your friend to talk. These conversations are best to be had in person, but you may find that your friend is not ready for this talk yet, which is understandable. Ask them a time that is good for them and also offer talking on the phone as an option.


Call them or send them a text and say “I want you to know that I regret what I’ve done and I’m so sorry. I’ve thought a lot about what I’ve done and I would really like if we could meet up to talk.”

, After all of the self-reflection that you’ve done, you should be prepared to articulate exactly what you have done wrong. Tell your friend what you wish you hadn’t done and be very specific with them. Vague apologies often feel insincere and poorly thought out. Your friend will appreciate much more if you offer a very specific acknowledgement of what you did wrong.
You might say something like “I am sorry for calling you that name. It was rude of me to do and I did not mean it.”

, Even in an apology, there is a still the human deserve to self-preserve. Instead of being defensive, admit all of the ways that you were wrong without backtracking. This will help the apology go more smoothly. Be as honest as possible.Many fall victim to playing “tit for tat” with their friend, by saying things like “Well, if you hadn’t done this then I wouldn’t have done that.” This will reverse any apology that you have offered and will immediately make your friend upset all over again.

, Even if you feel that you have some justification for what you did, this does not negate the fact that you hurt someone close to you. At a later point, your friend may ask you why you did what you did, and at that time, you can offer them your rationale. However, in the moment of an apology, justifying why you did something bad is only hurtful and will likely prolong the fight.Do not try to explain yourself. Keep it simple and move on.
Don’t offer excuses. Making excuses for hurting someone is never helpful during an apology and is only a mechanism for blame-shifting. Accept the blame for what you have done and keep it moving.

, In addition to making excuses and being defensive, there are other mistakes that you can make in apologizing. Some of these include saying things like “I’m sorry you felt that way”, “I’m sorry you’re so easily upset” and “I never mean to hurt you”. These false forms of apologizing give partial responsibility to the injured party for what happened and can feel very insincere in the moment. Avoid making these statements at all cost and instead apologize directly for what YOU have done.


An example of an appropriate apology is “I’m sorry for leaving you at the party without asking you if you if you wanted to go. We went there together and I should have talked to you before leaving alone. I apologize for that.”

, Though you have reflected on the issued on and yourself, you still may not be fully aware of their issue with you. Take some time during this conversation to truly listen to the ways in which you have hurt them. This last incident could just have been the last straw for them, but there could have been other times that you were rude to them that you haven’t considered.


Ask if there is any way you can make it up to them in the future, or if there is anything you can do to prevent something similar from happening again.
Apologize for the ways you have hurt them apart from this latest issue. Think critically about what they are saying to you so that you don’t apologize just to end the conversation. Make sure that any “I’m sorry” you offer is genuine.

, When having this conversation in person, be sure to practice open and positive body language. Simple techniques like leaving your arms and legs uncrossed are great ways to express openness and to demonstrate body language that is relaxed and calm.Also, look at them in the eyes when they are speaking, but break your gaze every so often to look around. No one likes to be stared at but people also want to feel that you are paying attention to them.

, Once you feel that the conversation between the two of you has reached a level of mutual understanding and positivity, re-offer your friendship to them. This can be a great way to move forward from the conversation and remind them that you do still want to be friends.


You might say something like “Again, I just wanted to reiterate that I am so sorry for hurting you and that it won’t happen again. However, I don’t want this situation to define us. Would you consider being my friend again?
Though they are likely to accept, be understanding if they don’t. They are within their rights to refuse friendship with you especially if you have done something very bad to them.

, You may find that you friend does not want to speak to you in person or on the phone, and you must respect their decision. However, this does not mean that you should avoid apologizing. Take some time to write them a heartfelt letter acknowledging what you have done, apologizing for it, and offering solutions to repair your friendship. You can either mail them the letter or leave it in their locker if you are classmates.

, If you broke something of theirs or took something from them and lost it, you should do all that you can to purchase a new one for them. Some things cannot be replaced like family heirlooms, but if it can, you should do all in your power to replace it.


If necessary, ask you parents to borrow money so that you can buy for them what you broke or lost.
You can also get a part time or temporary job to earn enough money to buy it yourself. Your friend will respect you all the more for it and you will be able to set right the wrong that you made.

, Even if the conversation went well, you may find that your friend still needs some time to think, and perhaps you do as well. Respect your friend enough to give them the time that they need to process and they will likely come back around to you soon.


Avoid being clingy or smothering them. They will return to you in their own time and your friendship will be the better for it.

, Take the issues your friend discussed with you in your conversation to heart to prevent having fights in the future and to reestablish the trust between the two of you. Be careful to not repeat old mistakes again, but to learn from them instead and move forward.For example, if you know they get upset when you take their things without asking, then be very sure to not do that in the future.
Also, if there are any things you need to work on to improve yourself, begin that process. For instance, if you are very forgetful and regularly forget plans with your friend, then invest in a planner or use your phone to set reminders for you. Being proactive will help to rebuild your friend’s trust in you by showing them that you are taking concrete steps to avoid a similar situation.

, During your apology, you very likely made certain promises to your friend that you would either avoid rude behavior or begin doing things differently in the future. In renewing your friendship with this person, it is important that you keep and continue to keep these promises that you made not only to avoid an argument but to preserve your friendship for the long haul., Take some time with your friend to reflect on the great memories that you have shared with one another. This would be a great time to bring out your photo album or look at your mutual photos on social media. Sit and reminisce with your friend to remind each other of these times and the good times to come.


You can even try using a little humor to lighten up the situation and reconnect with the person after making an apology.

, In addition to reflecting, go out and recreate those fun memories! If you and your friend love to go to the beach, play sports, or go out to the movies, do all of those things again. This is a great way to remind each other of why you became friends in the first place and to move on from your fight.

, In focusing on getting your friend to forgive you, it can be easy to be consumed with guilt over your actions. However, if you know that you have done all in your power to make amends with this person, it is time to make amends with yourself, too. Beating yourself about something won’t improve the situation, but will likely make it worse. Forgive yourself!"

If you don’t like someone’s customs, but it doesn’t affect you or harm anyone, keep your opinion to yourself.
If you really can’t get along with someone, just walk away and reflect on your interaction. Revisit it later with a different person.

, While customs, traditions, and important religious figures might differ, many religions share the same moral standards, tenets, and even sacred texts and holy sites. Find common ground and appreciate things that are similar, like the virtues of nonviolence, treating others with respect, and tolerance.


Judaism and Christianity use some of the same religious texts and both share the laws of the 10 Commandments.Islam, Judaism, and Christianity share holy sites in Israel and Palestine.Hinduism and Buddhism both share origins from India and have some similar beliefs, like the belief in reincarnation., Interrupting another religion’s customs or rituals is a huge sign of disrespect, and could make people very mad.

You can find most historical information on these religions online or at a local library.
It may be hard to research all five at once, so start with one you’re unfamiliar with and slowly move on to learn the rest over time.
Islam, Christianity, and Judaism were derived in the Middle East while Hinduism and Buddhism were founded in India.The age of each religion varies drastically in some cases. Hinduism is the oldest known religion that's still practiced and has been developed in India since 1500 BCE., Religious texts exist as standards and practices for major religions, and are great sources to better understand most belief systems. While your personal belief may lie elsewhere, reading and comprehending the texts will give you a better appreciation for other religions.

Focus on how your belief defines interactions with others.,
Consider the message you send to younger generations.",How to Appreciate People of Other Religions4," When you do not appreciate another group of people, it’s very easy to forget that regardless of belief, everyone shares a commonality in having emotions and desires. Don’t dehumanize another group of people, and if they are suffering, have compassion for them just as you would a family member or friend.


People of other religions also have families and friends and want the best for them. They might enjoy sports, or love the family dog, or get irritated with Grandma sometimes. Each person has many facets, and religion is just one side of who they are.
Recognizing that you, too, are much more than your religion may help you to think larger and apply that same concept to other individuals who may have a different religion.

Buddhism teaches you to treat everyone just as you would treat those that are close to you, like family or friends.The Bible teaches to “Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.”, We are shaping the world everyday, and our actions have reverberating effects. Think about the legacy that you are leaving behind, and whether it will be filled with hate and prejudice, or love and acceptance, and how that will affect the world after you’re gone.

Establish eye contact.,
Listen to her body language.,
Make small talk.,
Use your environment.,
Listen and ask questions.,
Get her information.,
Decide to try harder or walk away.,
Learn that rejection is ok. ""No"", ""no thank you,"" or ""bye"" do not mean your day or night is over.,
Move on to another lady.",How to Approach a Lady," Fear is our biggest hindrance; it makes the easiest tasks and simplest actions seem impossible. Talking to a lady can be easy, and your fear is tricking you into believing a worst-case scenario that is unlikely. Most women will be flattered by your approach, so taking action can work in your favor.The chances of getting slapped, scolded, ridiculed by her friends, or any other scenario are extremely rare.;
, When we get in our own heads, we avoid being out going and linger on being nervous. Focusing on something such as telling yourself ""don't be nervous"" would only make you feel worse. Instead, learn to recognize the physical symptoms of being nervous; then, you'll be able to gain control over them. When our heart races and our breathes become short, stop and control your breathing pattern. To relax, breathe in for about three to four seconds and release the breathe for the same amount of time. Doing this for a few minutes will ease your body from anxious nerves., Being positive and confident are not innate; they can be learned.Focus on the better outcomes; we shouldn't try things to fail--we choose them for success. Imagine the worthwhile outcomes when you talk to a women at the mall or in line at the bistro counter. You are only a few words away from a phone number, a date, or a story to tell.

, If you are communicating with someone, non-verbal cues will send the first message, and when you speak to a lady for the first time, send a signal of intrigue before saying a word. Make some changes in your body language that say you are open, inviting, and confident.


Use a strong posture. Shoulders back and chest out demonstrates a confident stance.
Smile. People who have a good time smile, and the more you smile, the more you'll feel better about every situation.
Make eye contact. Meeting eyes with whomever you speak with projects confidence.
Leave your hands out of your pockets. No need to constantly check your cellphone; that will only create more nervous feelings.

, Looking good means feeling good, so don't ignore taking care of yourself. Keep up with practical grooming habits such as regular haircuts, facial hair trimming, and cleaning up before heading out. Moreover, maintain a nice wardrobe, which could mean occasionally buying some new articles of clothing.When it comes to meeting someone new, attraction is key.

, If you are in close enough proximity, don't assume a lady has taken notice of you. Instead, keep in mind that surprising a lady is not the best way to first approach her. If she looks your way and your eyes connect, return with a smile, a friendly signal that will work well in your favor.

, Even though you may be observant, men commonly miss important cues from ladies. You want to approach a lady who wants to be approached. If her interest is in her friends or her cell phone, then, rejection is imminent. Look for the ones who are standing with open postures and glancing around the area.

, Start off with saying ""Hi,"" ""Hello,"" or ""Hey."" All these options are great openers and usually invite a direct response with some intrigue.


Keep in mind, if you approach a lady in a group situation, you are interrupting them with a simple ""hey,"" so have a follow up ready once you insert yourself. , A good conversation can start from what is right around you. If you are trying to approach a lady in a coffee shop, ask her what she's drinking or what she would recommend. If you approach a lady at a club, ask her if she knows when the place really gets crowded.Anyplace you can approach a lady has potential for immediate common grounds and interest.

, A good conversation goes a long way, and for women, it is a way to emotionally connect.Pay attention to what she has to say, and as you listen, think of follow up questions. It will make the conversation flow.

, Once getting to approach women becomes easier and more fun, take it a step further. If she interests you, ask her for a phone number, an email address, or any other way to contact her. This will achieve two great things. You will flatter her better than any compliment you can say, and this will make you feel much more confident about approaching a lady.

, Playing hard to get is real, but so is disinterest. Trying to figure out between the two with in a few minutes can be difficult. Approaching a lady demonstrates you are interested in her. No need to overstate it with unnecessary persistence. Your evening is filled with choices. You choosing to approach her should be as easy as choosing to walk away.

, If you have a goal of talking to multiple ladies in a given evening, then, rejection will happen. Keep in mind, however, that after you approach one lady, there will be another.Denial is not an invitation to be hard on yourself. Celebrities and ladies-men face rejection all the time.

, Chances are other women watched what you were doing, and being the guy who approaches people respectfully, smiles constantly, and converses well with others is attractive. Your actions will construct a confident vibe, so approach another lady, and build your allure.

Know your friends and their current situations.,
Check in on your friends.,
Observe body language.,
Remember your friends' complaints.,
Put all the clues together.,
Make sure you're not overbearing.",How to Anticipate Others' Needs1," Maybe one of your friends had just lost her dog. Maybe another one of your friends is in the process of moving. Maybe someone is just really stressed with school. If you know what each of your friends are going through, you'll have some ideas of the support they will need.


To take it a step further, you can research how to respond to each situation. If one of your friends has just found out her parents are getting a divorce, you can look up ways to support someone whose parents are going through a divorce.;
, Ask them how they are doing every morning you see them and scan their facial expressions periodically. This will tell you if they are content or upset.


Don't mistake boredom or just resting face for unhappiness. You may want to research facial expressions before trying this.

, You can often tell if someone is unhappy or needs something by the way they act. Sometimes it's obvious. If they are tearfully trying to carry a large stack of textbooks and finish the homework they procrastinated on at the same time, they obviously could use a bit of help. Sometimes it may not be as obvious, however. Not eating much lunch could be a sign something is wrong, but you'll need to be observant to notice those kinds of details.


Some details you could notice throughout the day. Rapid blinking, followed a few hours later by sitting staring into space, could signify that your friend is tired.

, If your friend complained earlier in the morning that she forgot money for lunch, then you see her later looking sick, you'll immediately know what she needs: lunch money. If your friend complains that his mom has been working long hours at the office and you later see him hanging around after school, it's obvious he needs a ride home.

, Combine your knowledge of your friends' current situations, their current well-being, their body language and actions, and earlier complaints to make an educated guess what's bugging them and what you can do to help. If all else fails, you can just ask.

, Your friends wil all get annoyed if you're constantly breathing down their necks, asking if they're okay and trying to offer them things they don't need. If you do it at the right times though, everyone will love having you around- and you'll love the smiles you cause.

Leave trash around the room.,
Cross into their side of the room.,
Open windows while the heat is on.,
Keep the door unlocked.,
Avoid taking the trash out.,
Leave dishes in the sink.",How to Annoy Your Roommate1," First of all, this will make your room smell bad. Secondly, it’ll attract flies, ants, and other bugs, which will gross your roommate out. She will now be forced to clean up your mess or will leave it there, and it will annoy her.


Avoid leaving anything you might also find gross. Try small things like candy wrappers, pop cans, or receipts.;
, Roommates who don’t get along have clear sides of the room. Use this to your advantage by subtly crossing it with your possessions. Leave your textbooks, clothing, or other possessions in their side of the room.


Leave your dirty clothes all over the room. The clutter of the clothes will get on her nerves.

, If you live in a place that gets cold, you’ll know how important it is to keep your house warm. One way to really get on somebody’s nerves is by abusing the heating of your room. Before you leave the house, open a window or two, then your roommate will be greeted by a draft and frustration., Certain people are very particular about the keeping the door locked. If you live with someone who is very protective of her stuff, leave the door or even just the back door unlocked.Some people cannot do this because their doors lock when shut.


You also risk having your stuff stolen when you leave the door unlocked.
It also may not be worth it if something belonging to your roommate actually gets stolen.

, Nobody likes to live with someone who doesn’t do their share of chores.Even a messy person can become annoyed by a build up in trash. Eventually your place will start to smell.


Again this may end up frustrating yourself more than your roommate. It might not be worth it to live uncomfortably.

, This is another simple chore that everyone can get lazy about doing. A build up in dirty dishes is sure to annoy the most peaceful of roommates.This could potentially backfire if your roommate decides to wash her silverware as she uses it. Then you’re left with all your dirty silverware in the sink, waiting to collect mold.


Add an extra supply of plates and silverware for a higher build up in dirty dishes.

Be cautious.,
Observe body language.,
Try to eavesdrop.,
Approach the person with caution.,
With the person's permission, help them with what they need.,
Don't be a creep.",How to Anticipate Others' Needs2," Do not approach strangers alone. If you're going to approach a stranger, do it in a place where there are a lot of people around and preferably with a friend. You don't know what these strangers could do to you.


If you're approaching a small child, approach them in a way that they feel safe as well.

, If the person you are looking at is laughing or smiling, then obviously they don't need anything. A head buried in the arms, slumped shoulders, or (mostly for small children) crying all signal that the person is unhappy and in need of something.

, If the person you are observing is having a conversation, try to listen in to get a hint about what they need. To do this, take a seat near them, maybe a table over. Appear to be doing something normal, like eating or reading a book, and listen to the person talk. Try to find out what their problem is.

, Ask them if they are okay and if you can help them with anything. You can gently bring up one of your past observations, saying something like:


Are you okay? You look a little sick.
I thought I heard you say you lost your wallet. Would you like some help finding it?

, The exception to this is if they are a total creep, in which case you should politely excuse yourself from the conversation, or if they are a small child who is lost. In that case, they obviously need help and it is up to you to help them.

, It's fine to be a friendly stranger lending a helping hand, but you'll appear creepy if you're staring at people, butting into their conversations, and trying to help everyone who walks by.

Know the sticky situations your friends often get into.,
Prepare for your friends' material needs.,
Come up with ways to help your friends that get into non-material situations.,
When one of your friends looks distressed, ask what's wrong.",How to Anticipate Others' Needs3," Make a list so you remember. Maybe one of your friends always forgets her lunch. Maybe another one of your friends is a procrastinator. Maybe one of your friends gets anxious in crowds. Write all of this down.

, If you go to school, you'll have a backpack to put everything in. If you're preparing for your friend's needs outside of school, get a bag to put everything in. First pack the things each friend will specifically need. For example, photocopies of those important papers for your forgetful friend, a jacket for the friend that's always cold, paper for your procrastinator friend. Then pack generic things:


Snacks
Money
A cell phone
Pads or tampons (if you're a girl)

, If one of your friends gets anxious in crowds, come up with ways to excuse him/her from group situations. If one of your friends falls asleep in class, be prepared to kick them under the table ever so often.

, When they tell you, get what they need from the bag you packed or do what you have been preparing to do. Then when you get home, refill your bag.

Use your roommate’s bathroom supplies.,
Eat her food and drink her drinks.,
Wear her clothes.,
Rearrange her stuff while she’s gone.",How to Annoy Your Roommate2," This includes her grooming products, such as make-up, hair products, shampoo, shaving gel, hairbrush, and toothbrush.If your roommate is a girl, try on her make-up and use a lot of it while she's gone. Find the one thing she uses on a daily basis and use it ever so subtly. The best way to annoy a roommate is to let things subtly build up over time.


If your roommate is a boy, use up his shaving gel, aftershave, or deodorant.

, Every once in awhile pop open one of her cans of pop and start eating some of her chips. It doesn’t matter if she is home or not. Sooner or later your roommate will start to notice her food and drinks are disappearing.If you do eat her food in front of you, be prepared to be confronted by her.
Some roommates are okay with sharing food and wouldn’t be bothered by this.

, When she is out of the house go through her wardrobe and try on some of her clothes.If they look nice on you, wear them out to class or the park. Don’t deliberately get her clothes dirty or stained. The point is for her to spot you out wearing her clothing.

, Start little by little, just moving some stuff around. Then start to take things and hide them. When she asks if you know where her stuff is just say, ""I’m not sure. I haven’t touched it""

Ask for help too often.,
Have friends over often.,
Avoid meaningful conversations.,
Prank call him.",How to Annoy Your Roommate3," Say no to sharing cake, a book, or anything. It will really annoy him if he sees you sharing with others but not him. Another way to annoy the is to offer him something once, but never again letting him borrow something.

, While your roommate is sleeping turn the T.V. or music slightly louder than it needs to be. Subtlety is always a better way of getting underneath someone’s skin. This will frustrate your roommate and make him annoyed.


Listen to your music loudly in your room while he is trying to study or when he’s in the room. Start singing along to the song., Call him to say you forgot the key to get into the room.Tell him it's an emergency and it won't happen again, but keep doing it. This will take time out of your roommate's day to come and help you. Always make sure to have your key just in case he can't come and let you in.

, Have your friends over all the time and have them stay late. When you have your friends over try to be loud and silly. They can also make the room a mess and not clean it up. On school nights have them stay late when your roommate is trying to study or sleep.


Another way to get under his skin is by throwing a party without him knowing., If your roommate asks you for an opinion, reply, ""sorry, no idea"" or ""I couldn't care less."" When your roommate buys something new and shows you, just tell him that the item is okay and leave it at that.

, Always use *69 before you dial their number to mask your identity. Try to convince him that this is a legitimate phone call. You could say you are from their work and tell him how he was suppose to come in an hour ago.


Try to keep him on the line. The longer you can keep him on, the better the prank."

Realize that there are times when you need to adjust your expectations to fit in with others.,
Learn acceptance rather than arguing.,
Keep your inner world intact.,
Avoid being overly emotional around others.",How to Adjust Your Nature to Fit in with Others," It may be at work, on a social occasion or at home. Not everything is about what you want, and learning to curtail your sense of entitlement around other people is a part of maturing healthily.


Doing as your asked when it forms part of your job description is common sense; work is not a place for rebellion but a place for consensus, discussion and fair dealing.
In social contexts, there will be times when it is best to not let out your true feelings or to insist that others constantly pay attention to you. Spare people intimate gripes when socializing––find yourself a good therapist or kind listening friend for getting that stuff out. And when conversing with others, listen more than you expected to be listened to.;
, While you may feel that you are in the right while another person is wrong, don't get angry about it. You can't change other people and you most certainly can't stomp over their perspectives as if they always see things wrongly. Accepting that someone else carries a different opinion from you is not agreement; it is acknowledgement that there are other ways of seeing the world and that not everything has a wrong and right way of being seen.

, While you are getting along with others by acknowledging the things that matter to them, keep your own sense of values and principles alive within. Do not discard who you are or what you believe in just because you need to make a show of deference or compliance for particular times of your life. Some ways to ensure this include:


Giving yourself restful times each day. Take at least 30 minutes a day to do something that is just for you and that is peaceful and reflective, such as meditation, reading, thinking or simply lying about and ""being"".
Realize that other people's perspectives consist of their opinions and inner worlds. They are not replacements for your own thinking or values; you are entirely responsible for the content of what you think and believe.

, Emotions are an important part of who we are but being angry, out of control or stroppy are forms of losing control. Sometimes we use emotions to manipulate others to do what we want without being openly clear––that is also failing to align yourself with others sensibly and will only end up hurting you and others. By keeping your emotions in check and behaving calmly, you will be able to adjust your nature to fit in with others and get along well.

Avoid touching the celebrity.,
Be respectful of the celebrity's personal space.,
Shake hands with the celebrity only if they offer it.,
Have an open and friendly demeanor.,
Plan out your questions or thoughts in advance.,
Speak calmly and clearly to the celebrity.,
Complement the celebrity’s work.,
Request an autograph, if allowed.,
Do not take pictures of the celebrity if it is not allowed.,
Ask if you can take a photo with the celebrity.,
Bring gifts for the celebrity, if allowed.",How to Act at a Meet and Greet," Though you may be tempted to grab or touch the celebrity in your excitement to meet them, avoid doing this. Do not grab the celebrity’s hand or touch them in any way unless they seem open to touching. Approach the celebrity as someone you have just met and respect their personal space., Avoid standing too close to the celebrity or placing your body in their personal space. If the celebrity is behind a table, stay on your side of the table.If there is no table between you and the celebrity, stand at a respectable distance from the celebrity. This will show them that you are engaged in the meet and greet and are able to respect their personal space.

, Most celebrities at meet and greets will offer to shake hands with you. Let the celebrity offer first and then shake their hand firmly and briefly. Waiting for the celebrity to initiate the handshake will show them you are able to respect their boundaries.

Some celebrities may offer different forms of greeting, like a hi-five or a wave. Respond in kind by hi-fiving them back or waving back. Let the celebrity dictate the terms of the interaction.

, The meet and greet should still feel warm and friendly, especially if you are meeting a celebrity you really admire. You should focus on maintaining open body language, where you maintain eye contact with the celebrity and position your body so it faces the celebrity.You should also let your excitement come through on your face by smiling at the celebrity. Show off your smile and let your happiness light up your face. This will signal to the celebrity that you are thrilled to meet them in a respectful and appropriate way.

, To avoid getting overwhelmed by your meeting with the celebrity, you may want to sit down and plan out a few questions for them. Try to choose one main question you would like to ask the celebrity and/or one thought you would like to share with them. This will allow you to gather your thoughts and be prepared for the meet and greet.You may ask a simple question, like, “What inspired you to make this film/create this album/write this book?”
Or, you may ask a more specific question that may be obscure to show the celebrity that you are a true fan. For example, you may ask, “Why do you always end your songs with two claps?” or “How did it feel to work with Mia Farrow in Deadweight?” Often, more obscure questions will impress the celebrity and help you stand out from the crowd of fans.

, Take a deep breath once it is your turn to speak to the celebrity. Greet them with a “hello” or “hi”, as well as a handshake or a wave, if they initiate it. Smile and speak calmly to them, maintaining eye contact. Try to speak slowly and clearly, just like you would speak to a friend or someone you admire., Most meet and greets allow for only a few minutes with the celebrity. Once you greet the celebrity, you may transition quickly into a compliment about the celebrity’s work. You may also ask your one question at this point, initiating conversation with the celebrity.Try to stick to one to two questions or compliments, as you do not want to take up too much of the celebrity’s time. This is especially important if you are in front of a long line of fans and do not want to hog time with the celebrity.
If the celebrity responds to your questions, be respectful and listen to their answers without interruption. Make sure you say “please” and “thank you” when appropriate, as this will show the celebrity you are treating them like a fellow human being who happens to be famous. Plus, it is just polite and good manners.

, You should bring an item you would like to be autographed, such as a picture of the celebrity or a copy of their work. Only ask for an autograph if it is permitted at the meet and greet. If there is a sign that clearly states no autographs, do not request one as this could seem rude or presumptuous.Consider asking for the celebrity's autograph at the end of the meeting as a way to close out your meet and greet with them. Make sure you bring a pen with you and have the item ready so you can easily hand it to the celebrity to sign.

, If there is a sign that clearly states no photography is allowed at the meet and greet, do not ask for a picture anyway or try to sneak a photograph with the celebrity. This could be seen as rude by the celebrity and annoy them.You may want to check with the meet and greet event to see if photography is allowed so you are aware of the policy in advanced. Some celebrities are more comfortable with having a one on one conversation with fans, rather than taking pictures.

, If there is no sign that says “no photographs allowed”, you should ask for a photograph with the celebrity before you take it. Some celebrities will have a photographer at the event who will take pictures for you. Other meet and greets allow you to take pictures with the celebrity on your own camera by asking a friend to take it for you.

You may want to read more on how to pose in a photograph. Make sure you have a big smile and maintain eye contact with the camera as you take the photograph with the celebrity. Try to appear happy but relaxed in the photograph. You can then treasure the photograph with the celebrity for years to come.

, You may decide to bring personalized gifts for the celebrity to give to them. Most meet and greets will specify if it is okay for you to bring gifts for the celebrity. If it is allowed, you may give the celebrity the gift at the end of your interaction with them as a parting gift. Many celebrities appreciate fan made gifts and will perceive the gift as your way of saying “thank you” and “I love you” at the end of the meet and greet.


You may want to create a custom gift for the celebrity, where you use their image to create a t-shirt, an original painting, or another craft project. You could then sign your work and give it to the celebrity as a gift.
You may also choose a gift that will show the celebrity what a big fan you are, such as an item that references their role in a movie or a commemorative item that relates to their verse in a rap song. Get creative and present a gift that is memorable to the celebrity.

Suggest a plan.",How to Ask Your Neighbors to Be Less Noisy1," Before you decide to confront your neighbors about their noise levels, you should try your best to assess their situation, particularly if this noise problem is a new issue. Consider the following sorts of questions, the answers to which might affect whether you decide to talk to them or how you decide to talk to them:


Do they have a new baby? If they do, they are surely aware that their infant is wailing and are trying to calm him or her. Indeed, they are most likely more stressed out about the baby's crying than you are. Consider giving it a little bit of time to let the new parents and baby settle into a routine before you decide to talk to them.
Do they work nights? If so, there may be no way around them making noise while getting ready for work (showering, going down the stairs, starting their car, etc.) or coming home from their shift. Of course, if they are excessively loud (blasting music while they shower, for example), you may want to talk to them. On the other hand, if the noises they are making are what you would reasonably expect from anyone getting ready for their day, you won't have much of a case.
Is their pet a new adoption who hasn't yet had time to adapt to its new home? If so, your neighbors and their pet may just be going through an adjustment period. You may want to consider waiting for a while to see if they manage to get their new pet settled and find strategies for dealing with its noise.;
, You are aiming for the best possible outcome, where your neighbor is receptive and sympathetic to your complaint. Thus, choosing the appropriate time and place to talk things over with them is important.


Ideally, you will be able to talk to your neighbor when they are not being noisy or disruptive, especially if the problem occurs in the middle of the night (when no one is at their best) or if you are angry while the noise is going on.
Try to pick a time when you are rested and calm, and also when you have reason to believe that your neighbor is similarly rested and won't feel ambushed.
Of course, if the noise is unbearable, you may not be able to wait, in which case we give you advice on how to confront them at these times in subsequent steps.

, In order to avoid putting your neighbor on the defensive, you should try not to surprise them at an inopportune time or place. It's best to avoid confrontations when it's clear that your neighbor is not prepared for a discussion, and it's even better if you can alert them to your need to talk and arrange for a time that works for both of you.


For example, it's not a good time to confront when your neighbor when she has just gotten home a twelve hour shift, or when she is clearly struggling to get all her kids off to school.
Rather than demanding that she give you her attention right then and there, you can try something like the following, after you see that she's got everyone buckled in: “Hey Kathy, I see that you're busy right now, but are you free for a short chat later this afternoon? I'd like to talk about some noise issues that I'm sure we'll be able to work out together.”

, There may come a time when you have to become more assertive if your neighbors do nothing to reduce their noise, but you don't want to be hostile when you confront them initially. Your neighbors are far more likely to be receptive if you approach them politely and calmly.


Instead of banging on their door angrily, or having the first words out of your mouth be “Your d*%$ kids have been keeping me up all night!”, try easing into the conversation by asking them how everything has been going for them lately.
If there is any way for you to compliment them or generally find a way to demonstrate your friendliness and willingness to work with them, then do so. For example, you may be there to talk to them about how their new dog barks while they are out of the house. So long as you aren't allergic and the dog is otherwise well-behaved, give the pup a good pet and compliment the owners on how beautiful she is.
You can then lead into your issue: “Spot is gorgeous and clearly attached to you already. I think that may be related to why I'm here: you may not know it, but when you're out of the house, Spot barks and cries almost continually. I think this may be because she's dealing with separation anxiety. I was hoping we could come up with a plan to address that today.”

, If you can find ways to make your neighbor be sympathetic towards you, it is more likely that they will take your complaints seriously and commit to reducing their noise levels for your benefit.


Once you've explained to your neighbor what activity or behavior of theirs is disturbing you, make sure that you clearly explain how it is negatively affecting you. Demonstrate to them that your problem isn't with them, but that it is with the noise and how it is interfering with your life.
For example, if their music is keeping you up at night, try the following: “Chris, you clearly have excellent taste in music—I'd like to get that playlist from you if I can—but the walls between our apartment are pretty thin, and I've been having a really hard time getting to sleep because of it. I've got to get up early for work, so this is becoming an issue.”

, Rather than just demanding that your neighbors shut up or stop making noise altogether, it will help if you are prepared with a plan. Be sure to let your neighbor know how you would like the situation to be resolved. Try to offer a reasonable plan that acknowledges your neighbor's right to live their own life in their own home.


For example, if your issue is that your neighbor's dog has been barking while they are out, you can suggest that they crate the dog at certain times or place it in a different room in the house when they are out.You could also suggest that they shut their blinds and curtains and leave the television or radio on when they are out (which can reduce the dog's distractions and thus hopefully its barking).
If your neighbor's music has been keeping you up, rather than just demanding that they turn it off, you could try the following suggestion: “Given that I try to be asleep by 10pm would you be willing to turn the music off or switch to using headphones by then?”

Be proactive and try to avoid noise problems.,
Write them a note.,
Be honest with yourself about how noisy or bothersome your neighbors are being.",How to Ask Your Neighbors to Be Less Noisy2," Everyone has neighbors who are noisy from time to time, and we are generally able to accommodate for this with little difficultly. However, you may have something big coming up such as a job interview or a change in work schedule, and are worried that your neighbor's noise may become a problem for you.


If this is the case, it's better to be proactive and let your neighbors know ahead of time that you'll need a bit more quiet than normal.
For example, in the days before your important event or schedule change, stop by your neighbor's with a plate of homemade cookies and try the following: “Hey Sam, I've got final exams all next week, and will need extra quiet time. Would you mind rescheduling your band's practice on those days, or maybe even temporarily moving it to a different location? It would help so much.”

, While talking to your neighbors directly is probably the most mature strategy, and is often the most effective—particularly if you are able to connect with them personally and get them to sympathize with your predicament—there may be times when you'd feel more comfortable writing them.


If you don't know your neighbors at all or if your schedules don't line up to where you ever see them outside of their home (at the mailbox, in the driveway, etc.), then leaving them a very politely worded note in their mailbox or on their door could be an effective way to alert them to the problem.
Make sure that your note explains specifically what the problem is: For example, explain that you can hear their television at 11pm when you are trying to get to sleep, and note that it is loud enough that you can hear all of the dialogue on the program.
Be sure to offer a proposed solution in your note: For example, suggest that they reduce the volume by a third, or ask that they move the television to the opposite side of the room, away from your shared wall.
In case the situation is not resolved, you should keep a dated copy of the note for your records.

, Keep in mind that just because you can hear your neighbors, this doesn't automatically mean that they are being too noisy and that you would be justified in asking them to quiet down. Remember that people do have the right to make noise in their own home.


Of course, what one person finds mildly annoying the next will find unbearable—these are somewhat subjective terms.
In your effort to decide if you really ought to confront your neighbors, ask yourself whether their noise is significantly interfering with your ability to sleep, work, listen to your own programs, etc. If so, then a conversation probably is called for.
If, on the other hand, your only complaint is that you can hear their kids playing in the middle of the afternoon while you are trying to read your novel, your request to make them have their kids knock it off will come off as being overly antagonistic. Perhaps you can just move to a different room or wear earplugs while reading.

Research local noise ordinances.,
Remind your neighbors of the noise rules.,
Contact the authorities.,
File a lawsuit.",How to Ask Your Neighbors to Be Less Noisy3," If talking to your neighbor doesn't work, or if you want to avoiding having a face-to-face conversation altogether, you may need to be prepared to involve the authorities, whether that be the local police, your landlord, or building management. Before you contact them, you'll need to know that your neighbors really are being excessively loud.


Most cities and counties have noise ordinances that outline what acceptable noise levels are, and many also indicate “quiet hours”. These vary from place to place, so you'll want to research the specific rules that apply to your location.
You can do this by going to your county or city's website or your local courthouse. Many libraries also have references available on this topic.If you live in a neighbor with a Homeowner's Association or in a rental complex, then the contract, lease, or agreement you signed upon moving in most likely contains a noise clause. Consult this document to verify that your neighbors are in violation of it before proceeding to report them.Some towns/counties have special ordinances about dogs. If your noise issue involves a barking dog, you should research your town's ordinances to see if special rules apply., Before you contact the police or management, it's ideal if you can try to sort things out with your neighbors (of course, we understand that this is not always possible). If possible, provide your neighbors with a copy of the noise ordinances or the appropriate contract or housing agreement that they also signed upon moving in.


You can do this in person or send it to them by mail. This will remind them of the rules and will serve as a warning to them.
Indicate to them that if their noise is not reduced, your next step will be to report them to the authorities.

, If your neighbors do not respond and the on-going problem continues, or even if this is only the first time noise has been a problem but it is out-of-control, you should contact either the local police or your housing management.


You should reserve calling the police for more extreme or on-going instances of noise. Choose this option if the problem has been ongoing and your neighbors have not been receptive to your polite requests and when you are not able to first go to a landlord or Homeowner's Association.
Call the police anytime that the situation looks dangerous or if you suspect that the noise is due to domestic violence or illegal activities. It's very important that you not put yourself in danger, and it's also important that you do what you can to help others that you think may be at risk.
If you do call the police, try to call when the noise issue is ongoing. There will be a better chance that your neighbor will be caught “in the act” and will be warned, given a citation, etc.Contact your landlord, building management, or the Homeowner's Association for noise problems that are less severe yet still a nuisance.
If your problem involves your neighbor's barking dog, you may want to call Animal Control as opposed to the police (assuming that you haven't been able to work it out with your neighbor already).

, As a very last resort, you can consider filing a lawsuit against your neighbor. Think carefully about this, for you don't want to get into a war with your neighbor, but sometimes this can be the best motivator to get your neighbor to respect your rights.


You may choose to sue either in small claims court, where you can receive money damages.If you are hoping to have a judge issue a cease-and-desist order to your neighbor, you'll have to file in civil court, and will need to hire a lawyer."

If you want to mow your lawn at the crack of dawn, even on a Saturday or Sunday morning, who has the power to stop you? Certainly not your neighbor. If he or she asks you to cut out the noise or mow your lawn at a later hour, just explain that you’re an early bird and don’t have time to mow your lawn during more traditional lawn-mowing hours.


You can even be extra annoying by putting a big grin on your face and cheerily saying, “The early bird gets the worm!”
This is a perfect trick because your neighbor can’t argue that you’re being noisy just to be annoying because it’s part of a chore.;
, Another noisemaker all neighbors love is the wind chime. Without any effort, after hanging them up, all you have to is wait for the wind to do its thing and to sit back and wait for your neighbor to get completely annoyed. If he asks you to take them down, just point out that it’s your home and that you have a right to decorate it however you darn well please.


Windchimes are outlawed in some communities — look into the regulations in yours before hanging them up.

, One great way to annoy your neighbor is to pick a gorgeous, warm evening and invite fifty of your closest friends over for a garden party. You can set up a bar, croquet, or a variety of other games, and many chairs for your guests to sit and mingle in. Try to make most of the party events happen closer to your neighbor’s house, and play a bit of music to get your guests really in the mood. Your neighbor will be driven crazy as he asks you to turn the noise down, again and again.


Of course, just remember to be loud within reason. Your neighbors may call the cops on you to make a noise complaint, and you don’t want to deal with that kind of trouble.

, Do you think you’re the next Aretha Franklin or Elvis? Even if you can’t carry a tune in a bucket, you never really know until you try, and what better place to test your singing prowess than your own yard? Sing loudly, sing often, and sing the most annoying songs you can think of, such as “Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer on the Wall,” which will make your neighbor cringe in his home. If he asks you to tone it down, just explain that you have a right to practice your art.


For a double whammy, you can even sing as you do loud yardwork or as you’re setting up your lawnmower in the early morning.

, Music is a great way to unite people and to bridge differences as well as a perfect way to annoy your neighbors. Play your music on your porch, blasting from your car, or out your open bedroom window. Going for super loud can help annoy your neighbor, as can playing incredibly annoying or repetitive pop songs that are likely to get in your neighbor’s head and drive him or her crazy.


If your neighbor is really insistent about you turning your music off, you can agree to do so very cheerily, and then immediately start singing the song you turned off.

, Neighbors love nothing more than loud, annoying dogs. If you happen to have a favorite canine in your home, then you should encourage this creature to bark and fully express him or her self as often and as loudly as he can, especially late at night or early in the morning. Dogs aren’t humans, so your neighbor will be less likely to make a complaint and is more likely to just sit at home and get more and more angry and annoyed.


If your neighbor objects, you can just say something like, “He’s just being himself. Asking a dog not to bark is like asking a human not to breathe air!”

, Another great way to make some attention-getting noise is to set up a basketball hoop in your driveway and to play as often as you can. If you’re on your own, just work on bouncing the ball as much as you can, and even missing pretty often so you can make extra noise as the ball bounces down your driveway or against your garage. If you’re playing with friends, make sure to call your shots loudly and to generally make as much of a ruckus as you can.


If your neighbor asks you to tone it down, you can say something like, “I need to train — I’m a professional!”
Consider inviting over a handful of loud friends to play a pickup game.

, Another way to annoy your neighbor is to sign him or her up for some unwanted junk mail, whether you’re signing him or her up online, or just filling out papers in local grocery stores or pharmacies to make sure your neighbor gets the best deals as often as possible. Just make sure that your neighbor doesn’t know where all of this junk mail is coming from and that it keeps piling on.


The more random and annoying the junk mail, the better. If you can get junk mail from pet stores when your neighbor has no pets, or junk mail for random fishing or hunting equipment, even better. You can even subscribe to a catalogue for clothes for teenage girls, to be extra annoying.

, This trick is an oldie but goodie. Just call up your local pizza parlor and order a few large, smelly pizzas — think lots of garlic and anchovies — to your neighbor’s front door and wait for the goods to arrive. Your neighbor will be oblivious and annoyed and may even be forced to pony up for the food they didn’t order. You can even order the pizza to the front door when you’re out of the house, so your neighbor has less reason to suspect you.


Just make sure the pizza place can’t trace your number or call you back when they see that there’s been some confusion.

, If some solicitors come to your door, tell them that while you’re not interested, your neighbor is a big supporter of their cause, whatever the cause may be. Just add that your neighbor is a little shy and may need some prodding to admit how much he or she really loves the cause. Tell them not to waste any more time with you and to get to talking to your neighbor as soon as possible.


Say something like, “Jimmy next door absolutely loves your cause. He goes on and on about how much money he’d like to contribute to you guys.”

, This another simple yet effective annoying ploy. After you rake your yard in the fall or use a leaf blower, make sure you “accidentally” blow all of those leaves in your neighbor’s yard, leaving them to clean up the mess. This will be especially effective if your neighbor recently spent many hours clearing out his/her lawn. Plan this trick carefully, because it may not be the kind of thing you can pull off more than once without arousing too much suspicion.


The more annoyed your neighbor gets, the more innocent you should act. Give him or her a goofy grin and shrug and say, “My bad! I guess I’m still getting the hang of this whole leaf-blower thing…”

, If you want to annoy your neighbor, then put on your bathing suit even if you have no plans to go swimming. You have the right to wear whatever you want in your front yard, especially if your neighbor is entertaining company. Wear your suit when you’re just hanging out on your porch, when you’re doing yard work, or when you’re playing basketball in your driveway. This is a great tactic because it’ll also embarrass your neighbor to tell you to put some clothes on.


If your neighbor has people coming over, you should make a point of walking out to the front of your lawn, giving her or him a big hello, and even trying to chat up the neighbor’s guests, without showing any sign of modesty.

, Prank calling has never really gone out of fashion, and if you want to annoy your neighbor, then you should disguise your voice and bother your neighbor for a few minutes. The best thing you can do is wait until your neighbor settles down to dinner with his or her family, so you cause the most inconvenience when you call. You can pretend to be a telemarketer for a made-up charity, insistently ask to speak to someone who does not live there, or tell your neighbor to collect her/his “Least Likely to Succeed” award at the town hall.


Practice your prank call on a friend first so you don’t crack up or give yourself up.
Of course, you can make sure to block your phone number before you make the call.

, This diabolical move can get you in a lot of trouble, but if you’re really feuding with your neighbor and want to cause a major problem, then wait until they step out and leave a trail of sugar from their lawn to their porch. This will attract ants, bees, and various other lovely insects who will be creeping closer and closer to your neighbor’s front door.


When you leave the trail, make sure you know your neighbor will be out all day, so the insects will have a chance to really do some damage before he or she returns.

, There’s nothing your neighbor may look forward to more than a nice, relaxing Sunday at home with the family, spent drinking coffee and reading the paper. That’s why you have to wake up earlier than your neighbor does, and innocently tip-toe over to his front driveway to steal his newspaper. This will really put a damper on his/her day, and as long as you’re sneaky, it may be hard for them to really accuse you of what happened.


If you’re caught red-handed, you can plead confusion and say you thought it was your paper.
This can be even more annoying if your neighbor knows you get the same paper, so she'd/he’d have less reason to suspect you. You can even take his or her and leave yours out and then kindly offer to let them borrow your paper since their's appears to be missing.

, If you live in an apartment building with assigned parking, then one of the most annoying things you can do is to snatch up your neighbor’s parking spot. This will be incredibly annoying, especially if there are few parking spots available and she'll or he’ll have to walk pretty far after parking in an available spot on the street. Though your neighbor will know it’s you, this trick can really be annoying, especially if you act completely oblivious. Of course, this will work best if your spot has been taken, too.


If you have adjoining spots, you can be extra annoying by parking a foot or two into your neighbor’s spot so you can take up both spots. Of course, your apartment manager won’t be happy about these antics.

, If you’re lucky enough to literally live next door to your neighbor, then it’s time to channel your inner Rafael Nadal. Get out your tennis or racquetball racket, and spend some time volleying against the wall. Make sure you do this when you know your neighbor is home, and that you’re very persistent and consistent. When your neighbor asks you to stop, try to look as serious as possible and tell him/her you need all the practice you can get to train for the US Open — or whatever competition is closest to you.


If your neighbor tries to get you to stop by hitting the wall, then you should act like you don’t know what that means and think it’s a game; hit the wall back the same amount of times, laugh, and resume playing your sport.

, If you live very close to your neighbor and he or she can easily smell whatever it is you’re cooking, then you can make a point of cooking fragrant foods to really get his attention. You can cook an entire pot of garlic or just make really intense-smelling food, making sure to open your windows so your neighbor can really get a whiff of what you’re up to. The downside, of course, is that you too will have to absorb this intense aroma as well. You can minimize the damage by playing chef right before you step out for a few hours.


If you see that your neighbor has a date over, then what better time to cook an entire pot of garlic?

, One of the biggest pet peeves of people in an apartment building is when one of the residents carelessly leaves his or her clothes in the washer or drying, keeping them from doing their laundry. Fill as many washing machines as you can and leave your clothes there for a few hours to annoy your neighbor. To make sure your clothes aren’t ruined, you can place them in the machines without even turning them on; if your neighbor is really compelled to do his or her laundry, they’ll have to touch your dirty laundry.


If your neighbor has moved your clothes and knows it was you who caused the problem, try to act incredibly upset that she or he would invade your privacy like that and start throwing a scene.

, Another classic way to annoy your neighbor is to watch your television as loudly as possible. You can turn it almost all the way up and then hop in the shower, so your neighbor can’t ask you to turn it down right away. You can play an old movie you love, and then have fun screaming all the words along with the actors, to really put on a good show for your neighbor. You can also watch your TV late at night, making sure to laugh as loudly as you can so your neighbor knows exactly what you’re up to.


If your neighbor asks you to turn it down, you can say, “What? What did you say? Sorry, I’m deaf in one ear,” to make your neighbor feel bad for asking.

, Put a little bit of Vaseline on your neighbor’s doorknob so he can have an unpleasant surprise waiting for him the next time he tries to enter his apartment. Not only will the jelly feel sticky and gross, but it’ll make it harder for him to turn the handle and to actually get into his apartment. This will especially be effective if your neighbor has just returned from a long vacation or a massive grocery trip.


Just make sure you don’t actually jam the lock with the jelly, or you may have to pay for repairs if you’re found out.

, This is another way to get under your neighbor’s skin. You can knock on the door at seven in the morning asking if your neighbor has any chocolate chip cookie dough; say you’re really having a craving! Or you can knock on the door late in the evening, asking if your neighbor has any bacon you can make. Don’t let your neighbor see that you’re just messing around and make it feel as if you really, really want and need these items.


When your neighbor looks confused, you can make them feel like the bad guy/girl, saying something like, “You really don’t have any bacon? That’s weird.”

Wait a few days.,
Bring other neighbors with you.,
Be courteous and respect their privacy.,
Form a neighborhood welcoming committee.,
Leave a note.",How to Welcome New Neighbors1," When new neighbors are moving into their home, they likely have a lot on their plate. Instead of interrupting them as they’re carrying boxes and unpacking, wait a few days to let them settle in before stopping by to introduce yourself.Feel free to introduce yourself if you happen to bump into your neighbors as they’re moving in, but be considerate of their situation and keep it brief.
Try simply saying hello, giving your name and saying, “I’ll stop by another time to talk when you aren’t busy.”;
, When you go to introduce yourself to new neighbors, you may want to bring some other neighbors with you. This can reduce any possible awkwardness that may arise in conversation by incorporating more people into that conversation. You may want to open by saying something like, “welcome to the neighborhood, I’m (provide your name) and these are some of the people that live in the neighborhood.” Then introduce your fellow members of the community.Bringing a group of neighbors with you can limit the number of times different neighbors stop in to meet the new people in the neighborhood.
If you participate in a neighborhood organization like a neighborhood watch, your group may want to go introduce yourselves.

, Not everyone enjoys interacting with new people, and your new neighbors may be hesitant to have a lengthy conversation with you or a group of people. Keep your meeting brief, and if your new neighbor seems uncomfortable, politely introduce yourself and leave.If your new neighbor suggests that it isn’t a good time, respect their wishes and come back another time.
Don’t take offense if your neighbors aren’t welcoming. It is difficult for some people to meet strangers.
If your neighbor seems busy or uninterested in talking right now, you may want to ask when would be a better time. Try saying something like, “I can tell you’re busy. Is there a better time for me/us to stop by?”

, You may want to gather a group of your neighbors together to establish a committee that can aid in welcoming new members of your community. You can ask your neighbors if they would be willing to share in some of the responsibilities of assembling a welcome basket or care package and plan to introduce yourselves as a group.


Welcome committees can allow you to extend a positive gesture to new neighbors while sharing the work load and limiting how much each person has to do.
You may want to ask your new neighbor if they would be interested in joining the committee in order to get to know the other members better.

, You may also be a bit uncomfortable introducing yourself to new people, but still wish to let your new next door neighbor know that they’re welcome in the neighborhood. If this is the case, you may want to leave a polite note to introduce yourself.


Write a brief note that introduces yourself and identifies which house you live in.
Try writing something simple like, “Welcome to the neighborhood from your new friends next door! Let us know if you need anything!”

Never say anything more than you need to say. (Example: Correct ""What are you doing after school?"", ""Nothing."" Incorrect, ""What are you doing after school?"", ""I'm gonna go home, sit down, read a book, eat supper and then maybe go shopping."") Keep the details to a minimum.
;
,, Being calm when someone makes you angry gives you the advantage, it also makes you seem more mysterious since you can keep your emotions in check.

, You can draw what you are feeling, write in your journal, read books, listen to music, or just watch your surroundings. Basically anything that would make people think that you are quiet and mysterious, like you are content with yourself and you do not need other people, and you can just keep on living.

,, Being more serious about stuff is good.

Eyeliner, dark eyeshadow, maybe lip balm or a little gloss...not too much!!

,, If you think it seems rude you can say ""hi"" but just like in a loud whisper.

, The middle seat seems like you really want to sit with people and talk and answer.

, Don't stop talking altogether though.

, Don't skip rope or go play football or something like that. If you're going swimming or ice skating, simply go around just floating or looking about. Playing on rafts or using a bar to skate aren't very clever ways to make people think you're all that mysterious.

, Pair your outfit with feminine things like long vintage necklaces, beaded black and purple earrings. Wear shorter skirts with fishnet stockings and colored tights. This is a really cool look.

, Try not to let expression show on your face. If you aren't obvious about your emotions, you will seem even more mysterious.

Have a face-to-face conversation.,
Discuss the financial impact.,
Prevent a confrontation.,
Avoid inflammatory language.,
Respond instead of react.",How to Deal With Your Neighbour's Unsightly Property1," Sometimes people are simply unaware of the fact that a problem exists, so do not assume that your neighbour is thinking about the problem. If it is settled in your mind that something should be done, you should schedule a face-to-face meeting to communicate your concerns. There is a possibility that your neighbour will promptly resolve the problem after hearing what you have to say.Before scheduling a face-to-face meeting, you need to assess whether or not the situation is safe. Not everyone is neighbourly and sometimes having a face-to-face conversation is not prudent. It could even be dangerous. It is particularly unwise to just show up on a person’s property uninvited. You may decide to handle the situation with anonymity to avoid physical harm or any type of retaliation.
If you decide to move forward with a meeting, be prepared to say exactly what the problem is and provide a reasonable date by which you think the issue should be resolved. Here are a couple of examples: ""I have always appreciated you as a neighbor, but I am concerned about the current condition of your property,"" and ""I think 30 days is a reasonable amount of time to resolve the problem. What do you think?""
There is an old saying that “good fences make good neighbours.” If you would prefer to avoid interacting with your neighbour about this situation and future matters, consider putting up a fence that blocks your view of your neighbour’s property. Not having to look at your neighbours unsightly property could resolve the problem from your perspective and keep the peace altogether.
If the neighbours are renters, contact the homeowner directly. You can find the homeowner’s information through the county assessor’s office.;
, If you are trying to sell your home then it is perfectly fine to communicate urgency, while also communicating that the problem may affect the value of your home. You may want to remind your neighbour that this matter also affects the value of their property, which can be a financial incentive for them to solve the problem.Consider telling them that you want prospective buyers to know that they are good neighbours and then offer assistance to expedite the resolution so that it does not affect the sale of your property (this could mean actually helping to clean up the litter).

, When communicating with someone regarding a difficult subject, it is important to be polite to avoid escalating the situation. It is possible to address a sensitive topic without being confrontational or hostile. A gentle approach is generally best.


Prepare yourself for a counterattack and reconcile in your mind that you will remain diplomatic and calm if your neighbour becomes angry.
If the situation escalates, walk away and plan to discuss the matter at a later date.Being cordial prior to a problem arising will sometimes go a long way towards resolving conflict down the road. A kind “hello” over the years can make a big difference.

, Do not use language that is accusatory or disrespectful. For instance, words such as “nasty” or “disgusting” are offensive and can quickly escalate the matter.


Refrain from threatening your neighbour. Most people do not respond kindly to threats and it is best to remain respectful., Before engaging in any conversations, make a decision to respond calmly during your communications with your neighbour. Reacting without thinking about the consequences could create a far worse outcome than is necessary."

Include baked goods.,
Share contact information for local businesses.,
Add a local specialty.,
Provide local takeout and delivery menus.,
Bring a bottle of wine.",How to Welcome New Neighbors2," Baking a treat for your new neighbors is a traditional gesture that many people may really appreciate. It’s important that you are considerate of possible allergies when doing so, however and don’t leave something you cook with your neighbor’s children in case there are ingredients in it that they shouldn’t eat.You may want to include a note with a list of the ingredients in what you make so your neighbors can avoid anything they may be allergic to.
Purchasing a baked good may not be as traditional, but is certainly still a nice gesture.

, Moving to a new neighborhood often includes finding local businesses to use for things like utilities, trash pickup, and emergency repairs. You can help your new neighbors settle in by providing them with fliers or a simple list of services offered in the area and who to contact to take advantage of them. Some services you may want to provide contact information for are:Local plumbers or electricians that can respond to emergency calls.
Local law enforcement and fire services.
Cable and satellite television providers.
Internet service providers.
Trash pickup or removal services.

, Many places have locally known specialties and treats that you can include in your welcome basket. Providing some samples of local specialties can help new neighbors learn about their new home in a delicious way.If your town is known for its dairy farms, you may want to include some locally made cheese, for instance.
Gift certificates are also a nice way to incorporate local specialties.

, Everybody doesn’t feel like cooking from time to time, especially when they haven’t been able to unpack their kitchen yet. New members of the community likely won’t know which restaurants are nearby and which ones can deliver to your neighborhood. Help them out by providing delivery and takeout menus from restaurants you use.You can offer a simple list of local delivery places instead of a collection of menus.

, A bottle of wine can be a nice gesture when welcoming new neighbors to the area. While not everyone enjoys wine, they may choose to simply set it aside to share with guests in the future. Wine is considered to be a traditional housewarming gift and can serve as a great accent to some of the food you may include in your welcome basket.


Choose a bottle of wine that you enjoy, as it can also serve as a way to get to know each other if they invite you to share it.
You may want to find a wine that pairs well with foods or snacks you have included in your welcome basket. You can find suggestions of what kinds of wine go well with certain snacks here: http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/15-rules-great-wine-and-food-pairings/3

Throw a block party.,
Invite your new neighbor to join community groups.,
Throw a cocktail party.",How to Welcome New Neighbors3," You may want to organize a block party and invite your new neighbors so they can meet one another in a comfortable environment. By throwing the party yourself, you alleviate the stress new members of your neighborhood may have about having people over before they have their house completely unpacked.


Make sure to invite the rest of your neighbors to the block party so they all have a chance to meet the new neighbors.
Block parties are also a great way for your new neighbor’s children to meet other neighborhood kids.

, If you are a member of a community based group like a neighborhood watch, you may want to invite your new neighbors to attend a meeting with you to get to know other member of the community.Bring your new neighbor to the meeting and introduce them to the group.
Other groups you may want to invite your new neighbors to join may include book clubs or school oriented groups like the PTA (if they have children).

, Depending on the time of year and your neighborhood, you may want to throw a cocktail party instead of an outdoor block party. You may want to plan your cocktail party for the evening and offer enough advanced notice for your neighbors to find a babysitter if they need one.


If your new neighbors have children, you can suggest a babysitter you trust to them for them to be able to attend.
Like a block party, throwing a cocktail party can alleviate the stress of having people over for your new neighbors while still allowing them to meet the neighborhood.

List other neighbours.,
Write letters.",How to Deal With Your Neighbour's Unsightly Property2," Keep track of the events that have occurred by writing down brief notes, including dates, times, and the individuals involved, Discreetly take pictures of the unsightly property. Being subtle may prevent an argument or altercation with your neighbor. It is very important that you do not trespass on your neighbour's property during any attempt to document the situation., If there is a particularly egregious event, you can record that event for clear evidence of what has occurred.Whether taking pictures or filming video, you may find it beneficial to subtly use your smartphone since it is usually readily available. Be sure that all photos and videos are date stamped.

, Keep track of other neighbours who may have expressed the same or similar concerns. While it is not a good idea to gossip and create drama by involving other neighbours unnecessarily, it is a good idea to list the names of those who may be able to support your claims., If you meet face-to-face, follow up by writing a non-aggressive letter to confirm and reiterate what you discussed. You can send subsequent letters as necessary.If you plan to follow-up on your conversation in writing, you may consider telling your neighbour to expect a confirmation letter in the mail so that they are not caught off guard upon receipt of the letter.

Clarify your concerns.,
Decide if your concerns are fair.,
Do your research.,
Review the problem with your spouse or a friend.",How to Deal With Your Neighbour's Unsightly Property3," When dealing with a neighbour’s unsightly property, it is important to put things into perspective before having any conversations or making any decisions. Always keep in mind the importance of maintaining positive relationships with your neighbours, when it is within your control. While you can certainly address problems, you do not want to do anything that would unnecessarily create a hostile environment or further diminish the enjoyment of your property.Think about whether or not this is a recent problem that may be soon resolved or if this has been a long-standing issue. The situation may be the result of a health problem that your neighbour is experiencing and they may be unable to do anything about it at this time. This is particularly important when you have elderly neighbours with limited mobility.

, Not everyone has the same standards for cleanliness or the same design aesthetic. What may be unsightly to you may be perfectly acceptable to others. Carefully consider whether or not your concerns are truly warranted and weigh the risks and benefits of addressing the issue. You may decide that your neighbour’s property is good enough for you to let the situation go without pursing it any further in order to keep the peace., Get clarity on the actual issues and gain an understanding of ordinances and zoning codes so that you can speak intelligently about the problem. Perhaps your neighbour’s property is creating a safety hazard or a sanitation violation. A quick Google search will get you startedIt may be worth your time to research affordable services that will help your neighbour with cleaning up their property. While you should not be expected to pay for the services, your due diligence in providing a useful resource may be well received.

, Sometimes talking through the situation with someone else will help you to decide whether or not you want to move forward with a course of action. It could be beneficial to have a calm conversation with a reasonable person to make sure that you are not overreacting. Once you move forward you cannot undo your actions."

Contact the homeowner’s association.,
Identify local or municipal authorities.,
Find a mediator.,
Follow-up until the situation is resolved.,
Consider litigation.",How to Deal With Your Neighbour's Unsightly Property4," In some communities there is a homeowner’s association that can serve as a mediator to resolve problems between neighbours. If you have already spoken to your neighbour and the problem is not resolved, consider contacting the homeowner’s association to share your concerns and provide the details that you have gathered.If you decide to handle the situation with anonymity, contact the homeowner's association before speaking with your neighbor and ask to remain anonymous.

, There are authorities designated to assist neighbours with dispute resolution. While problematic, your situation is far from unique and many homeowners have experienced the same issue. Local or municipal authorities may assist you with finding a quicker resolution. Start by contacting city hall.


You will need to read the local regulations to ascertain the procedures more clearly in your jurisdiction. In addition to the homeowner’s association and municipalities, you may also find assistance and direction through the fire department or police department, depending on the nature of the problem., If you do not have a homeowner’s association and the problem is escalating, consider contacting a mediationservice to assist you with resolving the problem without involving attorneys. A mediator is a neutral third-party who can assist with establishing communication until a resolution is found.

, Recognize that this is a problem that could take some time and effort to completely resolve. Before you start, realize that engaging with your neighbour regarding this issue may result in a long-standing feud that lasts for years. Be prepared to engage in the process and mend the relationship, if necessary.Some homeowners have found this type of issue to be so disruptive, that they chose instead to sale their home (when they were not otherwise planning to do so) and move on with their lives. While this may be a last ditch solution, it may be something worthy of your consideration depending on the complexity of the situation and your ability and willingness to relocate.

, You probably do not want to contact an attorney until you have made a sincere effort to resolve the issue. However, there are some instances when the situation is so contentious that you simply have to seek legal assistance."

Think about what causes you to react to the Joneses' affluence or actions.,
Consider which aspect you're trying to match or catch up with.,
Take the aspects of the Jones' life that you think you're envious of and break them down into a few reality chunks.,
Ponder how your obsession with keeping up is impacting your life.,
Reflect on your personal goals and achievements.,
Think of the worst case scenario and then work back from there.,
Pursue the things that you care about in abundance.,
Share yourself around.",How to Stop Keeping up With the Joneses," What lies at the heart of wanting to keep up with this family? There’s usually a deeper reason as to why you want to keep up with the Joneses and it’s not just because you want a new yacht. Dig down deep inside to try to find the reason why you may feel compelled to “one up” someone else:


Career frustrations. If you’ve been feeling like a hamster on a wheel at work, where you work harder but don’t seem to get anywhere, you may be feeling a little stung by another’s material accolades. It can be tempting to assume that someone else is having it a lot easier than you and getting nice rewards to boot.
Low self worth. Feel as if you can’t make friends without impressing people or “wowing” them with money or a display of a perfect life? If you're light in the wallet, you may feel as if you can’t make friends or keep them without having impressive items and instead of realizing this as an unrealistic way to make friendships, you might be cursing your lack of funds for your lack of keeping up with others.
Personal life troubles. If an area of your personal life is under attack and your self esteem is at risk, it can be tempting to look for the “quick and easy” fix to feeling superior to others. The term “the one who dies with the most toys wins” is one that isn’t lost on you––you believe that material wealth definitely will buy you the kingdom, all the while resolving any personal issues that are upsetting you currently.
Tough childhood. Those who may have been raised to “do without” may yearn for big homes and fancy cars as an adult. Seeing another family who achieves this type of status may be something you believe should be yours so you aim to keep up. On the other hand, many children who grow up in lower income families may be more grateful and accepting of material items they work for and earn rather than feel as if they deserve them because they “missed out” during childhood.;
, Although more than often it’s all about the money, sometimes it's several aspects a Jones-type family exudes that drives people insane, including relationships and work prestige. Some examples of non-monetary spurs to competing include:


Perfect marriage. Every time you bump into them, they're all smiles, cuddles and full of mutual support. You worry that the grouching you and your spouse have going at the moment has something deeper to it than sleepless nights with a new baby and too many work deadlines, but this nagging only seems to appear whenever you come across this perfect couple.
Perfect kids. You've heard that they've got straight As, lead the sports teams and don't answer back. You're wondering if all that critical thinking and ""follow your heart's desire"" chats you've been teaching your kids were such a good idea after all when you see the Jones' well-behaved pack move in synchronicity.
Tons of money. It does seem that they have a great deal more money than you––that car, those clothes, the membership of the local club you feel you can only aspire to...
Impressive career. You're not quite sure what it is they do but the CEO title seems most impressive. You wonder whether it's worth struggling with biking to work every day to sit in a cubicle and mull over office papers when you could be soaring like your neighborly CEOs.

, By doing this, you will start to see that your hankering for their lifestyle contains some major flaws. Taking the examples above, let's check out the other possibilities and things you can learn about yourself:


Perfect marriage. It may seem like they have a sublime marriage without hiccups. Of course, what you see isn’t always what you get. Even though happy husband and wife may be kissing each other on the front porch every morning before he or she heads off to work, this doesn’t mean it’s rainbows and sunshine at home. Moreover, they may have been through rough patches and resolved them, while you're still navigating one; that's just an issue of timing, not perfection.
Perfect kids. Straight A’s and the captain of the football team or head cheerleader living next door can make you feel inadequate in the parenting department. Yet, achievements like these don't mean that a parent has raised the perfect child and who knows what the honors kids are doing under the cover of being ""perfect"". Pushing a child to “be like” someone else’s kid will only create internal turmoil and trouble, plus you don’t really know what is going on inside the other families.
Tons of money. In a credit-driven society, many people will give the illusion that they are loaded, when in reality they owe the shirt off their back and some. Even if the other family does make a ton of money, for argument’s sake, how are they doing it? If it’s due to years of education, tremendous hard work and determination, take notes on how to get ahead in your career and not what they recently purchased. If it involves them working all hours of the day and never spending time with those perfect kids, well, perhaps you're the one who has made the right, albeit poorer, choice.
Impressive career. If George Jones is a car salesman, just like you, but seems to be doing so much better, use his success as a motivator not a point of contention. Sometimes people are pushed to excel and think outside the box when they witness the success of another. However, if George is a rocket scientist, perhaps you should marvel at the fact you have a rocket scientist as a neighbor and instead appreciate his success instead of trying to compete with it. Have some good yarns with him instead of trying to score yards over him.

, How obsessed are you with keeping up? In some cases, a little dose of envy can be a healthy motivator that goes a long way to light a fire under what was a dormant career or relationship in your life. However, if you're constantly keeping tabs or score, consider the fact that you have an unhealthy obsession that must come to an end.


Stop keeping track what they're doing. Even in the case where the Jones are your close friends, take the object of your obsession (money, relationships etc.) out of the equation to free yourself from this narrowed focus. For example, if you're obsessed with how well the Jones kids do in school, commit to keep all conversations with the family to other topics and not the kids. Or, open yourself up to learning about what it is that is inspiring these achievements, so that you can borrow their experience and tailor it to your own parenting.

, Sometimes when you become overly focused on what someone else is doing, you forget about how far you’ve come in your own right or you take for granted the achievements you’ve made.


Revisit original goals, hopes and dreams––chances are, they have nothing to do with the Joneses. They may simply have become an excuse or an indicator of your internal restlessness to get yourself back on track with your own goals.

, What would happen if you were able to keep up? If you are still clinging on to the notion that you need to keep up or exceed the accomplishments of another family, take a good look at what would happen if you actually did reach your goal.


Make a list of how you would be better off if you had that Mercedes or bought that big house. Be sure to include the cons of the result so that your list is balanced!
Consider every aspect of your life including your financial and personal well being. Is your life truly better or would you be strapped with an overwhelming financial burden and an unhappy family?
What is your trajectory if you carry on as you are now? What improvements do you want to make? Are you ready to get on with making them now?

, Whether it's volunteering on the weekend, writing at nights, teaching your kids the periodic tables or painting a mural on your outside wall, indulge in the things that really fire up your creativity and take you into the flow state of true joy. Money and status are poor substitutes for finding your sweet spot of creativity and the more you indulge in this, the more fulfilled you will be.

, When it comes to keeping up with another family, keep in mind that you're the only one keeping score. If you're truly interested in impressing the neighborhood, do it with your kindness or generosity. Be there for people, lend a helping hand, be a listening post and offer wanted advice when needed. Let people know they can come to you for support. Offer your wisdom to the community and the Joneses will be genuinely impressed instead of being bemused by someone mimicking their every move.

Find a good time to visit your neighbor.,
Presume that your neighbor is unaware.,
Let your neighbors address the problem.,
Make second contact.,
Suggest anti-barking strategies.,
Befriend the dog.,
Issue a final complaint.,
Keep track of the continuing problem.",How to Deal With a Neighbor's Barking Dog1," You want to set the stage for a nice talk about the dog without him getting defensive. The best way to do this is to make initial contact at a time that he doesn’t feel caught off guard. Make sure you phrase this first interaction as finding a time you can both talk. Then, if he is happy to talk about it right then and there, you may be able to settle the issue in one day.


You might try going over on a Saturday morning when you hear him using lawn tools. Don’t enter his property until invited, and try not to sneak up or surprise him. Break the ice with some small talk about how his week went, and then ask them if he has time to talk about the dog soon.
If your neighbor gets angrily defensive or violent and threatens you in this talk or any future talk, stop trying to solve the problem yourself. Go to the police and tell them about the barking, and that a simple, polite request prompted your neighbor to threaten you.;
, They may be uninformed about the problem, either not aware of the barking or not knowledgeable about what to do about it. A friendly heads-up, along with some tactful mentions of dog care strategies, perhaps even noting a dog trainer you've heard produces good results, may be all it takes. The neighbor may not be aware that the dog is causing a problem, for instance if the dog barks while he is away at work., After initial contact, or a planned conversation, your neighbors may feel regret and want to address the problem immediately. Allowing them to handle the problem themselves help you will keep your relationship civil. They may have tactics for handling their dogs barking that they haven’t had enough time to do lately.


Give your neighbor time to make changes. It can take time to adjust schedules and/or conduct training sessions that will help curb barking.

, It is entirely possible that your neighbor is either reluctant (doesn’t care enough to act) or recalcitrant (takes offense at the mere suggestion of doing something), which may require further action on your part. But remain cordial as much as possible. Having conversations in daylight and in public, such as during Saturday morning yard work, can help you keep the interaction safe and out in the open., There are many ways to prevent barking, including daily exercise and training sessions. Learn about several possible options and mention them to your neighbor in a polite manner.Try to treat the process as a negotiation of conditions that you both can accept. This will help you in the eyes of the law if things do devolve into an intractable dispute.If the neighbor is open to the idea, and you are willing to take on the cost/effort, you can even offer to pay for an anti-bark collar, or help them find a skilled dog trainer. You are under no obligation to do this, of course.

, You may find that this is often much easier than befriending the human neighbor. Learn the dog's name from the owner, and ask to be introduced. If the dog gets to know you, it may be less likely to bark at you. The next time it barks, try saying its name in a reassuring voice. With the owner's permission, give the dog a toy or treat to show you're friendly, and to calm it down.


If you can build up some level of friendly rapport with both neighbor and dog, you may even choose to offer to walk the dog during the day — for instance, if the dog barks each afternoon while the owner is at work.Getting involved in this way is always your choice, however. If you don’t like dogs, don’t have one because you don’t want the responsibilities of caring for one, or are plenty busy caring for your own dog, you absolutely don’t have to offer to help with your neighbor’s yappy mutt.

, If your neighbor ignores you, contact him one more time. Let him know you have asked the barking a few times, but it is not improving. You want this to remain a dialogue between the two of you, but you will get neighbors involved if necessary. At this stage, you probably don’t want to threaten contacting the police yet, unless they are acting violent or threatening you.

, Continue to gather evidence while you wait. Give your neighbor time to find a solution, but prepare for the next step in case this doesn't work. Maintain a detailed journal of how often the dog barks and for how long, or talk to other neighbors who have been as annoyed as you. If the neighbor seems unwilling to make an effort, this can come in handy moving forward."

Familiarize yourself with local laws/codes.,
Call animal control.,
Call the police.,
Pursue legal action.",How to Deal With a Neighbor's Barking Dog2," Involving the authorities should be your last recourse for a barking dog, because it is likely to take a good bit of time and effort to secure an acceptable resolution, and is sure to make your relationship with your neighbor uncomfortable at best — and quite possibly openly hostile. But, if you have exhausted other options and/or see no alternative, make sure you know your rights and how to assert them.Some municipalities have specific codes regarding barking dogs, while others include it within nuisance or noise ordinances. Within a single metropolitan area, local codes can vary widely, so contact your local government authority for clarification.If you and your neighbor are both part of a neighborhood association, there may be codes that cover barking dogs. Similarly, if you are renters (especially if you have the same landlord), look into the terms of your lease.Some municipalities may provide, or be able to refer you to, mediation services (binding or non-binding) to keep such disputes out of the courts. Contact your local government, district attorney’s office, or small claims court to inquire., The days of the dog catcher coming around unannounced and snatching up problem dogs is over, but your local animal control service may be able to intervene for you. Contact the service to find out whether it handles nuisance barking, or whether you need to involve the police first.


You may need to be persistent in your calls and/or be able to provide evidence that the dog is a nuisance for animal control to act.Call animal control right away if the dog is barking because it is in pain, has trapped itself in a small area, has tangled its chain, or is otherwise unable to access water. Contact the owner first if you are comfortable doing so, but don’t ignore a suffering dog that is not receiving proper care.

, Involving the police will usually either immediately escalate or immediately resolve the situation. Your amount of preparation beforehand may well make the difference.


Once you make yourself familiar with the relevant dog/noise/nuisance ordinance(s) in your area, call the non-emergency police number to report a violation.
Unless your local police uses the emergency number (such as 911) for all calls, do not call it to make a barking dog complaint. It is conceivable that you may be cited for misuse of the emergency line.
Many police departments and other services require you to prove that the barking is extreme before they can take action. Here is where your record-keeping — log book, recordings, statements from other neighbors, etc. — can prove invaluable in supporting your claim.Once the police are involved, your neighbor may feel besieged and try to frame the issue as a dispute between neighbors, in which you are primarily at fault for some reason. This is why it is essential to never give him ammunition to use against you by making threats, shouting, swearing, accosting the dog in any way, etc., If you need to go to court to prove a noise/nuisance violation, come prepared with the evidence you have gathered. Calmly and clearly establish your case.


You may be able to sue your neighbor in small claims court for causing you loss of enjoyment of your home and property. You’re not going to strike it rich this way (and may even end up losing money in the process), but if you provide a clear, strong case supported by documented evidence, you may be able to get your neighbor to finally quiet that dog.If you find that the local laws regarding nuisance dogs are lacking in your area, start a petition and contact your elected leaders.

Consider the situation.,
Consider your soundproofing options.,
Install an anti-barking sonic device.",How to Deal With a Neighbor's Barking Dog3," Unless you are far removed from any neighbors, there is simply no way you can expect to avoid hearing dogs bark from time to time. Barking is an innate activity for canines; they may do it to show fear or anxiety, to seek attention, due to pain or illness, and for many other reasons.Before taking action, consider whether your limits for the amount of dog barking you want to tolerate are reasonable and feasible. If the dog just yaps for a bit when a person or another dog walks by, or whines when it's ready to go back inside, or barks when playing with its owner in the yard, it will likely subside soon.
If, however, the barking is persistent (consistently ten minutes or more, perhaps), sounds like the dog may be injured or ill, or makes you feel threatened, you probably have legitimate reasons to act.

, There are numerous ways to muffle the neighbor’s dog as well as other annoying sounds. Installing soundproof windows is a more expensive option, but it may have the added benefit of reducing your heating bill. There are also soundproofing curtains, which would be a less expensive route. These would all have the added benefit of reducing other noises that you can’t do anything about, such as late night traffic and sirens.


By taking steps to reduce the amount of noise that actually reaches your living space, you may find that the annoyance factor of the dog’s barking is substantially reduced.

, There are devices on the market that emit a loud, high-pitched sonic blast whenever it detects barking. The sound is above the human range of hearing, but may annoy the dog enough that it learns to stop setting it off. These are basically automated dog whistles, and in fact using a dog whistle may work just as well.


If you can convince your neighbor to use one, there are dog collars that incorporate the sonic device, or release an unpleasant smell or hiss of compressed air instead.
The overall effectiveness of such devices at stopping barking is questionable, and while they shouldn’t harm the dog, they do cause a level of discomfort that you may be uncomfortable with (even if that dog is driving you nuts!)."

Be friendly towards others.,
Acknowledge neighbors who smile at you or greet you.,

Be soft-spoken when entering and exiting.,
Be considerate of the noise level inside the apartment.,

Have on-site laundry etiquette.,

Know the rules for different kinds of apartment parking.,
In assigned lots, parking stalls are included in contracts.,





Offer any positive assistance or convenience to your elderly neighbors.,

Ask any questions regarding smoking with the property management.,

Choose small pets for a pet-friendly apartment.,

Have apartment dumpster etiquette.,
Only invite guests over who can respect your apartment buildings house rules.",How to Be a Good Apartment Neighbor," You don't necessarily need to know them, but a simple hello or greeting goes a long way. Creating friendly relationships also makes it easier to interact in the future if anyone has questions or concerns.
, You don't have to stop and chat, but a little smile and wave don't cost you anything. Remember the nasty thoughts that crossed your mind about people you've said hi to who ignored you? You don't want anyone thinking of you that way.

Don't be creepy or annoying. While being friendly is important, it's equally important to allow your neighbors the level of privacy they desire. Don't just knock on people's doors and expect them to invite you in. Read your neighbors' body language. Does it look like they're in a hurry? Have they actually told you that they are in a rush? Then stop talking and let them go!
Get to know the property management and employees. Be sure to keep a contact list in case you need a maintenance fix or for emergency purposes. Put all requests for work in writing.
Participate in your apartment's events, discussion board or tenant portal. One of the potential benefits of apartment living is that neighbors look after one another. Introducing yourself is the first step toward getting the most out of your community.

, It may be normal to walk from the parking lot to your front door and vice versa, but you'll need to consider how loud a person is. Avoid stomping on stairwells, especially when leaving before sunrise or coming back late at night. Try not to walk around apartment with wood floors in your shoes (put them on just prior to leaving your apartment and remove upon entering your apartment) not all tenants work a ""9-5"" job and may be trying to sleep during ""regular"" daylight hours. Keep the noise at whisper-level in hallways. Loud laughter and conversations while people are relaxing or sleeping are a nuisance. Close doors behind you gently. Apartment doors create a lot of noise. Don't let them slam shut., This is one of the most common complaints reported to managers. More noise etiquette is needed if you live above another person. Soft footwear makes less noise than heavy duty items such as boots or high heels. It's not necessary to thump your heels around the kitchen in the middle of the night. If a neighbor requests for you to keep the noise level down, take it to heart. Rugs and rug pads are a must if you have hard flooring.

Try to vacuum or use exercise machines on the weekends or when you know people are at work. Noise and vibrations goes through floorboards and can be louder than you think.
Practice ""quiet time"" rules with children. Allow them to jump and run around during the day, but instruct them that they need to stop doing so when the sun goes down. Instead of having them create havoc indoors, spend quality time outside, such as in a small community playground. If you don't have carpet, have plenty of rugs down on the floor to muffle the noise of children.
Don't allow children to run or play in the hallways.
Turn the volume down on electronics, such as radios and televisions For wall-to-wall neighbors, you may want to move them away from those specific walls. If you're hard of hearing or if you like to listen to media at a high volume, invest in headphones.

, It's advisable to time each machine and avoid leaving clothes abandoned for any period. A typical washer operates for about 30 minutes on average, while a dryer can take between 45 to 60 minutes.

Never stop another person's laundry in mid-wash or dry to use it.
Never insert another person's wet clothes into a dryer. Every person has their own specific way of drying clothes, whether it's air drying or using a particular machine dial/setting. And then there are the delicates that shouldn't be placed in the dryer at all!
If no washers and dryers are available and another person's clothes have been sitting in an otherwise useable machine, you may remove them. It is considerate to wait at least 10 minutes if you can. Lay their clothes on a clean plastic bag, on a counter or on a folding table - never on the floor.
Always clean out lint screens and wipe up any spills. Who wants to clean up after another person that did a load before you?

, Respect all parking space borders by parking within the lines not on them) and don't double park., It is never okay to assume that you can use an empty space. Not even for just a few minutes. If your neighbor returns and finds your car in their space, you can probably forget your chances of having a civil relationship with them., If you see them in the parking lot with groceries, ask them if they need help carrying them inside the building or hold any doors open. If you see their mail piling up or you don't notice their lights on at night for some time, knock on their door and see if they're doing okay., Even if it's allowed inside the apartment, make sure that the area is completely ventilated with the windows and vents open. If smoke isn't venting well, install a box fan in your window backwards to suck the smoke out. Properly discard cigarette butts in your own trash; do not fling them out the window. You still need to obey rules with a non-smoking apartment, so light up on the sidewalk., Be aware of what - if any - house pets are permitted. If your building allows cats and dogs, choose small ones. Cats and small dogs don't usually make a lot of noise while walking on floors and they are less likely to threaten other neighbors. Always keep any four-legged animal on a leash while walking outside of your apartment and bring a plastic bag with you at all times. Inform your neighbors about a new pet if you're uncertain about their feelings., . Always break down and fold up boxes and other compact items.

Make sure your trash bag is secured closed and that it isn't leaking. Double bag if necessary. Be sure to wrap sharp edged items carefully and multiple times in newspaper or paper shopping bags. Leaky bags leave behind odors and stains that are likely to offend your neighbors and management won't have any trouble following the trail of the stain that probably ends at your door. In that case, you may be charged for clean up costs or even for carpet replacement.
Do not overfill bins or attempt to squeeze a too large bag down a trash chute. If your bag expands even a little as it falls, it could get stuck and create a back up.

, Most contracts forbid guests or any person not under the lease to be left alone in the apartment. Reckless behavior or any disputes between the guest(s) and another tenant may become the leaseholder's responsibility.

If holding a party, let those neighbors likely to be inconvenienced know about the occasion. If you think the neighbors will enjoy themselves too, consider inviting them.
Avoid having loud get-togethers on weeknights.
Most importantly, be tolerant. Whether you forgot about a load of laundry in the dryer or accidentally started a fire, we've all behaved inconsiderately at some point. Your neighbors are no different. They aren't perfect either.

Talk to a lawyer about your options.",How to Deal With Bad Neighbours," Your discomfort might be completely obvious to you, but if you haven't told them, chances are your neighbors don't even know they're being a bother. While you're sitting there stewing and getting ready to boil over, they're just going about their daily life. Don't assume that they're being intentionally rude. Just knock on the door, introduce yourself, and let them know what the issue is.


Ask nicely, but make your point. Ask for exactly what you want instead of being vague and keeping them guessing. It's not fair to expect them to be able to read your mind and know your limits – you need to tell them what you want.
Be willing to compromise. While you might be happy to never again have to hear the teenage son practicing tuba, it's probably not practical to ask your neighbors to soundproof their garage. Use a complaint that they'll be more sympathetic to, such as the noise keeping you up after your bedtime. You'll have more success if you approach the neighbors with a problem and a willingness to talk about possible solutions, instead of charging in and demanding specific behavior.;
, If you have difficulty reaching your neighbors, you can leave a note or email expressing your wishes.However, this can be risky, because the notes are easily misinterpreted as passive-aggressive messages. That said, if you can't get hold of your neighbors in person, sometimes leaving a note is the best option. Most people will feel a little embarrassed and immediately change their behavior to accommodate you.


Make sure the note is friendly in tone. Tell your neighbor that you'd like to find a solution that works for everyone.
If you're comfortable putting your phone number in the note and encouraging your neighbor to call you, do so. That way if your neighbor has any questions you can get them cleared up right away.

, Don't give your neighbors a laundry list of problems you want them to address – it won't go over well. Figure out what you can live with and what must change, and only present your neighbors with problems that are driving you crazy. Once the main issues are solved, you can get to the smaller matters at a later date, or learn to live with them.Remember that what's most annoying for you isn't necessarily the easiest for them to change. If they've explained that the problem is difficult to fix, consider asking for something easier instead.

, Depending on what you're asking your neighbors to do, they might be more amenable if you offer to help them make it happen. For example, if you like a nice, neat yard and are tired of seeing their unkempt weeds all summer long, you could offer to help them get the yard back in shape.


Even if the problem isn't something you can fix yourself, helping out can give the neighbors time or inclination to respond to your request. For example, if the neighbors can't fix their broken engine muffler because they use their car all day, offer to drive them between the mechanic and their workplace, or to run some errands for them while the car is being repaired.
Don't offer to give money or hire someone. Many people bristle at the suggestion that they can't afford to fix their own problems.

, Give the neighbors a reasonable amount of time to fix the problem, perhaps a few days for minor tasks, or longer if you're asking for something time-consuming like fixing up their house's appearance. If they still haven't made an effort, return for a polite reminder. If they have, thank them or even bring over a small gift of food, and they will be much happier about having to do it.


The next time something happens, stop and think about an appropriate response. If the neighbors are still playing loud music every night, it's time for another complaint. If the neighbors have been relatively quiet for weeks and are now throwing a birthday party, put in earplugs and give them once a year to be loud.
Keep lines of communication open afterward, even if it's just a wave and a hello. If you're a forgettable presence that shows up only when there's a problem, your neighbors won't be as inclined to listen to you.

, This is a good step to take if the ""bad"" neighbors show no signs of changing. If an issue is affecting you, chances are it's affecting everyone on the block or in the building. Talk with your other neighbors to find out if they're willing to sign a letter addressed to the neighbors at fault. There is strength in numbers, and being approached by an entire group instead of a single person could be what it takes to get the bad neighbors to change.


This doesn't mean you and your neighbors should storm the bad neighbors' house or apartment – that could get out of hand and make the neighbor feel threatened. Even a group email can feel ""us vs them.""

, Make sure you aren't doing anything that could be getting on other people's nerves before you bring up the problem. Especially if there's bad blood between you already, you don't want to make the problem worse by appearing hypocritical or insensitive.


Make sure you're not picking them out, either. If you don't want them to play music at 3 AM, your old friends Ken and Janet next door shouldn't be able to do the same thing.

, If you are planning a late night event, won't be able to keep up with the yard work for a while, or anticipate any other issues that could bother your neighbors, let them know.Have a quick conversation about it and give them your phone number to call if there are any issues. It's amazing what changes from ""intolerable"" to ""no problem"" if you just take the time to communicate.

, Just like everyone, your neighbors have problems in their life, even if they aren't obvious to you. Your neighbor may find it difficult to take the time out of their life to acknowledge and handle another person's problems. Don't fall into the same trap.

, Is your neighbor nameless and faceless, or do you actually know each other? It's a lot harder to care about someone you've never met, and resentment can build quickly when neighbors don't bother forming a relationship with each other. The best way to get what you want – some peace and quiet on the weekends, for example – might be to forge a relationship with your neighbor so you understand each other better and are more willing to be considerate. You don't have to end up as best friends, but seeing each other as people is a good start to increased neighborliness.


Why not invite your neighbors over for a meal? Ask them to come over when you're having a summer cookout, or invite them for pancakes on a Saturday morning. Get to know each other before you make any requests.
If inviting them into your space is a bit much, you could take over a bottle of wine or some home-baked cookies and introduce yourself.

, If you really want to repair relations with your neighbors, start planting flowers on a deserted lot, petitioning the local government about safety issues on your street, or organize a trash pickup. Reach out to all your neighbors and give them the opportunity to feel included in the project., These are drastic measures that are likely to take a long time to work, and make relations with your neighbors even worse. They are only suitable for neighbors who have been actively hostile toward you, or who have a pattern of sustained rude behavior, complete unwillingness to change it when asked, and even then only if the behavior has seriously affected you. You're going to have to live next to these people for a while; think carefully before you turn a disagreement into a feud.

, If you tried asking nicely and your neighbors weren't responsive, it's time to take more drastic measures. Begin by documenting the problem so that you can back yourself up if you have to involve the authorities. Take pictures of property damage, take video of parties that spill into your yard after midnight, save emails and notes, and so on. Basically, gather proof that your neighbors are trespassing or otherwise engaged in illegal activity.


You may wish to inform your neighbors that you're doing this. When they know you're hard on their trail, that may be the motivation they need to quit pulling those stunts.

, If you live in an apartment building, it may time to get the landlord involved. Call the landlord and explain how your neighbor is disturbing the peace in your living space. Depending on the infraction, the landlord might decide that he or she has grounds to evict the bad neighbors. At the very least, the landlord should discuss the issue with the bad neighbors so you don't have to keep complaining.


Use your best judgement on this one based on previous interactions with the landlord; some landlords hate having to deal with their tenants' disputes, and may get irritated at you for calling.

, If the bad neighbors still won't change, figure out what legal action is available to you. Get familiar with your local laws and determine whether your neighbor is breaking any. If your neighbor is in violation of any laws, you might be able to take action. Look up laws on the following:


Trespassing
Property destruction
Noise violations
Barking laws
Laws regarding property maintenance

, This and the remaining steps below fall into ""last resorts"" territory. Your relationship with your neighbors will likely never be repaired if you take this step. Getting the police involved is one way to shock your neighbors into changing, but don't use them as your personal dispute mediators.If the issue is loud music, call the non-emergency police number.
For unkempt yards, call the Homeowners Association (where applicable) or the city nuisance abatement officer. Most cities have nuisance abatement, or code enforcement officers, who are responsible for maintaining code compliance.

, Once you've determined that the neighbors are indeed breaking a law, and you've collected some evidence to prove it, let them know that you plan to take legal action. You don't have to give details – just tell them that you're planning to take this to the next level unless you can reach a compromise. They probably won't want to get tangled up in legal issues, so just telling them that you're prepared to sue may make them decide to change.

, If you're willing to put your money where your mouth is, call a lawyer and figure out what you can do. You must decide whether solving the problem is worth the headache of legal fees and open contention with your neighbors. If you're set on getting this matter settled legally, work with your lawyer to file a lawsuit and potentially bring your neighbors to small claims court.


If nothing else, you may be able to work out with your landlord to get out of your lease without breaking it illegally. If you've alerted him to the situation and he's done nothing about it, it certainly doesn't make him look good, so he may let you go – especially if you're going to get a lawyer involved. Consider this compromise instead of getting dragged into hours of court time and court fees that even you probably don't want to deal with.

Be nice to your new neighbors.",How to Be a Good Neighbour," Whether you're new in the neighborhood or new residents have just moved in on your block, introduce yourself. Say hello, offer a welcoming gift (the classic homemade pie never fails) and share or ask about the local area: ""Where's the nearest pizzeria?"" or ""The garbage truck comes by on Tuesdays and Fridays, usually around 10 in the morning, but sometimes he sneaks in at 8."";
, Get to know your neighbours--what they do for a living, what their schedules might be like, and so on. Sometimes, you can remedy problems before they even start; for example, if they work nights, quiet mornings will be important for them. If they have young children, quiet evenings will be very important to them. Similarly, give them information that'll help them be more considerate of your lifestyle. If you do a lot of yard work, or if your teenage son plays the drums, let them know in advance and mention that if it's getting too loud, they shouldn't hesitate to let you know.

, If you're in a terrace, condominium, semi-detached house or any structure where you and your neighbors share adjacent living spaces, position noisy household appliances such as washing machines and tumble dryers - even TVs and speakers - away from partition walls. If you live above someone, consider putting linoleum or rubber matting underneath your appliances to deaden or muffle the noise, and remember that someone downstairs can hear you walking around (so minimize how often you wear high heels indoors, for example).

, Keep your dog on a leash if it has a habit of running rampant on your neighbors' lawns, especially if they have a cat or a dog of their own, and make sure to clean up after it. If you have a particularly noisy dog, this may also become a source of contention for your neighbor. Put yourself in their shoes and imagine how upset you'd be if you or perhaps your newborn was woken from a much-needed nap by the sudden yapping of a nearby dog. If you have problems controlling your dog's barking or whining, consider seeking advice from your local vet or a local animal organisation.

, When you park your vehicle, be sure not to block anyone's access, or make them have to pull out of a very tight spot. Don't over-rev the engine of your car or motorcycle early in the morning or late at night. Park in front of your home, not theirs. Avoid slamming your doors or shining your headlights into your neighbor's windows late at night.

, If you're planning a party, be sure to give your neighbours plenty of warning, letting them know when it's going to start and how long you expect it to go on. Leave them a telephone number to contact if they need to ask you to turn it down. If you get on well with your neighbours, why not invite them too? When it comes to the party itself, stick to your agreed arrangements and ask your guests to be considerate when leaving.

, Weed your garden regularly, because the presence of weeds in your yard is not only unsightly but can also spread to your neighbor's yard. Mow your lawn regularly and keep your flowers, trees and bushes trimmed appropriately. Put equipment away as soon as you're finished with it. Ask if your neighbor has chemical sensitivities, small children or pets before applying pesticides.

, Position it where the smoke and smell will least likely blow onto your neighbor's property. As with parties, notify them in advance of your intentions, since they might have been planning to dry their clothes outside on that very same day!

, Only put your rubbish/garbage out on the day it's due for collection. If you accidentally miss the collection, bring it back onto your property immediately and try to contain it well. Garbage can attract vermin, insects, and other pests, and is also unsightly. Keep your trash area clean and debris free. Wash your garbage cans if they begin to smell.

, Above all, touch base with your neighbors regularly and keep them in the loop. Remember the golden rule and if anything you are planning to do may affect them, minimize it and let them know in advance. Keep the channels of communication open by reminding them that if you're doing anything which disturbs them, they should feel comfortable approaching you about it.

, Even if you're not in a ""neighborhood watch"" community, keep your eye on anyone you don't know acting suspiciously around your neighbor's property. When in doubt, call the police so they can quickly curtail any criminal activity.

Smile.,
Take a step towards others.,
Lean towards whomever is speaking.,
Make friendly physical contact.",How to Act Friendly1," Smiling at people is a friendly gesture that you can aim to do more often to act friendly. Try smiling at people who pass you on the sidewalk, who make your morning coffee in a café, or who you see on a daily basis.


Smile in a way that is natural for you. You don’t have to show a big toothy grin if this is not how you usually smile, but you can smile this way if it is your normal way of smiling.;
, When someone approaches you, take a small step forward to greet them. When you force someone to walk to where you are, you are enacting a subtle power play. Prevent this by moving towards them as well. This will indicate that you’re genuinely excited to greet them, and will convey friendliness right off the bat. , Your body language and the gestures you make send strong nonverbal social messages. Make sure your physical behavior sends a humble, friendly vibe to everyone you interact with.Tilt your head towards others, especially when they are speaking. This sends the message that you’re happy to be speaking with them.

, Speaking strictly in terms of nonsexual conduct, touching someone sends a strong positive message about how you feel about them. A friendly touch can quickly contribute to an increase in comfort between you and a stranger. Casual physical contact also makes you seem friendly to others who may be observing you.Touch another’s arm to convey that you are comfortable around them. A quick, gentle touch effectively removes a social barrier between you.
Limit touching to the upper arm or shoulder area. This sort of touching is least likely to be perceived as threatening or sexual.
Make sure you are never making anyone uncomfortable. Some people do not like to be touched. If someone pulls away from your touch, apologize and do not attempt to touch them again.
Try offering your hand for a handshake or offer a hug if the person is someone you are close with and feel comfortable hugging.

"
"
Get people talking about themselves.,
Put away the business cards.,
Part on a positive note.,
Follow up on enjoyable interactions.",How to Act Friendly2," Create opportunities for others to speak about themselves. Not only will others appreciate the gesture, it will make them feel valued, and make you seem like a master of conversation. The trick is asking the right questions.Ask open-ended questions that allow someone to be descriptive or introspective. For instance, when you find out someone did something interesting, ask them something like, “How did you pull that off!?” or “What motivated you to begin working towards that goal?”
Other great conversation questions include, “What did you like most about that?” or “What was the most memorable part of that experience?”

, Networking is an important aspect of professional life. That said, the internet makes other people more accessible than ever before. When you meet someone for the first time, don’t ruin it by whipping out your card after an enjoyable conversation. This risks making it seem as though you had an agenda, and makes your friendliness seem less genuine.Make sure to remember their name. Using their name and whatever else you know about them, you’re almost sure to be able to find their contact info online.
If you do want to exchange cards, ask if they have a card instead of offering yours. This conveys your interest in them, instead of drawing attention to yourself.

, You can do better than “it was great to meet you.” When wrapping up a conversation, part ways as warmly as you greeted someone. Shake their hand again, or touch them gently on the forearm. Say something along the lines of, “I hope we run into one another again” or “It has been an absolute pleasure to have some time together.”If you know when you’ll next see one another, mention it. For instance, include something like “I’m looking forward to seeing you next Thursday. I’ll catch up with you after the event to get your take on it!”

, Reaching out to people is a sure way to send the message that you were genuinely interested in them. Even if only to reaffirm that you enjoyed meeting someone, shoot them an email. Follow up a specific aspect of conversation, even if you only spoke briefly or in a group.For example, “Hey Jenny! It was fantastic catching that terrifying movie with you and everyone else the other evening. I’ve been thinking about what you said after the show, about the power that horror holds over our psyches. Anyway, hope to run into you again soon, and be sure to let me know of any particularly frightening movies you come across!”

"
"
Begin with the positive.,
Listen to those around you.,
Maintain informal relationships with colleagues.,
Say thanks more often.,
Offer to help.",How to Act Friendly3," Attitude is a huge component of personality, especially friendliness. Fortunately, you can control your attitude! Choose to approach everything you face – especially when others are involved – from a positive perspective. Even if your own inclination about something is negative, make a point of stating a positive perspective on the matter.For instance, you and a co-worker may be assigned a task that neither of you are happy about. Instead of complaining about it, say something like, “This will give us the experience we need to start getting better assignments!”
The specifics matter less than the collective mood that a positive approach can help create. Contributing something lighthearted and humorous will help keep everyone in a friendly, cooperative mood.

, There are entire libraries filled with tomes about the importance of listening. In short, the better you are at actively listening to others, the better you will get along and the more productive you will be together.


Maintain eye contact, and focus on thinking about what another person is saying as opposed to what your response will be. Wait until they are finished speaking and think about your response for a moment before responding.

, Relationships with some of your peers may become dominated by the responsibilities you share. Even if you sometimes do something fun together with co-workers, for instance, there’s likely room to add to your friendship with those you usually interact with formally.


Ask co-workers or fellow students you admire to grab a coffee sometime, or simply walk out to the parking lot together.
Even better: as class or the workday is wrapping up, voice your interest in shifting gears together. For instance, say something like “who’s in the mood for walk to the ice cream store?” Even if no one bites, the offer sends the message that you are friendly and accessible.
Plan ahead for periodic group social events. For instance, get one or two others to commit to bowling next week, and let everyone else know the plans ahead of time!

, Whenever someone makes your life easier or brightens your day, let them know you appreciate it. Catch them somewhere private and say something like, “Hey, I really appreciate what you did for our project. Everything’s finally coming together and you really helped make it happen.”Feel free to make it personal. Say something like, “Hey, I wanted to let you know: you made my day earlier. I’ve been in a better mood since, and I’m really glad I know you.”

, Being helpful is also a good way to act friendly. If you notice that someone seems overwhelmed or like they could use a little assistance, then offer to help.


For example, if you see someone struggling to open a door because they have too many things in their hands, then hold the door open for the person.
Or, if a friend expresses that he is overwhelmed by the amount of studying he has to do for a big test, then you might offer to study with him to make it seem like less of a chore.

Start in the locker room.,
Pick a lane.,
Circle swim if there are no free lanes.,
Observe wall etiquette.,
Be mindful of other swimmers' intervals.,
Always leave a respectful trailing distance.,
Be mindful of the way you are swimming.,
Don't be afraid to make conversation.,
Be mindful about the locker room.,
Don't talk about your swim league achievements.",How to Use Lap Swimming Etiquette," Just like in any public space, keep your voice at a respectable volume, keeping in mind that noises will amplify in a locker room. Either place your things in a single locker, or keep them as compact as possible on a bench. Remember, this isn't your home bathroom. It's a shared space.


Lap swimming communities are generally friendly, but don't do be aware that many of the ""veterans"" have specific routines they like to observe, like placing their things in a specific locker. If you notice and chagrined or distressed glances, try moving your things the next time you use the locker room.;
, If there are empty lanes, choose them unless you are swimming with a friend or have been invited to share. If all lanes are full, pick a lane with one person in it and ask them if they would like to split the lane.


""Splitting the lane"" means that instead of circling around the center line, you stay on one side of if and swim back and forth without ever crossing over. If they were there first, ask which side they would prefer or default to the side the least of their equipment is on.

, If there are no lanes with one or two people in them, then you will need to circle swim. As explained in the previous step, circle swimming is used when three or more swimmers are sharing a lane and involves consistently swimming on the right side. When you flip turn, you will cross the center line and swim back on the other side of the pool.


If you are circle swimming, always pick a lane with people relatively your speed or you will hinder the other swimmers' experiences. Always notify people you are joining their lane, especially if they were previously splitting the lane.

, If you are splitting, keep your equipment bag on your side of the lane and don't cross over or close to the center line when you are resting. If you are circle swimming, rest as close to the lane line as possible to leave the entire center line available for flip turns and keep your equipment bag neat and contained.

, It is immensely frustrating, not to mention dangerous, to have somebody push off the wall just as you do the same. Accidents happen, and your lane mates will be understanding with a sincere apology, but before you push off for a new set or a warm down, ask the other swimmers what their interval is or when they intend to leave. If somebody is coming in for the flip turn, wait until after they have passed to push off and begin, even if you have to modify your interval slightly.

, Many swimmers make this mistake, and it can quickly lead to you being shunned from the lane. Wait 5-10 seconds after another swimmer pushes off to start swimming, and if you notice yourself catching up, politely ask if you can pass them. It is acceptable to give another swimmer's feet a single touch before you pass them on the left to alert them to your actions. Think of it as the equivalent of a bicyclist holding out their arm to signal a turn.

, Avoid obnoxious techniques like the dreaded ""straight arm"" in which a swimmer swims without bending their elbows. Instead, keep your elbows high and your palms close to your body. This is both courteous and proper technique.


The same goes for swimming breaststroke. Try to keep your knees tight and bring them up under your chest instead of out to the sides (again, also good technique) Not much can be done for butterfly except warning your lane mates.
If you are using equipment, these techniques are doubly important. Tools like paddles or fins can harm other swimmers and even break the skin at times, so be very conscious of your space.

, A bucket sticker or a swim cap can make great conversation starters, and despite taking place mostly underwater, swimming is a pretty social sport.

, Limit your shower length if the venue is crowded or if you notice the water going lukewarm and don't hog the outlets, mirrors or bench space. Try to keep your space relatively dry. Nobody is asking you to wipe down the dirty floor, but swiping the puddle off your bench can go a long way.

, Everybody is there to swim recreationally because they enjoy it or its health benefits, and you will come off as arrogant or living in the past. You are also likely to get shut down by the occasional D1 athlete. Keep your conversations conversational, and let other swimmers move at the pace they enjoy. The pool should always be a cheerful place!

Exercise good oral hygiene when you’re with them.",How to Tell Someone They Have Bad Breath1," A classic way to hint at a particular problem is to act as if you have the problem yourself. This is a great way to bring up the topic of bad breath to someone, especially to a person that you are not very close with, because it is a non-confrontational way to make them think about their own breath.Start the conversation by saying:


“I’m going to go grab some water, I feel like my breath is terrible.”
“Is it just me or does my breath smell?”
“Can you smell my breath? I feel like it’s noticeable.”;
, Another subtle way at hinting to a person that they have bad breath is to offer the person a mint, stick of gum, or some water (since dry mouth can also cause bad breath) and see if they take the hint. For a natural transition, try taking a mint first and then offering one to them so you’re both included in the transaction.

, Etiquette experts agree that if you offer someone a breath aid and they turn it down, it’s perfectly acceptable to nudge them into accepting with a kind “I think you should.”It’s a delicate way to let them know that you offered the aid in the first place as a hint. If they still don’t get it, have another friend or coworker try!

, If the person with offending breath has this problem often, their chronic bad breath may be caused by poor dental hygiene and not just their food choices or use of tobacco products.If it is an infrequent problem, the person just might not have considered bringing a toothbrush for midday cleanings. Either way, try showing them good techniques:


After lunch say, “I’m going to go to the restroom quickly and brush my teeth; that dressing had so much garlic in it!”
Show them or talk about how you always keep floss and mouthwash in your desk because you cannot stand having bad breath.
If you’re close with the person, try saying “Would it be weird if I flossed my teeth right now? I feel like my breath is terrible, and it’s driving me nuts.”

"
"
Consider how close you are to the person.,
Talk in a private setting.,
Let them know gently.,
Help them fix the problem!",How to Tell Someone They Have Bad Breath2," In general, the closer you are to the person, the more direct you should be. If it is a friend or close work acquaintance, this is a great strategy, but if it is a superior or a relative stranger, consider dropping hints first since they are more likely to be offended since the two of you are not very close., No matter how nice you say it, bringing up bad breath to a person will be uncomfortable and could cause embarrassment. To ease the discomfort a bit, be sure to wait to bring it up until you are alone with the person, or ask the person if you can speak with them in private if the problem needs to be solved quickly.

, It is very important to understand that there is a difference between being direct and being insensitive. When being direct, it is important to avoid teasing, making any unkind comparisons like “Your breath smells like a sewer,” or having a critical attitude or disgusted body language.Some ideas for considerate, compassionate conversation starters include:


“I noticed something, and I’m not sure if you’re aware, but your breath smells a bit off.""
“Sorry to mention this, but you have some bad breath right now.”
“If the situation was reversed I would want someone to tell me, so I thought I’d let you know that you could use a breath mint right now.”

, After letting them know that their breath is problematic, it is important to then help them solve this problem. That could mean offering them a mint, inviting them to take a walk to a convenient store to get some gum, or talking about your own issues with bad breath.

"
"
Leave an anonymous note.,
Secretly drop off a pack of gum or a fresh breath kit.,
Send an anonymous email.,
Recruit someone to do it for you.",How to Tell Someone They Have Bad Breath3," The least confrontational option, this could also cause the person to wonder about who sent the note in the first place. But as long as you word the note kindly, the point will be made. Just be sure to place the note somewhere where no one else could accidentally come across it, as this will embarrass the person unnecessarily.

, Leaving gum, mints, or a breath freshening kit that includes a toothbrush, mouthwash, and tongue scraper is a great way to anonymously let the person know there is a problem with their breath.Leave it in their locker, desk, car, or somewhere where they can find it in private. You could even make it seem like a gift if you wrapped it up or included a nice card!

, Bad breath is so common that there are now many sites that allow you to send someone an email about their breath, along with tips for dealing with bad breath, anonymously. This is a great way to not only let the person know, but also to provide them with some information so that they can treat the problem proactively. Try one of these sites or look one up yourself!

, While not technically “anonymous” since someone would be saying something directly, this can be a great way for you to remain unidentified in the process, which can be ideal if you’re trying to tell your boss or someone you don’t know well. By asking one of their friends or relatives to speak to them about the problem, you can help solve the issue without any of the ordeal.

Consider getting professional help.",How to Stop Cracking Your Knuckles," When you crack your knuckles, you are manipulating certain joints in the body in a manner that promotes the release of gas (currently thought to be primarily nitrogen) from synovial fluid. Synovial fluid exists within synovial joints, and its function is to reduce friction between cartilage. When a knuckle is cracked, the gases dissolved within the synovial fluid are compressed and form of a bubble. This bubble then bursts, making that familiar popping sound as it does so.


It can take this released gas up to 30 minutes to dissolve back into the synovial fluid - that's why you usually have to wait a while before you can pop the knuckle again.
Cracking your knuckles stimulates the nerve ending and stretches out the joint, which is why it feels so good.;
, Although several studies have shown that knuckle cracking does not lead to arthritis, and although many will suffer no consequences after a lifetime engaging in the habit, some studies have suggested that people who crack their knuckles for long periods of time are at risk of developing the following symptoms:


Soft tissue damage to the joint capsule(s).
Damage to the hand's ligaments, the soft tissues that connect our bones.

, No matter how much you crack your knuckles, if you want to stop, then behavioral therapy techniques are the way to go.


In other words, cracking your knuckles is a behavior, so it is possible to use behavioral techniques to change your behavior. Simplifying a little, there are two basic forms of behavioral therapy: positive and negative.
Positive behavioral therapy includes techniques like reward systems: Set goals and give yourself (or your loved one) a reward for meeting those goals.
Negative techniques include minor punishments or other reminders to make the person aware of their habit, so they can stop. There are as many kinds of these techniques as there are people who would offer advice.

, Give your hands something else to do, other than knuckle cracking. Learn to twirl a pencil or a coin, for example.


Aspiring magicians practice moving a coin through, over, and around the fingers of one hand without touching anything else. A pen or pencil works too.
This exercise is truly good for anyone at any age. Developing finger strength, coordination,and manual dexterity can be fun too as you master a new skill rather than hurt yourself.

, Some kind of hobby that keeps your hands (and mind) busy is probably an excellent idea like drawing, writing, or arts and crafts.

, The single most classic behavioral method is to wrap a rubber band around your wrist.


When you notice you are about to crack your knuckles pull back on the rubber band and release, so it snaps back onto your skin.
The slight sting you feel may help you to break your habit, as you may eventually come to associate your knuckle cracking with pain.

, If the rubber band method doesn't appeal to you, there are several other things you can do to curb your cracking habit:


Carry a small hand lotion around with you in your pocket or purse. When you feel the urge to pop your knuckles, get out the lotion and rub it on your hands. This will give you something to do with your hands, while also leaving them soft and moisturized!
Have a friend put tape around your ""knocking knuckles"" or tape your fingertips to your palm to make a fist.
Put socks on your hands while watching television or doing other activities that don't require the use of your hands.
Keep a pen/pencil in your hand to prevent cracking or ""strumming"" your fingers.

, Since knuckle cracking is often a nervous habit, it is often done ""automatically."" . Most of the time people are not even aware they are cracking their knuckles until somebody tells them.


However, if you wish to stop your knuckle cracking habit, it is important to become more aware of when you do it.
It may be helpful to rope in a friend or family member to provide a gentle reminder whenever you crack. Knuckle cracking is generally a lot more obvious to outside observers than it is to the crackers themselves.

, Knuckle cracking may be classified as a nervous habit. Since a nervous habit is in response to stress or anxiety, identifying the source of the stress is the first step in dealing with the habit.


Stress can be specific, like worrying about an upcoming test, or it can be general, like relationships with parents and peers, social acceptance, or any of many other factors.
Try keeping a small notebook on you at all times, and make a note each time you crack your knuckles. This will help you to notice any patterns in your knuckle cracking behaviors and help you to identify your triggers.

, If you are a knuckle cracker or care for someone who cracks their knuckles, be aware that nagging or complaining about the habit is more likely to make it worse than make it go away.


Nagging only leads to more stress, which increases the nervous reaction to that stress.
Therefore gentle reminders will be much more helpful and effective than constant nagging.

, Although nagging or increasing stress is unlikely to help, there are many ways that friends and family can help the knuckle popper. A simple touch on the arm when somebody notices unconscious habits can go a long way to understanding and dealing with the problem.

, Understand that most knuckle cracking is harmless and will probably go away with time. If the cracking does not coincide with other changes in behavior, patience is probably the best antidote.

, Understand that prolonged excessive or any kind of habit that has a negative effect on the normal course of life is always a problem, or ""issue,"" and should be faced.


Truly excessive knuckle cracking, especially accompanied by the cracking of other joints in the body, can be an early sign of more serious anxiety disorders.
If you believe your knuckle cracking may be a symptom of a more serious disorder, you should consider seeing a therapist.

Know when you're talking to a story topper.,
Understand why they annoy you


A conversation should be an exchange of ideas between people.,
Get realistic


The best way to deal with a story topper is to be honest about your expectations of them.,
Get honest


It's not impossible that your story topper is completely unaware of their behaviour.,
Get strategic


Story toppers won't get the attention they sorely crave if you simply ignore them.,
Look for an upside


When it comes to advice, assistance or help, story-toppers are often invaluable.,
Set an example.,
Get some distance


Sometimes, a story topper becomes so unenjoyable to be around that you might have to get some distance for a while.",How to Talk to a Story Topper,"


The story topper in your life might be great fun but generally, they're not the most gracious conversationalists. Often they're often not even listening to your fascinating story - they're just waiting for a gap in the conversation so that they can bring the conversation back to their favourite topic. Sometimes, they'll get so fed up waiting that they'll simply interrupt you mid-sentence: ""-Hey, that happened to me!..."".






A story topper at a party is easy to spot. You'll hear them talking as soon as you walk in the door and when you are leaving at the end of the night, they'll probably still be talking. Any attempts to steal the conversational floor from this person will be thwarted. At best they'll listen without interrupting. At worst, they'll roll their eyes and pointedly ignore your contributions, simply steering the conversation back to whatever they were talking about.






A story topper who knows you well, like a family member or friend, can be harder to deal with. They know you well and probably already know how to push your buttons. You already know that no matter what you tell them, they'll go one better. This isn't uncommon amongst younger siblings, but it can become a lifelong habit.





;
, Trying to talk to someone who only wants to talk about themselves and their experiences can be downright unenjoyable. Often it's not a chat, but an audience that your story-topper is really seeking.






Here's the hard truth - sometimes, we dislike story-toppers because they steal the limelight and attention that we wanted for ourselves. Most of us like the limelight from time to time. If a story-topper annoys you, be honest - are they really being rude, or were you just disappointed that you weren't the centre of the conversation?







, If you're having a bad day and need some support and appreciation, perhaps they're simply not the first people you should call. If you've just received great news, or had a fantastic experience, call up the people you know will be supportive and genuinely excited for you.







, If your story topper is a good friend, it's not out of bounds to say: ""Hey, it kind of bothered me that you interrupted me then. Can you let me finish please?""







, If your conversation get hi-jacked by a story topper, wait for them to stop talking and simply say ""So...as I was saying..."" and continue with your story just as if their interruption hadn't happened. You aren't being rude, or playing their game. You're simply asserting your right to speak without being interrupted.







, If you need the low-down on great restaurants or a job position, they are usually fantastic people to call. If they claim to have had the best 21st party on the planet, maybe they're the best people to ask for advice about holding yours. If they think they make the best lasagne on the planet, maybe they do - grab the recipe! If they claim to be the best people in the office at fixing computer issues, they're your go-to person when you have an IT drama. We all have things we're best at - letting them shine, especially if it helps you too, is no crime.







,


No matter how the story topper in your life behaves, decide that you will always be gracious in your dealings and conversations with people. If someone tells a story about their trip to Paris, don't start thinking about your time in Paris and how much fun it was for you. Concentrate on them. Ask them questions and ask them to explain more about what they've said.







, Story-toppers aren't evil people, just a little draining sometimes. Try returning every third phone call, or not replying so soon to that email. If you need patience to deal with the story topper in your life, you'll need energy.

Listen to what he has to say.,
Just say no.,
Tell him if you want to be friends.,
Keep your tone polite.When you have to say no to someone in person, it does matter how you say it.",How to Say No Politely To a Man Who Asks You Out1," Especially if the man who is asking you out is an acquaintance or a friend, you don’t want to interrupt him while he’s speaking to you.


Even if you know that he’s going to ask you out, and you want to say no, you don’t want to cut him off. Cutting him off while he’s talking makes you appear overly eager to reject him and rude.
Keep a respectful distance from him, and smile slightly. Don’t move closer to him, or give him any body language indication that you might be interested.;
, The worst thing you can do when you’re politely rejecting someone is to string him along. It might hard for him to hear “no” at first, but it will be much nicer in the long run. Don’t make excuses. You don’t need to lie. Unless it’s true, don’t tell him that you’re in a relationship. Don’t give him a line like, “I just got out of a relationship, and I’m not ready to date.” Even if this is true, it might give him false hope that you’ll change your mind, and that’s not fair to him.
Be straight forward, and polite. Say something like, “You seem like a nice guy, but I just don’t like you that way. I appreciate that you thought to ask me.” This makes your stance clear but still seems slightly softer than a blatant no.
Keep it short. You don’t need to give a long-winded rejection just to seem nice.

, If you genuinely would like to be friends with a guy who asks you out, let him know. This will soften your rejection, and let him know that you value him company, even if you’re not interested in him romantically.


If you don’t actually want to be friends with him, don’t say you want to be friends. Simply tell him you’re not interested and that you hope he has a nice day, and walk away.
If you do tell him you want to be friends, make sure he knows that your feelings about the situation aren’t going to change. You don’t want to give him any false hope. Say something like, “Sorry, I’m not interested in you in a romantic way, but I know someone else will be. I like talking with you, and I’d love to be friends.”

, This will affect how the man takes your answer.


Don’t come across as defensive. You have every right to choose who you date. Being defensive can make you sound more aggressive or disgusted than you mean to sound.
Speak with the tone of an apology. You want to sound open and apologetic, even while still being firm in your answer. Try to make eye contact with him at least once when you are speaking.

Give them a hand with your garbage can.,
Prepare snacks.,
Make a thank you note.,
Process waste materials correctly.,
Spread the word!",How to Thank a Garbage Worker," Meeting your garbage man and helping them lift up your curbside trash can is a great way to show appreciation. While the workers can handle it themselves, knowing that their community wants to support them with a simple gesture can go a long way in their morale.;
, There's nothing that says 'thanks' like a plate of cookies or a cool refreshing drink for them as they are working. Preparing foods easily packaged, in plastic bags and takeaway cups, keeps them on schedule while giving them something they can enjoy.

, Tape a thank you note, or a greeting card, on your trash can lid so it can be clearly visible on your trash can. Make sure it is clearly labeled so they can see it before it becomes more garbage!

, A great way to show appreciation for the waste industry is to make efforts to responsibly handle garbage. Donating goods, recycling renewable resources, and correctly handling hazardous waste is not only good for the garbage man, but also the environment!

, Raising awareness is always a good start to showing appreciation, and using social media it can be quite easy to raise awareness and, hopefully, give garbage men and women an easier time at their jobs.

Respond in a timely manner.If someone that you’re not interested in asks you out over a text message, email, or instant messaging, it can be tempting to put off responding to him.,
Use “I” statements.When you reject someone, using “I” statements can help keep the rejection about you, so the guy you’re speaking with doesn’t feel insulted or put down.,
Use proper text etiquette.If you are too informal when you’re telling the man who asked you out that you’re not interested, you can come across as rude.,
Stay honest.",How to Say No Politely To a Man Who Asks You Out2,"


Also, don’t give him the silent treatment, and hope he gets the point. The polite way to handle the situation is to give him a response.
Even though you want to respond in a timely manner, within the day that he sends the message, take a little time to think about what you want to

,


For example, instead of telling him, “Sorry, you aren’t really my type,” say something more like, “I’m really sorry. I just don’t see you in a romantic way.”
Or say: “I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you, but I don’t see this developing into anything further for me.”

, Even if you normally text or type in a manner that is very casual, try to be a bit more formal in your rejection.


Use complete sentences and words. Instead of typing, “No thx. I’m just not really interested in u like that,” Say, “Thanks for asking, but I just don’t see you that way.”
Add something polite after your rejection. This can help you end the conversation and also soften the blow. Write something like, “Sorry. Wish you the best, John!”

, Often, it is easier to lie over text than it is to lie in person. It can be tempting to come up with excuses to let yourself off the hook, but in the long run, it is always better to lead with the truth.Don’t leave your answer open-ended. Make sure that he won’t think you might be interested in the future. Make your answer final. Even if you do want to be friends, make sure you say, “I don’t see myself having romantic feelings for you, but I’d love to be friends!” instead of “Do you mind if we just stay friends right now?”
Even though you want to be final and firm when you send your message, also try to find something positive to say. For example, say, “I appreciate that you asked me because I’ve enjoyed talking to you, but I just don’t have romantic feelings for you.”

Speak in a friendly way and be straightforward.It is often more difficult to reject someone after a date than it is to reject someone you’ve never gone out with.,
Tell him sooner rather than later.,
Keep your distance.",How to Say No Politely To a Man Who Asks You Out3," Sometimes, however, it takes a date to figure out that you really aren’t interested.


Say something like, “I’m sorry. I just didn’t really feel a connection on our date. Hope you find someone great!”
If you aren’t attracted to him but want to be friends say, “I had a lot of fun with you, but I didn’t really feel a romantic connection. Would you like to be friends with me?” Asking him if he wants to be friends is straightforward and lets him know that even though you don’t want to date, you still appreciate interactions with him.

, Once you know that you’re not into a guy, you should let him know. The longer you wait to tell him you don’t want to go out again, the more difficult it will become.


If you’ve only been out on a date or two, it’s fine to tell him you’re not interested in a text message.That way, you can craft a tactful message, and he doesn’t have to feel embarrassed in person.
However, if you know you’re not interested at the end of your first date, go ahead and let him know. Before you part ways, say something like, “Hey. Just so you know I don’t think there’s really anything here for me, but I’m glad we got the chance to go out.” This will save you from agonizing over when to tell him.

, Once you’ve told him that you’re no longer interested, don’t keep talking to him. Even if you both want to be friends, it can be good to have a little distance at first.


If he continually texts you after you’ve rejected him, it’s okay to ignore the messages.
If you do talk to him, be careful to avoid flirting or confusing him.

A behind-the-back hug can also be a good way to hug a guy hello. This sort of hug says, “you are mine,” so it should be reserved for someone you’re already close to.

Rest your face against his back or shoulder and hold him firmly but gently (it’s a hug, not a wrestling hold).

, A big part of what separates friendly hugs from romantic hugs is the amount of time you spend in each other’s arms. Spend a moment enjoying the feeling of his body against yours. Take a deep breath, and let it out with a slight sigh., Make eye contact and smile again as you break apart. If you are feeling especially affectionate, you might wrap your fingers in his as you separate, and give him a flirty look as you swing your arm gently for a moment before dropping his hand.A common way to signify the end of a hug is to give someone’s back a quick rub or pat.

If you believe someone cut in front of you in line, relax and don't be a jerk.",How to Practice Supermarket Checkout Etiquette," Express lanes are created for people who have a certain amount of items, such as a little snack or a little handful of groceries. This limit may be set between 6 to 15 (on average), depending on the store. Cashiers will probably look down at customers who have more than the limit and try to use the express lane to get out quicker.;
, Between the conveyor belt and the store aisles, people need to get through. Leave about a shopping cart length of space between the last person at the conveyor belt and yourself. Like traffic intersections, you may move forward if there's sufficient room for you and your cart on the checkout side.

, While waiting in line, please be sure that you have everything you need and anything that you do not want. Avoid giving cashiers food, especially perishable items, because you have changed your mind at the last minute.

, Coupons that need to be subtracted manually with the specific item can set things back a little if the cashier is unaware of it. Be prepared to give any membership or store club cards to the cashier in advance. It saves time and the savings can be subtracted as the items gets swiped.

, If there is no bagger at the check-out station that you're on, it's in good faith to bag your groceries instead of waiting for the cashier to ring up everything and then have to sort and bag themselves.

, Huffing and getting impatient will make it feel like a longer line. Read a magazine or distract yourself in another positive way. Don't scan other lines to see how fast they're moving or how many people there is in a line. These thoughts will probably cause you to move into another line; a position that may or may not be better than the previous line you were in.

, A polite greeting followed by a short conversation will make the transaction pass faster for the both of you.

, There is nothing worse than taking a step back and hitting someone's cart because they are too close. Think of when you are driving, do you like people to tailgate? Its the same with shopping carts.

, If the cashier says ""Yes"", move into that line. This is not line cutting.

, Take a deep breath and go to your happy place and enjoy an extra minute of meditation.

Text messages should not become discussions.,





Avoid texting while intoxicated.,





Do not text without permission.",How to Practice Text Etiquette," Many phones come with sound levels such as ""vibrate,"" ""loud,"" ""soft,"" or a combination of the two. Have a habit of changing the volume tone to a low level or, better yet, silent. Keep doing this habit so that you have practice of changing it back and forth once you are in a comfort zone of having a loud ring tone or alert.
, Places that restrict people from using cell phones to call should be practiced while texting people. If sound disruption is the issue, for example, a library or waiting room at the doctor's clinic, then placing the phone on either silent or vibrate would be acceptable for you to continue texting., If you are chatting amongst a group of people or one person at a coffee shop or taking a walk somewhere, try to ignore texting as much as possible until the party leaves or you have gone somewhere alone such as a restroom. If the text is very important, apologize to your party first, then text. Never make it seem like your phone is more important than their presence., Texting should stay short, but still getting the point across. Avoid dragging text messages over two pages, which is the time to just call the person and explain the matter to them. You also don't want them to wait longer than expected for a text and then bomb them with pages of your reply., SMS is defined as ""Short Messaging Service."" This means some phones are only capable of a limit of characters in a text (about 160 is the average). If the sent text has more than the limit, some of the message may be either cut off or sent into 2 or more text messages towards the receiver of the message., Acronyms and abbreviations are the fastest way to get a message across, but knowledge of what they are comes with it. Think about if they would or wouldn't understand it. If they wouldn't, don't use it., Texting is a method to get a quick message or a very short conversation across. Don't end up spending more than enough time texting; if the conversation strays on, or is very important, then it's time to call the person., The last thing you want is true feelings about a boss or an ex coming out in public. It may sound fun to do while tipsy or drunk, but not the next morning., Even today, not all plans come with unlimited texting. More than that, not everyone likes text messages. You could be sending a text message into a black hole or costing someone else money! Your 50 cents worth of text messages may not seem like a lot to you, but think about all the other people sending ""Happy Birthday"" and ""Merry Christmas"" texts as well - they could easily pay $10 for that month's texts. Is it fair to have them pay for your text or get unlimited texting for your benefit? If in doubt - call instead."

Check if any modifications would increase its appeal.,
Recommend for them to see if anyone else wants it.",How to Respond when Someone Dislikes Your Handmade Gift1," If the person’s response stemmed from an oversight on your behalf, then it might be a good idea to apologize. For example, you prepared cookies with gluten for someone who has celiac disease, or you hand-painted a wall art canvas saying ""Home is wherever I'm with you"" to someone who just announced a divorce. Don’t be too hard on yourself, and, certainly, refrain from over-apologizing.


Say, “Gee, I didn’t realize…” or “I’m sorry, I forgot about your condition.” Keep it short and sweet and change the topic.;
, A healthy dose of laughter can often rescue anyone from an uncomfortable situation.Let's say, you presented your gift to a friend only to have it tear up, break, or be completely useless. You gave it your best shot, but your skills just weren't up to par. Graciously laugh it off rather than making the receiver have to nurse your wounds. You may even be able to convince them it was a gag gift after all by following with a just-in-case present.


You might say, ""Yikes! Well, when I knitted this, I imagined it actually fitting--not simply going over only one arm...Maybe I just started a trend!"" or you could follow with ""Just joking! Here's your real gift...you do like scented candles, right?""

, Sometimes, people aren’t receptive to gifts because they would have preferred something else. Maybe your daughter wanted the latest technology gadget for her birthday so she is underwhelmed by the carefully-knitted sweater you gave her. Or, perhaps a coworker would have enjoyed a gift card, but you presented a more practical gift of handmade kitchenware.


Simply because it’s not exactly what they wanted doesn’t mean that your gift is any less helpful. Try not to let their indifferent reaction make you forget that. You might say, “I know this may not be what you wanted, but I heard you say a while back how you needed these…”, In some cases, the slightest tweak could turn an unsatisfactory gift into a personal item that someone cherishes forever. Find out what the person dislikes, and see if you can make the desired alterations.


For instance, if you made a dress for your mother that resembles a tent, take new measurements in order to bring in the seam. If it fits her better, she might be pleased after all., If all else fails, don’t allow your hard work to go to waste. Politely suggest that the person re-gift the item to someone they think might enjoy it. That way your handmade gift finds an owner who will justly treasure it.


”Well, if you’re not a fan of this green scarf, feel free to re-gift it to someone else. Maybe Sarah? This green would really complement her eyes.”"
"
Resist jumping to conclusions.,
Don’t let your pride ruin the moment.,
Reap the benefits of giving.,
Practice self-compassion.",How to Respond when Someone Dislikes Your Handmade Gift2," So you presented a gift and the receiver didn't really respond how you expected them to. Before you over-react, consider that you are bound to attach more meaning to something you made yourself than to something you purchased from a store.


It's possible the person could actually like the gift and simply not know how to express their gratitude. Or, maybe that jaw-drop symbolized them being amazed that you crafted something so perfectly ""them""--not astonishment that you would give them something so horrific.

, It happens to the best of us—even seemingly expert gift-givers miss the mark every now and then. In the end, you had good intentions. So, remember it’s the thought that counts. Being too frustrated with yourself places you in the category of bad gift-giver.Getting caught up in whether someone actually likes your gift detracts from the point of giving. Don’t attach too much meaning to someone disliking the gift. Just be grateful that you were able to give. Besides, some people are just really hard to please.

, Becoming distraught because the person didn’t like the gift takes away from the positive gains you get from giving. In fact, researchers have found that givers receive even more positive benefits than those who receive.


Giving is typically a selfless act. In addition to boosting your connection with others, you feel grateful for having the ability to give and you can even start a chain of giving, in which others are inspired to follow your lead. What’s more, being generous even has a positive effect on health. Science shows us that giving can lower stress, increase immunity, and lead to a longer life., No matter how you save face after a lackluster response, it may still hurt your feelings a bit. That’s perfectly normal and human. Be kind to yourself in this moment and attend to your feelings.


Take some time alone to lick your wounds and show compassion to yourself. If you have a desire to cry, do so. If you feel slightly embarrassed, acknowledge it. Give yourself a hug, and repeat “You are a caring, compassionate person. Even though you didn’t get the reaction you hoped for, you still did a good thing.”"

Plan a white elephant gift exchange.,
Be sensible.,
Consult with the person beforehand for guidance.,
Practice on the item a few times before gifting.",How to Respond when Someone Dislikes Your Handmade Gift3," Are you feeling deflated because your handmade gift missed the mark this year? Why not suggest to your friends and family to host a ""Yankee Swap"" or ""White Elephant"" exchange next year? These gift-giving games are light-hearted ways to get rid of undesirable gifts in a fun and relaxed environment.


These games involve re-gifting tacky or off-the-mark gifts or selecting a price range to purchase new gifts. All the gifts are placed in a pile and every attendee gets a number. The first person goes to the pile and selects a gift, and so on until everyone has a gift. The fun part is, at the end, you can choose to exchange with someone if you'd prefer their gift. This is an exciting way to go about gift-giving, without all the pressure.

, So you got a nifty new sewing machine and have been making clothes for everyone you know. Although you might enjoy the act itself, you can’t expect others to necessarily like what you make. A lot of personalization and creativity goes into handmade gifts, and they won’t mean the same for everyone.


Next time around, read your loved ones to determine which people are better sports for handmade gifts. Do some people express creativity or make homemade gifts already? They may be better candidates for your heartfelt gifts than someone who generally buys everything they own from high-end boutiques or stores., Your gesture could have fallen flat because you were more intent on it being a surprise rather than seeking any involvement from the other person. When a gift requires a lot of time, energy, or money to make, get the intended receiver’s opinion to verify you’re headed in the right direction.


For instance, you might ask the person’s favorite color, scent, or fabric to guide your designs without giving away what you’re making. Or, you might be straightforward like, “Hey, Randy, I wanted to demonstrate my pottery skills and design you a vase. Do you have any preferences on colors or shapes?”, As hard as it is to accept, your gift may not have been well-received because it wasn’t very well-crafted. While you may have put your best foot forward, the end result may have fallen short. If your handmade gift was one of few in the early stages of learning a craft, it may be best to hold off on gifting these items until you have increased your mastery.

Be aware of your surroundings.,
Stick to one side of the sidewalk.,
Avoid using your phone while walking.,
Use consideration when listening to music.,
Be respectful of those with visible injuries or disabilities.,
Excuse yourself or apologize promptly if you accidentally walk into another person.,
If you see a person in front of you drop something, quickly pick it up and return it to them.,
Don't stop all of a sudden.,
Let people pass you.,
Maintain a safe distance from the person walking in front of you.,
Keep pets under control.",How to Practice Sidewalk Etiquette," Always look around to see what is around you.


Look ahead for cyclists and walk on the other side to give them room to pass.
When you're crossing a road and a driver about to turn is allowing you to walk first, thank him/her by making eye contact and giving a polite smile and wave. Remember that in marked crosswalks, pedestrians have the right of way when the respected signal is for them.;
, Avoid walking in the middle or changing sides if you do not need to. This allows people moving faster than you (like bicyclers and joggers) to pass you. If you live in a country where people drive on the right side of the road, walk on the right side of the sidewalk, and vice versa.

, It's okay to answer an occasional text or change a song, but don't go updating your Facebook status or uploading a picture on Instagram. Not only is it dangerous (because you'll lose your focus and inadvertently walk into hazards), but it's quite inconsiderate when you're walking more slowly than the people behind you (you might run into them or something).


If you're waiting to cross an intersection, use that time to check your messages before you start walking again.
Make a playlist of the songs you want to listen to during your walk before you leave to avoid constantly changing songs.

,


Keep the volume level so that you're still able to hear external sounds, like bicycle bells and car horns. Many people use one earbud, but this may carry a hazard (see Warnings).
Resist the urge to sing along. Unless you're a superstar, the people behind you are probably not going to want to listen to you.
Don't play loud, eardrum-blasting music. You may be a metal-head, but people around you may not want to hear the faint guitar riffs coming from your headphones.

,


Don't stare at them as you walk by. Similarly, don't look at them and then look away as if you're trying to avoid eye contact. It makes them feel very uncomfortable and insecure.
If someone in a wheelchair is in your path, shift to the other side a good amount of length before they pass you. Never wait until the last minute or wait for them to make the move around you.
Even though it's not a disability, treat people with strollers the same way as people in wheelchairs.

, Avoid getting into conversation as the other person may be running late; just smile politely and continue walking.

, Get their attention by saying ""Excuse me"" and/or lightly tapping them on the shoulder. It doesn't hurt to do a good deed once in a while... that person may be especially grateful if it's a wallet that they dropped!

, This might inconvenience people walking behind you, who might bump into you by mistake. Instead of just stopping, ""pull over"" like you would in a car. Find a spot where there's not foot traffic and stop there.

, If you notice someone behind you is walking at a faster pace than you are, pull off to the side when you get a chance so they can pass you and go on at their pace in front of you., Walking too close might lead to you stepping on the other person's heels, which is not acceptable.

,


Keep pets on a tight leash. Lengthy leashes can quickly become a menace, as they trip pedestrians.
Train your dog not to go wild if he sees a cat strolling by, or get distracted by any other kind of distraction.
Remember to train your pet not to poop on the sidewalk. Obvious as this may seem, sidewalks in some countries are littered with dog poop.

Accept your own worth.,
Be honest about what you want.,
Examine yourself as a giver.,
Consider the different gifts you receive.,
Identify and accept your inherent gifts.,
Practice thanking someone for a tangible gift.,
Practice thanking someone for an abstract gift.,
Verbalize your gratitude.,
Receive with open body language.,
Resist the urge to deny the gift.,
Don't get carried away.,
Give credit where credit is due.,
Follow the appropriate protocol.,
Avoid competing with the giver.",How to Receive," To become better at receiving, you'll need to accept the fact that you are just as worthy of receiving as anyone else is. Accept that the ability to receive is not a selfish or conceded attribute.


At a more basic level, you'll need to remove yourself from the giving-receiving dichotomy and learn to accept yourself simply for being who you are. You are enough, no matter how much you give or how much you receive.;
, Ask yourself what it is that you really want. Identify any fears that hold you back from receiving your desires, then work on releasing those fears so that you can embrace your desires more fully.Specifically label the fears that prevent you from receiving. For instance, if you fear that you aren't talented enough to find success or beautiful enough to love, identify that fear and argue against it. You won't be able to accept the gifts you want unless you can first remove the lies saying you don't deserve them.

, Determine whether or not you truly give to others with an open heart. If you are able to give freely, it will be easier for you to embrace the related practice of receiving freely.


Think about the gifts you typically give to others and ask yourself what motivates you. If you give out of a sense of obligation or superiority, your heart is probably in the wrong place. Similarly, if you expect to receive each time you give, you'll need to learn how to give without clinging to the hope of receiving.
Make a habit of giving to others. Offer praise without expecting it in return. Show consideration without wishing to be acknowledged for it. Once you learn to give openly, you'll be able to accept that others can give to you openly, as well.

, There are many different types of gifts you will receive in your life. Some will be tangible, while others are more abstract. By identifying the different types of gifts you'll receive, you can prepare yourself to accept each type more thoroughly.


Tangible gifts are usually rather obvious and include things like presents, money, and greeting cards.
Abstract gifts might be less obvious, though. They include things like compliments, words of support and encouragement, acceptance, a listening ear, and advice.

, Identify one quality of yours that you feel pleased about. While meditating on that quality, practice saying “thank you” for it out loud.The quality you identify can be something you were born with, like a great smile, or something you developed, like a good sense of humor.
Tell yourself, ""thank you for having a great smile"" or ""thank you for having a great sense of humor.""
You might feel bashful, depressed, or angry with yourself at first. Push beyond these self-judgments, though, and continue to repeat to yourself, ""thank you for this gift.""
Repeat this exercise until the judgments stop and you can honestly feel pleased and thankful for the gift you've identified.

, Find a physical gift that someone has already given to you. While holding onto that gift, practice saying “thank you” for it until doing so feels natural.


This gift should be something you can physically hold or touch. Look at it, feel it in your hands, and say, ""Thank you for this gift. I accept it.""
As before, you might begin to feel guilty, angry, or depressed as you think about having received this gift. Continue to repeat this exercise until these negative judgments end, leaving only gratitude in their place.

, Think of a sentiment or other abstract gift someone has already given to you. Focus on that gift in your mind, then practice saying “thank you” for it until gratitude overrides any other sentiment.


This time, the gift must be something you cannot physically hold onto. It can be a compliment, the gift of reassurance, or something similar. The idea is to choose a sentiment-based gift so that you can learn to accept the love behind the gifts you receive.
Think of the gift and, as before, say ""Thank you for this gift. I accept it."" Repeat the exercise until your gratitude overwhelms all of the negative emotions might initially experience.

, When receiving a gift of any kind, you should absolutely tell the giver “thank you” for it.""Thank you"" is the best response you can offer no matter what you receive. Expressing thanks demonstrates your desire to accept the gift, compliment, or sentiment while still being humble about it.
If simply saying ""thanks"" feels awkward to you, follow the phrase with a secondary phrase that continues to express gratitude. Try something like, ""I appreciate the compliment,"" or, ""That's very thoughtful of you.""

, Your nonverbal response is just as important as your verbal response. At minimum, you should receive the vast majority of gifts with a smile.


Smiling indicates happiness, and the point of any gift is to make the receiver happy. Smiling when you receive something allows the giver to know that the gift was appreciated, regardless of whether the smile is shy and polite or huge and enthusiastic.
Aside from smiling, you should also do things like maintaining eye contact and leaning in toward the giver. Even if you feel uncomfortable, you should avoid crossing your arms, looking away, or appearing disinterested.

, If you have a hard time receiving, your natural reaction might be to deflect or reject a gift that is offered to you. Doing so is actually more likely to cause a negative reaction than receiving the gift would cause, however.


Put yourself into the giver's shoes and think of how it feels when someone denies a compliment or suspiciously rejects a gift. Most people will either be saddened when they realize the receiver doesn't know his or her own value, or frustrated by the implication that the gift or sentiment was somehow dishonest., It is also possible, of course, to seem conceited when you receive something. Failing to express genuine gratitude may make you appear egotistical, which can also cause a negative response from the giver.


Appearing egotistical can usually be avoided as long as you stick to the standard “thank you” script. You should still avoid following your thanks with words of self-promotion, though. For instance, if someone compliments your appearance, avoid replying with, “Thanks; I get that all the time,” or, “Thanks; I know.”

, A fair, appropriate way to demonstrate humility when you receive something like a compliment or a reward is to acknowledge others who put you into a position to receive the gift.


For instance, if you receive a compliment about a project that was successfully completed as part of a team effort, tell the giver something along the lines of, ""The entire team put in a lot of effort, and it wouldn't have been possible without everyone's input. Thank you for acknowledging us.""

, Depending on the situation, it might be socially appropriate to follow up with a more formal thanks or return gift. This principle won't always apply, but following it when convention deems it appropriate can help you feel more comfortable with the gift you received.


This is a big issue to consider when receiving gifts for formal occasions, like weddings and baby showers. As you receive the gift in person, a quick “thank you” is appropriate. Later on, you should also follow up with a more formal thank you note acknowledging the gift in greater detail.

, No matter what the circumstances are, you should never turn the practice of giving into a competition. Giving and receiving are two sides of the same action, and there is no shame in being on either side of that action.


This can be especially tempting when receiving compliments. If someone compliments your work, don't return the praise by offering higher praise. For instance, you shouldn't reply with, ""Thank you, but you could've done a better job."" Even if you believe such a statement, it is best to accept the praise without argument.

Question yourself.,
Come to terms with your decision before moving further.,
Gather together all of his/her things.,
Ask him/her to meet you somewhere quiet and private.,
Be kind, honest, direct, and firm.,
End contact.,
Don't trash talk your ex.",How to Break Up Your First Relationship," What is it about the relationship that is making you so unhappy? It's important that you are clear, so that you can make it clear to your soon-to-be ex.


Is it because you argue all the time?
Have you met someone new, whom you are interested in pursuing?
Do you feel trapped without enough freedom? Are you being smothered?
Are things just moving too fast? Are you tired of being pressured into having sex when you feel you just aren't ready yet?
Have you grown tired of the relationship? Are you simply not looking forward to spending time with him/her any more?;
, After you understand your negative feelings about the relationship, make up your mind to absolutely end the relationship, and move on to the next step.

, You will need to return all of his or her stuff - albums, earrings, jackets, books, watches, cameras, rings. Put it in a box and take it with you to your meeting. It's hard enough for him or her, probably - knowing that s/he must return and face you later to get those items will cause unnecessary pain, and will be uncomfortable for you, too. Taking it with you will help make this a clean break.

, Your former love should be given the dignity and respect that privacy affords. If your ex is prone to violent outbursts, you must choose a neutral location, such as a coffee shop or outdoor cafe. But if at all possible, try to keep things low key and between the two of you.

, State clearly that you've called him or her here to end the relationship. You may not need to recite a list of reasons - if you aren't asked to, don't. Stay as calm and be as nice about it as possible while understanding that, if this is a total shock to the other person, there will be some shock, disbelief, maybe anger, and certainly, pain. S/he may express anger or outrage at your decision, but stay calm and firm, and keep on point. Don't allow yourself to be pulled into an argument or shouting match about who was more at fault, or who is the worse person here.


Give reasons for the breakup only if you need to (s/he asks you why you are leaving) - s/he may already have suspected you weren't happy and that a breakup was coming, so s/he may not want to hear any more about it. When giving reasons for the breakup, don't launch into a laundry list. Choose the one or two most inarguable causes, and let that be enough. You want to help him or her to understand what went wrong, especially if some behavior on his or her part was the deal breaker. But you don't want to just beat him/her down into the ground with a long recitation of his/her faults.
Try something like: ""It just comes down to basic incompatibility, Clark. I'm more open, and you're more secretive - it's almost like you're hiding something from me, and it drives me crazy. I want the chance to meet someone who is more transparent with me, and doesn't feel a need to keep secrets."" or , ""You are my first real relationship, Lana, and that's the problem. I want the chance to have other relationships. If we were really meant to be those rare first loves that last forever, I think I would feel more sure of that. But as much as I've cared for you, I feel I haven't experienced enough to make that lifelong commitment. I feel like there's something or someone out there waiting for me. I'll always care for you, and I'm sorry, I know this is hurting you, but I need to go.""


If things start getting out of hand tell him/her that you don't wish to argue or fight but that you have made up your mind and it is final. Give him/her the box of his or her things, then turn around and walk away before things escalate into an actual fight.
If s/he is crying tell her/him that you are sorry to hurt him or her, but that this is your decision. Get up and leave. Let his/her friends do the comforting.

, If you have truly made up your mind to break up with him/her, it is best to stay away from him/her, refuse all calls from him/her, refuse to meet with him/her or talk with him/her. For some people, getting you to take calls, return texts, meet with him/her, etc. are a way of controlling you. Every moment they can get you to spend with them is a win for them, so don't do it. Let the break be clean and definite - and final.



Breaking up is like a band aid on your arm, you can pull it off slowly a little bit at a time and it will hurt for a long time, or you can pull it off quickly and all at once and it will all be over quickly and the hurt will be less painful and more merciful in the long run.

, Say nothing against your ex, and don't allow your friends to trash talk him/her, either. Instead, take the high road, and hope that's what gets back to your ex - and not a lot of mean backbiting. If s/he starts trash talking you, and you hear about it, just respond with something like, ""S/he must still really be hurting. That makes me feel bad for him/her.""


It is your and his/her private business and no one else's - don't broadcast it. It's bad form.
If he/she threatens you with violence or begins stalking you, immediately notify the police or, if you are a minor, tell your parents or guardians. Breaking up is sad, but it is better to end a relationship than to live in a dating relationship that is no longer satisfying. (However if you are married, or if there are children involved, it is better to try your best to work things out and if necessary get professional help in doing so. A failed marriage is much worse than a failed ""first relationship"").

Look for someone else, if you're interested.",How to Break Up with Your Middle School Boyfriend Considerately," While this may seem easy, a lot of thought needs to be put into this decision. If you break up with them, you've ended it, and you'll look foolish if you decide you were wrong and go running back to them. If your boyfriend ditches you for his friends, if you like someone else, if he texts you all the time but won't talk to you in person, or if you simply feel uncomfortable with him, it's time for the relationship to end. But if he's just been frustrating this week, then maybe you should hold on a little longer and see if it improves.;
, Once you make the decision, you can't go back. Try to think about it, hard, for at least a week before you break up (unless you sense that it is turning into an abusive relationship. Then, as hard as it may be, you need to tell someone and get help).


Only ask friends for help if they know a lot about your relationship and are really close with you.

, Never break up with someone before their birthday, Valentine's Day, the winter holidays, or even your birthday, as they may have bought an expensive present.

,, You don't want to make him think your decision was out of the blue.

, Only ask for an item or two at a time. You'll be able to get the rest back after you've broken up, unless you are in a long-distance relationship. If your boyfriend lives far away, ask him during your breakup on the phone if he will mail your items back.

, Don't ask anyone untrustworthy as they will spread the word that you're planning to break up. Only ask close, trusted friends. Keep the number of people you talk to to a minimum. Three is a good number.

, This may cause him to dump you before you can break up with him.

, If you're in a long-distance relationship, call your significant other (tips for breaking up over the phone are given below). Never break up over a text message or social media. The worst possible way is to change your Facebook status to ""single"" and wait for them to find out.

, If possible, do it somewhere public but quiet, like a park, so you can say what you need to say and then leave, texting an adult when the conversation is over to come pick you up. However, do not make it seem like a date. That is just getting his hopes up.

, These suggest that you're willing to talk about it. Saying, ""I need to tell you something"" is more definitive and final, because you're telling him your decision and not allowing yourself to be talked out of it. It's not going to be a discussion or a debate.

, Tell him in your own words not that you want to break up, but that you actively ARE breaking up with him. An acceptable line is ""Our relationship isn't working anymore.""

, Chances are, you just don't feel for him anymore, in which case you can tell him he's a good guy but he's not right for you. If you have a reason, such as he texts you all the time but ignores you in school, or sometimes he makes you sad with things he says, tell him gently. Do not get too into it or act like it is a joy to bring up his faults in the relationship.

,  The relationship is over and his feelings aren't your responsibility anymore, no matter how harsh that sounds. If you've made mistakes in the relationship, bring them up and say that it wasn't just his fault that the relationship petered out. However, don't make him feel like he should be comforting you. Just as it isn't your responsibility to comfort him, it isn't his responsibility to comfort you.

, No matter how many times you've heard it in a book: ""We can still be friends, though,"" it isn't a good idea until a few months have passed and you've blown off some steam.

, You have nothing to be sorry for.

,  Say what you need to say and then part ways.  Talking for an hour about what an awful boyfriend he was will only cause hard feelings.

,, You can tell him what you need to tell him without awkward pauses or silences.

,,, Saying mildly comforting things is okay.

,, Spend time with family and friends. Focus on school. Pick up a hobby. Ignore his texts and calls as they may be asking to get back together. If his constant texts or calls are overwhelming, block his number.

, He shouldn't have any problem giving them to you.

,  Saying ""we decided together that our relationship wasn't working,"" is a lie, and he's not going to appreciate it. Tell people (only if they ask), ""I broke up with him,"" and end it there.

, You're going to get a few angry comments or stares from his closest friends. Ignore them. If there are threats, report them to the principal.

, It is normal to miss your ex after you've broken off the relationship.  Don't allow yourself to go back to him unless you agree that you are both ready.

, If you're not, that's okay. You've got your whole life ahead of you.

, You must decide whether your relationship is worth ending.You have to think about the future for not only yourself, but also your partner.


Never avoid breaking up with somebody because you are afraid of being single. The only way you can find the right person for you is to get out there and be on your own.
Never avoid breaking up with somebody because you are afraid of hurting his or her feelings. Breaking up may seem cruel, but continuing to be with somebody you are not in love with anymore is even worse.Don't suggest a ""break."" Breaks are usually just a segue into a full-on breakup; if you feel that you need a break from the person you're with, then chances are that you actually want to break up but are too afraid of being alone. Rather than asking for a break, wait until you're ready to fully end the relationship and then do it.

, If you live together, then decide on who will move out and who will stay (of course, you may want to leave this open to discussion). If you expect your partner to move out, you will need to allow ample time for him/her to find other living arrangements, and should find somewhere else to stay during that time.


Ask your parents or close friends whether you can stay with them for a few days, or rent a room at a hotel for a couple of nights.
If you don't live together but see each other daily at either work or school, then you will need to consider whether it's worth re-adjusting your schedule/circumstances. If you think that seeing each other on a regular basis is going to make moving on difficult, then consider changing jobs or rearranging your class schedule to avoid having to constantly interact with this person.

, There's never going to be a perfect time to break up with the person you love, but there are definitely certain situations that you should avoid. Among them are the following:


When your partner is dealing with a personal crisis like a death in the family, diagnosis of an illness, or loss of a job. If he or she is in the middle of a crisis, allow some time to pass before you break up to avoid adding on extra pain.
In the middle of a fight. Never end a relationship in the heat of the moment; you may end up saying things that you don't really mean, and come to regret your decision once the argument is over.
In front of other people. If you choose to break up with him or her in public, be sure to at least find a quiet table or corner to have the conversation. Remember that one or both of you may become very emotional and need some privacy.
Over text, e-mail, or the telephone. If you really love this person, then you owe it to him or her to have the discussion face-to-face.

The only exception to this rule is if you are in a long-distance relationship and seeing each other in person is impractical. Even then, try to do it over Skype or the telephone rather than the more impersonal venues of text or email.



, In other words, don't surprise this person with the news by blurting it out in the middle of a conversation or while he or she is busy doing something else.


Pull your partner aside and say ""I want to talk to you about something,"" or ""I think that we should talk.""
You may want to send an e-mail or text message to your partner asking to talk prior to getting together. This will give him or her ample time to emotionally prepare for a serious conversation. You do not want to break up with the person through text, but let him or her know a serious conversation will happen in near future.

, These statements more effectively deflect feelings of judgement, and concisely get your point across. For example, you may say something like:


""I really feel like kids are not part of my plan."" This might be a better way of saying: ""You want kids and I don’t.""
""I think I need to spend more time on my own right now."" This might be a better way of saying: ""You want to spend too much time together.""
""I need to think about my future."" This might be a better way of saying ""We are not going anywhere.""

, Everybody deserves to be told the truth, but at the same time, there are certain things that will only hurt your partner's feelings without serving any constructive purpose.


If there is something explicitly wrong with the relationship, like having incompatible interests, then you should tell your partner that.Being honest and eliminating some of the mystery may help the person move on more quickly rather than constantly wondering why you ended the relationship and what he or she could have done differently. This might be something like: ""I know you are really into going out all the time, but I just don't enjoy it. I don't think we'll continue to be happy with this incompatibility.""
Find a nice way to phrase your criticisms. If you love the person, then you should make an effort to protect his or her self-esteem. For example, instead of saying ""I don't find you attractive anymore,"" say something like ""I no longer feel that there's any chemistry between us.""
Reassure your partner that you still love and genuinely care for him or her. This will help ease some of the feelings associated with being rejected. You might say something like: “I think you’re a really great person. You’re very smart and have a lot of ambitions. I just think my ambitions are different.”

, If you genuinely want to stay friends with this person, then you should express the sentiment at the end of the breakup. Again, be prepared for the possibility that he or she will be too hurt to stay friends with you, at least initially. Respect your partner's needs and give him or her space if needed.


Don't continue to call or text your ex on a regular basis once the breakup is over. This will send mixed signals and make moving on impossible. Even if you have decided to stay friends, you should take some time apart just after the breakup during which you don't see or speak to each other.
After some time has passed after the breakup and the feelings are not quite as raw, consider opening up to your ex. This might be a group outing (it might be best to avoid a one-on-one outing to avoid sending mixed signals.) You might want to try and say something like: “Hey, some friends and I are going to watch that new movie. Do you want to come?”

, Though it may seem impossible to totally cut off contact with somebody you love, staying in contact constantly will actually make things a great deal more painful. If you feel tempted, block your partner’s number from your phone. Block his or her username from social media sites. This will help with the temptation., Even if you were the one to initiate the breakup, you may still feel hurt or loss. These are normal feelings and should be acknowledged to help heal.

, Love can be complicated. After a breakup with someone that you loved, you may feel a loss. This might be an indication that you should take some time to get to know yourself and to readjust to being single before jumping into a new relationship.

, Do not be afraid to seek out emotional support from those in your life. This might include your close friends and family. Chances are, they will empathize with what you are going through and will offer support or advice.

Make sure that you are 100% positive that you want to break up with him.,
Don't ask for a break.,
Choose an appropriate time and place to break up with him.,
Break up with him in person.,
Be absolutely clear about your intentions.,
Decide how much you want to explain.,
Stay kind, caring and firm.,
Give him space.",How to Break Up with Your Boyfriend," Before breaking up with him, try to imagine your life without him, and be prepared for the possibility that you might not be able to maintain a friendship. Even if you break up, realize you made a mistake, and get back together, you will have caused irreversible damage to the relationship by breaking up in the first place.


Consider the advantages and disadvantages of single life. On the one hand, you will be free to date and flirt with whoever you want, but on the other hand, you will probably be spending more holidays and evenings alone.
If you are truly unhappy with the relationship, don't let the thought of being alone prevent you from breaking up with him. One of the worst things you can do to both yourself and your boyfriend is to stay with him when you are unhappy. Staying with him will only delay the breakup, and the longer you wait, the more damage you will do to your relationship.;
, Asking for a break is just a bad way of saying that you want to break up. If you think you need a break from your boyfriend, then chances are that you want to break up with him but are too afraid of being single again.


Remember that asking for a break isn't any easier on him than telling him you want to break up, because it still connotes the fact that you are unhappy with the relationship.

, Sometimes it's not the breaking up, but rather, the method by which you chose to break up that truly hurts.


Don't break up with your boyfriend while he is dealing with a difficult personal problem like a death in the family, trouble at work, or other emotionally straining situation. This will be like kicking him while he is down.
Don't break up with him in the middle of an activity that neither of you can leave. For example, don't break up with him while you are dining at a restaurant, at the movie theater, or on a vacation together. Remember that immediately following the breakup, he will probably need to be alone for a few hours to compose himself.
Don't break up with him in front of other people. While this may seem like common sense, you should be careful that nobody can overhear the breakup conversation while it is happening. This will add unnecessary humiliation to the situation.
Don't break up during a fight. You might do or say things in the heat of the moment that you will both regret later. Wait until you can have a rational, adult conversation.

, Regardless of how long or short your relationship has been, your boyfriend deserves to be told in person. Don't send him a text, Facebook message, or email telling him that you want to break up.


While text or online messages may seem easier, remember that these messages don't allow you to convey emotion or tone. As a result, break-up texts come across as way more ""harsh"" than spoken words, even if you type out what you would have said word-for-word.
If you are in a long-distance relationship, then doing it over the phone or computer might be the only option. If this is the case, then write a heart-felt breakup letter that shows that you have given the breakup some thought. Don't keep it too short, as this shows carelessness, but don't make it too long, as this could be torturous for him.

, By this stage, beating around the bush will only confuse things and make it harder to say what needs to be said. Instead, be ready beforehand with some handy phrases that will explain just what you need to say. Some examples include:


""We've had some great times together. But lately I've not been feeling it and we've also had some pretty rough patches. I've come to the conclusion that our relationship isn't right for me and while you're a great guy, I just don't think we're destined for a long-term relationship. I'd like us to end on a good note today.""
""You're an amazing person, with so much going for you. I want you to know that I respect you and have had some great times with you. It's just that I don't feel the connection with you as a girlfriend that I'd like to feel and while I've tried to feel this, I've finally decided that it isn't going to work. I have had a great time, I'd love to stay friends but I can't honestly stay with you as your girlfriend anymore.""
""I'm feeling unhappy in our relationship and this has not changed for weeks/months. I've tried to make things work but now I just feel that it's not going to get over the hurdles and I don't want to drag things out any further. I'd like to end things between us today.""

, It's tough to break up and too much discussion about feelings and needs can open doors to him fighting for the relationship and having you give in to trying again. Respect the things he has to say and expect him to fight for the relationship (unless he also sees it as a moment of relief) and be ready to keep it simple by repeating that it just isn't working out for you.

, Show that his feelings do matter but that you're not budging from your position about the relationship ending. He needs to know that you're serious and mean what you say.


Be careful about saying that you'll stay friends. Sometimes it's appropriate, but other times it just strings along his hopes. You will need to judge the worth of this from the context of who you both are and how the break-up talk proceeds.
If you're dumping him because somebody else has attracted your eye, don't tell him this. If he asks whether that's behind the break-up, reassure him that it's because you don't feel the compatibility and that you're just not feeling this is a long-term relationship for you. There is no need to bring a third party into the break-up.

, Every relationship is different, but regardless of your unique situation, you should spend some time apart immediately after the breakup. Continuing to hang out on a daily basis will make it much more difficult for both of you to move on.


Consider telling him that you still want to be friends, but only if you mean it. If you do, then respect the fact that it might take him some time to feel comfortable spending time with you again. Don't force him to be your friend immediately.

This will help you to take stock of all of your options and analyze each one before deciding. To make your decision in a structured way, you may want to:Write a detailed definition the problem. Why do you want to break up with the person? Is it because of something that happened between the two of you? Or is it because of how you feel?
Make a list of your options. Is breaking up the only option? Or do you think there is potential for you and your significant other to work things out? If you are determined to break up with the person, then what are your options for breaking up?
Consider your options. Which option is most likely to bring about the best result? Think about what the risks and benefits of each of the options you have listed might be.
Choose and follow through. After you have analyzed each option, you can choose the one that you think will provide the best results. Then, put your plan into action. Make sure to reflect on the outcome of your decision and consider how you might improve your approach in the future.;
, Take enough time to think your decision through, and carefully weigh your reasons for wanting to break up. Make sure your decision is based on logic, not stress or anger. Once you pin down the exact reasons you’re leaving the relationship, you’ll have an easier time following through and defending your choice to your boyfriend or girlfriend.If your relationship is physically or emotionally abusive, you never need to feel guilty about breaking it off. You deserve safety and respect in your relationships.

, It’s only natural to feel guilty when you’re breaking up with someone who cares about you, but don’t let your guilt keep you in a relationship that makes you unhappy.


Delaying a breakup might be easier in the short term. But, in the long term, dragging a relationship out wastes everyone’s time and will hurt your partner more in the end., If you’re uncertain about whether breaking up is the right thing to do, an outside opinion can help shed some light on the situation. Ask someone who cares about you for an objective opinion on your relationship.Use your judgment when asking for advice. Choose someone who will keep your business private. You don’t want your partner to find out about the breakup from somebody else before they hear it from you.
You might bring up the subject by saying “Hey, sis, I wanted to talk to you about something. I love John and he loves me, but we seem to have grown apart. I don’t know what to do…”

, We have gut instincts for a reason. Your subconscious mind often picks up on more information than your conscious mind does, leading to feelings and intuitions you can’t explain. If you just can’t shake the sense that it’s time to break up, it’s probably best to heed your instincts., Once you’re certain that you want to break up, it’s best to get it over with as soon as possible. Don’t drag a dying relationship out unnecessarily. Getting the difficult conversation out of the way will put you on the path to recovery faster and save your partner from getting more invested in the relationship than they already are.Don’t spring “the talk” on your partner without any warning. Say something like, “I need to talk to you about something important. Can we meet up tomorrow evening?”
Do not break up via phone, text, or email unless you are concerned for your safety. Breaking up in person is much more considerate and respectful to your partner.

, Write out a list of all the points you want to cover if you’re afraid of forgetting something. Ask a trusted friend to role-play the breakup with you so you can rehearse what you want to say out loud.Breakups usually bring intense emotions to the surface for both people. Your boyfriend or girlfriend may get angry, cry, or try to talk you out of breaking up. Decide ahead of time how you will handle each of these responses, and practice staying firm in the face of these reactions while role-playing with your friend.

, Throughout the conversation, frame things in terms of how you feel and what you need. Avoid blaming your boyfriend or girlfriend for the breakup. This will take some of the sting out of your message and make it harder for them to argue with you.For instance, don’t say, “You don’t make me a priority in your life.” Instead, try saying something like, “I need a partner who makes time for me, and I don’t feel like you do that.”

, Your boyfriend or girlfriend will probably feel confused and hurt when you tell them you want to break up, and empty platitudes will only add insult to injury. Respect your partner’s feelings and their need for answers, and be straightforward about your reasons for ending the relationship.Resist the temptation to express your sorrow with a cliché like “It’s not you, it’s me” or something similar. Just say what you mean as directly as possible.

Studies have found that breakups are least painful when the person ending the relationship is kind, honest, and positive about the time they have spent with the other person.Emphasize ways the breakup benefits both of you. For instance, you might tell your partner, ""I think I would be happier if I dated someone whose personality is more compatible with my own.""

, Staying in contact with your ex will only keep feelings alive and prolong the heartache for both of you. Avoid going places you might run into them, delete their number from your phone, and resist the urge to look at their social media accounts. If you have any of their belongings, return them – preferably through a mutual friend – or get rid of them.Even if you want to stay friends with your ex, remember that you both need time and distance to heal after a breakup. Be respectful of your ex’s feelings and give them space to move on after the relationship ends.
Unfollowing or unfriending your ex on social media may also be a good option to reduce your reminders of them.

, After a breakup, it’s common to feel sad, stressed, and uncertain about the future. It might be tempting to call in sick at work and wallow in your feelings, but you’ll actually feel better if you stay busy and don’t skip your regular activities. Sticking to a routine can help preserve your sense of normalcy.If you don’t know what to do with yourself, try picking up a new hobby or joining a gym. Sometimes post-breakup pain can be a catalyst for personal development.

, You may have just ended one relationship, but don’t forget about all the other relationships in your life. Family and friends can be a source of strength and comfort while you’re working through the emotional fallout of a breakup.


Don’t hesitate to call up a friend or spend extra time around your loved ones if you’re feeling down. Simply say to a loved one, “I know it was for the best, but I don’t want to be alone right now. Do you want to come over and watch a movie?”, It’s usually not a good idea to get into a rebound relationship while your emotions are still raw. Instead, focus on healing and becoming the best version of yourself you can.


If you have any unresolved issues that played a part in your last breakup, work on addressing those before you re-enter the dating world. Becoming emotionally healthy will help you attract a better relationship in the future."

”I think you’re a great person.”
”I’ve been so lucky to have you in my life.”
”We've grown so much together.”

, No matter what it is, there needs to be a concrete reason for the breakup. Without a definite cause, there is a probable argument or a drawn out conversation.

”We simply argue too much. The relationship isn’t fun anymore.”
”You’re mean to me, and I’m just not happy.”
”The communication in our relationship is a one-way street. You never listen.”

, Do not preface the sentence with “I think” or “I believe.” Do not use a substitute like, “I think we need space.” Be very blunt. It’s important to get your point across without any interpretation, debate, or argument that will bring about doubt.


”I just don’t see any future between the two of us. We’ll be staying together for no reason.”, She may not want to hear it, but it’s important to end things as positively as possible.

End things quickly once you've made you decision.",How to Break Up with Your Boyfriend if You Are in Love with Him1," Breaking up with someone is hard. It is no easier when you still have feelings for him. However, sometimes relationships stall, grow apart, and become difficult to manage due to time or space apart. You can be in love with someone and still feel like you need to move on to a new stage of your life. If you're considering a break-up, ask yourself a few questions about yourself and the relationship. If you say no to most of the following, it may be time to move on:


Do you only want to break up because of present circumstances, like a recent fight or money troubles? If not, is it because of long-term problems?
Do you have second thoughts about breaking up, or have you been sure of your decision for a few weeks?
If your partner asked you for a second chance, would you say yes?
Do you see your partner in your life 6 months from now?;
, No doubt it may be hard, but if you get down your reasons down on paper, it makes it easier to convince yourself you need to get through with this. Don't worry about hurting anyone's feelings -- this paper is for you and you only. Brainstorm why you need to end things, considering the following reasons:


You can't give him the love he deserves. You may need to move for a new job, want to spend more time with your family, or have a hard time supporting his needs. If you truly love him but know that you can't/don't want be there for him, it's time to end it.
You've fallen in love with someone else. Unfortunately, you can't really control who you love. If you've got deep feelings for another, you need to end things with your current man before moving on.
You don't see yourself spending the rest of your life with him. This is especially important if he seems to plan his future around you. End things now instead of hoping you change your mind -- it won't happen.
You're unhappy. If the bad times outweigh the good, and the relationship weighs on your mind each day, it's time to move on. This isn't a phase -- this is relationship that has begun to go sour., Read your reasons for needing to break up with him and see if they still feel true. Did you dash that list off in the spur of the moment, or do you still feel the same way seven days later. If you're still sure of your decision to break-up, you've made the right one.

, Many people stay in relationships for too long because they're afraid of the emotional whiplash being alone will bring. You may understand that you'll be better in the long run, but the short-term pain makes breaking up seem unbearable. However, you've got to rip off the bandage sometimes, and it will get easier if you remind yourself of several key things:


You will not be alone forever. Being single does not mean you'll never find love again, even if it feels like you'll never find another ""perfect"" man.
Independence will make you stronger. Being alone is hard, but it forces you to grow in unexpected and important ways. You do not need your guy to be strong and happy., This may be one of the hardest things to do, especially if you've committed to ending the relationship, but you need to consider the good with the bad. Jot down why you love him, the reasons you're together, and the good times you've had. Remember, you will always have these memories, no matter what happens between you. If you make it through this trip down memory lane, but still know that it would be best to end things, then you'll know for sure that you've made the right decision.


Remember, it may be best to break up even if you still have feelings for him. You just want to be sure that the bad outweighs the good.

, The final hurdle to a break-up is often your worries about other people. What will our friends think? What will my parents think? How will we sort out our stuff? Most importantly, how will he feel? However, all of these worries are unimportant in comparison to your own happiness and emotional well-being. While this sounds selfish, it is ultimately the most thoughtful perspective you can adopt. If you're in a relationship that isn't working, you're going to take it out on each other with fights and arguments. Friends and family may get dragged in, and worries about your stuff can turn into possessiveness and secrecy. When you're ready to end things, all that matters is your decision to break up. The rest of the details will work themselves out.Sometimes a gut feeling -- ""This just isn't working"" -- is a perfectly acceptable reason for breaking up. Remember that you're doing this for you, not someone else.

, Know that if you don't break up with him right now - and you keep delaying - the situation you are in may grow worse in the future. You'll regret not taking action while you could have, and end up wasting both his time and yours in a meaningless relationship. It may hurt right now, but once you get this over with, you'll be happy you did. Once you go through with it, both parties can move on, but not before.


Remember -- it is better to be happy alone than miserable on your own."

Terminate your relationship before starting another.,
End all interaction.,
Avoid post-breakup gossip.",How to Break Up with Your Girlfriend over the Phone3," The reason some lines are more prevalent is that they have been used multiple times and are pretty broad-ranging.

There are some good conversation starters in the guides below for specific breakups, but the main idea is to end things with simple and direct language:


""I'm ready to move on from our relationship.""
""It's time we saw other people.""
""I think we should break up."", Breaking up is hard enough without having a fight or argument. You may have a laundry list of reasons to break up with him, but that doesn't mean you need to point out all of his flaws and the problems in the relationship. That just adds insult to injury, and it can lead to a fight or argument that makes everyone feel even worse (""what do you mean I didn't support you -- I always support you!"" or, ""That's not my fault, it's your fault for moving away!""). That said, he'll likely ask you why you are doing this, and it is best to have a calm, truthful, but non-judgmental answer ready.


""I've realized that we're growing apart. We've grown together for so long, and I cherish all of the time, but I need time to grow on my own now.""
""I don't feel like we treat each other with the respect we used to. Some of that is my fault. But we still need to move on to people who will treat us how we deserve.""

, If he's still in love, he may ask for a second chance, come up with a way to salvage things (like a temporary break), or convince you to change your mind. But once you've made your decision, you need to stick with it. Remember, what he says now will not change your relationship, or the problems that led you to break up.


""I understand, but I think we need to go our separate ways.""
""I don't want to take a break and leave things uncertain. We need to break up.""

, To soften the blow a little, give him a gentle hug and leave. Don't linger or wait to see what his reaction will be like - you want to avoid tangling yourself up in the emotional fallout of the relationship. Know that this is going to hurt, and there is no way to make it easy or perfect. You will not be happy with each other in the immediate aftermath, no matter how long you stay or what you say. The best thing to do is leave politely."

Remind yourself your reasons for ending things when you miss him.,
Separate yourself completely for the foreseeable future.,
Try something new.,
Turn to your friends and family for support.",How to Break Up with Your Boyfriend if You Are in Love with Him3," It's not easy breaking up. However, know that your reasons are right and that it's not you - it's him. Convince yourself you have done the right thing. Although you have completed your mission, you still may feel hurt and angry. The recovery process will depend on how much you love him, but don't worry - you will feel better one day soon.


Missing him does not change any of your issues and it is not a reason to get back together. Your bigger issues, the ones you broke up over, will still be there when the dust settles.

, Once you've let go of the one you love, it's going to hurt. You'll miss him at random times, feel like you've made a mistake, and want his advice on what to do next. But you have to resist the urge to text, call, or see him. You can move on and get your life back together, but only if you commit to moving on. Resist the urge to talk to him and work on sorting through your emotions on your own. It will be difficult, but you'll be able to do it with time.You may be able to be friends one day, but that day is in the future. You need to be completely over your romantic feelings, and the only way to get there is to not see each other.
Packing away photos and items that bring painful memories is a good way to start the healing process.

, As painful as a breakup can be, it also comes with a sense of liberation. You no longer need to make decisions for two -- you can make them only by yourself. You'll notice you have a lot more free time all of a sudden, and events and activities that were difficult to coordinate with a partner are now easily available. Don't spend your time trying to recreate the feeling you had in a relationship -- go out and try something new. Enjoy your newfound liberation and explore the single world.Do things for you. Take the time to take care of yourself for a bit.

, Having a great network of other people reminds you that, even without a boyfriend, you are not alone. Spend your time with other people you love to help heal the inevitable hole in your heart.


When you feel like calling or texting your ex-boyfriend, call your best friend instead. Let them know, briefly, that you are still kicking old habits chat out your problems.
Most people are happy to help you move on, but that doesn't mean they want to hear about your ex-boyfriend all day. Avoid bringing him up, instead moving on to other topics."

Statistics show that most students break up during summer break. For everyone else, Monday seems to be the most popular day of the week for breaking up.;
, The less public, the better. Don't do it in a place where the person on the receiving end isn't going to feel especially vulnerable. Avoid these break up locations at all costs:


The office.
At a wedding.
In a car.
At school.
In a restaurant or nightclub.

, If the relationship is relatively new, maybe you can get away with breaking up over the phone. Maybe. But come on, if you've been out on more than a handful of dates, isn't that kind of harsh? Do the right thing and end the relationship in person.


Having one final talk together is a good way to bring closure to the relationship.
As painful as it may be, a relationship-ending conversation might enable you to learn something about yourself and set the stage for something better in the future.

, You may try to be sparing their feelings, but it will blow up in your face when you're caught. You will be considered untrustworthy, and your reputation will falter. Your friends might back you up, but that doesn't mean the rest of the world will., No one likes to get dumped. But we at least appreciate the truth when it's over. Unless, of course, the truth is you've stopped finding him/her attractive, you've met someone better, or that you're just plain bored with the relationship.


There's no point being negative. Try to exit with as much decorum as possible. Even if there's bad blood, always take the high road. You'll be glad you did.

, Don't seem too happy about the break up: you'll come off as mean-spirited. Just be kind, caring, and considerate.

, Some people don't handle rejection well. Some people yell, scream, or cry. But it doesn't mean you should react to their meltdown. Remember, rejection is tough. You've already got the status of being the dumper. If their tantrum escalates, get out of there! Don't wait around for the messy aftermath. Only try to ignore when the conversation is yelling and screaming, try to be and remain civil in all other situations. Be honest and sensitive and try to listen to their emotions and act upon them.

Understand that they may not believe you when you say this. Let them know what you are willing to do for them, but do not feel pressured to do something you're not comfortable with.;
, Don’t challenge or argue with your boyfriend or girlfriend about their suicide threats. If they feel like you aren’t taking them seriously, they may hurt themselves just to prove you wrong.For instance, avoid saying something like, “You don’t really mean that,” or, “You’re just saying that to make me feel bad.” Instead, you might say, ""I'm sorry that you are thinking this way.""
You can also avoid an argument by using ""I"" statements, such as ""I am unhappy in this relationship"" rather than ""You don't make me happy,"" which may make the person defensive.Keep your tone of voice soft and low. Maintain open body language with your arms and legs relaxed at your sides. When you raise your voice and use intimidating body language (e.g. crossed arms or balled fists), an argument is more likely to occur.

, Let your boyfriend or girlfriend know that you’re not going to change your mind. Restate the reason why you want to break up. Be as kind as you can, but don’t be wishy-washy.You could say something like, “I can’t sacrifice my long-term goals to stay in this relationship, even though I think you’re a great person with a lot to offer.”

, Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend that you can’t control whether they kill themselves or not. Don’t let them push the blame onto you.For instance, if your soon-to-be ex says, “When I’m gone, it will be your fault,” you could reply, “I don’t want you to kill yourself, but that’s your choice to make, not mine. I can’t control what you do.”

, Remind your boyfriend or girlfriend of their good qualities, their talents, and their interests. Tell them they don’t need another person to define or complete them.For example, say something like, “I know it’s hard to think about now, but you’re a lot more than just half of our relationship. You’re going to go to veterinary school and do good things with your life. In time, you’ll even be happy with somebody else.”
Remind them that other people care about them too. When you do this, list specific people who can support them during this time.

, Find a suicide hotline that your boyfriend or girlfriend can call for support.

Be understanding of their feelings and let them tell you all the reasons you're wrong.,
Allow them to be angry.,
Be humble.",How to Break Up with Someone and Remain Their Friend1," You don't want to be lovey-dovey one day and breaking up the next day. Perhaps become increasingly distant (but not hostile) over a period of a month or two. If there is a particular event that can be connected with it, all the better (such as family problems, or dissatisfaction with your job, or generalized depression, etc). Don't drag this out longer than necessary. Once your partner starts to get the message, it becomes cruel to carry on.;
, And make sure you have enough time for a long conversation. Don't be afraid to show emotion yourself, but remain resolute - wavering will make the situation worse.


Allow your ex to determine when the conversation is over. Keep in mind that this may take a long time.

, Don't point your finger elsewhere. If you're breaking up with your partner because they were cheating on you, don't say ""I'm breaking up with you because you're a cheating jerk."" Say something like ""I feel insecure all the time, and need some time alone to regain my confidence.""

, If issues in the relationship were unaddressed, and your ex keeps on asking why you have broken up with them, be honest. If you get caught trying to lie about the breakup reasons, for the sole purpose of keeping your ex as a friend, that is a sign of cowardice and they will possibly see that they can't trust you any longer, especially if certain issues that could have been fixed were never discussed. Honesty is always the best policy, especially if you really do want your ex as a friend, as there is no worse feeling at that time than learning that the dumper has now violated your trust for them, and expects an unfair demand.

, Presumably you're breaking up with them for non-hurtful reasons. Let them know why and explain it thoroughly. You get huge bonus points if they say things like ""I understand"" or ""maybe this is the best thing to do."" If your reasons are hurtful (like saying ""I never loved you""), make sure they're general and nonspecific. For example, say something like this: ""I feel really apart with the world and the people around me, and want to reconnect with it.""

, In the end, however, remain firm and keep telling them that it's ""something you need to do for yourself.""

, Very angry. And hurt. Don't try to tell them that they are wrong for feeling so. They will get over it eventually.

, Not proud. Take no joy in what you're doing, and try to be compassionate.

, If you are fearful of your partner's safety, make sure someone will look out for your ex after you break things off. Contact one or two of their family members, friends, or roommates, and tell them about your concerns. Ask them to be present in the household so they can offer extra support after the breakup.Say something like, “Hey, I know this isn’t a fun thing to talk about, but I’m going to break up with Emily tonight. She’s threatened to hurt herself, and I’m worried. Will you come over so she has support once I leave?”

Remind yourself that they are their own person. You can’t control them or make decisions for them.If you are struggling with guilt after the breakup, it may be helpful to talk to a counselor.

, After you end the relationship, move on and don’t look back. Avoid getting back together with your ex, even if you miss them. Both of you need time and space to grieve the loss of the relationship, and dragging the breakup process out will only make healing more difficult for both of you.You should remove them from your social media profiles.

Using the phone may be awkward during the first few months after a break up. If so, consider other methods of communication, like social networking sites (Twitter and Facebook), or simply send them text messages.

, Sorry, this step sucks, but it's necessary for the future of your friendship. Otherwise, they will assume the worst, such as you and your new date potentially been going on dates behind your ex's back, and the ex might also fear this has been happening during the relationship.

Move on.,
Be kind to your former partner.,
Have others intervene on your behalf if your ex won't stop calling and contacting you.,
Realize that you may feel weary and shocked for a while.",How to Break Up with Someone Who Just Doesn't Get It," You are probably angry or hurt, which leads to you wanting to get away from this person whom you either loved or even still love but don't wish to remain with. It's a contradictory thing. If you are angry and still forced to be around this person, it can lead to a blowup. It can also lead to sniping and arguments that bleed out any remaining good from a relationship.


Tell him or her you are feeling unhappy in the relationship and need some space to think and rid yourself of anger. It might take a firm tone to get this request across but do so and expect they other respects you enough to give you the time to think.
Don't set aside a week to think and then hang out with them the next day. Distance yourself completely. Don't make or accept phone calls or texts. Don't see them, or if you can't avoid that, don't give them too much of your time. Make this time all about you, even if you miss them.
If you miss them too much, try to put it into perspective. Make a pros and cons list. Make a list of what you require out of a relationship. Make a list of what you like about this person and what you dislike. Talk to your friends, go out, and don't change your Facebook status until you're sure.;
, This helps you to be absolutely resolute when telling your boyfriend or girlfriend that it's over. It ensures that you won't cave into pleading to give things another go. Most of all, it'll help you to come across as meaning what you say about the relationship being over. Consider the following:


Did you ask for changes to behavior that was hurting or upsetting you? Only to find that nothing came of it? Did you offer a reasonable cause of action for them to follow but they neglected to even try? In such cases, they've disrespected you and have shown no intention to shape up.
Do you feel that your boundaries are always crossed? Do you feel resentful all the time because you feel as if you're the one giving up or giving in just to maintain the peace? That's not a relationship, it's you being taken advantage of.
Do you feel suffocated or stifled because this person is always clinging to you, hanging around, checking up on your or acting as if they can't trust you? Do you feel that you can't spend time with friends or other people out of fear of upsetting or angering your boyfriend or girlfriend? Can you spend time alone, just in solitude without them barging in? Clinging, jealous or people who lack trust don't make for good relationships. Until they deal with their low trust issues, they are going to make any relationship feel squeezed.
Do you consider that you're being taken advantage of? Did your partner say they'd change, then refused to do so? In this case, you'll likely find that this becomes a repeated pattern, with you being used all the time.
Are you taking care of yourself, of your own needs? Or, is it all about him or her all of the time? Are you transforming yourself just to fit in with their needs and preferences? If this is the case, it's not healthy for you and you'll fail to blossom fully into the person you really are.

, This will depend on the reason behind why you want to break up. If you've already given plenty of opportunities for this person to change, skip this step. On the other hand, if you feel that you need to do this in order to feel comfortable about having tried your best, perhaps give it one more try. You agreed to be with this person and therefore your judgement must have had some semblance of sanity once upon a time. Trust that judgement and the respect the person your judgement chose. Give them a second chance if you haven't already. It may happen that when you asked for time to think he/she was thinking too. And perhaps they were thinking about admitting fault or even changing their actions. If you don't have a crucial reason for breaking up, try again. Respect your original choice and give them another chance to measure up.

, If you're angry, it can be hard to break up firmly but kindly and you really don't want emotions leading the breakup because that leaves you open to persuasion to not break up. After getting yourself some space, you can wait until you've forgiven them. Try to understand things from their point of view. Think about how much you loved/love them. Consider that this is going to hurt them too, maybe even more than you.


That said, don't let guilt change your mind. If you want to break up, if you can't see it working anymore, don't let the guilt of hurting them hurt you more. You must take care of yourself first.

, Refer to the problems, not the personality. Tell them the reasons why the relationship just doesn't work from your perspective. If you still love them tell them that, it lessens the pain, but be honest. You are breaking up, you don't have to hold your tongue anymore. Tell them the truth about why you were unhappy. Perhaps they will learn from the experience and change for future relationships.

, It is necessary to get the point across to them so they know it's over. Do it gently, preferably right after the talk, but be firm. Let them know there is no more chances and that it is done. Whatever you say ought to make it clear as to how much you've thought things through. This isn't a spur of the moment decision, it's deeply considered, and this goes to helping your partner realize that you're not going to back down. For example:


""I have had a long think about the possibility of us staying together and I just can't see us together in the future. I don't see us sharing the same interests, I don't see us following the same trajectory. I really have thought hard about this because I do care about you but I just don't consider that we're compatible enough to stay together as a couple.""

, Things that you may confront include:


They cry a great deal. This is hard and hugging is okay but nothing more intimate. Don't give in––tears are cathartic and a great form of release, so this is good for them even though it seems awful at the time. Reassure them that they'll be okay, because they will be.
They may get angry and shout and call you names. Stay calm and focused on why this is over. Say things such as ""I am sorry you feel so upset, I know this isn't easy but it is over"", or ""I can understand why you're angry, but anger won't mend what is already broken."" In some cases, it's best to say nothing more than ""Let's discuss this when you feel less upset. We can't decide anything while you're feeling this way.""
They may express relief. This may surprise you but many people know when the breakup is about to happen, they've sensed it, they know it's on the cards, especially if you've already asked for time out to think. And in that time, they may have reached their own conclusion that it's not worth persevering but didn't want to be the one to initiate the breakup. Don't respond as if you're disappointed with their relief––this is a good outcome for both of you!

, Maybe the person needs to hear it again, through the tears, shock or anger. That's okay, it reinforces the message and leaves less room for error. Just continue to be gentle and caring, as you would be with any human being you're talking to. There is absolutely no need to be mean or furious, and every reason to be gentle and considerate; this is a hurtful thing to happen but that doesn't undermine the fact it remains an essential thing to do.


Your partner may keep on saying over and over: ""I just don't understand why you'd do this to me."" At this point, you can gently let them know that you're not doing it to hurt them, that it is about you realizing that you cannot be a part of a relationship that isn't feeling right to you, that it's about your feelings of incompatibility. Help them to understand that this isn't an act directed at them personally, that they're still a terrific person who deserves a relationship with someone who matches them precisely.

, Here comes the hard part. Do not remain in contact with your partner over anything other than having them collect their stuff or return things to you. Do not connect via online sites, do not connect via phone or email. Here are some other aspects to consider:


If they keep sending you texts, emails, messages, notes, whatever, then do not respond. It will only give a persistent person hope that there is an opening to get back together again.
If they make use of friends, family and anyone else to get to you, tell such people firmly that you still care about the well-being of this person but that the intimate relationship aspect is definitely over and that you'd appreciate these people not trying to fix what is essentially your own personal life and choices.
If there are children involved, communicate strictly only about the needs of the children. Continue to see your children or share access to them without entering into discussions about your former love life with your partner. Do not use or allow your partner to use the children as go-between messengers.

, Send their things on to them or let them collect these things without being mean about it. You loved this person once, there is no need to smash their record collection or rip up all their photos in a fit of rage. If the relationship was abusive, unkind or unfaithful, dispose of any memento or image items quickly and quietly without a fuss (a calm ritual is okay)––remember that this is about your karma too and that while voodooing and burning your ex's items might cause you to feel great in the moment, it feeds the anger. Let go to be happy and treat your former partner as a fellow human being who can go about their life without you now. Best of all, if you don't wreck their goods, back account or anything else they value, there is even less reason for them to keep annoying you or worst still, sue you, which are just more means to keep in touch. Yes, you may be surprised to learn that suing people is a really good way to stay in communication, albeit angrily. Let go in order to be set free yourself.

, It may be helpful to have friends, family and others inform this person that you really won't respond and that you really meant the breakup when it happened. Sometimes it takes a third party spelling it out to clarify that the relationship truly has ended. It may seem callous but realize that you have already done your best to end things with this person.

, Even with your thinking things through thoroughly, no longer being part of a couple is a big change in your life and it can take some getting used to. Allow yourself to mourn. It's over but the memories still form a part of who you were at that point in life. It's okay to cry, to perform a calm ritual of letting go (no angry ones) and to feel pain inside. This is all normal. Let go. You're free now.

List the reasons you want to end the relationship.,
Anticipate his response.,
Rehearse the conversation.,
Brace yourself against uncertainty.,
Try to prepare yourself emotionally for the breakup.",How to Break up With Your Boyfriend when You're Shy1," One of the first questions your future ex-boyfriend is going to ask when you deliver the news is “why?” To answer this, you must first figure it out for yourself. Come up with clear and concrete reasons as to why you don’t want to continue being a couple, write them down, and bring the list to the breakup.Reflect on your “whys” before breaking up to determine whether or not your issues can be fixed with a discussion instead.
Write down the level of contact you plan to have with him after the breakup so that you can clearly communicate this to him as well.
Having the list is a particularly good idea if you’re shy. It gives you a script for what to say and keeps you focused if he tries to change your mind.;
, You are likely aware of how your boyfriend is going to react to the breakup. Mentally preparing for his response can prevent you from being side-tracked or caught off guard. Most importantly, it can help you stand your ground and stop you from changing your mind.


For example, you can say to yourself, “I know he’s going to be unhappy. He may even yell or cry. However, this is what I want and I can’t back down, no matter how bad he makes me feel for breaking up with him.”, Going into the difficult conversation knowing exactly what you’re going to say can give you the confidence you need, particularly if you are shy. Having a plan and comebacks for all of his questions and rebuttals allows you to stay in control of the conversation.


Practice the conversation with a friend or someone you trust. Do it as many times as it takes for you to feel prepared and comfortable. However, only choose to rehearse with someone who you know will not tell anyone else what you’re about to do. You want him to hear the news from you, not the grapevine., You know you’re shy, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t able to stand up for yourself. Quiet the voice in your head that doubts you can do this. Appearing wishy-washy during the conversation may give your boyfriend mixed signals.


Give yourself a pep talk before the conversation. Say, “I can do this. I have the courage it takes to speak up for myself. I will be clear and focused and not let my shyness get in the way.”, Do your best to be prepared for the emotional toll that this may take on you as well. Make sure that you take good care of yourself afterwards and have a plan in place to keep your mind clear. Activities like yoga and meeting up with friends can help you stay grounded and avoid dwelling on the breakup after it happens."

If you are not looking forward to future visits with your girlfriend, this is a major sign that the relationship may not be working.If making plans to see each other feels like a chore, then a long distance relationship may not be the best.;
, Sometimes relationships do not work out because your values and goals are not compatible with the other person’s values and goals. It’s okay to have some differences, but major differences like different religious beliefs, life goals, or other important things may interfere with a harmonious relationship. If you find that you are often fighting because you value different things, then this might be a sign that the relationship will not work out.


For example, if you value time with family and friends more than money and professional success, then this could be a problem if your girlfriend is really focused on her career right now. Or, if one of you wants kids and the other one does not, then this could cause serious problems down the road.
Try making a list of values, beliefs, and goals that you have in common with your girlfriend, and a separate list of values, beliefs, and goals that you do not have in common. If the list of things you do not have in common is longer than the list of things you do have in common, then this may be a reason to break it off.

, If you're finding yourself interested in someone else, then consider if this long distance relationship is working. Long distance relationships can require a bit more commitment, so be aware of whether this type of relationship is right for you.


You may feel torn if she was your high school sweetheart, and now you're finding new love interests in college. Avoid cheating on your girlfriend as an ""out"" from the relationship. If you find yourself thinking more about someone else than your girlfriend, talk with your girlfriend first.
Avoid hurting your girlfriend's feelings further by lying or covering up about what's bothering you.

, Sometimes your life gets in the way of love. If you've been dating your girlfriend for a few months, and now are back to your different lives in different cities, the passion and desire to continue this relationship may have changed.You may find after dating long distance for a few months that you and your girlfriend are actually headed in very different directions. Maybe the support she needs is different from what you can offer.
For example, let's say you were dating for the summer, and now that school has started again you're in different cities, at different schools, and have different commitments to work or activities. You may feel less connected to your girlfriend now that you have some distance and are back to focusing on your studies and spending time with friends.

, Do you feel like you're communicating less and less with your girlfriend? Do you feel like scheduling calls and frequent weekend trips is just too much? It may be time to talk with your girlfriend about this.A long distance relationship, after only knowing your girlfriend for a few months, is likely to be very difficult.
Be mindful that if you've been dating your girlfriend for a year or more, then you need to assess if it is the long distance part that is the difficulty, the relationship itself, or both.

, This may be trickier if you live 2,000 miles (3,000 km) away or are in another country. But if your long distance relationship has been for over a year or more, and you are able to drive to see your girlfriend, then a break up in person is a more respectable option.Breaking up in person shows courage rather than cowardice, and shows that you take this relationship seriously--even the breaking up part.
Meeting in person may be more uncomfortable but it can give your girlfriend a better sense of what you're feeling in terms of body language, your words, and your physical presence.

, If financial costs or timing are major factors, then consider breaking up by phone or video chat such as Skype. This way you can still have a conversation that allows both sides to interact at the same time. There will be less miscommunication than if done by email or text.


Schedule a time to call or chat when both of you are free to talk for an hour.
Consider a format that is most comfortable for you, but also allows for real-time, voice interaction.

, While you may be used to texting, chatting, or emailing your girlfriend, this is a less personal form of communication. With a break up, it's important to take action in a personal, kind, and clear way.Texting back and forth about breaking up will likely feel heartless to your girlfriend. In terms of break up etiquette, it will feel like the relationship wasn't even that important.
While ending a relationship via text after two or three dates may be fine, if you and your girlfriend have been exclusive and dating for many months, then avoid this way of breaking up.

, While you may not like your girlfriend anymore, there is still common decency to consider. Treat her as you would like to be treated if the roles were reversed. Maybe you've been dumped before and it felt horrible. Try to avoid making the same mistakes.


It is important to be clear and direct without giving mixed messages. For example, consider saying, ""I'm sorry but this isn't working any more. I did care for you very much, but I don't think we should see each other anymore.""
Be truthful with your reasons for breaking up. If it's that you're headed in different directions, then say so. If you have lost interest in the relationship, then say so. Just make sure to be kind, and say some words that show there were good times in the relationship too.

, Your girlfriend may be shocked, heartbroken, or possibly understanding. It could be a combination of all or none of these emotions. By talking with her in real time, either over the phone or in person, you give her a chance to say what she needs to say.


Avoid getting into an argument at this point. If you have decided to break up with your girlfriend, you don't need to have this conversation blow up into a blame game.Be open to listening. Avoid ending the conversation abruptly after you have said that you wanted to break up. Give her time to think and process what is happening.

, You may say to your girlfriend, ""Let's stay friends,"" but this could send mixed signals to your girlfriend. If she is still interested in a relationship with you, she may read this as an opportunity to get back together later.Instead, try saying something like, “I think that we should stop communicating for now, but maybe we can be friends after we have both moved on a few years from now. For now though, I do not think we should communicate by phone, online, or in person.”


Some relationships end well and amicably. Think about how you and your girlfriend are ending yours.
If you and your girlfriend are already living long distance from each other, there is a better chance that you won't run into each other on a regular basis. But think about how much you want her to interact with you online or via Facebook.

, If you and your girlfriend had been arranging plans to see each other again soon, you may have made purchases or arrangements that need to be addressed. You may also have items that belong to your girlfriend. While you may not be able to tie up these loose ends right after breaking up, be mindful of your part in any pre-made plans.


Honor any obligations you have to cancel arrangements or pay back any money owed.
If you have items that your girlfriend would like back, be respectful and return things promptly that belong to her.
If there are things that are jointly owned, then consider another conversation with your girlfriend after the break up to discuss these items.

, Before a break up, you may be worried about telling her. After a break up, you may feel guilt or anxiety about what just happened. It is normal to feel worried about hurting someone's feelings, as well as the guilt afterwards. These feelings will pass with time.Understand that is better to make a clean break, rather than to have a relationship drag on when you are feeling unhappy or miserable.
With long distance relationships, it's important to see this as an opportunity for growth, change, and renewal. If you have been unhappy in a long distance relationship, you may feel some relief.

Even if your partner realizes it's time to break up, he or she will probably still have questions that you need to answer. You need to be able to say why you want to break up and clearly lay that out for your partner.Think about when you started noticing things were going wrong. What prompted you to start thinking about ending your relationship?
What do you think is not working? Why do you think it can't be fixed?
A few concrete things to think about include whether you still laugh together, whether you have similar goals, how your sex life has been, whether you communicate well, and how balanced the relationship is.;
, If you're breaking up with someone, you of course need to be able to live independently. For instance, you'll need to take care of all of the rent and bills at your place if your partner moves out. If you can't afford to live where you are by yourself, you may need to find a new place.

If you would need to be the one to move out, you may want to find a new place to live before you have the conversation, so you can be prepared to move.
You may have to make sacrifices to move out, such as moving in with a family member for a little while.

, It's better not to just attack someone with unexpected bad news when they're not expecting it. Therefore, let your partner know you want to talk about your relationship, and set up a good time to do it.Pick a time when you both have enough time to talk. Also, make sure your full attention is on the matter at hand.
Be sure to have the conversation in a private place and in person. This conversation isn't one you want to have over the telephone or email.

, Don't try to temper the bad news by leading with good news. If you're having a serious talk, your partner knows the bad news is coming. You might as well start with that, so you can get to the meat of the conversation more quickly.You can just start with, ""I know you know things haven't been good with us lately. I'm to the point where I think breaking up is the best option.""
That being said, you don't need to bash your partner. In fact, saying what you like about the person after you've made the announcement can help take the sting out of it a little bit.

, Instead of putting blame on the other person, discuss why you think the relationship isn't working. You don't have to be negative. In fact, you can stay positive throughout the breakup, while still acknowledging things aren't working.For instance, you wouldn't want to say, ""You're emotionally unavailable, and you've ruined this relationship.""
Rather, you should say, ""I feel like we're drifting apart emotionally. I don't think we're as close as we used to be.""

, Even if you're determined to break up, you need to give your partner a chance to respond. They're going to need a moment to process what you're saying and figure out what they're feeling, which they may do out loud. Give them a chance to do so, and listen attentively to what they're saying.Make sure you're hearing what the person is saying, not just thinking about what you want to say next.
Ask questions that show you've heard what they've said and you want to explore further. For instance, you could say, ""What I think you're saying is your upset that I'm bringing this up at a time when you're stressed. How can I help de-stress the situation?
Nod and use body language to show you're listening, like looking the person in the eyes.

, If you've already made plans to move out, you need to bring it up now. That way, your partner has time to get used to the idea and make financial plans for living without you. Plus, it takes away the stress of your partner having to find a place to live.For example, you could say, ""Now, I don't want you to worry about finding a new place. I've already found somewhere to live, so you can stay here.""

, Your goal is to breakup, and once you've listened to your partner, you may need to reiterate the fact that you do want to break up. Sometimes, it takes hearing something more than once for it to sink in, and your partner may work to convince you that you should stay together.If your partner is arguing to stay together, tell them gently but resolutely that you've made a decision: ""I understand that you feel we can work this out. However, I don't think we can. I want to move on.""

, Have an honest conversation about who should live where. You need to decide, for instance, who will be staying in your current place, and you both need to voice your opinion about it.If the house or apartment belonged to one of you before you got together, then it should stay with that person.
If you got it while you were together, you may both need to move out, especially if you can't afford it separately.

, Some couples simply don't have the finances to move out immediately. You need to have an earnest discussion about whether that's true or not. If you must stay in the apartment together for some time, you'll need to decide how finances will be taken care of.For instance, are you going to pay the bills in the same way? Will you have separate food bills now?
If the other person can't afford to move out without help, you may decide you want to help them get past the initial expense, but that's totally your call.
Don't forget legal issues. For instance, if you rent or have bills jointly, you're both still legally responsible for those bills., You've broken up, and therefore, there needs to be a time limit for how long it will be until one of you leaves. Four to six months is reasonable for finding a new place, with the stipulation that you or the other person is trying to get out as soon as possible., If you have kids together, you'll need to come to an agreement about where they will live. You also need to decide how the kids will be able to spend time with both of you, as well as who will pay for what when it comes to clothing, schooling, and healthcare.If you don't involve lawyers, keep in mind that any custody agreement you make could have legal ramifications later.
That is, if you decide the kids will stay with one parent more, a judge may take that into account later.
If you can't come to a custody agreement, you may need to hire a lawyer.

, When you live together, your property gets jumbled together, and dividing it can get confusing. However, if you two can agree on some clear rules, it can make it easier to divide up your property.For instance, anything either person bought on their own belongs to them. The same goes for anything either person inherited. If you gave a gift to the other person, it goes to them.
If you bought it together, you'll either have to agree to take certain items or maybe buy each other out of expensive items, such as televisions.

, You'll need to decide who's going to sleep where. You'll have to set up rules about when and where you two can date, if you decide that's an option while still living together. You may need to set rules about who can use the kitchen when, if you really can't stand to be around each other anymore.If space is limited, you may have to share certain commodities. For instance, one person gets the bed one night, then switches to the couch the next night.

, Now that you've broken up, you're going to need new emotional and social boundaries. You're both going to need to be able to say when you need privacy, and you'll both need to be able to respect that privacy.You don't need to be mean about it, just firm. For instance, say your partner asks what you're doing this evening, and you have a date. You could just say, ""I'm going to be out tonight,"" and leave it at that.
When you were together, you had a right to know where your partner was most of the time. Now, though, you must respect that you don't have that right anymore.

, It can be tempting to fall into old habits when you still live together. However, it's important to set clear boundaries now that you've broken up. If you have sex together, you are raising false hopes that you may get back together., When you're a couple, you can work together to get the household responsibilities done. When you're separated, you need to be more clear about who does what. Have a conversation to divide up the chores, making sure they're even.Of course, you want to keep more personal chores separate now. If you've always done her or his laundry, you shouldn't be doing that anymore.
In other words, each person should be responsible for his or her own chores, as well as splitting up the household ones.

, That is, try to make spaces where you each can have your own privacy. If you live in a tiny apartment, that may not be as feasible. However, you should try to carve out areas where you can each be alone. For instance, if you have the bed one night, you stay in the bedroom while your partner gets the living room to themselves., Breaking up is going to be hard on both of you, even when you're doing the breaking up. That means that you both may be hurt and angry for a time, and you need to respect that about the other person.That means trying not to engage in arguments with the other person and looking the other way when emotions get the better of you or the other person.

Talk to him in person.,
Be honest and open.,
Stay kind, but be clear about your intentions.",How to Break up With Your Boyfriend when You're Shy2," Breaking up with someone face-to-face is perhaps the most difficult way to give the bad news, whether you’re shy or not. However, it is also the most respectful. Honor the relationship you had by having the courtesy to tell him in person.


Avoid breaking up with him by calling on the phone or through text or email. You would likely feel worse if he ended the relationship with you through these means, so don’t do it to him.If you have tried, and you absolutely cannot bring yourself to do it in person, write a letter or call him. Apologize for not doing it in person, and explain that you tried and could not bring yourself to do so.
If you are afraid for your safety, you can break up any way you want. An email or a text may be preferable to an in-person confrontation.

, You can’t sugar-coat an effective breakup. Not telling your soon-to-be ex the truth about your feelings can cause him to have a false sense of hope. Instead, speak honestly about why you’re ending the relationship. He deserves to know the truth, even if your shyness makes it difficult.


Although honesty is the best policy, you don’t want to come across too harsh. Try not to blame your ex for anything and attempt to stay positive. Doing so can prevent you from deeply hurting his feelings and having a particularly messy breakup., Consider his feelings during this breakup. He’s about to hear news that will likely break his heart. Therefore, you want to stay kind and sensitive to what he’s going through. However, you must also be clear about your boundaries or he may not get the hint.


Saying “yes” to conditions you don’t agree with will only keep him around longer. For instance, if you don’t want to stay friends with him or hang out, tell him so. While you can still be kind, you don’t have to skirt around the issue because you feel bad. Tell him directly what you feel comfortable with and leave it at that.Soften the blow by mentioning his positive qualities and saying other true things that shed an optimistic light on the breakup.

Cut off communication.,
Resist getting back together right after the breakup.,
Don't be intimate with your ex.,
Avoid seeing him, if possible.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Break up With Your Boyfriend when You're Shy3," Although it may sound like a good idea, staying in contact with your former beau usually ends in disaster. It may leave him confused and give him a false sense of hope that you can make it work. Staying in touch may also make it more difficult for you to move on, as well.


Avoid answering his calls, texts, emails, or other forms of communication. You may also want to remove him from your social media accounts., You may feel like you’ve had a change of heart. However, it is likely that you simply feel bad and lonely after the split. Stay strong in your convictions and you may prevent having to break up with him all over again.


Typically, couples are even more unhappy the second time around than they were the first. Remember, there was a reason you broke up. Getting back together just reintroduces those issues back into your life., Becoming intimate with your ex again is often quite destructive, even if it only happens one time. The comfort you feel from spending time with him in that way won’t last, and you’ll likely only feel worse when it’s over. You’re also sending him the wrong message: he may think you want him back.


Prevent this from happening by not putting yourself in this type of situation. Resist the urge to call or text him if you’ve had too much to drink or when you are feeling lonely.

, Don’t go to a social event if there’s a chance he’ll attend. The temptation may be too great soon after the breakup and you’ll only take two steps backward by spending this kind of time with him.If you must attend an event he’ll be at, ask a buddy to come with you to hold you accountable.

, After the breakup, your ex won’t be the only one adjusting and working through feelings. You might feel relieved or guilty or a combination of emotions, and that’s normal. Do your best to move forward by focusing on taking care of yourself and making yourself happy.

Spend time with friends and engage in healthy activities such as exercise and meditation in order to work through your emotions.
Make sure you’re eating healthy, balanced meals. Try to resist the urge to overeat or undereat during this stressful adjustment period.
If you find yourself reminiscing on good memories with your ex, remind yourself of why you broke up, and then try to move onto a new thought completely.

Consider why you have decided to break up with him.,

Re focus on your needs and your priorities.,
Set up a time where you are both alone and can talk privately.,
Express yourself clearly and calmly.,
Use “I” statements.,
Be firm about your desire to end the relationship.",How to Break up With a Married Man," If you are anxious or uncertain about whether or not it is the right decision to break up with the married man, it may help to make a list of the reasons why the relationship is not working. You may feel it is time to end the relationship due to frustration with his inability to leave his wife, guilt due to his constant lying to you and to his family, or anger at being “the other woman”. It can help to remind yourself of the reasons why it may be time to end the affair as you prepare to have the break up conversation with the married man.


Many married men who have affairs will offer very similar excuses as to why they are cheating on their spouse and why they cannot leave their spouse. For example, “I haven’t divorced her because of the children,” “I don’t love her anymore and I don’t think I ever did”, or “We don’t sleep together and haven’t for a very long time”.Though you may have believed these excuses when you first became involved with the married man, over time you may get tired of hearing these excuses and be frustrated that the married man seems incapable of leaving his spouse, even when he claims to be unhappy or unfulfilled. It will likely be up to you to end the relationship, as the married man may be content to string you along and continue to use the same excuses.;
, Though you may not want to tell your family or close friends about the affair, you can lean on them for support in other ways. Spending quality time with family and friends, away from the married man, can help you gain perspective on the relationship and remind yourself that you have other meaningful relationships in your life besides the affair.


If you do have a family member or friend you feel you can confide in, talk to them about your feelings around the affair and your decision to end it. Sometimes expressing your emotions and feelings to a sympathetic ear can help you figure out the motivations behind your decision and feel you have support in your decision to walk away from the relationship.
If you do not feel comfortable sharing your feelings with anyone, you can write down your thoughts in a journal or a diary. Working through your emotions on the page may help to prepare you for the break up conversation and give you an outlet to vent about the relationship.

, It’s important that you prepare yourself in active ways by re focusing on your needs and your priorities. Practice self care by eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting eight to nine hours of sleep a night. You can also take up stress-management techniques like yoga or meditation. Taking good care of yourself will help you to move on from the relationship after the break up, both physically and mentally.

Rather than devote your time to analyzing what went wrong with the relationship, focus on a new hobby or passion, or on developing stronger skills at your job. Prioritizing your career and your well being over the needs of the married man can help you to feel empowered and stable on your own.

, The break up conversation will likely be intense and difficult so set the scene by choosing a time and place where you can be alone and talk in private. This could be a quiet bench in a park or a private spot in a coffee shop. Choose a location that feels neutral and secluded enough to give you both space to talk and listen.

, Because you are the one instigating the break up, you will need to take charge of the conversation and be clear about your intentions. Try to keep your voice calm and controlled, as getting emotionally may signal to the married man that he can try to comfort you and avoid the break up conversation. Using a calm and clear tone will make it apparent that you are serious about your desire to end the relationship.


For example, you may begin by telling the married man you need to discuss your relationship and your unhappiness or discomfort with the situation. ""I would like to talk to you about our relationship. I am not happy with our relationship and I think we need to address the status of our relationship.""

, To ensure you are understood clearly by the married man, focus on “I” statements, such as: “I feel that you are not committed to our relationship and I am not comfortable being the other woman,” or “I think we should end our affair. I am tired of all the lying and sneaking around.”


At this point, the married man may try to persuade you to change your mind or use excuses he has used in the past. Resist this by providing reasons why you think it is time to end the relationship and by being clear that you have made your decision. Using “I” statements will show you are being accountable for your decision and are expressing your feelings without blaming or accusing the married man. This will keep the conversation controlled and prevent it from devolving into a shouting match.

, Once you have stated your intentions to end the relationship, be firm about your decision by rejecting any excuses the married man may use and walking away if he tries to persuade you to change your mind.

For example, you may say: ""It's no use arguing about this anymore. I'm not going to change my mind and I hope you can respect my decision by not contacting me in any way. I think we both need time apart to accept the break up.""
You may want to cut communication with him to give him time to accept your decision and to avoid being tempted to renew the relationship. Avoid calling, texting, or emailing him, and do not answer any of his messages if he reaches out to you. Doing this will show him you are serious about your decision to end the relationship and will also help you to move on from the relationship.

You want to be sure that you aren’t rushed in your conversation and can take some time for yourselves afterward., Schedule a time where the two of you can meet in person. Do not break up with him via text, phone call, or email. You owe him the courtesy of an in-person meeting.Pick a place where you can talk privately. A place that’s filled with memories of your relationship (such as the place where you had your first date or your bedroom) might not be the best place to talk. Try taking a walk around the block.
If you’re in a long-distance relationship, get as close as “face-to-face” as you can. Have a conversation over Skype or FaceTime.

, Tell the guy that you want to have an important conversation. You want him to know that a serious conversation is going to happen so that he’s not taken completely off guard.Try saying something like, “I need to have an important talk with you later.”
You could also say, “Can we talk later? I have something I want to discuss with you.”

Avoid gossip.",How to Break up With a Guy Nicely," It's fine to ask a friend or two for advice, but once someone knows you're planning a breakup, it won't stay secret forever. Don't delay once you've made up your mind. You won't earn any nice points if your boyfriend finds out from someone else.


Whatever you do, don't have a friend pass on the information for you.;
, Breaking up over text, email, or anything besides a conversation is a terrible idea. Meet in person, and meet somewhere you can talk in private, where he won't be embarrassed by the possibility of strangers overhearing.


If you're in a long-distance relationship, call him when he's at home and alone.
If you are scared that he might react by physically hurting you, meet in a quiet but public place, such as the corner of a park or a mostly-empty cafe.

, Yes, it will be painful. No, there aren't any better options. Be as direct and clear as possible, and get to the subject right after the greetings are done. ""I'm breaking up with you."" or ""I need to end our relationship."" leaves no room for uncertainty, which helps both of you in the long run.

, He'll almost certainly ask ""Why?"" and you need to be prepared for this. Don't give false hope by saying you want more free time, or that it's just a bad time in your life. You're breaking up because the relationship isn't working out, and he needs to know that.


For example, say ""I don't feel a connection with you"" or ""My feelings for you have faded.""
If you're unhappy but aren't sure why, say ""I'm sorry it's come to this, but I'm unhappy with our relationship and I don't want to drag it out.""

, You can be clear and direct without insulting him to his face. If he brings up his behavior, personality, or appearance during the conversation, use your judgement to proceed. Most of the time, you should deflect the question by saying ""I've already said my reasons."" If it's an actual, obvious problem (such as him being unfaithful, or something that's been the topic of frequent arguments), admit that ""it doesn't help."" Be especially careful around topics that are common sources of male anxiety in many cultures:


Physical appearance (avoid saying ""I'm not attracted to you"")Sexual performance
Emotional sensitivity or lack of ""machismo""
Ability to provide financially

, It doesn't matter whose ""fault"" it is that the relationship is ending. If you say it's his, he'll be offended. If you say it's yours, you'll feel guilty or he'll try to convince you you don't need to break up. The best you can hope for is a mutual acceptance that the relationship has ended, without trying to point the finger at each other.

, Once he understands that the relationship is over and that you don't resent him, it's time to say goodbye. If the conversation has gone on for thirty minutes, it's time to say goodbye.If he gets angry at you and starts shouting, stay calm and say goodbye. Try not to respond to angry statements, or get dragged into a fight.

, Becoming friends is a great solution in the long run, but a terrible subject to bring up during the breakup conversation. You both need time to heal, and you can't do that if you're hanging out or if he's constantly trying to turn that ""friendship"" back into dating. If he asks whether you can become friends, answer ""Maybe later, but let's keep our distance for now."" You can explore the possibility of a friendship once time has healed some wounds, perhaps after a couple months. 

, For courtesy's sake, hold off on publicizing any dates you go on or relationships you start in the next few weeks. You don't need to keep them secret, but don't post photos on Facebook or other places where your ex will see them.

, It's common to have second thoughts and to miss your ex. Telling him about these doubts can cause a great deal of pain or resentment at being ""jerked around."" If you need to revisit your decision, give yourself plenty of time to think it over in private.


Avoid telling your mutual friends about these doubts, as some of them may relay them on to your ex and tell him to contact you.

, You'll naturally want to vent about the experience, and you can do so in the company of a close, discreet friend. Never spread rumors about your ex or repeat about private conversations and secrets.

Emphasize his good qualities.,
Say that you’re no longer interested.,
Answer any questions he has.,
Know when it’s time to end the conversation.",How to Break up With a Guy You're Just Not Interested In2," Think beforehand of a couple really sincere compliments you want to give to the guy. Even if you are not interested in dating him anymore, think about what drew you to him in the first place and what you’ve discovered about him since.For example, say something like, “I really enjoy spending time with you because you’re so adventurous. We’ve been on some amazing hikes together, and I’ve enjoyed your company and our conversations.”
Or try, “I really admire how committed you are to your job. It’s rare to see someone so committed to health care policy reform, and I really respect your dedication.”

, Speak from your own perspective. You should be truthful about why you want to break up, but try to avoid things that might hurt his feelings.Don’t tell him that he’s boring or unattractive, but, if he has a couple qualities that really bother you (such as being rude to strangers or flaking on plans all the time), you can be honest about those. Here are some things you could say:


“I love spending time with you, but I don’t think our personalities mesh well enough to continue our relationship.”
“I think you’re really wonderful, but I’m not in the right mindset for a boyfriend right now.”
“We had a couple of nice dates, but I think I need to be with someone a little more invested. When you cancelled our third date three weeks in a row, I didn’t feel like I was a priority.”
Do not say, “You’re really nice, but I just don’t think you’re attractive.” You can work around this issue to be a little nicer. Try, “We have great conversations, but I don’t think that we really ‘click’ in a romantic sense.”

, You should try to respond to questions about logistics and planning, such as returning things you’ve borrowed. However, try to cut off the conversation if he starts asking more in-depth questions about why you broke up or if you’re going to date that guy from your running club now.


For example, if he asks you when you can return his iPhone charger, make a plan to drop it off in his mailbox later that night.
However, if he asks you if you’re breaking up with him because he’s gained a little weight since you started dating, try to stop the conversation thereafter.
Do not promise that you will talk soon or be friends afterward. You need time to decide if those things are best for both of you.

, Do not have an extended conversation about the break-up. Hear his opinion and thoughts if he wants to share them, but try to leave as soon as possible. You both need time to breathe and recover."
"
Return his things and take back yours.,
Unfollow his social media.,
Wait at least a month.",How to Break up With a Guy You're Just Not Interested In3," It’s likely that you have some of your ex-boyfriend’s stuff at your house and some of your stuff at his. Arrange how you will return the stuff, hopefully without seeing one another. Try leaving it in the mailbox or giving it to a mutual friend to trade.

, In the digital age, it is hard to completely block contact with someone unless you unfriend (or unfollow) them on Facebook, unfollow them on Instagram and Twitter, and delete him on dating websites. If necessary, unfollow some of his friends, too, if they might post things about him that will bother you., You both need time to heal and get over the relationship on your own terms. Do not try to contact him, and do not let him contact you. Maybe you can be friends in the future, but you need time and space before either of you can decide to take steps to be friends again."

Ask yourself why the person ignoring you might be doing so.They might be purposely or accidentally ignoring you.,
Ask a third party why you’re being ignored.,
Ask the person ignoring you directly why they’re ignoring you.,

Think about the problem as a difference in communication styles.Assume that your friend or partner is not ignoring you to be malicious.,
Accept your feelings.,
Employ structured conversation.,
Stray outside your comfort zone.,
Exchange apologies as necessary.",How to React when People Ignore You," Think back to the last time you spoke to them -- were they angry or hostile toward you? Did you say something to offend them? If so, they are probably still stewing over whatever it was set them off in the first place. On the other hand, if you had a great time with them last time, there’s probably some intervening factor which has led them to ignore you inadvertently. Perhaps they are busy studying for a test or have become infatuated with a new love interest.;
, If the person ignoring you is a friend or coworker, ask a mutual friend or coworker if they might know why you’re being ignored. Perhaps this mutual friend could identify or explain to you why the person ignoring you is doing so. Perhaps you’ve angered them without realizing it but rather than telling you so directly, they’ve decided to just ignore you to avoid deepening the conflict. A third party might be able to examine the situation more objectively and help you figure out why you’re being ignored.

, Confront the individual who is ignoring you. Ask them to talk privately. In a quiet, private place, calmly ask “Hey, I was wondering why you’ve been ignoring me?” Present evidence that they’ve been ignoring you, such as not returning your calls or emails, or not responding when you speak to them. Listen attentively to their explanation., If this is the first time the person has ignored you, there may be a good reason. However, if your friend or coworker has made a pattern out of ignoring you or others, they may be getting some satisfaction from the act.They may, alternately, be using silence to evoke an apology or acquiescence to a certain demand. Finally, they might be ignoring you to disempower you: you might hear them say “If you really knew me / loved me, you wouldn’t have to ask why I’m ignoring you.” All the foregoing examples indicate a narcissistic personality which should be recognized and not catered to.

, Suppose you confront the person ignoring you and they say they understand where you’re coming. Perhaps they even apologize for ignoring you. Afterwards, though, they go back to ignoring you. In this case, you must understand that they are being insincere, and do not really have an interest in maintaining a positive relationship with you.

, Someone who chronically shows you the cold shoulder is likely getting some satisfaction from doing so; don’t play their game by trying to mediate the issue over and over.

, You should not fret about things you could have said or done differently to make them more attentive to you or your perspective.

, Let your friend or family member who is ignoring you know that you hope for reconciliation.Don’t give up on them. Some people have personal problems which need to be confronted before they figure out how to maintain healthy relationships. Let them know that you’re there for them if they ever want to talk or need help.

, It’s likely your partner is ignoring you simply to avoid deepening and extending a conflict. They probably want to get some breathing space and let you both cool down for a bit after a conflict. When you understand your partner’s different understanding of the silent treatment, you will be in a better position to make up with them later and avoid deepening the conflict.

, When you’re ignored by someone you care about, it hurts. You might feel frustrated, angry, and sad that you’re being ignored. If you feel this way, don’t pretend that you don’t.Accepting your feelings is the first step toward expressing yourself and letting the other party know they’re being unkind.

, Structured conversations are those which are schedules at a particular time for a particular purpose, and unfold with a particular set of rules which forbid things like yelling and name-calling. In a structured conversation, both parties are prepared to confront the issue in front of them and have rehearsed their basic talking points.Suggesting structured conversations can be useful if someone is ignoring you because of a longstanding problem or set of problems which prevents you from forging a deeper emotional connection.

, Try a different style of communication for yourself.If you’re a “hot” conflict communicator -- constantly yelling, getting angry, and flaring up emotionally -- try to exercise more control in the heat of the moment. If you’re a “cool” conflict communicator -- you ignore the other person, leave to give yourself space when a conflict occurs, and try to explain yourself and your point of view only after taking a few minutes to consider your response -- put more immediacy and emotion into your conflict resolution behavior (but don’t get carried away yelling and cursing).

, If you realize in the course of the person’s explanation that you’ve hurt their feelings, you should explain that you didn’t mean to and that you’re sorry. But be firm when explaining that you feel hurt as well by the way they’ve been ignoring you. Forgive the person who has been ignoring you and express your hope that they can find it within themselves to forgive you too, should you feel you need it.Sometimes it is hard to understand why people are upset by the things we do or say that seem innocuous. If the other person has a weak or unintelligible reason for ignoring you, it’s nice to apologize nonetheless.

Have the right body language.,
Be sincere.,
Don't overstep boundaries.,
Listen.,
Don't say anything too cheesy or cliched.,
Don't talk about yourself.,
Give the person a reassuring touch (depending on the situation).,
Ask if there's anything you can do to help.",How to Offer Condolences1," To show the person that you really care, you should give him 100% of your attention. If the person is grieving, the least you can do is make direct eye contact and face your body toward the person, showing that talking to him is your highest priority. Keep an “open stance” – don’t fold your arms over your chest or turn your shoulders away from the person, or it’ll look like you can’t wait to leave that person. It’s natural to feel a little uncomfortable when offering condolences, but your body language should say that you want to be there.


Put away all of your distractions. Turn off your phone and don't play with your necklace or look around the room when you talk to the person.;
, You don't have to be original to be sincere. Just say something like, ""I heard what happened to your mom. I'm so sorry for your loss."" Don't give the person fake statements or false hope; just show him that you're truly sorry that a terrible thing has happened to him.


Speak evenly and slowly. Don't make it sound like you're trying to speak as quickly as possible to get it out of the way.
You can say, ""I can't imagine what you're going through."" Be honest about the fact that you're very sorry and understand that you can't fully imagine the person's grief.
If you knew and cared about the person who passed away and the timing is right, you can share a quick story or anecdote that shows how much you loved the person. Or you can say something like, “I wish I could eat another one of her delicious meals” if the person is receptive to discussing the person who passed away.

, If you don't know the person very well, you don't have to look like you're about to cry and give the person a big hug -- unless he looks like he really needs one. If you only have a very professional or casual relationship with the person, you shouldn't make that person uncomfortable by becoming so involved in his private business.

, If the person wants to talk, let him finish. Even if you've prepared a list of the things you want to say, remember that the person is grieving and may just want to talk to someone. Don't try to offer advice or words of comfort -- the best thing that you may be able to do is listen.


While you're listening, nod while the person is talking and maintain eye contact. If you're close, keep an arm around the person or touch the person in some way to give him comfort.

, Don't say that ""Everything will be okay"" -- it won't. Or that's at least how the person will be feeling. Though you may have the best intentions, this will make the person feel like his feelings aren't valid and that his grief should not be taken seriously.


Say what you're feeling instead of what you've heard on TV or read in greeting cards. You can acknowledge that what happened was terrible instead of sugar-coating it.

, If you had a similar experience with a death, you can say, “I lost my father too. We can talk about it if you want.” But don’t go on about your own personal loss—this will make you look more self-involved than sympathetic. No matter what experience you had, you won’t know exactly how that person is feeling at that very moment, so don’t compare that person’s experiences directly to yours.

, If you know the person well, of course you should give him a hug, put your arm around him, or at least give him a reassuring pat if you don’t know him as well. If someone is grieving, then he may just want to be held and you can give the person more comfort this way.


Just make sure that the person does want to be touched and doesn’t shrink away—some people may feel very vulnerable after a death and don’t want to be touched at all.

, After you tell the person how sorry you are, ask if there’s anything you can do to help. You should only ask this if you really mean it and do want to help the person. You can offer to do anything, from running small errands for the person, to sleeping over that person’s house if you’re really close.


Wait for the person to suggest something specific—this may not happen right away.

Make annoying sounds.",How to Make Someone Mad1," One way to make someone mad is to belittle what she says or does by attributing it to her gender. This works best with females, since sexist comments are rude and offensive and easily make women angry.


Say, ""A woman is too emotional to do that.""
Try replying with, ""That's just like a typical woman.""
When a woman is upset, say, ""Are you on your period?""
Tell a woman, ""That's not very ladylike."";
, People don't like to hear about how well you eat, how much you work out, or how much weight you've lost. To make people mad, talk about these things at dinner. Make sure people are eating unhealthy foods to make your words have more impact.


While everyone is eating burgers and fries, eat a salad or grilled chicken. Then talk about how you never eat fried foods and red meat. Talk about how many calories are in a serving of fries. Tell everyone you never eat that kind of stuff and your waistline is showing it., When someone is nice to you, don't be nice back. Instead, respond with a mean comment. Tell them to leave you alone, or to go away. Shoot down every nice word or action with a rude, mean response.


When someone smiles and says hello in the morning, glare in response. Don't say anything to them.
If someone asks if you want a doughnut he brought for the office, say, ""No. Don't ask me again."" Or say, ""Only idiots like doughnuts."", People are very sensitive about their children and pets. A surefire way to offend someone is to say something rude about them. You don't even have to come out and say they are ugly; try backhanded compliments or rude questions.


Ask someone what gender their baby is. Or if you know the gender, talk about the child as if it's the other gender.
Tell a pet owner that animals don't matter because they're just animals. Or claim they don't have feelings.

, In the middle of someone's conversation, just jump in without regard to the person talking. Start adding your own opinion about the topic, or go completely off topic with a random question or unrelated topic.

, One way to annoy and anger someone is to ask a lot of stupid questions. If they have just explained something, ask them a question that they obviously just answered. Ask them a question that has nothing to do with what they just asked.


Go around asking ""Why?"" repeatedly. Whenever someone tells you something, follow that with ""Why?"" Continue asking ""why?"" until the person is angry.

, Those three concepts are extremely personal to people. By insulting a person's race, religion, or sexuality, you are hitting on sensitive subjects.


Try saying something like, ""You don't act black/Christian/gay."" Boil them down to a stereotype.Ask people what gender, race, or religion they are when it's very obvious., When people are angry or upset, they usually don't want to hear that they are being over dramatic or things aren't as bad as they seem. Doing this takes away the validity of their feelings. When people are mad, point out that things aren't bad. Tell them they should feel lucky despite their feelings.


Tell someone, ""It could be worse."" That is likely to irritate them further.
Tell the person to smile. If you know the person well, push her cheek into a smile. If you don't know the person well, shoot them an obnoxiously wide fake smile and point to your smile.
Say, ""You shouldn't care this much. It doesn't even affect you.""
Tell the person to calm down., Whenever someone says something, reply with a sarcastic one-liner. This shows you aren't taking what the person said seriously, and it irritates the person because you are being a jerk.


Reply with ""that's what you think!""Try saying ""your mom"" or ""as if!""
Instead of replying sarcastically to others, start or end your sentences with sarcasm. Say, ""Fun fact!"" or ""In fact"" before each sentence. End the sentence with something strange, like ""until the aliens come"" or ""in accordance with the prophesy.""

, Sounds are a great way to annoy people and tick them off. Go around making random sounds as you walk through a store or while you work. Walk by someone and make a weird sound instead of speaking.


Make a beeping noise when someone backs up.
Yell randomness or random numbers while someone is counting.Croak like a frog. Walk by someone and meow.
Yell like Tarzan or talk like a baby.

Verify that you truly want to go through with this.,

Use “I” statements to explain why you are breaking up with her.,
Avoid blame.,
Give her an opportunity to respond by actively listening.,
Refrain from saying “It’s not you, it’s me.” Avoiding blame all together is a much better approach to breaking things without hurting the other person more than the break up may already hurt them.,

Prepare a short, neutral response to others about the breakup.,
Delay making a new relationship public for some time.",How to Break up With a Woman," It is too easy to get caught up in the moment of an argument and break up without really wanting to do so. Take the time if you have had an argument or other issue to let your emotions settle and make sure you are not breaking up just as an emotional response to something you can get past.

While it may be tempting to talk this over with a friend or family member, it is important to make sure any choice you make is one that you can be okay with. You are the only one who can make this choice. Taking the time to make sure you are comfortable with this choice will prevent regret about the break up later.
For example, some good reasons that you may want to break up may be due to infidelity on either your part or your partner's, because you don't see the relationship going anywhere, because your partner's values don't align with your own, or because important people in your life are not supportive of the relationship.;
, Perhaps you could create a list to help you prepare for any questions she may have. It is tempting to focus on just the negative, but it may be more useful to make a pros and cons list to make sure you are actually ready to end the relationship. Putting your reasons on paper will help to clarify things and will also make sure when you are ready to talk to her without leaving anything out.


Having an outline of the reasons for the break up is a great place to start a role play to practice for the conversation. Taking a few moments to rehearse how you want to have the conversation can help you avoid turning it into an ugly argument.For example, you might truly enjoy how your partner makes you smile or feel good about yourself. However, you may also think she's overly clingy or doesn't like you to have your own friends or interests. Weighing the pros and cons can guide you in your decision.

, The last thing you want to do is avoid the person and the situation, so meeting in public in a reasonable amount of time after your decision will help in making the break up as easy and peaceful as possible.

Avoiding her or trying to end things behind closed doors can only lead to problems. It is much better to diffuse a situation in a calm, yet public space.

, This type of statement can help you make your own feelings clear without blame or making accusations. It is also much harder for the other person to argue with “I” statements because they are on a basic level how you and only you feel.

An “I” statement follows a simple pattern: I feel (insert emotion) when you (insert their action or behavior) because (explain why the behavior is a problem). You are owning your own emotion but also explaining how you got there.
For instance, you might say ""I feel ignored when you place your career in front of me because I have always put you first. I think I need to focus on what's best for me right now and make myself and my future top priority.""

, Stick with the facts. Getting caught up in the blame game clouds the real issues and doesn’t give either party a clear end to the relationship. The facts clarify without getting mean or destructive.You can avoid blame by making sure you use ""I"" statements that allow you to take ownership of your feelings about the relationship or your partner. For instance, if you said ""I want to break up with you because you are always saying you will call but never do,"" this type of blaming statement will likely cause your partner to become defensive.

, She may or may not see the break up coming, but she will feel better if she at the very least has a chance to respond. Taking the time to understand how to actively listen will help you to avoid arguing and also let her feel heard.

A big part of active listening is being able to mirror back her statements to her so she knows you heard what she was saying and understand. For example, you might say something like ""If I'm not wrong, it sounds like you're trying to say...""
Listening does not mean you are agreeing with anything. Instead your devoting some attention to her feelings and response gives her the chance to say what she needs to say to get closure.
Another part of active listening is your body language. Make sure you turn to face her. Also, uncross your arms and legs, which can be a sign of defensiveness., Making the conversation to the point without blaming either her or yourself is a much clearer and compassionate approach.

Telling the other person “It’s not you, it’s me” may seem like a gentle way to end things, but it leaves too much up in the air to be misinterpreted. That statement may leave you open for them thinking they can “fix” you since you are the one that is broken. It also can come off as being a cop-out or even cliché., This gives both parties closure and also allows you to make sure you give them the level of respect you should as things end. Even if it is uncomfortable, in the long run it is the best way to handle things and to avoid any confusion.

Although you may prefer to communicate with your partner via the phone, text or email, it is never a good idea to use those modes of communication to end things. This can come off as avoiding the other person and may make them angry or upset.

, In the moment it is important to make the break up clear and a definite end. A big part of this would be avoiding anything that may come off as being manipulative, including offering friendship if it isn’t possible or to just avoid the issue altogether.

, This could give her false hope of reuniting. Keeping clear boundaries without any hint of negotiating or fixing the relationship may seem harsh but it avoids misunderstandings.You will need to figure out if you want to delete things like social media connections. In the short term it might be better to make a clean break and not have an easy way for the other person to see your daily life. It’s often best to give each other a clean break for at least 6 months including ties on social media., Just as with social media, a clean break is usually best. You may still cross paths but you should out of respect at least try to avoid this happening. There may be places you both just have to be like school, or work, but avoiding places you have a choice about will cut down in the likely hood of it happening over and over.

, In some cases, your lives may be closely intertwined and it's impossible to avoid your ex. In these situations, just be sure to acknowledge your ex, but keep the interaction to a minimum.For example, if you run into your partner on the way to work or class, simply nod your head or say ""Hi"" and then continue on your way. This shows respect as opposed to looking the other way or avoiding contact with your ex.

, It can be incredibly tempting to bad mouth your ex if the relationship went downhill due to an indiscretion on her behalf. Avoid this at all costs. Be the bigger person and keep your mouth shut about the messy details of the breakup. Instead, prepare a short statement that explains that the two of you are no longer together. Save the venting and bad-mouthing.A short response to explain the breakup might sound like ""Oh, yeah, Donna and I are no longer together. It wasn't working out."" Resist the urge to further explain or put your ex down.

, Social media plays a huge part in many lives, but a new relationship doesn’t need to be broadcast publicly. This can be as simple as making your relationship status invisible online to avoid hurt feelings on the other side. Part of making a clean break is giving the other person time to move on without feelings of betrayal or anger.


Announcing a new relationship on social media may seem harmless, but sometimes checking up on social media is a way the other person keeps tabs on you. It’s better to just assume the ex may read the posts and be hurt by them."

Offer condolences to your close friend.,
Offer condolences to your loved one.,
Offer condolences to your boss.,
Offer condolences to an acquaintance.",How to Offer Condolences2," If you’re offering condolences to your close friend, then you don’t have to worry about overstepping boundaries. With a close friend, you can sincerely give your condolences, hug the person, and watch the person cry and maybe even join in. Just think about how the person reacted in other difficult situations and use this to get a sense of how the person may deal with the death.


If you know your friend is very emotional, try to give your condolences during a private moment so she can let her emotions out.
If you know that your friend doesn’t like to be touched, then don’t overwhelm your friend with a big hug.

, Giving your condolences to your loved one is tricky. Since you’re comfortable with that person, you should be able to talk about anything, but everyone has a different way of dealing with grief. Just tell the person you love him and that you’re sorry about what happened. Tell him you’ll do absolutely anything for him and hold him for a long time if he wants to be held.


To offer condolences to someone you love, holding and touching that person is just as important as saying the right thing. Just be there physically for that person.

, Remember to respect boundaries when you offer condolences to your boss. You can offer them to your boss in person, and even send your boss flowers or a card to show how sorry you are. Just don’t give your boss a big hug unless you have a warm relationship, and remember to give your boss space and to keep things professional.

, If you know that someone in your neighborhood or office has lost someone and you happen to run into that person, you may want to offer your condolences. This is especially true if that person knows that you know the news. Just say, “I’m really sorry for your loss” and add “let me know if there’s anything I can do for you” if you mean it.


If it’s a neighbor, you can offer to water that person’s plants if he goes away for the funeral; if it’s a classmate, you can offer to take notes for him while he’s away.

Offer condolences through a card.,
Offer condolences over the phone.,
Offer condolences on Facebook.",How to Offer Condolences3," Offer condolences through a card can make you feel even more at a loss for words than if you were standing in front of the person. But if you take the time to write a brief, thoughtful note, you’ll be helping a friend or close acquaintance in a time of need. Here are some basic things to keep in mind as you offer condolences through a card:


Don’t use the word “death” or “dead” - say something more tasteful, like “loss” or “passed away”.
If you knew the person who passed away, you can write a brief memory or anecdote about that person—as long as it’s tasteful.
Tell the person who suffered the loss that you’re thinking of him and that you are there to help.

, If you know that someone close to you has suffered the loss of a loved one, then you should communicate your condolences over the phone if that person lives far away. You should call that person to say you’re sorry and sound sincere and talk slowly. Give the person all of your attention over the phone and make sure you’re in a quiet place when you have some time to talk.


Avoid offering condolences through text. If you have a very casual relationship with that person, and he texts you and mentions the loss, then you can say you’re very sorry through this method. But if you know the person suffered a loss and you’re close, take the time to make a phone call instead of initiating contact through texting, which could offend the person with its casual nature.

, Though it may feel strange to give your condolences on Facebook, people now often tell all of their Facebook friends that they’ve suffered the loss of a loved one. This puts you in an awkward position—if the person knows you’re on Facebook a lot and you and the person post on each other’s comments often, then you’re almost being rude by not responding. Here’s how to offer condolences on Facebook:


If you don’t have a close relationship with the person but do post on his wall or comments from time to time, then simply join the masses of other people who have posted something like, “I’m sorry for your loss.”
If you’re a bit closer with the person but not close enough for a phone call, you can send the person a private message saying that you saw that the person lost a loved one and that you’re very sorry for the loss.
Obviously, if someone has posted a status about losing someone and has even written some kind words about the person, do not “like” this status. Even if you just like the sentiment about the person who passed away, this may give the person the wrong message and can be deeply offensive.

Refuse to pay attention when talking.",How to Make Someone Mad2," To make someone mad, flirt with their significant other. You can be serious with your flirting, or you can do it in a joking manner. The more obvious the flirting, the better. You want to the significant other to see you flirting so he can get mad.


At a party, flirt with someone you know is in a relationship. Make sure your body language reads that you are flirting. Turn towards the person, lightly touch his arm, laugh at what he says, and compliment him.
If you want to make strangers mad, walk by a stranger and say, ""Why didn't you call last night? I missed you."" Or act mad by saying, ""Why didn't you call last night? You're such a jerk!"" Then walk away., No one likes to be ignored. To really irk someone, ignore her. Don't look at her, don't speak to her, don't interact with her at all. Pretend she doesn't exist. This will make the person angry and possibly hurt her feelings.


If someone talks to you, continue working or doing what you are doing like the other person doesn't exist. If she says, ""Do you hear me talking to you?"" just keep working.
If you get together with people, leave the person out. Don't send her the Facebook invite, don't text her, and don't invite her when you ask around the office., No one likes a line cutter. To really get under people's skin, cut in front of someone. Don't say excuse me, and don't look back when someone yells at you for cutting.


While in the line at a bathroom, march past everyone and slip into the open stall before someone else does.
Cut in line at a restaurant or coffee shop. Just step into line like you belong there. If someone calls you on it, act like you don't know what they're talking about. Don't move.
While waiting to merge onto a congested road, drive along in another lane to the front where everyone is merging, and force your way into the long traffic queue.

, Most people don't like loud noises, and no one likes being yelled at. Simply raising your voice can start to grate on people's nerves. Yelling at them at full volume may freak them out, but also anger them. Don't yell at them because you are angry; just yell at them for no reason.While at dinner, ask loudly, ""Can you pass the salt?""
At work, walk by someone and yell, ""Nice day, isn't it?""
When standing at the printer, raise your voice and ask, ""How are you today?""

, People don't like to be accused of things they didn't do. They don't like to be liars. To make someone mad, accuse them of taking something from your desk or saying something they didn't.


Claim that someone stole your stapler, then point to one of your colleagues. Blame him for taking the stapler. Insist it is him despite his denial.
Blame your brother for drinking your last soda. No matter what he says, insist that you know it was him., Driving under the speed limit annoys most drivers. To make someone mad, drive 10-15 miles per hour under the speed limit on a two lane road where drivers can't pass you.

, The smallest things can make people mad. Think about the pet peeves of the people around you. Start doing annoying things, increasing how often and loudly you do it as time progresses.


Chew gum with your mouth open. Smack your gum loudly. Blow bubbles and pop them.
Tap your pen against a table. Or tap your nails against the table.
Click your pen repeatedly.
Pick your teeth.

, When someone is talking to you, don't pay attention to him. Instead, do other things and make sure the person can see it. When he is finished talking, ask if he can repeat what he just said.


Look around the room while someone is talking. Lean over and whisper something to someone else.
Play on your cell phone. Having someone on a cell phone during a conversation is extremely irritating and can cause anger.
Work on something else. Write down your grocery list, doodle, or read the newspaper.

Recognize if an issue directly concerns you or not.,
Respect boundaries.,
Pay attention to cues.,
Assess the risk involved in a situation.",How to Mind Your Own Business1," Unless you are an immediate participant in a personal situation, it’s best to mind your business by not getting yourself directly involved. Even if you are indirectly affected by an issue, that does not mean that it’s about you or give you the right to intervene.A useful exercise for gaining perspective on a situation is making a ring chart to analyze your relationship to it. Start by drawing a circle and writing those who are directly involved in the situation in the center. Then, draw another ring for those people who are most affected by the issue. Keep drawing outer circles like ripples for each level of people affected, and see where you fall on the chart.
For example, if you’re thinking about a friend’s breakup, the couple would go in the center. Their family would come next, and friends like you would come third. Seeing this visually can help you recognize that, though you’re affected, it’s still not your drama to sort out. The best thing you can do is support those who are more directly involved.
Keep in mind that this is not to say that you should not get involved with social issues, like poverty or children’s health, that don’t affect you directly. However, you should be sensitive to work with those people who the issue at hand does directly affect if you do.;
, Recognize that everyone has a right to privacy and that each person is in charge of their own lives. Don’t expect people to share personal information or try to exert control over how others use their time or resources.One good way of respecting boundaries is being careful not to overstep your relationship with a person. For instance, if you’re dealing with someone who is a co-worker or client, be sure to keep your interactions professional. If you’re not a child’s parent, it’s not a good idea to try and discipline them.
Another important element of respecting boundaries is accepting other people’s right to their own values, beliefs, and opinions. While you may disagree with them, it’s often best to mind your business rather than trying to interfere with others’ belief systems.

, Step back when people communicate directly or indirectly that you should do so. Respect others when they tell you that something is not your business and/or change the subject. Even when they don’t explicitly tell you to butt out, be aware of what their body language is saying.For instance, if people are avoiding eye contact, angling away from you, or crossing their arms as you speak, they’re probably silently asking for you not to interrupt or intervene.

, Minding your own business does not mean being a bystander when you encounter a situation that’s potentially dangerous. If you see someone engaging in a high-risk behavior that is illegal, physically destructive, and/or potentially harmful to themselves or others, it’s responsible to intervene, especially if no one else is.For example, if you see two people getting into an altercation, it’s time to call the police, not to mind your own business. If a person is drunk and planning on driving, it’s fine to intervene and take their keys since they have great potential to do harm to themselves and others.

Find someone you may be interested in meeting.This can be anywhere... a book store, bar, restaurant, shopping center, etc.,
Relax.,
Glance casually in her direction.,
Don't stare.,
Meet her gaze with a smile.,
Avoid examining her.,
Try to read her facial expression.,
Let her be the first to break eye contact.,
Continue to look.",How to Make Eye Contact With a Girl1,"


If you find someone at a place you visit frequently, chances are you may have something in common. Something to talk about, perhaps.;
, Narrow and tense eye's tend to convey a negative or angry disposition, so do your best to maintain your calm. A calm demeanor will put people at ease and make them feel more comfortable speaking with you., Every so often, gaze over at her. Does she seem to be trying to make eye contact with you?

, Staring at people is not only rude, but it also makes people feel very uncomfortable.If you don't catch her eye, she may be uninterested or preoccupied. Even worse, you may be offended that you are staring.


If someone is unwilling to make eye contact with you, or seems to be avoiding it, this may be an indicator that she is not interested in speaking or meeting you.

, If the two of you make eye-contact, be sure to relax and smile. Again, an easy smile will make people feel more comfortable.

, Looking intensely at a person--even when eye contact has been established--can be rude and intimidating, even demeaning., Although this is highly subjective and is in now way a perfect science, do your best to interpret any expression she may have made. Did she return the smile? Or, did she politely nod? A smile may be an indicator of interest, while a nod just the opposite. Blinking or batting of the eyes can also be an indicator of interest.


Did she raise her eyebrows? This can be a way of saying hello or communicating further interest.Were her eyes wide open? This can be a way of communicating happiness or joy, even a feeling of ease.Did she seem to be lowering her chin, appearing to be looking up at you? This too can be a sign that she may be interested in meeting you., Don't look away until she does. This will communicate that you are interested in speaking to her.


The longer she maintains eye contact, the more likely it is that she may be interested in meeting you.

, After she breaks eye contact with you, continue looking in her general direction for another second or two. If she looks back, make eye contact with her once again and smile.


If she looks back, it may be an indicator that she is interested in meeting and/or speaking to you.

Take a moment to work out what the Golden Rule means for you.,
Give yourself daily reminders about the role of the Golden Rule in your life.,
Show respect and kindness.,
Use your manners.,
Be willing to be flexible in your approach to other people.,
Be compassionate.,
Realize the wider benefits of living the Golden Rule.,
Spread the attitude of living the Golden Rule.",How to Live the Golden Rule," There are plenty of people willing to interpret it for you but that's not the point. At its most basic, what does it mean to you and in what ways do you feel able to best express it through your actions and words? When you are able to define this for yourself, you'll find it connects better with you and it'll be easier to practice it daily. Then you are free to read and learn about the various interpretations of ways of enacting the Rule as proposed by others and see which ones you find most appealing and workable for you. Some questions to guide your thinking include:


How do I wish to treat others?
What does it mean to me to have the actions I do and the words I say reflect back on me?
What motivates the things I say to others? Are there times when I clearly know I should be kinder, more thoughtful or more interested? What stops me from being more connected and considerate on those occasions?
What about the times when I fail to live the Golden Rule? How will I get back on track?;
, When it's fresh in your mind, your actions will be directed about it.


Consider reading works that are based on the Golden Rule. Keep a few by your bedside table to remind you about it regularly. These works could be novels, books of positive sayings, works about peace, biographies of people who tried hard to live well and help others, etc. Don't limit yourself to any one author or genre––read widely and learn as much as possible to stay inspired.

, Whether or not you know the people with whom you're interacting, that should never define the manner in which you act towards them. Respect their dignity just as you expect them to respect yours.

, Manners evolved to keep poor and selfish behaviors in check. They're not meant to be a strait jacket; rather, they're an evolving body of helpful guidance in ways to interact with others politely and thoughtfully. In actual fact, manners are a shortcut for having to think more deeply about the impacts of your actions at the moment of interacting; by adopting good manners and making use of them, you don't have to waste time wondering if you're behaving well in the moment. Therefore, see please, thank you, being courteous and putting others ahead of you as the simple ways of ensuring that you will be treated in a similar way.


Be polite even when others are not. Politeness enables you to remain calm and stay focused on what really matters, especially when emotions run high and nervous energy takes hold. Politeness can be seen as a form of shield, a defense against unruly emotional outbursts.

, What works for you may not work for another person and interacting with others successfully requires a nuanced readiness to dance to each other's steps. Be ready to listen, learn and stay open-minded without pressing your preferred interests onto another. Interestingly, by respecting the other person's space and story, you'll often find that your listening and withholding of judgment heightens their respect for you. This creates a willingness on their behalf to hear your side too; it may take time but it's more likely to happen if they're aware that you're hearing them.


Establish a good rapport with a person from the outset. You can deal with disagreements and not seeing eye-to-eye later. What is important initially is to make a connection and to show that you care about the other person's dignity, in spite of your disagreement with their opinions, ideas or ways of being.

, Realize that everyone is doing it tough some of the time. That outburst that seemed directed towards you is often a manifestation of the other person's heavy internal unhappiness and pain and is in no way a reflection on your own worth. You could choose to take it personally and seek to make an enemy of this person. But it'll be better for your own sanity and happiness and for the sake of trying to help the other person find their way to healing if you don't harbor grudges, build up a big defense wall and try to take them down. You are not being asked to take this person back home to have dinner with you (although, you can if you like); you are simply being asked to use compassion to try to stand in the other person's shoes and unpack the story they may be bringing to you, unseen beneath their anger, resentment and rigid opinions. Think about why a person has reacted poorly towards you before you react and use your reflection to temper the manner in which you react.


Remind yourself how you want to live and how you wish to treat others when a moment of fury or knee-jerk reaction takes over.
Wear or carry a token that represents the Golden Rule to you. Whenever you find yourself in a situation where you feel you're going to break your allegiance to the Golden Rule, hold or rub the token to bring you back down to Earth.

, You serve as a role model to others when you live the Golden Rule on a daily basis and show it through your action and words. Being unswayed in your devotion to it gives strength to others to also live this rule, as they can see it is not only possible but that you are an example of someone who makes it so. The Golden Rule is as contagious as negative approaches to living with each other, although it takes more courage and practice at times. With more people adhering to the Golden Rule in their daily lives, the levels of anger, resentment, irritation and intimidation are likely to be kept in check but this requires a community-minded approach, not just seeing this as a way of feeling good about yourself.

, Plant seeds of kindness and respect and the Law of the Harvest will give you the return of like fruit!

Don’t butt in.,
Don’t offer unsolicited advice.,
Avoid judging others.,
Support others without intervening.",How to Mind Your Own Business2," If there’s a conversation, meeting, or exclusive event to which you have not been invited, it’s best not to interrupt or intervene. Stay away or walk away.


While being excluded can feel hurtful, it’s important to recognize that there may be good reasons why something is not your business.

, It’s tempting to weigh in when you see something that doesn’t mesh with your own daily practices or lifestyle choices. However, doing so implies that you know better. People are not likely to take kindly to your intervention unless they’re explicitly seeking it.If you find yourself wanting to confer nuggets of wisdom, remind yourself that everyone is entitled to make their own choices and that the way they choose to live their life does not affect you.
Part of this is respecting others’ choices and space. If you’re at another person’s house, don’t assume that they should live as you do. Let them practice their habits and norms without intervention.

, It’s natural to make judgements, so it’s important to be aware of and curb the downsides of that instinct. When it comes to minding your business, avoiding snap judgements means foregoing the assumption that you fully understand a situation. Give everyone involved the benefit of the doubt until you do., Minding your business does not mean that you should not offer love and support to others. It simply means that you should not assume to the role of fixer for their problems, which usually only complicates a matter instead of solving it.For instance, if your brother is getting a divorce, it’s not wise to try and play marriage counselor. However, offering him your comfort and company or taking care of his kids from time to time will help him out without contributing to the stress or drama of the situation.

Keep your distance or walk away.,
Change the subject.,
Stop the cycle of rumors.,
Catch yourself in the act.,
Make a conscious effort to share positive news.,
Set the example.",How to Mind Your Own Business3," Gossiping is inappropriate (and often unsubstantiated) talk about others’ personal affairs. It’s the opposite of minding your own business. If you know people are gossiping or prone to gossip, the easiest solution is to keep your distance.If you find yourself involved in a conversation that involves gossip, you can powerfully communicate your objection by simply walking away. Give yourself an out, such as, “Sorry to interrupt; I’ve got work to do,” and excuse yourself from the situation.

, If a conversation veers towards gossip, steer it in a different direction. This will demonstrate that you’re not willing to participate in gossip without having to admonish the guilty parties.The best way to do this is to refocus the conversation on a big-picture issue rather than on a private one. For instance, if you’re at work, switch to discussing the business rather than a fellow employee’s personal business.

, Don’t let yourself be drawn in by gossip or reciprocate by adding new fodder to the conversation. It’s better to stay silent. If you do find yourself in a gossipy conversation, don’t repeat its contents elsewhere. Make sure the buck stops with you., If you find yourself making or about to make a gossipy remark, gently stop yourself. If you slip up in a conversation, acknowledge that your remarks were inappropriate, and change the subject.Doing so will enhance your awareness of how you participate in gossip, and make it easier to avoid in the future. It also gives you a chance to set an example by taking responsibility for perpetuating rumors and negative behaviors.

, Gossip is a negative form of speculation about others. Counter it by focusing your conversations on the good things you know about a person.For instance, if someone is spreading rumors about the sex life of your co-worker Anthony, refocus the conversation on his recent standout report or volunteer work at the local food bank.

, You want to show that you won’t participate in damaging gossip, but you also don’t want to seem self-righteous about it (which is a form of interfering in itself). The solutions is to be a leader through your actions and behavior, not through lecturing or being dogmatic.If you’re having trouble staying away from gossip, start small. Challenge yourself to not participate for a full day. If you succeed, extend the length of your next challenge until it becomes a habit rather than a challenge.

Relax.,
Practice your smile in the mirror.,
Look at portraits of people.,
Practice making eye contact with the television.As you watch your favorite television show, practice making direct eye contact with the characters as if they are real people speaking directly to you.,
Go see a public speaker.,
Engage in short conversations with people you don't know.,
Look your friends in the eye when conversing.,
Take a test or survey.",How to Make Eye Contact With a Girl2," Although it can be very intimidating to make eye contact with someone you don't know, you need to do your best to maintain a calm demeanor. Nobody likes being looked-at with nervous, intense, or over-anxious eyes.The person you may wish to make eye contact with may be nervous as well. If you maintain a calm demeanor, you might be able to make them feel more at ease.
Intense or anxious stares may suggest hostility or anger--the opposite of what you are trying to convey.

, This may sound silly, but if you aren't in the practice of making eye contact with people, then you might not be in the practice of producing a gentle gaze or smile. You may not actually be ""staring"" at someone, but the look on your face may suggest otherwise. This can make people feel very uneasy.


Being stared at makes people feel uncomfortable and will make them want to avoid eye contact. Be sure to avoid making facial expressions that would suggest you are examining or critiquing a person.
Practicing your smile in the mirror will also help you get over any feeling of intimidation of shyness that you may experience when making direct eye contact.

, Get used to making direct eye contact by practicing on a few portraits. This may feel awkward at first, but that is the point. You want to continue to work through any feeling of awkwardness that you may experience while looking people in the eye.


You can even do this while flipping through magazines or while browsing the internet.

, Follow their eyes as they move around the screen.

, It is a lot easier to make and maintain eye contact with an individual when you are listening instead of speaking. Furthermore, being part of a group may help alleviate any anxiety.Practice making eye contact with someone delivering a speech or public address.


Even when the speaker is not looking at you directly, practice looking at their eyes.

, Maintaining eye contact for a long period of time can be uncomfortable or difficult, so start with short conversations with the grocery clerk, your neighbor, even a co-worker.The point is not to engage in a deep or meaningful conversation, but to practice making eye contact with a real person for short periods of time.


As you feel more-and-more comfortable, try increasing the length of the discussions.

, Practice looking your friends or people that you feel comfortable with in the eyes. Make this a priority when you are speaking to your friends and family.


In some cases, it may be easier for you to look at another spot on the person's face. If you pick a spot close enough to the eye they will not be able to notice that you are not looking at them directly., If making eye contact with a person continues to be a difficult task, you may want to consider taking a preliminary test to see if you may have social anxiety disorder.Social anxiety disorders can be identified as an extreme and constant fear of being judged, scrutinized, or critiqued.This could be the cause of your fear of making eye contact.

When conversing, pay attention to how often the conversational ball is passed.,
Pay attention to their body language.,
Do their replies seem short?,
Listen to notice whether they have cursed at you or mumbled under their breath phrases like, ""Whatever"", ""Oh Please"", and the most obvious, ""Why won't he/she just shut up?"",
If they occasionally seem to huff or breathe heavily, unless it is appropriate to the conversation, this would be another good indication.

If they print this out and leave it somewhere that they want you to find it.

If they keep cutting short your jokes, or news or topic on current events, saying they've heard it before.",How to Know if You Are Irritating," Has the other person said anything in the last 2 minutes? Have they responded to anything you said either verbally or physically?;
, Are their arms crossed? Do they appear stiff? Are their eyes drifting away while you speak? Are their feet moving slowly, but steadily in the opposite direction of you?

, Have they used more than a 1-3 word sentence while speaking with you?

, while you were speaking.

,,,,, Some people will feel more able to show their irritation than others. While some find it quite easy, others try so hard to be polite and those people may worry that they will seem rude or that they will hurt your feelings. These individuals may have been irritated for some time by you but you never suspected. They also are the people you mostly want to keep by your side, so change and repay their patience!

, Pretend not to hear anything that you say? Do they suddenly walk away while you are in the middle of a sentence and go off to talk to someone that isn't appearing irritating?

, It means they don't want to hear you out anymore and that you're irritating them.

Know how to greet people.,
Manage introductions with grace.,
Groom yourself appropriately.,
Write thank-you notes.",How to Have Good Manners1," Say ""Please"" and ""Thank you,"" when you need to, even to the person behind the counter at McDonald's. People notice when you're courteous and respectful toward them, and it can count for a lot.


Additionally, say ""Excuse me"" whenever you accidentally bump into someone, or if need to leave a social setting temporarily.;
, You don't have to be a guy to hold a door open. If someone will be entering the door shortly after you, pause a second and hold it open. Say, ""After you, sir/ma'am,"" if the person is a stranger; if not, use his or her name in place of sir or ma'am.


If you're unsure about whether or not the other person would appreciate having the door held open, ask politely. Say, ""May I get the door for you?"" This gives the other person an opportunity to accept or decline.

, Keep the volume of your voice as low as possible while still allowing people to hear you, and don't use slang or filler words (such as ""like,"" ""uh,"" ""so..."" and so on). Remember that the people around you are not all deaf, so you don't need to shout at the top of your lungs. They might think that you are rude.


If possible, try not to drop your Gs. For instance, instead of saying ""hangin' out,"" try to enunciate ""hanging out.""
Don't discuss rude topics in public, such as bodily functions, gossip, dirty jokes, swear words, or anything you wouldn't want your mom (or someone you have a crush on) to hear you say.
Don't interrupt or override another person when he or she is speaking. Practice being a good listener, and talk when it's your turn.

, If you're on a crowded train or bus and you notice someone struggling to stand up. (For example, an elderly person, a pregnant woman, or someone with a lot of parcels), offer him or her your seat. Saying something like, ""Excuse me, I'd be delighted if you'd accept my seat,"" can make the situation less awkward for the other person. If he or she declines, be gracious; say, ""Please feel welcome to let me know if you change your mind.""

, Offer your congratulations to someone who's just made a big accomplishment (such as graduating or being promoted), has added to his or her family (such as getting married or having a child), or has otherwise done something worthy of praise. People that you praised will be inspired and touched because of you. They will also do this when you achieved something.


Be a good sport. Congratulate anyone who beats you in a race, sporting event, election or other competition.

, Driving with good manners might seem outdated, but it's actually a matter of safety. Try to follow these tips:


If you come to an intersection, stop, so that if there's an another driver who doesn't seem to know how to manage, just motion him or her to go ahead of you.
Yield to pedestrians, and try to give cyclists plenty of room. Remember, your two-ton vehicle is a lot more dangerous to them than they are to you, so it's your responsibility to try to make sure everyone is safe.
Don't tailgate people or refuse to let them into your lane.
Use your turn signals even if you don't think anyone is around - you never know if there's a pedestrian or cyclist you just can't see.

, Whether you're in an informal or formal situation, acknowledging the presence of another person is a fundamental point of having good manners. (Failing to do so can be seen as an insult in most settings.) Here's what to do:


If you're greeting someone you know as a family member or close friend, an informal greeting is enough. It can be as simple as ""Hey, how's it going?""
If you're greeting someone who's an elder, business associate, church leader, or other formal acquaintance, stick to a formal greeting unless you're instructed to do otherwise. Greet the other person using his or her title (such as ""Mrs. Jones"" or ""Pastor Smith""), or use ""sir"" or ""ma'am."" Avoid slang such as ""hey"" or ""hi,"" and try to speak in full sentences. Something like ""Hello, Mrs. Jones. How are you today?"" could be appropriate.
Make any necessary greeting gestures. For informal greetings, how you physically interact with that person is your choice - you could do nothing at all, or offer a hug, handshake, or other greeting based on your relationship with that person. For formal greetings, though, it's appropriate to offer a handshake or bow your head forward slightly. If the person you're greeting formally goes in for a hug or an air kiss, accept it graciously.

, If you're with two people who don't know each other, but you know both of them, it's your responsibility to make the introduction of good manners. Follow these steps:


The person who is of higher social rank should have the second person introduced to him or her. That is, the person of lower rank is the one who should be presented to the person of higher rank. (For example, ""Mrs. Jones, I'd like to introduce you to my good friend, Jessica Smith."" Jessica is the person of lower rank in this introduction.) This is relatively easy in some situations, but here are some guidelines for when it's less clear-cut: younger people should be presented to elders, men should be presented to women, and laypeople should be presented to clergy, public servants, members of the military, or other people of higher rank. If you're still confused, just go with your best judgment.
Start out an introduction by naming the person of higher rank, then say ""I'd like to introduce you to.."" or ""this is..."", and name the person of lower rank.
After the two people have greeted each other, offer some information about each person. For instance, you might say, ""I've known Jessica since grade school"" or ""Mrs. Jones is my mother's dear friend."" Whatever you say should be able to start or sustain a short conversation, which you're responsible for carrying.
When you're being introduced to someone else, look that person in the eyes and remember his or her name. After the introduction, greet the other person and say something like ""How do you do?"" or ""It's a pleasure to meet you,"" and offer a handshake.

, Whether you're going to your school, your job, or just to the grocery store, your pristine manners will go unnoticed if you're not well-groomed. Take a shower everyday, and keep your hair, skin, nails and clothing as clean as possible. Wear freshly laundered clothes that are appropriate for the setting you're in (whether it's a school uniform or a business-casual look for work).

, Whenever anyone gives you a gift or does something particularly nice for you, send him or her a thank-you note within a few days (or a few weeks, for larger events such as a birthday party). Note how thankful you are for the specific gift or action, and how delighted you are to have the other person's friendship.


Note that a thank-you email can be appropriate in certain situations, such as the workplace or for someone who lives so far away that an email is much more expedient. When possible, though, it is preferable to send hand-written thank-you notes.

Lead the way.",How to Get Attention," Dress for the part you want: whether it's serious educator, future CEO, or looking just plain pretty! You have to look like you mean business and that you're taking this seriously (and more importantly, like you take them seriously!). Dress in clothes that flatter your body, that are clean, and free of stains and holes or tears. Iron your clothes if they're wrinkled. Put effort into choosing an outfit. Maybe go shopping just for the occasion of meeting an important person.


If you don't know how to, get ideas from popular clothing stores, like H&M or Zara.
Until you have a more comfortable relationship with someone, be they business partner or friend, you should dress to their comfort and appeal mainly to them, instead of yourself. This means that even if you like tight shirts, it may be better to hold off if it's going to be off putting for them.;
, Your haircut, your clothes, and your makeup (if you wear any) should all show that you're someone who lives in this decade. When people dress a little too much out of style, it sends the message that you have a hard time living in the present and that you cling on to the past. This rule applies to businesses trying to get attention too. It doesn't mean that you have to be cutting edge, although that can't hurt, it just means that you have to be identifiable as fitting in and understanding life as it is now.

, Using bold colors in your clothing, accessories, and makeup (or your advertising) will show a bold, youthful approach to life. This is usually a good thing. While you may need to temper it in business situations (a bold silk scarf instead of a bold blouse, for example) but having this highlights somewhere will always be a positive sign of personality and initiative.


Many studies have shown that for attracting men, wearing red is extremely effective. This should be used with caution, however. If you have a lot of red in your skin tone, wearing red can really bring it out and make it more noticeable.
People with very dark skin tones may look better in yellow, while medium skin tones may find turquoise more effective.

, When we don't practice good hygiene, it sends the message that we don't respect ourselves. Why should someone else respect us and pay attention to us if we don't even think we're worth looking at? Wash your hair and body regularly, take measures to present a clean face, and do things like brushing your teeth.

, Bad smell can put people off even the most fascinating person. Bathe regularly, use deodorant, try to have good breath, and wear light perfume or cologne in a pleasing smell.


There's almost no consensus on what smells appeal to what gender, but in general it seems that clean, fresh, and citrus smells appeal fairly broadly.
Try to match your scent to your personality. This will do the most to appeal to the people you want to appeal to.

, Bitten nails show a nervous personality (even if it's not true) and dry, cracked hands are no fun to shake! You want your hands to be inviting, because you can tell a lot about a person by what their hands look like. Keep your nails neat and attractive, and use moisturizers (lanolin cremes are great) to keep those hands soft and a pleasure to touch.

, That said, we don't want you to look like some cookie-cutter person. You shouldn't just bend to every trend. It's important to play up your individuality and the person that you are. Make choices in how you present yourself that reflect your personality, but temper them with what people expect to see. Being too out there can be off putting but being just a little unique is usually very charming.

, If you want people to pay attention to you, whether you're trying to sell them a product or you want to find someone to date, you have to be relatable. They have to identify with and feel connected to you. They have to believe that you are what you're selling yourself as. That's just human nature. This means showing your flaws and not trying to make yourself seem like Superman. Don't oversell it. You need to seem plausible, real, and tangible. You need to seem truthful.


When you're not relatable, people feel like they're getting sold a story. They feel like they're being manipulated. Instead, let them see a slightly better version of what they already know to be true. Then they will not only be motivated, they'll feel like you're something they can actually have and deserve.
This goes for those who feel lower than their peers too. Let people see that you own up to your flaws but you're really working to improve yourself. They'll give you a chance, because they hope that someone would give them the chance too.
Don't say things you don't really mean or laugh at jokes you don't get or don't find funny. People can tell.
You should also avoid rehearsed speeches. You don't want the ""ad copy"" sound. This seems more manipulative and fake. Instead, always speak from the heart.

, No one likes to be around someone that is a downer. They already know what's impossible. They know that life is difficult and sad sometimes. What they need is to know that things turn out well in the end. Everyone that goes through a hard time (which is everyone) inherently seeks out someone that convinces them that life gets better.


Start by finding the upsides in tough situations.
You should also keep complaints away: both by saving your own and helping others to set aside theirs.

, Everyone likes someone who's confident. The funny thing about confidence though is that very few people actually have it. It mostly comes down to being good at faking it. Don't talk down about yourself (unless it's a light jab in order to make a joke at your own expense). You also should speak up for yourself and be willing to approach people and strike up a conversation.


It's hard sometimes to hit a balance between being confident and being vain or self-centered. Don't try to make conversations about you. Focus more on feeling good about what you have to offer others (and offering it to them!) rather than making things about what others should offer to you.

, Whether you're trying to make friends, take leadership in the classroom, or sell your product to investors, it's crucial to actually know what you're talking about. People can usually tell when you don't. This doesn't mean that you should act like a know-it-all or show off your expertise all the time. It just means that you shouldn't claim expertise in an area you don't know, just in order to appeal to people.

, You need to be willing to break the mold a little bit. You have to offer something to people that’s more than the boring stuff that they’re used to seeing. Mostly, this means just getting out there and doing something! Just sitting around and sticking to what you’ve always done isn’t very engaging. Be just a little unexpected and be willing to take some risks. This will attract everyone from customers to potential friends.


People tend to feel like they live boring lives. When they see someone doing something exciting, it gives them the chance to feel like they’re exciting too by being connected to you.

, You need to be friendly when you talk with new people. You don't want to come across as cold or difficult to approach. This creates awkwardness and tension when you're trying to develop a relationship with them. Of course, you don't want to act overly familiar. Just be willing to open up to them about yourself and use inviting body postures and language. For example, instead of keeping your arms crossed while you talk, speak with your hands and make sure they see a big smile!

, In order to be really good at getting positive attention, you need learn how to read people. It's crucial for knowing when to press more and when to back off. Pay attention to how people use body language and what people say. Similarly, you need pay attention to what feelings people are expressing and what they say about the events in their lives, so that you can make an educated guess about what would interest them in that moment.


If they seem like they're looking for an exit, you probably need to back off for awhile and excuse yourself gracefully.

, When you want someone's attention, you need them to feel connected to you. They need to feel like the two of you get and care for each other. They need to feel like you're invested in their happiness and well being. Do this by creating and showing sympathy towards them. When they've had a hard day, they need to see you taking an honest interest in their problem and trying to make them smile (at no obvious benefit to you). They should also feel that you support and encourage them. Judgement and criticism only throw up barriers. Be their cheerleader and when they're making poor choices, instead of judging them simply guide them to a better solution.

, People naturally want to see themselves as the hero in their own story, not as the side character in someone else's. If you can play to this desire, you can be great at getting lots of attention. Appeal to people's curiosity, by giving them a puzzle to solve that ends in a reward. Appeal to their love of stories, by telling them a story with a happy ending that mirrors their own experience. Tell your own story in a way that paints them as the hero. No matter what you want from them, this will really help grab their attention., Similarly to how they need to feel like the main character in their own story, people want to feel important. This helps build the idea that we are side characters in their story, by helping them to feel like they're making an impact on the lives of others. Make them feel important by giving them small ways in which they can help you or by helping them to see the profoundly positive role they play in your life.


For example, if you're not that popular but you want to make friends, find a more popular person that tends to be nice than the rest and say something like, ""I'm having a really hard time making friends and you seem so good at getting along with other people. Can you help me learn to be better at making friends?""
If you want to appeal to a potential business partner, say something like, ""We here at Business Corps have admired how you run your company for years. You're an outstanding example to the entire industry and to me personally. We'd really love to find some way to work together, to bring some of your wonderful spirit of innovation into Business Corps.""

, You have to show people that you have something of value to offer them. In the case of relationships, friendships, and partnerships, this means giving as much as you take. It means being your own fully developed person with worthwhile traits. If you are a business, it means showing your customers that you can offer them more than your competitor, even if it's just a better balance of emotional benefits to physical benefits. Be there for people when they're having a hard time. Help them with their problems and make sacrifices for them with no thought to how it affects you. They'll remember how hard you worked for them.
This also means that you have to emphasize and play up why you are different. There will be lots of people with similar stories or generally similar offerings. You have to show them what you can do that no one else can. This might be something like a unique feature or it might be something less tangible, like a more ethical approach to what you do.

, Sometimes when you want attention from other people, you just have to say what you want. This is especially important when trying to get attention in relationships. This can be a dangerous move, but sometimes it's just what's needed to make yourself more relatable to others. Sometimes they just can't see themselves in you until you show it to them. If you're not having any luck with other methods, you can try to appeal to their sense of humanity by showing yours.

, Someone that's not afraid to take on the challenges that others shrug off is someone that gets attention. We're not saying that you should start skateboarding off a cliff, though. You're better off choosing the tough subject for a report, choosing a career that really takes some work (like being a firefighter), or creating a product that is completely new. Do something that someone is going to look at your actions and say: ""Man, I didn't think anyone would actually be brave enough to do that!"" This not only earns their attention, it earns their respect, and that is the kind of attention that you really want.


This advice also applies to finding relationships. A potential boyfriend or girlfriend wants to see that you're willing to and able to handle the more challenging aspects of life.
You have to balance risk vs reward when choosing challenges though. If it's a dangerous activity, for example, it's going to need an awfully high amount of benefits in the end to be worth it.

, Talent is sexy. It's beckons to people, regardless of whether they are potential relationship material or if they are customers. Everyone wants to know that girl that plays killer base. Everyone wants to know that guy that puts together outfits that belong in Vogue. Everyone wants to do business with that company that does advertising that makes Mad Men look like a bunch of kids working a lemonade stand. Find your talent, or develop a new one if you don't have one you like, and then embrace it and show it to the world.


You'll find lots of good primers on lots of cool skills all across wikiHow. Poke around to get some ideas and see what speaks to you!

, Unfortunately you can't just be 100% your own person that only appeals to you. It seems like that should be how life works, right? But when you only do things that appeal to yourself, it shows a lack of interest in other people. It makes you seem self-involved. It makes you seem like you're not interested in being a team player. Temper your own approach to your interest area with something that appeals to a wider audience. This way people are more likely to look at what you're doing and see something that they can get behind, even if it is a bit unique or unusual.


For example, if you like old-fashioned clothing, don't go full-on 1950s rockabilly. Instead, mix vintage pieces with modern looks into a wardrobe that also features modern pieces. This way the flavor of your personality shines through, but it doesn't hit people over the head.

, Don't flit from one trend to the next, or from one interest area to another. This makes it clear that you're only doing things to get attention and it makes it seem that you don't really care about anything you do or the people that it appeals to. Instead, let progressions happen naturally and move slowly from one area to the next.


For example, don't go from selling jeggings to selling tablet covers. Instead, move on from jeggings to selling more general accessories and then move on to more decorative items like tablet covers.

, You want to command attention, not just ask for it. Now, generally you should do this by being nice and appealing to the better side of people. Sometimes, though, you'll run into people that are so caught up in themselves that they distract from what you're trying to offer people. When someone is being a jerk, ruining the experience of other people, or generally being rude to you: call them out on it. Let them know that their attitude isn't wanted and that they can take their negative approach elsewhere. It's fine to have constructive criticism or try to find solutions for flaws, but always looking for the downside isn't helping anyone.

, Dramatic gestures to get attention are childish and tend to make you someone that other people don't want to be around. You'll come across as unpredictable, lacking a sense of appropriate behavior, and more of an attention whore than someone that actually deserves attention.


A good example of this attention-grabbing behavior can be see in the characters in a lot of children's shows these days.

, Be a leader. When no one is willing to take responsibility in a situation, stepping up to the plate will earn you the reputation of someone who's worth paying attention to. You become known as the person that others can come to and rely on. Be a leader by being decisive, thoughtful, and firm. Live up to the promises you make and be willing to take risks that will bring benefits to others. Take responsibility and act nobly when things don't go the way you'd hope. You'll grab the attention of everyone around you before you know it.

Only use your phone in appropriate settings.,
Ensure the number you have is correct.,
Check your voice!,
Practice basic conversational courtesy.,
Give people a chance to answer their phone!,
Don’t spend an hour (or hours) chatting to someone.,
Know how to answer the phone.,
Put someone on hold politely.",How to Have Good Manners2," For instance, it's impolite to use it in the bathroom, in the middle of a meeting, when a service person is helping you, in church, or (sometimes) on public transportation. If you feel awkward using it or people are giving you dirty looks, you should probably put it away.


When talking on the phone in a public space, keep in mind that everything you say is no longer just your news. Keep your voice at ""indoor voice"" level, or lower. Generally, people with good manners don't talk about potentially embarrassing private issues in public.
When on the phone, don't talk with others in the room. What's worse than having a phone conversation with one who chats, perhaps not listening to what you're saying, and you can't tell if they are speaking to you or others. If someone tries to talk to you, simply point to your phone and they will get the message.
Avoid using the computer while on the phone unless it's part of customer services. It is extremely rude and unpleasant when someone makes you listen to a clacking keyboard.
When with others in a social setting, try to refrain from using your cell phone. It implies you'd rather be somewhere else, with someone else, and that who you are with is less important.
Don’t phone before 8:00 am and after 8:00 pm unless in an emergency or an important overseas call. Also avoid calling people during meals, work, and school. People don't expect you to drop in and visit at these times, unless it is arranged. This includes texting, though you would obviously not text for emergencies.

, If you do disturb someone and it’s the wrong number then ‘please’ have the decency to say, “I’m so sorry! I have the wrong number!” DO NOT just hang up. That individual may be ill, in a wheelchair, or elderly, etc., so you should show respect and apologize for their inconvenience. Likewise, if a person with a wrong number phoned you, politely point out that they have called the wrong number.

, It carries much more than just a tone, and reflects your character and personality even on the phone! Remember: your listener cannot see you, so your phone-voice becomes your facial expressions, gestures, personality, and character. Always check your voice when speaking; speak in a pleasant tone and very clearly. Smile through your voice! What they hear will make a positive or negative impression.

, When someone answers the phone don’t be harsh and abrupt by telling them what you want first. This confuses them and makes them wonder who you are. You also appear very rude, which is bad if you need a favor from them. It gives the wrong impression before you start! And don’t say, “Who is this?” You phoned them, so introduce yourself and state who you are and what you want – politely! For example; say “Hello, my name is Mrs. Peppermint, I'd like to speak to Mrs. Sally Lemon. Is she available?” If the person is not there, state to the person on the phone whether you will call back later or request they call you back. Or if you are making inquiries, state; “Hello, this is Mrs. Peppermint. I saw an advert in the local paper for a shop assistant; is that position still open?” When finished, say, “Thank you for your help. Goodbye” and be genuine! Now ensure you give them time to say ‘Goodbye’ too!

, They could be outside in their garden, knitting, baking, washing the car, or at another end of the house. Don't just ring three times and hang up! It's annoying when you stopped doing something and just as the phone gets to your ear the caller hangs up! In the other hand, do not let the phone ring for too long, the person you're calling might be busy or doesn't want to take calls at the moment and you might be interrupting. Especially when calling a cellphone, and the recipient is in a meeting, movie etc.

, Don't waste people's time or disturb the household! It’s one of the biggest turn-off’s to having a friendly chat! They will not want to talk to you again.

, Just be pleasant and polite and say, ""Hello."" Avoid saying, ""Good afternoon, Smith residence"" or ""John Smith speaking."" It's too dangerous today. If you are alone and you don’t know who the person is, don't tell them no-one is home or your husband is working, etc. Always pretend someone else is there. Use wisdom and good old-fashioned common sense! Be safe!


If the call is for someone else, say something such as; “One moment please, I'll just go and call them for you.” Put the receiver down gently. If who they want to speak to is unavailable, say, “I’m sorry, Sally isn’t available right now. May I take a message for her and ask her to phone you as soon as she can?”

, If you must carry on two conversations at once you should always excuse yourself from one and resume it later. Say, ""I'm sorry, can you hold on a minute; my boss is telling me something,"" and wait for the person's answer. If the personal conversation will last more than a minute, it would be better to ask, ""Can I call you back? My mother needs to talk to me and it may take a few minutes.""


In case of needing a restroom break, say something to get off the phone, without sharing too much information. All you really need to say is ""Can you hold on for a few minutes? I will be right back.""

Don't chew with your mouth open.,
Say ""excuse me"" whenever you need to leave the table.,
Ask for someone to pass you a dish or a seasoning.,
Don't put your elbows on the table when you're eating (British and American culture).,
Know how to manage informal and formal place settings.,
Hold your utensils.,
Know how to rest your utensils.",How to Have Good Manners3," It's an obvious rule, but one that's easy to forget when you're enjoying a delicious meal.

, If you are a child or teenage, then ask an elder ""if you may be excused to (insert reason here)"".

, Never reach across a dish or someone else's plate to reach something; instead, politely ask the person sitting next to you to ""please pass the sauce.""

, It's an old standby to admonish people for putting elbows on the table during a meal. If the meal has yet to begin or is over, however, putting your elbows on the table is acceptable.


Elbows on the table are mostly considered acceptable in French culture.

, One of the most intimidating parts about dining can be not knowing which utensils or plates to use. Here's a quick primer:


If you forget the particulars, remember: ""work from the outside in"". This basically means that if there are utensils on both the right and left sides of the plate, you'll start with what's furthest right and furthest left, and gradually work closer to the plate.
If all else fails, just watch what everyone else is doing.
For an informal place setting, you should have a dinner plate in the center.

Immediately to the left of the plate will be two forks -- the one closest to the plate is the ""dinner fork,"" to be used for the main course; the one furthest from the plate is meant for a salad or appetizer.
A dinner knife will be directly to the right of the plate, with the blade facing toward it; next to that will be two spoons. The soup spoon is furthest to the right; the dessert spoon (or teaspoon) is between the soup spoon and the knife.
Your glass should be positioned directly above the dinner knife. Subsequent glasses should be placed to the right.
You might have a small salad plate to the left of the forks.
You might have a small bread plate to the upper-left of the dinner plate, with a small butter knife. Use the butter knife to take a pat of butter and put it on your plate; then use the knife to spread ""your"" butter onto the bread.
A dessert spoon or fork might be placed horizontally above the dinner plate.
A cup and saucer (if you're drinking coffee or tea) should be placed just above and to the right of the knife and spoons.


Know how to manage a formal place setting. A formal place setting should be mostly similar to an informal place setting, with a few key exceptions:

You might have a small fish fork between the dinner fork and the plate, if a fish course is being served.
You might have a fish knife between the dinner knife and the soup spoon, if you require one for a fish course.
You might have a small oyster fork on the far right side of the utensils to the right of the plate, if you'll be eating an oyster course.
Glasses are placed according to type in a formal place setting. The one directly above your dinner knife is your water glass; to the right of that is a red or white wine glass, and then a sherry glass to the far right.



, How you hold your utensils probably depends on where you come from. Both are perfectly appropriate. In general, there are two styles:


American style: If you're cutting food, you'll transfer the fork to your non-dominant hand and put the knife in your dominant hand. After the food is cut, you'll lay down the blade of the knife on the edge of the plate, and switch the fork back to your dominant hand to move the food to your mouth.
Continental style: The fork remains in the left hand, while you use the right hand to hold the knife and cut your food. Once you're done cutting, you might lay the blade of the knife on the edge of the plate, or just keep the knife in your hand.

, How you put your utensils on your plate communicates to the service staff whether you're finished eating or you still plan to continue. For the purpose of these instructions, imagine the dinner plate like it's the face of a clock.


If you're finished eating, lay your fork and knife side-by side so that the prongs and blade are slightly above the center of the plate, and so that the handles are pointing between 3 and 4 o'clock.
If you plan to continue eating, lay down your fork and knife so that the prongs and blade are near the center, with the handle of one utensil pointing at 8 o'clock and the handle of the other pointing at 4 o'clock.

Understand the true definition of focus: giving one's complete attention over to an object, idea, endeavor, action.,
Recognize and overcome the ego-fallacies about focus.,
Understand that focus is a form of appreciation and, by its nature, is an act of attaching.,
Understand what focusing isn't.,
Understand that focusing may feel dangerous.,
Understand that focus may lead you into a 'flow' or 'zone'.,
Practice.,
Honest focus is a feat.",How to Have a Focused Gaze," Having dinner with a friend and periodically checking the door to see who's coming in is an example of not being focused. The friend knows it and, at some level, feels insulted. Texting while in a business meeting is not being focused, nor is just sitting there and waiting for it all to be over. Focus is the act of forgetting self in favor of total immersion in the object, person or task at hand.;
, Focus is a self-less act. Using the meeting example above...many think it makes them look important to be so 'in demand' that they must text while in a meeting. Only the immature are impressed. Most observers consider this behavior a needless distraction or an insult. Much better to forget self and impress by focusing on the people and/or job at hand.

, Focus is giving one's complete attention over to something, noticing it deeply. The act of focusing gradually becomes a form of appreciation. Focusing in order to get to 'rejection' leads to failure because it leads to detaching from the object. The effective equation? Focus...appreciation ... attachment ... more focusing ... more appreciation, and so on. This is one reason why it is hard to fake the 'focused gaze'. Few can remain attached to and appreciative of something/someone that is not appealing to them.

, It is not self conscious in any way. It is not self-evaluating. This is a clear case of 'if we're thinking about how we're doing, we're not getting it done'. Concerns about how well we're doing, being 'in the zone' 'doing it right' 'doing it wrong' are indications of lack of focus. Being distracted by concerns for the thoughts and opinions of judges, bosses, audiences, others' expectations, one's own expectations, ...all of these are evidence of lack of focus. Being conscious of decisions, potential results and outcomes are a lack of focus. Every bit of attention being paid to any of these things is attention not being paid to the subject/person at hand. It is loss of focus.

, By its nature, focus requires detaching from surroundings, which may cause a feeling of vulnerability. For many, focus ultimately brings a heightened sense of connection, but that requires passing through this phase of momentary discomfort.

, Athletes, artists, and actors often want to lose themselves in the flow of the moment that focus provides. They work to heighten their focus - increase their commitment - in order to get in the zone and improve performance. This is something of an altered state. It's a normal result of focus.

, Focusing is a skill. It must be developed by practicing. Practice focusing and practice not being distracted. They sound the same, but are slightly different. See exercises in the tips below.

, It's an accomplishment. Why diminish it with such a superficial concern as whether one has adopted a 'focused gaze'. Leave behind the pretend and get real. Get focused. Get results.

Determine your teacher's restroom policy.,
Choose an appropriate time to ask if you may use the bathroom.,
Ask to use the bathroom.,
Respect your teacher’s answer.",How to Get Permission to Use the Bathroom in School1," Bathroom policies will vary from school to school, teacher to teacher, and grade to grade. If you do not understand the bathroom policy, ask your teacher or professor to explain the rules and procedures to you. If you can not remember the restroom rules, ask your teacher to remind you of the rules. If you can not comply with any part of the bathroom policy, set up a meeting with your parents, teacher, and principal to discuss the concern and develop a solution you can all agree on.In elementary, middle, and high school, you may be required to ask for permission to use the restroom.
In college and graduate school, most professors will let your come and go from the classroom as you please. When you do get up to use restroom, leave and reenter the room quietly and discretely.
If you are an exchange student, ask your host family, roommate, teacher, or professor to explain the country's cultural norms regarding using the bathroom at school.;
, Before asking to use the bathroom, make sure it is a convenient time for you to ask this question. Ask yourself, “Is it a good time to talk to my teacher and leave the classroom?”


Avoid asking your teacher to use the bathroom when they are in the middle of giving instructions, during the middle of a lecture, or during a lesson.
Do ask your teacher to use the restroom during independent work times, when you have finished all of your class work, or after you have completed a test.
If it is an emergency, remain calm and ask your teacher immediately., When it comes to asking to use the restroom, each teacher has a different policy. While some teachers prefer the traditional method of raising your hand to ask for permission, other teachers find this practice disrupting. Instead, they insist that their students use a special hand signal.


Raise your hand, wait patiently to be called on, and ask for permission to use the restroom. “May I please go to the restroom, Mr./Mrs/Ms. ____.”
Raise your hand with the special signal (perhaps crossed fingers) and patiently wait for a response. If your teacher is fine with you using the bathroom, they may nod their head ""yes.” If your teacher would like you to wait, they may shake their head “no” or raise a finger to signal “wait a few minutes, please.”, Your teacher may respond in one of three ways: “yes,” “no,” or “not right now.” If you don’t receive the answer you were hoping to hear, you must respect your teacher’s answer. If it is an emergency, tell your teacher it is an emergency and you can't wait to use the restroom.


If your teacher says “yes,” thank them and exit the room. After using the bathroom, return to the room quietly.
If your teacher says “no” or “in a minute,” ask again in a little while.

Fill out your pass to use the restroom.,
Ask if your teacher will sign your pass for the restroom at an appropriate time.,
Comply with your teacher’s answer.",How to Get Permission to Use the Bathroom in School2," In some schools, especially middle schools and high schools, students are required to fill out a pass each time they need to leave the classroom. Students generally receive a set number of passes for each semester, trimester, or quarter. Once a student uses all of their passes, they must wait until the next marketing period to receive more. In elementary school, you teacher may give you a set number of pre-printed bathroom passes or tickets. When you need to use the restroom, pull out your pass sheet and fill out the following information:


Date
Class
Reason for using the pass., After filling out or finding your pre-printed pass, subtly get your teacher’s attention. Raise your pass in the air until they notice you. When the call on you or come over to your seat, ask if you may use the bathroom.


Unless it is an emergency, do not ask to use the bathroom when your teacher is giving instructions or in the middle of a lesson.
Great times to ask for permission include after you have finished taking a test, while you are working independently, and during transitions from one activity to the next., When you ask, “may I use the bathroom,"" your teacher has the option to reply with “yes,” “no,” or “please wait a few moments.” If you don’t receive permission or are asked to wait, remain calm and respectful. If it is an emergency, explain the situation to your teacher and ask to be excused.


If your teacher says “yes,” hand them your pass to sign. Leave the room quietly, use the bathroom quickly, and reenter the room silently,
If your teacher says “no” or “please wait a few moments,” ask again at a later time. "

Use the restroom during passing time and lunch.,
Sign in and out of the classroom to use the bathroom.,
Grab a classroom bathroom pass.,
Use the restroom during approved times.",How to Get Permission to Use the Bathroom in School3," Many teachers and administrators prefer that students use the restroom on their own time. Visiting the restroom during passing time and throughout lunch time, teachers argue, increases the amount of time students are present in the classroom. While some students can manage to do this, others simply don't have time in between their classes.


If you have enough time in between classes, make an effort to use the restroom before your next class starts. Teachers will appreciate that you took care of this need prior to entering their class.
If your passing times are extremely short or your classes are really far apart, do your best to fit in visits to the restroom between classes. If you simply don't have enough time, ask your teacher for permission to use the bathroom during class., When you need to use the restroom, your teacher may allow you leave the classroom without asking for permission. Instead, they may simply require you to sign-in and sign-out of the classroom when you need to go to the bathroom. This sign-in/out sheet is usually located near the classroom door.


Quietly get up from your seat and walk to the sign-in/sign-out sheet.
Fill out your name, the date, the time, and where you are going.
If your teacher requires you to take a pre-printed pass, grab one before exiting the room.
When you return from the bathroom, sign-in and write down the time you returned.
Go back to your seat without disturbing the class., Some teachers have a classroom bathroom pass that they require students to take with them to and from the restroom. This form of pass is often less disruptive to the entire class. Students may take these community passes without asking permission to use the restroom and the teacher is not required to sign any passes.


When you need to use the bathroom, get out of your seat quietly and walk to the classroom restroom passes.
Grab the pass and take it with you to the restroom.
When you return to class, put the pass back and return to your seat.
If you get up to use the bathroom while your teacher is talking or giving instructions, they may ask you to wait a moment.

, In some classrooms, teachers use a sign to let students know exactly when it is and is not a good time to use the bathroom. One side of the sign may read: “You may use the bathroom without asking permission.” The opposite side of the sign may read: “Please wait to use the restroom. If it is an emergency, let me know.”


When the sign says, “You may use the bathroom without asking permission,” get up from your seat quietly and walk to the bathroom. After using the restroom, return to your seat quietly.
When the sign reads, “Please wait to use the restroom. If it is an emergency, let me know,” wait patiently for your teacher to flip the sign. If you are having an emergency, notify your teacher immediately."

Consider what direct and indirect demands you have been making.,
Be prepared to evaluate your viewpoint of the situation as objectively as possible.,
Recognize that often, men do not concentrate on the same details as women on a given conversation or situation.,
Organise your thoughts.,
Get your priorities straight.,
Contemplate whether you feel the relationship has a future.,
Prepare yourself to talk to him about it if you think addressing the issue will make it better.,
Let him know that there is something you would like to talk to him about.,
Start the talk with saying how much he means to you and why you entered into the relationship.,
Connect the criticism to the positive things you said before by telling him something like ""I really loved when you used to .., but lately, you haven't done that anymore."",
Be careful not to make it a nagging monologue, but address a certain behaviour and say clearly ""This makes me feel neglected / unattractive / not appreciated / stupid / sad"".,
Show him how much this means to you and that his behaviour hurts your feelings.,
Ask him to explain why he acts that way.,
Keep the discussion on track.,
Accept his apology if he offers one.,
Take small steps with the changes.,
Make changes yourself if the discussion has uncovered something you do that bothers him.,
Praise him for taking more care of you if you notice he's making an effort.

",How to Get an Adult Male to Use His Manners," Reflect on the balance of personal demands you are making to your partner, and evaluate whether that balance is just.;
, Don't go into the impending talk convinced that anything he might say is either wrong or not heartfelt. That won't help to solve the problem.

, Recollections of events will naturally differ, and importance placed on particular situations will greatly vary between men and women. There is no right or wrong interpretation or recollection of any given situation. Your male partner's views and responses are valid in his world view, as yours is equally valid.

, Sit down in an undisturbed place for a few minutes and compose a list of what is bothering you. It may be that you are never treated politely, that he is ignoring you, that he never gets the groceries out of the car anymore or anything else that makes you feel neglected.

, List the traits or behavioural patterns in the order of importance. What disturbs you most? What changes have to be made fastest to keep you from just walking out?

, Viewing your list, try to assess whether the man in question will be able and willing to change his behaviour. If something on the list is a trait he is even proud of, the chance of him dropping it is pretty slim.

, Maybe you want to take a few notes. Don't get worked up beforehand. Be confident that there is something you can do together to improve your relationship.

, If you want, you can set up a certain time to discuss it. Don't let it slip into the background or postpone it, emphasize that this is important to you.

, That will give you a good start (you've just praised whatever it was that made you fall in love with him) and a solid ground on which to build your criticism.

, This is the observation of a fact. Don't judge his behaviour by saying something like ""You haven't done that anymore, so you don't care about me."" That is a negative presumption. It probably isn't true and would hurt his feelings.

, This way, he probably won't dismiss your points as ""not a big deal"".

, You don't have to clearly threaten to break up or get divorced, but you should make clear that you do not feel like you're his partner any more (if that's what you feel) or that he doesn't care as much about you as he used to.

, Let him know that you really want to understand him and connect to him. Don't do this in an accusatory manner (i.e.: ""Why do you do that? What's wrong with you?"" would instantly make anyone angry and defensive). He might be overwhelmed and say ""I don't know."" Don't assume that this means he doesn't care. Try to guess what underlying need might have influenced his behaviour (i.e.: If you feel ignored by him, you could ask ""Do you feel I've not been making an effort to spend time with you?"").

, He might try to throw things back at you, like you letting yourself go or whatever. Make the offer that he can tell you about what bothers him when you're done, that you don't want to mix up the issues and that the point is not in placing blame. When you're done with the issue at hand, really go back and let him tell you about what bothers him. If he says you're letting yourself go, try to go deeper than that. You might ask if he feels you don't care about him any more because you haven't made an effort to look nice around him, for example.

, If he doesn't, ask him if he is willing to work on the problem together, and that both of you might be more considerate of each other's needs and feelings in the future. If he loves you, he will say yes.

, Don't expect him to change everything at once, it will probably take a lot of his energy, so observe during the next few weeks if he does something considerate and keeps it up.

, That way, he will know that you're reliable, it's important to you, and that you want him to be happy.

Think of a person that you find really nice and has a nice nature.,
Look what you came up with.,
How many of these qualities do you think you have?,
Be polite.,
When it comes to consideration, remember peoples feelings.,
Being a good friend is vital when you want to appear as a nice character.,
Generosity is something that we should all have among our other good qualities.,
Always be kind!It really isn't difficult just to be friendly, polite and nice.,
Caring for others shows how nice you really are.,
Now hopefully you have shown the world how nice and friendly you really are, you'll be getting along with everyone much better.

",How to Get Along With People and Be Nice," What qualities do they have to be like that? It could be anything from politeness to being supportive. Make a list,even.;
, Here are some examples: they are polite, considerate, a good friend, generous, kind and caring.

, Here's how you too, could change they way you relate and communicate with those around you for the better.

, This includes swearing at all (at least,not in front of anybody or very mild and not that serious). When you get angry, count to ten and take a deep breath. Think about what could happen if you said what was on your mind at that time. Chances are, not something very good. If someone is rude to you,instead of getting in a scrap about it then just say something casual and light,like ""Yeah,well,that's your opinion"" and if they call you a name, ""And anyway, your wrong because I'm not what you say I am. But I'm not going to bother getting into a fight with you"". Much more mature then screaming your head off! Tell someone if the person really upsets you, though. Keep your cool. Be nice to those around you, and respect everyone else.

, How would you feel if someone was about to laugh at you, if you were just about to do that to someone else? Think of other people as well as yourself in situations like this.

, Be with your true mates, who are ones that would never bully, laugh and hurt you. Support a mate when they have a problem and listen, make an effort in friendships, talk to them regularly, and just be what you would expect to find in a friend. Remember, be a good friend and you will receive good friends in return!

, Make a card or give a present to somebody when it is their birthday or Christmas, and learn to share.

, Anything from holding open the door to someone or giving a smile could make anyone's day!

, Offer to help and be especially nice to someone when they are ill. How about making a cup of tea or hot chocolate for a family member when they're poorly? And you could just quickly ask a friend who wasn't at school to see how they are. Even if its something very small, it makes a difference to how someones feeling, which is great!

You will continue folding the napkin like an accordion, taking two inches of fabric and folding it towards the center of the napkin.Stop folding when you have approximately four inches of unfolded napkin left.

, Now, fold the napkin in half horizontally bringing the two bottom edges of the fan together. Your fan should now be folded in half with the extra four inches of unfolded napkin hanging on the inside fold of the fan.


If the unfolded napkin is on the outside of the fan, unfold the fan and refold it the opposite way.

, Take the unfolded corners that are part of the four inches of unfolded napkin section. Tuck the top corners unfolded napkin section into where the two halves of the fan meet. This will make a triangular edge along the unfolded section.


Make sure to tuck it securely to make a sturdy base.

, Let the napkin fan out into a semi-circle. The base that you’ve created from folding the unfolded corners of the napkin will act as a base to keep your napkin fan standing.Be aware that this fan is delicate. The fan may fall and unfold if you try to move the dinner plate that it is resting on.

, You can use the same basic technique of the standing fold to create a fan that can be placed inside of a glass. Rather than leaving four unfolded inches, fold the entire napkin like an accordion.Now that the napkin is fully folded, take one end of the fan and fold approximately one inch over. Allow the fan to open up.
Place the folded end of the fan into your glass and spread the rest of the fan out. This technique is called the goblet fan.

Be clean.,
Sit nicely.,
Be polite.,
Leave your cutlery where it is.,
Be tidy.,
Eat slowly.,
Wipe your mouth.,
Thank the chef.",How to Eat Like a Lady," Before eating your meal, make sure you wash your hands and mouth. Check to make sure that nothing is stuck in your teeth or braces, cover up any cuts with a plaster or two and, if necessary, cover up all off-putting spots and blemishes with makeup. Also, get the dirt out from underneath your nails. Nothing is more disgusting to everyone else than you eating with dirty, black nails. If your clothes have any spillages on them that look quite nasty (E.G., Milk spills, tomato sauce etc) be sure to change before dinner time. Oh, and make sure that nobody sees you doing all this, that can be off-putting in itself.;
, After making sure that you're clean and nice to look at, you need to be able to sit nicely. This means no slouching, no resting your legs on the chairs opposite you and don't rest your elbows on the table. Sit up straight and look sophisticated. You don't have to look like a pole to look good, but slouching is generally what men are stereotyped to do. If needed, lay a clean napkin on your thighs to catch any food or tuck one into your shirt by your chest to keep your top clean. This works best with foods that are saucy.

, If your food has not yet arrived, don't sigh or complain. Just wait patiently and make small talk with the other people on your table. Also, don't check Facebook on your mobile every two seconds, it's not going anywhere. If your phone rings, excuse yourself and take the call somewhere else. Only do this if it's absolutely necessary. If you get a text, ignore it unless it's important. You can always explain to the person calling why you never answered them later.

, Playing with your cutlery will make you look as if you'd rather be at home so try to avoid this. If your cutlery has already been laid out for you, leave it there. If your cutlery is in the middle of the table, politely pick up a knife and a fork. Put these on either side of your plate. Alternatively, you can put them both on one side. If you really do get bored, you can always play with your cutlery to hint that it's time to put some food in front of you. Never, though, bang them on the table shouting ""we want food!"". That's just rude.

, When your food finally does arrive, be tidy with it. Hopefully, everything isn't just slopped onto your plate. Your plate should be looking relatively similar when you're done. This means that if you don't like something, gently move it to the side of your plate. When trying to mix two items together (rice and peas, for example), be very careful and try not to spill any on the table. When somebody comes to take your plate away, they probably don't want to see your food all over the place. Try to keep everything in a certain section of the plate unless you want to mix two things together.

, Unless you haven't eaten in three days and somebody has finally given you a bowl of chicken soup, there's no real excuse to eat like a pig. Don't shove everything down your throat at once, it looks disgusting and you're most likely going to get more of the food on you than in you. Eat slowly and take care with how you're using your cutlery. For example, if you have a tough piece of meat, just be patient and keep cutting it or use your fork to pull it from the bone. Don't put it between your teeth to try to separate it, you're a lady, not an animal. If you really are having troubles though, maybe ask somebody else to help cut it for you so they look like the sloppy ones instead.

, When you feel a little bit messy, feel free to wipe your mouth. You can do this whenever you feel like it because nobody is going to complain. They will complain or feel sick, however, if you never wipe your mouth. If there are no napkins lying around, ask the dinner host or waiter for one. You can always remove the one from your chest or lap and use that instead. Try to have a napkin nearby beforehand so you don't get all messy and then have to embarrass yourself asking for one. If you have sensitive skin, you can always keep a packet of soft tissues in your bag or pocket and use them instead. If anybody questions it, politely explain that the other type of napkins hurt your skin.

, If the chef is sitting at the table with you, be sure to thank him/her. Even just saying something like ""Wow, that really was lovely"" is going to be a huge compliment, especially if the chef is your date. If you didn't like the food at all, still give your thanks and maybe add some advice to it. Don't be rude though, just say something similar to ""Wow, that was nice but I might have added a bit more salt myself"". If you're going to do this though, make it clear that you still enjoyed the meal, even if you really didn't. Think of it this way, what would you want people (or your date) to say about your dinner?

, Is everyone else eating it? If so, then your taste buds just might not be agreeing. So look around for options.

, You can either eat it, because (likely) it won't kill you.

, Ah, so you've decided to go to the dark side, huh? Well now you have to start looking for alternatives. If eating it isn't an option, then look for another way to dispose of it.

, Hey, it's not fair that we get this gourmet food, while all they have is kibble! Right? If you sneak it smoothly to your dog, then you're good. Just make sure it's not something they can't eat like chocolate, grapes, tomatoes, etc.

, Shoot. Still got some tofu pancakes, but unfortunately, you don't have a dog. Maybe you should consider getting one? Anyway, you can almost always hide your food. Look for vacant spots in napkins, glasses, pockets, dog's mouth, etc.

, So you're sitting with your family for a Friday might dinner.Dad to your right, sister to your left. Take a small portion,(bite size) and carefully put it in someone else's plate when they aren't looking. A parent exchange might be risky, because moms are forever looking with the eyes in the back of their head to see if you're eating her fried Shiitake burgers. But if you put a little bit, slowly, then you're safe.

, This method is only in extreme disgust of your meal and only mastered experts can even attempt this. If you aren't then STOP.

, Ask a parent if you can use the washroom. This is one form of destroying your food. Before you go, take a big chunk of whatever it is, and put it in your mouth. When you go to the bathroom, close the door, and quietly spit the whatever it is inside a small wad of toilet paper or a napkin. Drop it in the toilet, and flush.

, This is basically the same as the last step, however you must do it when nobody is looking or no one is hanging around. Or you could request to use the washroom, and instead of putting it in the toilet you can drop it in the bottom of the trashcan. Voila!

, Be careful. If by now everyone has left the table and has given you the usual routine saying: ""You can't leave the table without eating all of your food!"" Then you are in luck. Simply open the door to your backyard,preferably you have a fence or a park behind you. At least some kind of fence to hide it. Wind up you good arm, and give it a hearty toss. Hopefully, it makes it over the fence and out of your site!

, Talk to your parents about your amazing B+ in algebra, or you could arrange your fried tentacles in a happy face, making your parents think that you are an artistic genius.

, Tell you mother in law you love her new hair cut. Ask your wife if she's lost any weight.

, Say that you just ate, or that you don't like to eat when you feel sick. Say you're a vegetarian, or that you declare today opposite day, so you should desert first.

If they are slouched, have their arms crossed, or seem disengaged, they may be bored by your conversation.
Ask plenty of questions about the other person. Try to avoid standard conversation starters like “What do you do for a living?” but instead ask fun questions like “What’s the best part of your week?” or “What makes you feel passionate?”, Boring people often have no opinions or are afraid to share their opinions. Sharing your opinions shows that are paying attention and have something to contribute.If you disagree with someone, be considerate of their opinion. Don’t attack them, but show that you are listening and engaging with them.
When you do share your opinion, make sure to know both sides of the conversation. Otherwise, you may come across as uninformed.

, Look for opportunities to have a good time. Boring people are often inhibited or afraid to do something that seems crazy; instead, try to always look for a way to have fun with others.


If you have any skills or talents, show them off. Don't make yourself the center of attention, but find ways to show that you know how to do things.
Try not to worry too much what others think. If you're feeling and acting natural, that will make you a less boring person.

, Boring people often moan about their life and work, whereas less boring people see life more positively. Talk about the things you care about, not the things that bother you.If you are talking to people about what you are excited about in life, you are more interesting and engaging to others. Being passionate really shows through in your nonverbal body language.

, Focus on the talents and skills of other people as well. When you're talking to them, ask them about things they care about, so you don't make the conversation all about you.


Don't be conceited. Try not to worry about how you come off to others. If other people are the center of attention, that does not make you a boring person.

, A grin shows that you approach life with a positive attitude and that you're interested in making friends. If you have a blank or sad expression on your face, you’ll come across as boring and disengaged to others.


Smiling makes you feel happier and more open to new situations. It can really improve your mood and make you more likely to talk to others.When you smile at others, it’s often contagious. They’ll want to smile back at you and feel more receptive when talking to you."

Make laughter a priority.,
Don't be scared to be wacky or zany.,
Don't wait for others to begin having fun.,
Try to look at things from a unique perspective.",How to Be a Less Boring Person3," If laughter is important to you, then you will make an effort to laugh when you're around others. It is part of your personality to be a person full of laughter, which shows you feel joy in life. In contrast, boring people often seem joyless and do not laugh often.Laughter brings people closer together. It bonds them together socially through the shared experience of laughter.If you make laughter a priority, this shows that are a joyful person. It shows that you are in touch with yourself and others., Sometimes, it's good to dance like a goofball, have unusual conversations, or do silly things. Holding back your silly side from others may close you off from them and make them think of you as a boring person.


Always involve others in silliness. Don't be a clown for others, but instead bring them into any fun activity you are doing.
Being silly also shows that you don't care too much about what others are thinking. You are interested and engaged in others, but not reliant on them for your sense of self-worth., Boring people often wait for others to entertain them. Instead, start the fun by yourself and encourage others to join in engaging in fun and playful activities.


Start joking with others when the opportunity arises. They may be willing to join in the fun, but were just waiting for others to start.
Do something silly or outrageous to gauge everyone's reaction. If they are amused or entertained, then you know that they are also interested in laughing and having a good time.

, Humor is a sign of intelligence and flexibility in terms of outlook. Boring people often seem inflexible and not willing to change their perspective. When people are talking, think of funny ways to take their words or their actions. Don't insult them, but try to find the humor in any conversation.
Don't be afraid to make fun of yourself. Making fun of yourself shows that you do not take yourself too seriously."

Press your thumb and middle finger of the same hand together.,
Relax all other fingers but keep your wrist straight and still.,
Quickly slide your middle finger off your thumb, causing your middle finger to strike the palm of your hand.,
Repeat the snapping motion for the duration of the time you wish to be ""clapping.""",How to Clap With One Hand2," Apply as much pressure as you can without hurting either finger.








, Your wrist is only used for support and you won’t use your other fingers at all.








, Because your middle finger and thumb were pressed together, this should happen quickly and result in a “snap” sound.

Open the palm of your hand, as you would if you had both your hands free to actually clap.,
Find a second surface available.,
Repeatedly strike the second surface with your open palm.",How to Clap With One Hand3," Maintain a relatively relaxed hand position.

, This could be your leg, the program you are holding in your other hand, or something else that is near you.


Try to have this surface chosen before the need to clap arises. This will help you clap smoothly instead of appearing frantic as you find something to use.
Don’t use anything that will disturb another person, such as a shared armrest that might shake their chair.

, It should be hard enough to create noise, but not hard enough to break anything or hurt (if the second surface is your thigh.)

Practice being optimistic.,
Avoid complaining.,
Develop some form of stress-relief.,
Express your gratitude.,
Replace the word “have” with the word “get.” The chores and monotony of daily life can easily bring you down.,
Avoid unnecessary drama.",How to Be a Bubbly Person2," It is a misconception that some people are just naturally positive. In reality, optimism takes practice. You can develop a bubbly personality by working to bolster your optimism.Become aware of your “self-talk,” or the thoughts that you have about yourself.
Don’t say anything about yourself that you wouldn’t say about a friend.
When you have a negative thought, try to alter it. Instead of thinking, “I’ve never done this before,” try to tell yourself, “This is an opportunity to learn something new.”
Try to be optimistic when you talk with your friends too, such as by pointing out the positive in a situation. For example, if a friend is worried about an upcoming exam, don't join in on worrying about the test with your friend. Instead, you might say something like, ""You are a great student! I am confident that you are going to do a great job! But for now, let's enjoy this beautiful day!""

, Negativity leads to more negativity. So even if something is bothering you, try to let it go rather than complaining about it. Complaining only spreads your misery around to others (which is decidedly un-bubbly). Embody a bubbly disposition by breaking the habit of complaint.


If you really need to air your complaints, try writing them down.
Another option is to speak to a therapist.

, If you want to exude a bubbly disposition, you can’t be hampered down by stress. Find some methods of stress-relief that work for you and practice them regularly.Get a massage.
Go for a walk.
Diffuse essential oils (like lemon or lavender) in your home or office.
Try to relieve your stress before it even becomes a problem.

, When you feel genuine gratitude in your daily life, it becomes much easier to exude bubbliness. Develop and grow your experience of gratitude by keeping a gratitude journal. Get a notebook, and write down five things you are grateful for each day.
In time, your gratitude will grow and grow!

, You may find yourself grumbling, “I have to go to work,” or, “I have to go to school,” or even, “I have to pay my rent.” But try swapping out just one little word, “have,” for the more positive verb, “get.”


When you say that you “get to go to work,” it reminds you to be grateful that you have a job.
When you say that you “get to pay rent,” it reminds you to be grateful both that you have a place to live, and that you can afford to pay for it., There is a Polish proverb that goes, “Not my monkeys, not my circus.” This saying reminds us that we do not need to engage in the drama of others.When you encounter conflicts that do not directly involve you, try not to intervene.
Refrain from gossiping! Avoid talking about people behind their backs.
If you are constantly surrounded by the drama of others, consider surrounding yourself with new people.

Look your best.,
Focus on the positive.,
Carry yourself proudly.,
Use daily affirmations.,
Take good care of yourself.",How to Be a Bubbly Person3," In order to be bubbly, you need to feel good about yourself. Take some time each day to look your best: groom yourself, wear clothes that make you feel good, and spend a little time on your hair, make-up, or other beauty rituals. When you take a little time to look your best, you will feel better and attract more positive attention from others.

, Write down a list of things that you like about yourself. This can be anything from your eyes, to the way that you are kind to everyone you meet. Aim to include at least ten attributes on your list. Read this list over daily. It is certain to make you feel good about yourself.Once you have identified some of your best qualities, aim to let these qualities shine.
For example, if you have beautiful eyes, wear eye makeup that accentuated this.
If you are smart and well-versed in philosophy, practice ways to lead with this in conversation.

, Make sure that when you walk, you hold your back straight and pull your shoulders back, maintaining good posture. When you talk to people, look them in the eye and smile when appropriate. These are all good ways to improve your self-confidence and give off a bubbly attitude.


The shape you make with your body also affects your hormonal response.
Simply standing up straight can make you (on a hormonal level) more confident and better at dealing with stress.

, You can use daily affirmations to and cultivate a bubbly personality. Affirmations are short, positive statements about yourself. You can post these any place that you’ll see each day. You will want to state these affirmations out loud.Examples include: I am beautiful, I am worthy, I am confident, or I deserve to be happy.
Consider placing these near your bathroom mirror, above your kitchen sink, or any place you will look at them often.

, Taking good care of yourself includes eating well, drinking water, staying active, and getting enough rest. Taking good care of yourself works to boost your self-esteem (and make you more bubbly) in two ways: first, when you feel cared for, you are more likely to cultivate self-love, and second, when you are in good health, your emotions are more stable.Focus on eating vegetables, fruit, lean meats, and whole grains.
Avoid sugar, alcohol, and fast food.
Try to sleep 8 hours per night.
Drink at least 8 glasses of water per day.
Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day, such as kayaking, walking around the block, playing tennis, or dancing to music.

Approach your helper at an appropriate time.,
Tell them you're looking for a favor.,
Word your request for a favor carefully.,
Get to the point.,
Flatter your helper.,
Offer this person a reason to help.,
Give your helper an ""out."",
Accept refusals politely.,
Have a backup plan.,
Thank your helper.,
Follow through with your end of the bargain.,
Be ready to help others when they need it.",How to Ask for a Favor," If you ask someone for a favor at an inconvenient time, you can embarrass or even anger him or her. You also might decrease the chances he or she will say yes. If you're going to ask your teacher for help with your math homework, don't ask in the middle of his lecture. Definitely don't ask right after he's learned his house has burned down! In general, try not to interrupt someone's work nor their moments of joy or sadness.


Depending on the favor, you might also want to move to a private location when you ask your person. If your favor's embarrassing to you or this other person (for instance, if you need help removing a wedgie), don't ask him or her in front of other people.





;
, The sooner you mention your intentions, the better. It's polite to be up-front about you want, but it's also a smart use of your time. If you ask for a favor at the end of a long conversation and your helper says s/he can't help you, you've wasted time you could have spent looking for another helper. It's simple - all you need to say is something like, ""Hey, I was wondering if I could ask you a favor"" within your first few sentences. Then, simply launch into your request! Your potential helper will probably appreciate that you weren't sneaky about what you wanted!

, You want to be polite and gracious while also being crystal clear about what you want. Explain the facts of the situation. Leave nothing to guessing. Then, without dallying, explain what you need this person's help with. Ask them plainly if they'll help you in the form of a simply-worded question. Don't allow any chance of misunderstanding. If this issue is important enough to require a favor, you should address it head-on. Say ""Do you think you can help me with my math homework for an hour tomorrow?"", not ""Hey, if you want to show me some math stuff, that's cool!""


Specify any relevant deadlines or qualifying information up front. For instance, in our math homework example, if you've got a test at the end of the week, be sure to include this information so the person will know s/he will have to free up time before then.






Don't try to coerce or guilt someone into doing you a favor. A favor isn't a favor unless it's given genuinely and willingly.

, Don't procrastinate - the longer you wait before bringing up your need for a favor, the bigger chance you have of losing your nerve and leaving the conversation without even having asked. If you let this happen, you'll be back to square one! Make your greeting, exchange one or two short pleasantries, move to a quiet area if you need to, then immediately tell this person that you're looking for a favor. Don't let him or her get away before you gather the courage to ask!

, Let this person know that they're the only person who's good enough for the job - even if they're not. Compliment this person's abilities - in our example, we might say something like, ""Could you please help me with my math homework? You're crazy good at trigonometry - didn't you get an A on the last test?"" Your praise can range from subtle to gushing, depending on how desperate you are for help!

, People who are reluctant to help you can be swayed if you tell them the consequences (for you) if they don't grant your favor. Tell them the worst-case scenario of what will happen if they won't help you out. In our example, you might tell your potential tutor that if you can't get help with your math homework, you'll definitely fail math!


You don't have to be over-the-top or maudlin to get your point across, but if you're desperate, it can help!

, If you're desperate for a favor, it can be quite tempting to shoot down a potential helper's excuses for not being able to help. If you do this, though, you'll regret it as soon as the favor's done. For peace of mind and to avoid lingering awkwardness or hurt feelings, it's a good idea to include a subtle ""exit strategy"" for your helper when you ask for a favor. Mention a potential reason why your helper might not be able to grant your favor - they'll probably take this excuse if they don't want to help.


In our homework example, we would say something like, ""Hey, I'd really appreciate it if you can give me a hand with my homework, unless you're busy or something. ""

, The act of asking for a favor implies that there's a possibility they'll say no. Prepare for this possibility! Don't get upset if this person can't help you - instead, be happy that s/he was honest about his or her capacity to help you. If, out of guilt, they had offered to help you, only to withdraw their help later, they would have cost you valuable time. By being up front, they've given you a better chance to find help elsewhere. Tell them that you understand and don't ask them for a favor again.


You can, however, ask them if they know anyone else that can help. With luck, they'll be able to recommend someone you hadn't considered.
Don't take it personally if someone can't do you a favor - it's not a reflection of their opinion of you. If you suddenly start ignoring this person, s/he will think you only cared about his or her ability to help you.

, Asking someone a for favor doesn't necessarily mean they'll agree to help you! They may be too busy to help or may not know how. They may simply not want to. In any case, don't be too emotionally invested in your first choice - have a few alternate options in mind in case you need to look for help elsewhere.


In our math homework example, for instance, we would first plan to ask the girl in class who gets straight A's for help. If she can't help, we'd then ask the boy who answers the most questions in class. If he can't help, then and only then will we approach our standoffish teacher.

, A good rule is to offer your sincere gratitude three times - when your helper agrees to help you, when they've finished helping you, and the next time you see them after that. Remember that this person had no obligation to grant your favor - s/he did it out of personal kindness.


Your thanks doesn't have to be flowery and complicated. ""Thank you so much"" is simple and effective. Most people can tell if your thanks is genuine, so a small but heartfelt ""Thank you"" is better than an overwrought thank you speech.
If the favor was a big one, consider writing this person a thank-you note or buying him or her a gift. Remember that when giving gifts, sincerity and emotional weight mean much more than the material value of the gift.

, If this favor requires your participation, provide it. Nothing is worse than asking someone for a favor, then not offering that person the full attention and participation the person needs to help you! For instance, in our math homework example, if we ask a fellow student to tutor us before the test, it's very unfair to show up unprepared or to text during our tutoring session.


If the favor requires the use of certain items, do your best to provide these to your helper. If your friend takes time out of the day to help you with your homework, try to show up with paper, pencils, a calculator, etc.

, If you accept someone else's help, you should, in turn, try to help someone else. You might try asking your helper if s/he needs help with anything as soon as s/he's done helping you. If not, simply go on with your life, keeping an eye open for people in need. Remember that the initial reaction when someone asks you a favor may be reluctance or hesitance. Try to overcome these feelings. If you can (realistically) help someone, do it.


Think about how relieved you felt when this person agreed to help you. By helping others, you're giving them that same feeling of relief.






Don't only help other people after someone's done you a favor! Strive to help others whenever you can - it'll make you feel great!

Be prepared.,
Rehearse jokes.,
Warm up before taking the stage.,
Sharpen your comedy skills.,
Perform regularly.",How to Avoid Laughing at Your Own Jokes1," The worst mistake you can make is to walk into a comedy set completely cold. This sets you up for nervously laughing at your own jokes! Even the best comedians need to spend some time preparing what they are going to say. Create a set list for yourself. Make a list of each joke you will tell.
Think about transitions. How does one joke flow into the next? Is there some kind of logical progression?
Keep in mind what kind of people you expect to see in the audience. Certain demographics will be more or less likely to enjoy certain types of jokes. An open mic at a church, for example, may not be the best place to try out very dirty material.;
, Whether you’re the type of comic who follows a script or one who tends to free-style, rehearsal will always make your set better. Plus, it is the most effective way to stop yourself from laughing at your own jokes. Set aside time to run through your entire set 2-3 times before you take the stage.

The more times you rehearse your jokes, the more normalized they become, and the less likely you are to laugh.
Be sure to time yourself. This way you’ll ensure that you have the right amount of material, and you can move through your set without concerning yourself with time.

, Taking the stage cold sets you up for nervous laughter. Before you take the stage, find a way to warm yourself up, and release any “silly energy.”


Put on your favorite song and dance around making funny noises and goofy faces in the mirror.
Laugh at yourself.
Move your body, use your voice, and wiggle the muscles in your face.
All of these actions dispel nervous energy and prepare you to tell jokes on stage effectively, without bursting into laughter.

, If you do a good job of making the people around you laugh, you won’t need to laugh to fill the silence. Prevent yourself from laughing at your own jokes by making other people laugh.

Use vocal variation. Don’t fall into a monotone delivery.
Signal the punchline. Pause for a moment to let the audience know it’s coming.
Use a call-back. Reference something funny you said near the beginning of your set near the end. Audiences love this.

, If you really want to strengthen your comedy and prevent yourself from laughing at your own jokes, the only true remedy is spending as much time as you can telling jokes on stage. You can’t perform once a month (or less) and expect to improve at your craft. Try to make it out 1-3 times per week.Begin by seeking out comedy open mics. You can find these advertised at coffee shops or bars, or in a local entertainment paper.
Open mics are where you can practice, connect with other comics, and gain exposure.
If you do well at open mics, you will be invited to perform at more regular gigs.

Have a private conversation.,
Remove any distractions.,
Feel prepared to talk.,
Take a friendly yet concerned approach.,
Ask how they are.,
Mention something specific.,
Avoid confrontation.,
Talk about suicide.,
Be available to listen.,
Avoid judgments.,
Acknowledge their experience.,
Encourage action.,
Stay in contact.",How to Ask Someone if They're Okay," Choose the right place to talk to your friend. If you ask them in front of people, they might become embarrassed and not answer honestly. For example, if you’re out to coffee or lunch, your friend may not want other people to hear their response, even if they’re strangers. If you want to talk, pick a time when it’s just the two of you. Have the conversation in private where there are no prying ears.Talk in the car, on a walk, or another private place.;
, Don’t ask your friend when they are in the middle of working on something, on their phone, talking to someone, or when they have something on their mind, like a test tomorrow. Ideally, you want your friend to have some time to talk without having any interruptions or distractions.For example, if you’re at your friend’s house and their parents or siblings often interrupt, go somewhere where interruptions will not occur.

, You should feel prepared to listen, talk, and support your friend. Don't be distracted by anything, and have some time set aside for your friend. Don't have other things on your mind or things that might distract you, like anticipating a phone call. Set aside some time that you have free.Remember that you cannot ‘fix’ someone’s problems. If the person isn’t ready to talk or doesn’t want to, be prepared to let it go.
If you think you might get nervous talking about something personal, you could write down some bullet points you want to address.

, When talking to your friend, be warm, open, and gentle. Show that you are concerned and want to help and support them. While you might choose to approach the conversation casually, make sure they know that you care.Say, “I’m concerned about you and want to know if you’re doing okay.”
Nonverbal cues can help communicate your concern. Sit facing them and make eye contact when you speak. It if feels appropriate, you could place a hand on their shoulder to let them know you care.

, Once both of you appear ready to talk, begin asking some questions. You can start by simply asking, “Are you okay?” Keep in mind that there are lots of ways to see how your friend is doing. Ask, “How have you been lately?” You can also ask, “How are you doing? Do you want to talk?”Starting the conversation can be the hardest part. Jump right in and allow them to respond however they choose.

, If there’s something that worries you or concerns you, bring it up. Especially if your friend is surprised or somewhat defensive to your questions, expand a bit more. Talk about what you’ve noticed and why it concerns you.For example, say, “I’ve noticed you’re spending a lot of time alone lately. Are you doing okay?”
You can also say, “You’ve been really secretive. Is there something going on?”
Try to stick to objective observations without adding any assumptions or accusations.

, Notice if the person doesn’t want to talk about it or if they feel immediately defensive. You don’t want to cause a fight or argument. If the person is not responsive to your questions, drop it. Reiterate that you’re concerned and that you’re there for them.If the person is getting defensive, ask, “Is there someone else you’d like to talk to?” or, “I’ll leave you alone, but please don’t hesitate to call if you want to talk.”
Understand that it might take a few conversations for them to open up about whatever’s going on. Try not to push the issue in your first conversation or two.

, If your friend is suicidal, stay calm and stay with them. Talk with them about suicide and get help if needed. They might tell you how they are feeling or what they want to do. If you’re worried, ask, “Are you thinking of hurting yourself or taking your life?”If the person is scared to ask for help, tell them to call a suicide crisis like (like 1-800-SUICIDE) or emergency services.
After the call, offer to help them find a mental health professional or follow up on whatever suggestions the hotline operator made.

, It’s not enough just to ask your friend if they are okay. The important part comes next, when you show them that you’re available to listen and support them. Make sure you have time to listen if they decide to open up. Lean in and make eye contact frequently. Nod your head and give some feedback that you’re listening by saying, “Uh huh” or, “I see.” Reflect what they are saying to show that you understand the content and the feelings they’re expressing.For example, say, “I’m so sorry that makes you feel sad and angry.”
Avoid saying you know how they feel. It’s best just to be there for them and empathize the best you can with what they are experiencing.

, Even if you disagree with the person, don’t immediately say so or start an argument. Don’t blame them for their experience, even if you think their problems are their fault. Keep in mind that you asked them if something is wrong. Whatever your opinion, keep it to yourself, at least for today.For example, if your friend admits that they have a drug problem, don’t chastise them for doing drugs. Listen and show your support in admitting their problem.

, When listening to your friend open up, acknowledge their experience and how it makes them feel. If they are having a hard time, notice and acknowledge this difficulty. Show that you’re listening and sympathetic toward their feelings.Try to simply listen and empathize for a bit before offering any advice. You might ask, “What are you thinking about doing about that?” Helping them formulate their own solutions can help them feel empowered.
If you don’t know what to say, consider, “It sounds like this is difficult for you” or simply, ‘That sucks.”

, If their situation needs action, encourage them to take the next steps. You might encourage them to see a therapist, look into rehabilitation facilities, or talk to their family and friends. Perhaps you might encourage them to take some medications or take some time off from work or school.Say, “Thanks for opening up to me. I think it may be best for you to consider talking to a professional or getting some help.”

, Check in on the person to see how they are doing. Let them know you haven’t forgotten about them. Send a text, ring them on the telephone, or see them in person. Let them know you are there to support them and help them when they need it.Continue asking, “How are you doing?” to follow up with them.
Ask, “What can I help you with?”

Aim for clarity in your own speech.,
Say what you want to communicate, and ask them what they think about that.,
Use body language that lets non-autistics know that you are listening.,
Take your time.",How to Avoid Miscommunication when You're Autistic1," Another major part of communication of course, is speaking. Good communication comes from clear intent of what you want to communicate to them.  Be clear in yourself what you want to get across. Is it some information? Some experience you had? Some feeling you have? Some opinion? Do you want to invite them or just tell them something? You may just want to have a friendly chat. So, your intention is to communicate that you are interested in who they are and you want them to know who you are. Know what you want to communicate.;
, That way, you should be able to gauge if they have understood you or not. Speak directly and give some reasons or background. If they don't get it, you can say, ""Actually, I mean...."" and explain in a different way. Then, give some more reasons, to help them understand. Communication is about building a bridge from you to them.

, Non-autistic people have slightly different body language, and recognizing the cultural difference can help you understand how to show respect to them. Here are some things non-autistics see as signs of attention:


Looking in their direction (especially at their face)
Pointing your body towards them
Keeping your stims subtle (tapping toes, twisting fingers, squeezing stim toy)
Not looking at distractions
Conversely, if you want to hint that you're done with the conversation, do the opposite.

, You don't need to speak up the instant that they are done talking, nor do you need to say everything in one go. Take pauses, and let the conversation slow down. Give your conversation partner a chance to finish their thoughts, and then they will most likely let them finish yours.


Pauses can help let your message sink in. If you find yourself talking too quickly, stop and take a deep breath. Then let it out and continue.

Take responsibility for your actions.,
Plan your apology.,
Decide how to deliver your apology.,
Be sincere in your delivery.,
Choose your words carefully.,
Acknowledge the hurt or foul.,
Show remorse.,
Be specific.,
Say, “I’m sorry.” It’s important that your apology contains the words “I’m sorry.” make it clear to the person that you’re making an apology and not trying to make excuses or justify your words.,
Consider their feelings.,
Assure them that it doesn’t happen again.,
Make amends.,
Take action on a larger scale.",How to Apologize for a Racist Comment," Even if you don't understand why, act with the assumption that the person has a very good reason for saying that they’re offended. Racism isn't something that people take lightly. It's better to be too serious than to blow off someone else's pain.


If someone points out a racist comment, they aren’t saying, ""You're a terrible person"" or even, “You’re a racist.” They are telling you that you said something hurtful. Don’t take it personally, but instead, recognize that they’re helping you see your blind spots.;
, You might wonder what was racist in your words. If so, ask the person. You might have a lot of questions, so ask them one at a time. For example, if you’re unclear, ask, “What did I say that was racist?” You might also wonder, “How was that offensive?” or, “What could I have said instead?”


Don't push them to explain. While some people are willing to gently guide you through the painful world of racism, it isn't their job, so don't expect it, and express gratitude if they take time for you.
If the interaction happens online, consider private messaging the person to talk about it further and ask your questions.

, Own up to what you said and accept any consequences that have (or may) occur. Taking responsibility means admitting that you said something hurtful and that there’s no excuse for it. It means you don’t blame anything or anyone else for what came out of your mouth.Taking responsibility often doesn’t feel good, but it’s an important part of admitting your actions and showing that you’re sincere in taking steps to amend what went wrong.

, Choose the circumstances around your apology carefully. For example, don’t casually bring it up in the middle of something or around strangers. Try to apologize in a private way. Choose a good time and a quiet setting that will facilitate the discussion and apology. Pick a time you know the person or people are available and have time to talk. Allow some time for discussion.

Say, “Is this a good time to talk?” or, “Can we talk tomorrow after class?”You don’t want to feel rushed in your apology, nor do you want the other person or people to feel awkward or uncomfortable.

, In most cases, you’ll speak in-person to one person or a group of people. There are certain instances that may warrant a public apology. If you made a racist comment online, for example, you may want to publically take responsibility and apologize for your comment. Or, if you made a comment in your workplace or classroom, you may want to revisit that space and those people and make amends.


You may choose to write a letter. If you struggle to say things out loud or have difficulty wording your apology, try a letter (or email). This can help you say what you need to say how you want to say it.

, What you say should be heartfelt. If you are giggling and not trying to act serious, no one will take you seriously. Make it clear that you are serious about your apology and about racism. Believe that you mean what you say and really mean it.For example, you should know why you’re apologizing and why what you sad was hurtful before you apologize.

, You want to dig yourself out of a hole, not dig it further! Avoid trying to justify why you made your comment (“It was funny at the time”) or making a non-apology: the apology isn’t about how they feel or if they feel bad, it’s about your actions. Avoid saying things like, “I’m sorry if you feel bad” or, “I’m sorry you didn’t understand me.”One helpful technique is to use the word and instead of the word but, such as ""I'm sorry and I didn't mean it"" instead of ""I'm sorry but I didn't mean it.""

, Start your apology by admitting responsibility, then acknowledge the hurt your comment caused. Show an understanding of how your words were hurtful and that you understand the pain they caused.For example, say, “I thought my comment was funny, but now I see how insensitive it was toward Black people, and I’m horrified I said that” or, “I made that comment casually, but I know now it meant something much more serious and really hurt you.”

, It’s important to show that you feel bad about what you said. Even if you hurt the person unintentionally, you still can feel remorse for the effects of your racist comment. Remorse can express guilt, shame, embarrassment, or humility.""I'm sorry. I heard people using that word, but I didn't know exactly what it meant. I'm horrified that it has such negative connotations, and I would never have used it had I known. I'm truly sorry.""

, Speak specifically about what you did that was wrong. It’s best not to speak in generalities such as, “I’m sorry I said something racist.” Instead, say specifically what you did that was wrong and why it was offensive.For example, say, “My comment about Latinos sounded funny to me, but now I see that it was out of line and offensive.”

, Saying the words, “I’m sorry” makes it clear that you’re making an apology.Try to say, “I’m sorry” early on in the apology. Don’t wait until the end of your apology to say that words or else it can be confusing.

, Listen closely to their response and really consider what they say. Pay attention to their words and feelings and show that you’re listening by nodding occasionally and encouraging them to continue by saying, “I see” or, “Uh huh.” Respond to their words by validating their feelings and empathizing with them.See things from their point-of-view and understand why they feel the way they do.

For example, say, “I can understand why you feel hurt” or, “I didn’t realize how much my comment affected you.”

, Let the other person know that it won’t happen again. This helps in rebuilding trust and repairing a relationship. It also shows that you’ve learned from the experience and don’t want to hurt others. Just be sure to honor this commitment. Say, “This was a painful experience, and I’ll be sure to be more careful with my words in the future.”

, Take your apology one step further by making amends. For example, say, “Is there anything I can do to make this up to you?” Think about anything you can do to improve or do better and share this with the person. However, don’t make empty promises or grandiose gestures as a way to relieve your guilt.For example, say, “I know this is a blind spot, so I’m signing up for an online class about racial diversity.”

, Perhaps this experience has opened your eyes to larger issues about race and you want to get involved in spreading awareness and equality. Join a diversity group at your school, university, or workplace to encourage working together. Get involved politically by raising awareness in your community or signing petitions that promote equality for people of all backgrounds.

Do what you can to promote awareness and sensitivity. Perhaps you might even stop someone and start a discussion about race after they make an offensive comment.

Work on a few “staple” jokes.,
Try to relax.,
Let it go.",How to Avoid Laughing at Your Own Jokes2," If you want to tell jokes at parties, you could benefit from preparing some “staple” jokes. If you have some jokes or stories that have been rehearsed (and that you know are funny), you can use these to break the ice. Best of all, the more times you tell a joke, the better it becomes and the less likely you are to laugh.

Think back to the wildest thing that has ever happened to you. Can you tell this story in a humorous way? Be sure to include all the major details, and include one joke or funny outburst every few sentences. Keep your story under 5 minutes.
Another alternative is to think up some thematically appropriate jokes. For example, if you will be attending a non-profit ball, you can try something like, ""How many board members does it take to change a light bulb? Response: Six! One to change the light bulb, and five more to divert the founder!""

, Laughing at your own jokes in usually the result of nervousness or feeling awkward. Focus on the experience of telling the joke, and try not to even think about whether or not anyone will laugh. This helps to curb the knee-jerk reaction of nervous laughter following your punchline.You can relax yourself by taking deep breaths. Breath in to a count of 4, 5, or 6, and try to make your exhale the same length.
Alternatively, you can count your breaths. Try to take 10 slow, deep inhales and exhales.

, If the people in your company don’t laugh at your joke, just let it go. Don’t try to encourage them to laugh by explaining the joke, or by laughing maniacally. This only comes off as desperation, and nothing is less funny than that.


Try to believe in your joke. If you believe what you’re saying is funny, other people will hear this in your voice.

"
"
Diffuse your jokes through repetition.,
Pinch yourself.,
Hold your breath.,
Think of something sad.,
Make your laughter part of the joke.,
Try to focus on the reaction to your joke.",How to Avoid Laughing at Your Own Jokes3," Have you ever tried repeating a word so many times that it ceases to sound like a real word at all? This same idea can be used for jokes. If you’ve got a particular joke that seems to inspire your own laughter, try saying this joke as many times as possible. Say it while you’re driving, while you’re preparing breakfast, or while you are in the shower. Say the joke so many times that it loses it’s power., If you feel the tickle of an uncontrollable laugh coming on, try giving yourself a pinch. Inflicting yourself with just a little bit of pain will be enough of a mental distraction to halt the laugh in its tracks.

, Another simple trick to stop an oncoming laugh is to exhale the air from your lungs, and then hold it. Just stop breathing for a few seconds (you can count to five in your head). This helps to break the cycle you are in, and switch off your instinct to laugh.

, Just as actors use sad memories from their lives to inspire tears on stage, you can use a sad memory to halt a laugh. When you feel a laugh taking hold of you, think quickly of the saddest memory you’ve got. This will interrupt your laugh.

, If you should happen to laugh anyway, consider making it part of the joke. Sometimes owning up to the laugh can be even funnier.Note that, usually, a little snort is a lot less disruptive than a long bout of hysterical laughter. If you need to let out a little laugh, try not to make it long and drawn out. A short laugh can add to the joke telling experience, but a long laugh will almost always distract from it.
Consider Jimmy Fallon’s habit of breaking on The Tonight Show, or comedian Tig Notaro bringing her laughing mother-in-law on stage to tell a joke.
Try making your compulsion to laugh part of the joke.

, Instead of focusing on the words of the joke itself, look at the people to whom you're telling the joke. Are they laughing? Did they find your joke funny? Make mental notes about who laughed and what their favorite parts of your joke seemed to be. It's hard to laugh at your own joke when you're thinking about something else."
"
Pay full attention to your conversation partner.,
Try to understand the other person.,
Ask for clarification.,
Paraphrase back to them.,
Keep an eye on their body language.",How to Avoid Miscommunication when You're Autistic2," Focus on what they are saying, not on what you are going to say to them. Your first goal is to understand their point of view.


If you need to stim in order to pay attention, find a helpful and non-distracting stim. Bouncing your foot, fiddling with jewelry, squeezing a stim toy, et cetera, are all helpful stims.
If the environment is distracting, say so. Ask if you could move to a quieter place, so you can listen better.

, One part of communication is listening. Listen closely to what the person is saying. Pretend you are them, and think how you would see the situation if you were them. Nonverbal. These include emotions, how a person really feels about a topic, sarcasm, wishes, jokes, seriousness, etc. How would you feel if you were in their situation?

, It's absolutely okay to ask people to clarify, and they usually prefer that you'd ask rather than you'd guess and get things mixed up. You can use scripts such as...


""Did you mean...?""
""How do you feel about that?""
""Do you really mean it or are you just joking?""
""Are you really serious, because it's hard for me to tell.""
When in doubt, ask, instead of assuming.

,  Say things like, ""So, I hear you saying that....""  or, ""I think you mean..., right?""  See what they say in return. You are being like a detective, gathering clues about what they're telling you and what they're feeling, to make sure your impressions match the other person's intention, to make sure you understand them.

, Notice what direction they are looking, if their body seems ""open"" or ""closed,"" how straight their posture is, and how this compares to their ""normal"" baseline. This can hint at what they are feeling inside.



Reading faces and body language is a skill. You can learn and work on it.
This is harder for some people than others. If keeping track of it is distracting or overwhelming, refocus on the content of their words.

Be aware that everyone has a unique way of seeing the world.,
Consider disclosing your autism, or saying you have social difficulties.,
Look for patterns in people's requests.,
Aim for absolute clarity around boundaries.,
Remind yourself of their thoughts, opinions, and preferences.",How to Avoid Miscommunication when You're Autistic3," You might have to explain to them how you see things, and why you have a certain feeling or opinion, so they can understand.  So, take some time to reflect on why you think or feel a certain way. Or why that person might like to do a certain thing, or be interested in a certain topic.

, If you don't feel comfortable sharing your disability, you can still explain that you have trouble with a specific thing. Most non-autistic people are familiar with the idea of social challenges or awkwardness and view it as a normal and reasonable thing to accommodate.


""I have a hard time reading people. If I'm doing anything that upsets or bothers you, please tell me, so that I can stop.""
""I have a bit of trouble understanding sarcasm and jokes. If I look confused or am asking you odd questions, that's why.""

, For example, if your boyfriend doesn't like it when you show him a newt, a lizard, and a praying mantis you caught, it may mean that he doesn't like to look at creepy crawlies at all. Consider the idea of a pattern, and feel free to ask if you are unsure.

, If someone is uncomfortable with something, or if you are uncomfortable with something, there needs to be a clear understanding. If someone expresses a boundary, listen closely and ask for clarification as needed. If you are uncomfortable with something, say so, so that the other person knows to respect that.


""So it bothers you to be hugged from behind? Okay, I won't do that anymore.""
""I want to make sure we're clear: do you always dislike it when I put my arm around you, or is it only in certain situations?""
""Please don't jump out and try to startle me like that. It really upsets me.""
""I really dislike being kissed on the cheek or forehead. Maybe you could hug me instead, or kiss the top of my head?""

, It can be difficult to keep track of different people's different perspectives. You can improve your memory by summarizing the conversation in your head, after it happens.


For example, tell yourself ""Diamond said she was looking forward to visiting Europe with her mom. Germany is her favorite country, because she speaks the language, and she wants to see France too.""

Start by taking down any photos deemed to be embarrassing by your child.,
Explain to your child why you posted the photos.,
Tell your child that you will respect his or her wishes about posting photos.,
Ask your child to give you parameters for posting photos.,
Inquire about what you can do to make it up to him or her.,
Reassess your future online approaches to sharing information about your children.",How to Apologize to Your Child for Putting Embarrassing Pictures of Him/Her Online," The minute your child tells you he or she feels ashamed or embarrassed by the photos remove them from the Internet immediately. This isn't a time to be quibbling about what you thought was the right thing to do––your child is uncomfortable and that should be sufficient for you to respond fully.


Be sure to hit all the mediums where the embarrassing photos may lurk. Ideally, photos should only have been posted to one online medium, but if you use a variety of online posting opportunities and you've been including them in your blog and all the social mediums, go back and take down every single photo.;
, Your child may be extremely frustrated or upset with you and most likely doesn’t understand why you posted that awful picture you of the haircut he or she decided to give him- or herself. Let your child know that your intentions came from a place of love and not meant to hurt. Typical reasons parents use to show off photos of children include:


Going nostalgic about those adorable baby days. Parents wistfully look back on those squeezable baby days and love to see their child’s baby pictures every now and again. Explain that you were thinking back to a time when he or she was your little baby and how cute you were then (and still are now).
You found some of the photos to be funny. Everyone has funny (or awkward) family photos. Unfortunately, if your child was the butt of one or many of them, while you may be laughing… your child, not so much. Realize that what is funny to you may be a much more vulnerable family issue to your child.
You wanted to show friends and family members how much you have grown. Another part of parenting is boasting about how big your child has gotten through the years. If grandma missed seeing your baby jump from being a cute elementary school child to a good looking adolescent, mom and dad may want to proudly post the picture for all to see.
You're proud of your child. Perhaps your child may want to keep the fact that he or she is the president of the robotics club at school, but you want the entire world to know more about his or her achievements.

, Have a heart-to-heart talk with your child and communicate that going forward you will respect his or her wishes about posting any photo online.


Explain that you had no idea that certain photos being posted would have embarrassed him or her. Make sure he or she knows that if you knew the picture would have left him or her red faced, you wouldn’t have posted it.
Apologize for posting the photos. Deliver a heartfelt apology and really mean it. Your child’s world may surround his or her social life and what you may consider to be adorable, your kid thinks is mortifying.

, Of course it’s impossible to resist posting any photos of your child, so ask your child to set certain parameters so you can quickly determine if he or she will be cool with the photo being posted.


Decide which photos are completely off limits. Make a list of all photos that are considered to be completely wrong for posting. Photos such as old naked baby photos, pictures where your child is wearing an embarrassing outfit or wiping out may be at the top of the list.
Are there photos your child won’t have any trouble with you posting? As with the “don’t” list, ask your child to make a “do” list. Perhaps school photos are fine, or photos taken during sports competitions will make the cut.
Consider setting up a system so you child approves any photos in his or her “murky” area. Although you may have some photos that are totally clear-cut, you will come across other photos that you may think would be fine, but he or she would consider to be totally embarrassing.
Ask how your child will be most comfortable with you sharing photos with friends and relatives. Establish if there are any friends or relatives that he or she absolutely does not want you to share the photos and which medium you can use. You could also create a family only blog or a scrapbook to keep at home.

, Make things “even Steven” by finding out how you can “write the wrong” of posting pictures your child has deemed to be embarrassing.


Unfriending your child’s friends on social media. Perhaps in addition to the photos in question, your child may not be completely comfortable with your online social media friendships, especially if you post comments or anecdotal information about silly things your child has done.
Allowing your child to post a silly picture or baby picture of you. If you really want to even the score, let your child post an approved dorky photo of you. Find something funny like you wearing goofy clothes or having a bad hair day.

, Think about the child's perspective rather than yours. Author of The Girls' Guide Jane Yee says that blogging about children is actually a moral issue. She suggests parent bloggers consider how the children might feel when they grow up and realize that they didn't want photos of themselves all over the internet. Even one of the most famous bloggers in the world, Heather B. Armstrong, who frequently blogs about her children, has noticed her eldest child running out of the room when it's camera time and now resorts to asking her daughter if it's okay to mention her in a blog.It couldn't hurt to include your children in the discussion from school age onward––after all, it's their reputation and life you're blogging about.


Be aware of how intrusive online sharing of information about people other than yourself can be, especially where it involves children. They have every right to establish their own identities without being trapped by the image and stories you've created about them online.
There is a fine line between gentle occasional bragging and treating a child like a prize exhibit. Know the difference and stick to the limits.
Give serious consideration to restricting who gets to see photos of your children online to only those people who know the child directly and care about the child's well-being. Use filters and privacy settings to ensure this.

Don’t approach a celebrity when they are with their family.,
Don’t interrupt a celebrity.,
Plan what you will say.,
Have your materials ready.",How to Ask a Celebrity for an Autograph or Photo1," As a general rule of thumb, it is not the best idea to ask a celebrity for their autograph or a picture while they are with their family. Celebrities want to be able to spend quality time with their families. And, for security reasons, celebrities who are with their children generally do not want to be approached by the public. Therefore, your chances of getting an autograph or a picture are quite low if a celebrity is with their family., Similar to the family situation, if you see that a celebrity is on a date, at an important business meeting, or having dinner, they generally do not like to be interrupted.If you have to, wait for them to finish what they are doing, whether it is eating or in a meeting, and then attempt to approach. Attempt to approach them only when they have finished signing their check and are getting up from their seat and putting on their coat.

, Plan ahead by knowing what you will say to the celebrity. Phrases that are appropriate are, “May I have your autograph?” or “I really like your work, may I have an autograph or a picture?”


Don’t say things like, “I really hate to do this, but may I take a picture with you?” or “I really didn’t want to bother you, but my friend wanted me to ask…” If you really “hated” it, then you wouldn’t be asking. It just does not seem sincere.

, No celebrity likes to be interrupted by a fan that is fumbling with his or her autograph paper and pen, or with their camera in order to get a picture. If you are going to ask a celebrity for their autograph or picture, commit to it by having your materials prepared beforehand.


Have your pen and paper sitting in your back pocket so you can pull it out swiftly if they agree to an autograph. Or, have your camera ready and on the correct settings so you can take a quick snap."

Avoid giving an opinion on something you know is controversial.,
Give brief responses.,
Keep conversations short and simple.,
Avoid people who are inflammatory.,
Stay neutral.,
Be calm.,
Look disinterested.,
Rush them.,
Dodge questions and answers.,
End the topic by leading to something else.,
Respect other people's points of view.",How to Avoid and Survive Controversial Topics," Even if you think the person will agree with you, putting in your two cents can lead to a debate. If the person mentions something like religion, it is fine to state what your beliefs are but not saying why: ""I am ____"" or why ""It is good/bad to be ____."";
, If you know a certain response will lead to the other person bringing up a certain topic, keep it short. This will deter most people from making any more comments that could lead to the topic. If someone's comments seem to be trying to goad you into a certain reaction, say ""mmhm"" or ""okay"" or nod. That way you can hopefully make the other person uninterested in talking about it further.

, Pets, children, the weather, anything of the sort should work. Talk about normal, everyday occurrences. Ask the person about his/her life too, so you won't be stuck scrambling for ordinary topics to talk about. Stick to agreeable and not insulting items (puppies are cute, rain is cold). Think ""coffee-break talk"" that will not get too wound up at a job or between events.

, If you really don't want to deal with the guys that want to ask you about your personal beliefs all the time, try avoiding them. Be friendly and say hello, but you don't have to force them/yourself to talk. If you see someone coming after you to start an argument, focus on something like work or leave to go to the bathroom. Send a message that you are busy and would like to focus.


If the person is a relative or someone you can't avoid, make sure to keep conversations short and talk about mundane things. Talking about the weather is acceptable.

, Even if you really disagree with someone, arguing can encourage them to keep talking. So, keep responses to one or two words, or nod your head once in a while. If the other person sees that you are not taking a side, they will drop the subject if there is nothing to argue about.


Either disagreeing or agreeing can be inflammatory, so staying neutral is a good way to not fan the flames.

, When the other person is making you scream internally, keep a calm exterior. Don't be defensive or angry. Some people want a reaction out of you or are looking for enemies. Keep a straight face (poker face, anyone?) and be the person that can't be bothered.

, If someone's not listening to your conversation, you tend to stop talking. Do some important work, or look around, past the speaker. You don't want to seem rude, but you want to silently say, ""I'm not really into this"". If you can, adopt a glazed, far-away look. If you have to say something, say it in a bored, neutral tone. Be as boring (but not rude) as possible.


If someone started arguing when you were working, even better. Don't look up and keep working, making sure to focus on the work and not them. Appear busy.

, Say you have to go somewhere or to the bathroom (avoid going to the bathroom too often). Make it generic but plausible (""That reminds me, I have to call ____ soon. She/he will be worried if I don't""). Pretend to ""remember"" something like the fact you might have left your keys in the car. Tell them it's not a big deal, but act like it is and that it's urgent. Hopefully they will finish up their argument quickly and leave you alone (even if you said you're only going away for a few minutes).

, Shrug if someone asks you something, or say ""I prefer not to say"". If they push you into answering, stay firm and calm on the fact that you don't want to answer. If they ask about your opinion on an opinion, say, ""Everyone's different"" or ""That's nice..."" in a boring voice. Don't straight-up answer the question.

, If someone mentions an unrelated topic briefly, re-introduce that innocent topic to lead the way out of the argument. Connect to something else that is easier to talk about.


For example, if they say, ""Animals have no souls"", then you can say ""Animals, huh? They are cute. In fact, I have the cutest parrot named Bob. Bob loves talking! Have you ever heard a parrot talk?"". Make the transition smoothly.
If they try to change the subject again, don't try to change it back. Just say, ""Well, I've got to go. See you"" or appear very tired/bored.

, So, be agreeable and accommodating in a valid way -- not too silly or off, like a dead head."

Let children up front ask first.,
Be polite.,
Don’t ask them to sign multiple things.,
Be time conscious.,
Respect their personal space.",How to Ask a Celebrity for an Autograph or Photo2," The chances are that you are not the only person who has spotted the celebrity from afar. Consequently, there might be other people, including children, asking for an autograph or a picture as well. Let the children go first. Don’t push ahead of them or shove them to the side so you can get your signature. The celebrity might find this offensive, and might not sign your paper or take a picture with you., When asking for an autograph or a picture, always be polite. Say “please” when asking, and say “thank you” when they have signed or after the picture has been taken. Remember that celebrities appreciate manners, too.Don't scream at them. You will probably scare them off if you do this.

, Be aware that there are people out there who make money from selling pictures and signatures online. Besides your own memorabilia, if you are trying to get another autograph for a friend or a family member, then that is fine. But trying to get five different things signed seems greedy and suspicious.Try not to ask them to sign odd things, like body parts, clothing, toilet seats, and other unconventional things. The celebrity might find it offensive and you will not get an autograph.

, If a celebrity agrees to take a picture with you, don’t turn it into a photo shoot. Be aware that celebrities have places to be, and that there are other people waiting to get an autograph or a picture, too.

, Don’t try to get too close or touch the celebrity when asking for an autograph or photo. For example, some celebrities are sensitive about their hair or their clothes. If you respect their personal space, and follow the celebrity’s lead on how to act around them, they will be more willing to acquiesce to your request.

Take some time to compose yourself before you apologize.,

Ask for forgiveness.,
Offer compensation for any damaged items due to your behavior.,

Give the person time to process your apology.,
Be kind to the person, even if they are still upset at you.,
Focus on changing your bad behavior.",How to Apologize After Bad Behavior," Though you may want to throw yourself at the mercy of the person you have offended as soon as you realize your bad behavior, you may want to wait a little before apologizing. Depending on how bad your behavior was, you may take a day away from the person to give them some space and let your emotions cool down.Taking some time to compose yourself will also allow you to think about how you plan to apologize and what you are going to say in your apology. Often, a well thought out and clear apology a day after the offending incident can be more effective than a casual, awkward apology right after the incident.;
, If you are struggling to put your apology into words, you may want to try sitting down and composing an apology letter. Sometimes, writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you get a better sense of what you want to say to the person. It will also force you to confront your bad behavior and consider why you acted badly. Identifying the reason(s) for your bad behavior may allow you to write a more sincere and clear apology to the person. Though you may not actually give the letter to the person, writing down your thoughts can help you to craft a better in person apology.


In your letter, you should focus on saying “I’m sorry” but without adding any excuses for your behavior. Avoid saying “I’m sorry for my behavior, but I am under a lot of stress” and instead say, “I’m sorry for my behavior and for the way I treated you. I was stressed, and I took it out on you, which was inappropriate.” Replacing the word but with the word and can be a good start.
You should also try to empathize with the person’s point of view in your letter, noting that you understand why the person may be upset at you. You should also make a point of promising that you will try to act more appropriately in the future, as this shows you are making an effort to correct your behavior.
End the letter on a positive note, stating that what you did will never happen again and that you hope you can both move past the incident. You may want to sign the letter, “Sincerely” to show that you are trying to be honest and truthful.

, If you decide to apologize in person, you should make sure you make the apology in a quiet, private area. This could be in your office at work, in a conference room, in your home, or in a quiet area of the library at school. Apologizing in a private area, one on one, will allow you to be honest and upfront about your feelings.


If the person is very upset at you for your behavior, you may want to suggest a public place that feels neutral and safe for both of you, such as a coffee shop close by where the person lives or a bar.

, You should start your apology by discussing your bad behavior and acknowledging that it was inappropriate. Be specific when discussing your bad behavior, as this will show the person that you are able to take responsibility for your actions. Doing this will indicate you are willing to admit you were wrong, which will likely make the person more willing to forgive you.For example, you may say, “I was wrong to yell at you during the meeting with the shareholders. I was also wrong to swear at you and use inappropriate language when I spoke to you.”

, Once you have acknowledged your behavior and acknowledged it was inappropriate, you should express sincere regret for your words and actions. This will let the person know that you are aware you caused them discomfort or pain. You are trying to connect emotionally with the person so try to be as honest and sincere as you can.For example, you may say, “I realize that my words and actions were wrong and I regret that I let my anger get out of hand. I know that I hurt you and embarrassed you, and I am sorry for my behavior.”

, You should offer some way of making up for your behavior, whether this is a promise that you will never act the way you did again or a promise that you will talk to the person with respect rather than lash out at them in the future. You should make a realistic promise to the person as a way to strengthen your apology. Make sure your promise notes your desire to change your behavior so you do not act badly again.For example, you may say: “I promise that I will never speak out again in a meeting and speak inappropriately to you or to others.” You may also say, “I know I keep lashing out at you and I do not want to keep behaving this way. I will work on how I process my emotions and make sure I do not take them out on you.”
Another option is to ask the person how you can make it up to them and let them dictate their expectations for you. This may be a useful option if you are apologizing to a partner or spouse and want them to give you input on how you can make up for your bad behavior. You may ask, “How can I make up for my behavior?”

, You should end your apology by asking for forgiveness for your actions. Requesting forgiveness and putting yourself at the mercy of the person will show that you are sincere in your apology.Always form the request for forgiveness as a question, rather than a statement. You want the forgiveness element to feel like you are at the mercy of the person, rather than demanding something of them. You may say, “I’m sorry I behaved the way I did. I know I behaved inappropriately. Will you forgive me?”

, If you have acted badly towards a colleague or an acquaintance, such as spilling coffee on your colleague’s shirt or missing a lunch with an acquaintance, you may want to offer some form of compensation. This could be a redeeming action that is tangible, like paying for dry cleaning the stained shirt or paying for lunch with the acquaintance to make up for missing it the first time. The action of at least offering to compensate the person will often show that you feel bad and want to try to make up for your behavior.Offers of compensation can be financial if you have damaged someone else’s property due to your behavior. You can also offer compensation through other kind actions, like paying for the person’s coffee if you spill theirs by accident or helping someone replace their broken phone if you accidentally sent theirs into the toilet.

, Another way to make up for bad behavior is to surprise the person you have offended with an apology gift. This could be a standard apology gift, like a bouquet of flowers or a box of sweets. Leave the gift on their desk or have them delivered with a card noting how sorry you are. The small gift may at least help them work toward letting go of their anger toward you and accept your apology.


You could also think of a gift that seems particular to the person, like a mug with their favorite celebrity on it or a box of their favorite chocolates. Thoughtful, personal gifts are usually a big hit and can show the person that you feel bad for your behavior.

, You can also do something nice for the person that will improve their day and show them you want to make up for your behavior. This could be surprising them by taking them out to lunch or bringing them their favorite lunch at work. You could also plan an outing just the two of you to make up for missing an appointment with the person.


Often, kind acts should be done along with an apology in words. You may need to compose a thoughtful, heartfelt apology and share it with the person, as well as do a kind act, to help the person forgive you.

, Once you have apologized to the person through words and/or actions, it is important that you give the person time to process your apology. Do not expect the person to forgive you right away or say, ""no big deal"" after you apologize. It may take time for the person to accept your apology and move forward from your bad behavior. You may need to give the person space and spend time away from them so they are able to process their emotions towards you and find it in their heart to forgive you., If the person does not say, ""I forgive you"", you may be frustrated or annoyed at them, especially if you have presented a heartfelt apology. But you cannot force the person to forgive you and being rude or unkind to them will only make the situation worse. Instead, focus on showing kindness and consideration to the person, even if they are cold to you. Go out of your way to be nice to them and show them that just because they have not yet forgiven you, does not be mean you have written off your relationship with them completely., If the person does not accept your apology, you may need to turn inward and focus on changing your bad behavior permanently. Actions speak louder than words, and adjusting your behavior so it is more responsible and considerate will help to show the person that you are trying to change. Put your changed self into action and show the person that you are trying to get better at maintaining healthy relationships and boundaries. Over time, the person may see that you have changed and consider renewing your relationship again."

Figure out whether the self-talk is your own self or a different voice.,
Examine the content of your self-talk.,
Assess whether your self-talk is generally positive or negative.,
Assess how your self-talk makes you feel.,
Assess how others respond to your self-talk.,
Acknowledge the behavior.,
Think more.,
Allow self-talk only in certain situations.,
Write down your self-talk.,
Make conversations with people.,
Keep busy.",How to Stop Talking to Yourself," If you are hearing an audible voice that is not your own, consult a mental health professional as this may be a sign of a more serious psychological issue.One way to determine whether the voice is yours is to determine whether you are responsible for it. If you are not responsible for the voice (e.g., are you thinking, making, and saying the words consciously?) and if you have no clue what this voice will say next, this could be a sign of a mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, depression or psychosis.Other symptoms of a mental disorder include hearing more than one voice; experiencing non-verbal thoughts, visions, tastes, scents and touches that you didn’t call into existence; experiencing the voices as a waking dream that feels real; experiencing voices that are present all day and that negatively impact your daily functioning (e.g., you become isolated and withdrawn or the voices threaten you if you don't do what they say).If you are experiencing any of these symptoms during your periods of self-talk, it's important that you consult a mental health professional in order to rule out a psychiatric disorder that could be adversely affecting your life and health.;
, What kinds of things are you talking to yourself about? Are you narrating the day? Are you planning what you need to do next? Are you talking about something that happened recently? Are you reciting lines from a movie?Self-talk is not necessarily a bad thing. Articulating your thoughts can help you organize them. It can also help you think through things more carefully, particularly when making a tough decision, like where to go to college or whether or not do buy this gift or that gift for someone., Positive self-talk can actually be good for you in situations where you want to feel highly motivated, such as a job interview or intense work out. Telling yourself “You’ve got this, you can do it!” can make you feel good and give you a positive boost of self-confidence before you do something important. You can be your own cheerleader! In this way, some occasional self-talk can be healthy.However, if your self-talk is mainly negative, where you typically rebuke and criticize yourself (e.g., ""why are you so stupid?"", ""you never do anything right"", etc.), this may be a sign of an underlying psychological or emotional problem.In addition, if your self-talk is repetitive and focuses on something negative that happened to you, this may be a sign of a tendency to ruminate. For example, if you were recently in a small tiff with a coworker and you spend the next two hours thinking of and talking to yourself about all the things you should have said, this is not healthy. It is ruminating and dwelling on the issue., We can all be a little nutty, and that’s fine! But in order to keep yourself mentally healthy, you need to make sure that this habit is in fact just a quirky habit and not negatively impacting how you feel about yourself or how you function in your daily life. Ask yourself these questions:


Do I frequently feel concerned or guilty about how much I talk to myself?
Does my self-talk make me sad, mad, or anxious?
Is me talking to myself such a big problem that I try to avoid public situations to prevent embarrassment?
If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, then you should consult a counselor or other mental health professional. A licensed mental health professional can help you reflect on why you talk to yourself and work with you to develop strategies to bring the habit under control.

, Consider whether and how others have reacted when they see you talking to yourself. Chances are that most people won't even really notice that you do it. However, if you often notice certain reactions from the people around you, this may be a sign that your self-talk is disruptive to others or that these individuals are concerned about you and your mental and social functioning. Ask yourself these questions:


Do people give me weird looks while I'm walking around?
Do people often ask me to quiet down?
Is the first thing someone hears from me is me talking to myself?
Have my teachers ever recommended me to the school counselor?
If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, then you should consult a counselor or other mental health professional. In their reactions, people may be expressing concern for your well-being. However, it's also important to note that you may be disrupting others when you self-talk and that you may need to get this habit under control for the sake of your social relationships.

, When you find yourself talking out loud, become aware and acknowledge that you are doing so. You could keep track by tallying the number of times a day you catch yourself talking out loud. Becoming aware of behavior is the first step to reducing it.

, Try to keep the conversation in your head. As soon as you find you are talking to yourself out loud, try moving the conversation inside your head, to your internal world.


You can even press your teeth down on your lips so you cannot open your mouth. This will help, but keep in mind that it may also look odd to those around you!
Try chewing gum too keep your mouth occupied and not able to talk.If it's too challenging to just start thinking rather than talking, try mouthing the words. This way, the conversation can continue on but won’t be audible to others.

, Only allow yourself to do it while at home alone or in the car, for example. Be careful with this step, because once you allow yourself to talk out loud, you might start talking to yourself at other times too. Have rules to limit your talking, and if you've followed them for a week, do something to reward yourself, such as watching a movie or allowing yourself a sweet snack. Over time, try to reduce the number of situations in which you allow yourself to talk out loud until you no longer do it at all.

, Buy a journal for those moments when you find you start talking to yourself. In this way, you can have a written, rather than oral, dialogue with yourself. One way to do this is by writing down your thought then providing a response or answer.


For example, let's say you went on a date but haven't heard from the guy yet. This is one dialogue that you might be tempted to say out loud to yourself, but that you can also write down: ""Why hasn’t he called me? Maybe he is busy or maybe he doesn’t like you. Why would you think he doesn’t like you? Maybe he is just really busy with school or maybe you're just not a good match for each other because you don't have the same interests or priorities. Well, maybe, but I still feel rejected. That's an understandable feeling, but he's not the only guy in the world and, more importantly, there's lots about you that is great; in fact, what makes you feel good about yourself?...""
This kind of dialogue and journaling exercise can help organize and reflect on your thoughts. It can also be a good mechanism to keep yourself on the path of thinking and conveying positive thoughts about yourself, and correcting those negative ones you may feel.
Get in the habit of keeping your journal with you at all times, whether in your bag, car or pocket. There are even journaling apps for your smartphone, too! Another benefit to this writing exercise is that you’ll have a record of the sort of things you talk about and are concerned with. Patterns may emerge. Creativity may flow. And you’ll have something to show for it!, One of the most common reasons that people end up talking to themselves is because they feel like they don't have anyone else to talk to.Becoming more social will give you more people to talk to other than yourself. Remember that human beings thrive on social interaction.If you feel anxious about socializing and talking with others, try taking a few small steps to initiate conversations. For example, if you come across someone who seems friendly and receptive to you (by smiling at you, saying ""hello"" or making eye contact), try reciprocating and smiling or saying ""hello"" back. After a few positive experiences in this vein, you may feel ready to engage in more than just the basic pleasantries.
Sometimes it is hard to read social cues and know how much to talk to someone. Trust is another thing that may take time to establish to converse comfortably with someone. If you feel too anxious or nervous about talking to strangers, that’s okay. However, it may be a good idea to look into support groups and personal therapy to help overcome this discomfort.
If you want to meet more people, try taking up a new activity, such as yoga, pottery-making, or dance classes. Making an effort do more activities where other people are present (e.g., a yoga workshop versus running on the treadmill in your own home) will give you more opportunities to have conversations with people who share your interest.
If you live in a geographically isolated place, using the internet to stay in touch with people can be fulfilling. You can try chatrooms or forums where people discuss topics of interest to you. If you do not have the internet, try communicating the old fashioned way - with letters! Staying connected to others is an important part of being human.

, In many instances, having conversations with yourself starts out with daydreaming or just being bored, so keeping yourself busy could help. Immerse yourself in another activity so that your brain is already occupied doing something else.


Try listening to music. When on you are on your own or walking somewhere, give your brain something to focus to avoid the impetus to talk to yourself.Music can be a nice distraction for your mind and may also inspire some new internal thoughts or bursts of creativity as well. Melodious sounds have been proven to encourage the release of dopamine in the reward/pleasure area of the brain, meaning that you will feel good while listening to music.There's an added benefit to even just appearing like you are listening to music. If you are wearing headphones and realize you are talking to yourself, people may think the headphones are for your cellphone and assume you are talking to someone else.
Read a book. Reading can help you get lost in another world and requires a significant amount of concentration. Having you mind focused on something else will give you less opportunity to talk to yourself.Watch TV. Try watching something you're interested in on television or just having the TV on for background noise. This will help create a certain ambiance and a sense that the room is ""full"" and lively. It is for this reason that people who have trouble sleeping alone often turn on the TV as they fall asleep, just so that they feel like someone else is there even if it's just on the screen! Watching TV also helps focus your attention and keep your brain busy."

Understand what is meant by a ""hard and disturbing question"".,
Don't answer.,
Flip the question back to the questioner.,
Delay.,
Answer gradually.,
Refuse to answer.,
Use humor.,
Answer it intelligently.",How to Answer Hard and Disturbing Questions Intelligently," For the purposes of this article, it is assumed that such questions involve personal beliefs, controversial challenges/topics, or, for example, questions about your sexuality, your involvement in something potentially illegal, your faith, your political beliefs, your understanding of something you are allegedly expert at, your knowledge of someone's infidelities, etc. Basically, it's a penetrating question that disturbs, worries, upsets, or flummoxes you and you don't want to appear on the back foot.;
, This is your number one defense reaction. Provide time-buying responses such as:


That's an interesting question. I'll have to think that one over.
I've never thought about it like that before. Give me some time to get back to you on it.
I'd need the facts first. I'll do some research and let you know later.
Well, that's an interesting question. I'd like to answer it but I don't have enough time right now. Can we pick up this thread next time maybe?

, Another stalling device is to return the question to the questioner. Ways of doing this include:


Why do you want to know?
I don't know quite how to frame my response. What do you think first?
Well, what would you think in that situation?
Clearly you have an answer/idea; perhaps you'd care to elaborate on that?

, Use silence as a way to give yourself thinking time. Reassure the questioner that you're listening by nodding, maintaining eye contact, and using filler comments such as ""Yes, interesting point..."" and staying silent for a moment while you think about it.

, Don't give out all of the answer straight up; instead mete out your response and make it clear that if more information is required, you will consider entering into a mutual discussion about the matter, provided that the questioner is being genuine and also offers to give their opinions and feelings on the matter. Examples:


Yes, I did do that at 3am but I'm not sure what you're getting at. Are you prepared to elaborate on what it is you really want to know? If so, maybe I can help you more.
That isn't something I'm aware of but perhaps there is something else I can help you with? I do know the Cotswold area well but I am not sure why you are interested in my local knowledge?

, As politely as possible, while maintaining eye contact and smiling, or at least not looking fierce, firmly assert that you won't be answering that question, thanks. If you feel that the question has crossed the boundaries of appropriateness or is too intimate, refusing to answer can be a proper option. You might say things like:


I appreciate your curiosity but I am not comfortable responding to that.
I mean no offense but it's really a case of my business being minded and I decline to answer.
No comment, sorry!
I'm grateful for your interest but I'm not up to talking about this matter with others who were not involved.
That's way too personal a question. I'm sorry but I just don't feel right sharing that information with you.
I'm sorry but asking me that makes me feel unduly pressured. Please don't ask that of me again.
I'm not in the habit of answering questions that are so incredibly personal. Perhaps you might like to rephrase the question to make it less confronting?

, This is a deflecting manner of responding to a question. Humor can be used to avoid answering a question by making a lighthearted quip or a self-deprecating joke. Humor can also be put to good use to answer the question in a lighthearted manner that pushes aside the disturbing and hard elements of the question. If you want to use this method, you need to be confident with using humor and that isn't easy.

, If the question isn't problematic, it isn't too personal or grueling, and you know the answer, why not launch into answering it? If you have any sense that the person has tried to outdo you in any way, this is always a super fun way to respond in kind! Keep it light and factual and if you're debating, make it interesting too.

Learn about them ahead of time.,
Remember to introduce yourself.,
Take photos with them.,
Get their autograph.,
Think of conversation topics ahead of time.,
Try not to stress about it.,
Bring them a gift.",How to Act Around a Celebrity1," If you aren’t the celebrity's number one fan and don’t know much about them, learn about them before the meet and greet. Maybe you won the meet and greet tickets on the radio, but don't know their work or you love the celebrity but you don’t know much about them. If this is the case look up information about who they are. Watch their movies and TV shows, or listen to their music before the meet and greet so you are prepared.


You might find out information about them that you can relate to (such as where they grew up or that you both love dogs) to help create a natural conversation.;
, You can tell them your name and a little bit about yourself. Celebrities are likely to want to feel like they are having an opportunity to meet and get to know someone too. Make sure to tell them your name and a little bit about yourself when you meet them.


For example, “Hi! I am Lisa. I am from Wisconsin and am a junior in high school! I have been a big fan of your music since I was 11.”

, If you are at a meet and greet, it is usually expected that you can take photos with the celebrity. You can politely ask them for a photo on your phone. They also might have photographers at the meet and greet. Be confident and polite when you ask for the photo.


Say something like, “Can we please take a photo?”
Make sure to say thank you for the photograph.

, If you know you are going to meet a celebrity, you can bring something for them to autograph. Don’t bring too much stuff, otherwise that might be overwhelming for them. Bring something that is merchandise of theirs, such as a poster or shirt, for them to sign. They will likely have a pen for autographs, but just in case they don’t, bring a pen or marker with you.


You can simply ask them: “Can you please sign my poster?”

, Before you get to the meet and greet, think about what you want to talk to the celebrity about. You can tell them how much you love their music or acting. You can ask them insightful questions about how they come up with songwriting ideas or what it was like playing a certain role., They might seem divine to you, but remember they are just another human. Try not to stress about meeting them and treat it like you are meeting any other person. The celebrity will probably appreciate it if you treat them like anyone else and not like someone special., Many celebrities appreciate the thought of a gift from a fan. Don’t get a celebrity something strange like a personal item of yours, but you can get them something thoughtful. Some celebrities love gifts from fans; for instance, Taylor Swift posted a sweater a fan knitted for her on Instagram.If you are a big fan of the celebrity and are worried you are going to get tongue tied when you meet them, then write them a short note. You can tell them how much of a fan you are and appreciate their work, just don’t go overboard.

Don’t scream their name and draw attention to them. You can politely approach them, if it seems appropriate, but don’t freak out so much that everyone else in the area runs after them., If you are running into a celebrity by random luck, you might not have a lot of time to fully introduce yourself. If you think it is okay to approach the celebrity, make sure to at least tell them your name so they know who they are meeting too!


You can say something like: “Hi I am Kelly! I am sorry to bother you. I just wanted to say hello and tell you I am a huge fan of your music.”

, Taking photos without the celebrity’s permission is disrespectful. Most people would not like it if they were followed by crowds of people photographing them. They get enough unauthorized photos from the paparazzi. Instead, if it seems appropriate to approach the celebrity, you can politely ask them for a photograph.


Say something like, “Hi, I am John! I love your music. I was wondering if you would mind taking a quick photo with me?”
If they say no, respect their wishes., You don’t need to announce to the world that a celebrity is at a certain place or doing something. You can post on social media that you ran into them, but don’t post every detail about it online. Don’t call everyone you know and tell them to hurry down to the restaurant they are eating at. Celebrities are people too, let them have their personal lives., You might want to run up to the celebrity and go for a hug, but be respectful of their personal space. If you are trying to get their attention don’t touch their shoulder. If they touch you (such as they put their arm around you for a photo), then you can reciprocate the touching if it seems appropriate., Celebrities are people too. You don’t need to act like they are above everyone else. Be polite and casual with them. Try not to freak out and act different around them then you would anyone else. Celebrities will likely appreciate being treated like regular people.You can compliment their work and tell them you are a huge fan, but try not to go overboard (like scream and cry) when you talk to them.

If you suspect your girlfriend might be seeing someone else, watch for the warning signs that your relationship may be flagging a bit. Watch to see if your girlfriend:


Calls less frequently
Seems distracted when you're together
Dresses differently
Cancels your plans regularly
Lies to you about where she's going;
, When you are out together, does your girlfriend spend most of her time with her head buried in her phone instead of making eye contact with you? Does she seem overly preoccupied with talking to someone in particular?


Lots of texting could be a sign of a roving eye, or just that she's texting her mom. Try to remember who she talks to is her business. If you have to, say something like, ""I was hoping we could spend some time together now, not with our phones, unless there's some emergency. That ok? Is everything ok?""
Don't try to crack past her phone password and start digging around in her personal stuff. If you feel the need to spy on your partner, your relationship is already in bad shape, and you should end it.

, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and other social networking and texting apps make cheating a whole lot more complicated. If you suspect your girlfriend might be cheating online, you could even open up some fake dating site accounts of your own to check and see.


You've noticed she's posting a lot of comments on a male coworker's pictures? Don't freak out. She can post whatever she wants, on whoever's board she wants to post on. That doesn't mean she's cheating, but it does mean she might be losing some interest or engagement in your relationship.
Never, under any circumstances, should you try to log into your girlfriend's email, Facebook page, or other password-secured information. Breaching trust because you're suspicious means you're in a bad relationship.

, If your girlfriend starts behaving in a way that's counter to the way she usually acts, that might be cause for alarm. It's hard to say exactly what this might consist of, but keeping an eye out for anything that seems out of the ordinary for her to be doing.


If you have plans together, and your girlfriend cancels or changes them abruptly, that might be a sign of something going on.
If your girlfriend starts hanging out especially late with people she doesn't usually hang out with, you might want to talk about it.

, If your girlfriend is having second-thoughts about your relationship, or has even taken up with someone else, she'll likely want to talk about this with somebody. If you play your cards right, they'll likely feel sorry for the position she's put you in, and they might come clean.


Don't come in with accusations, come in with upset questions. Tell her friends that you've noticed that she's seemed really distant lately, and you're not sure why. Ask them if they know anything that could help you fix the relationship.
If they say no, that doesn't mean they're ""in on it."" It might just mean that your girlfriend is not cheating. Try to relax.

, Are you being the best partner you can be? Are you contributing to the health of the relationship in a positive way? Are you doing everything you can to make the relationship work? Are you a respectful, kind, and giving partner? It's possible that your partner is not cheating, but is feeling less enthusiastic about the relationship in general because the relationship itself is going downhill, not because there's someone else pulling her away.

, Sometimes a person who is cheating, or wants to cheat, will project their own inclinations onto their partner.

, Lots of cheating evidence can be found on someone's cellphone or mobile, but checking out someone else's property needs to be done carefully and tactfully to avoid crossing the line.


If you have to look, do it ""accidentally."" When her phone's out, glance at it when a message comes in to see who it's from out of the corner of your eye. If there is a long string of texts from someone suspicious, you might have a good reason to talk.
You'll break someone's trust entirely if you pick up their cellphone and start scrolling through the message history. And if you find nothing, you'll be the jerk.

, If you're concerned your girlfriend might be messing around at your place when you're not around, you can change up your routine regularly, to come home at odd times when you'd usually be out.


Have a good reason for popping in. Bring carry-out at lunch time, if you usually grab lunch near your job or school. Or show up early when you're coming home, just for a surprise.
If you don't live together, don't just show up at someone's door when you're not supposed to be there. That might come off more creepy than anything else.
It's important to know that catching your girlfriend in the act can be pretty traumatic. It's usually better to talk about it before you resort to Jerry Springer tactics.

, If your relationship is suffering and you're concerned about it, focus on evaluating it and either making it better or ending it, not on going on some kind of cheating crusade. Be bigger than that. Better yet, don't pry in the first place. If you have some issues with your partner, bring it to them first.


Don't obsess. If you're thinking about placing pinhole cameras in places you think she is cheating on you or are contemplating closed-circuit television, you need to end this relationship now and find a healthier one.

, If your girlfriend is cheating, think about why, and whether or not you want to end the relationship because of it. If your girlfriend is not cheating, think about what might have changed in your relationship that you became suspicious.


If you were just suffering a bout of paranoia that turned out to be false, talk it out with your girlfriend and come clean. Apologize. Talk about your relationship in an open, honest, and trusting way. Work on building back the trust you might have lost.
If your girlfriend was cheating, ask her what she wants to do, and try to decide whether or not an infidelity means the end of your relationship for you. If it's over for her, it's over regardless. If she wants to work it out, you've got to decide whether or not it's worth it.

, If your girlfriend cheats on you, guess what? It's not the end of the world. In fact, you should maybe take it as a good thing. If your girlfriend felt the need to cheat, that means your relationship was unfulfilling in some way, possibly broken beyond repair. Now, it can be over, and you can both stop wasting your time in a relationship that doesn't work. Stay calm, take a big breath, and try to keep a cool head.


Leave the scene, if necessary. If you catch your girlfriend cheating, just walk away. If you find some kind of evidence, walk away. Call a friend, or a family member, and talk it out.
The last thing you ever want to do is lash out violently or irrationally. Be the bigger person in this relationship. Stay calm, and decide what you want to do.

, Breaking up is hard. Your girlfriend's feelings for you might have kept her from telling you to your face, to avoid the pain of the break-up. So, really, whether or not your girlfriend is cheating, it's a bad sign that you've come to this point anyway. It's still important to Try to be objective and honest with each other.


Ask your girlfriend big questions. What do you want from this relationship? What are you not getting from this relationship? What might I be able to change to make it work better?
Try to be as specific as possible. You don't need the answer to a question like, ""Why did you cheat on me?"" or ""What did you do with him?"" Focus on things that matter for going forward, not looking back.

, Try to keep things focused on her feelings and not on the way that you feel. Being cheated on hurts, and you may want to express your feelings and hash it out with your partner, but take a step back and focus your energy where it will matter.


If she's already given up on the relationship, there's little point in bearing your soul to someone who doesn't care. Walk out on her. The relationship is over, if one party has given up on it.
If she wants to work it out, then you can talk about how you feel and decide whether or not you want to. Try to think about whether you'll be able to forgive an infidelity, or the trust barrier is broken beyond repair.
If your suspicions were wrong, but you're having serious relationship problems, it's still important to have this talk.

, Even if you think you know how you feel, you might be surprised. Give your girlfriend an opportunity to talk, and really try to hear her side of the story. That doesn't mean you have to accept an apology, but it's still important to give her the chance to talk. You can always end the relationship.


Don't assume that you know why your girlfriend may or may not have cheated. Don't accuse or attempt to lecture your girlfriend in any way. Hear her out.
If necessary, you can try some kind of conversational game. Set a timer on it and promise that you'll each get to express yourself, judgment free, for 15 minutes, without the other person interrupting. Stick to it.

, If you're going to work on your relationship, you need to confront the way you were hurt by an infidelity, if one occurred. When you do that will be up to you. It's usually best to hear her side of things first, then decide whether or not you want to share your feelings, or just call it quits.


Talk to a trusted friend about how you're feeling first. Getting some perspective on what happened can be hard by yourself. Talk about what happened, sparing any graphic details, and get some extra input.
Many people find it difficult, if not impossible, to get past an episode of cheating. If you feel like you can't stand the thought of being with someone who has cheated on you, then don't. Break up.

It could be a physical feature (the eyes, the hair) or it could be something they do (the way they walk). Are any of their little tricks ones that you feel you could adapt and use too? If so, adopt them—they will improve as you practice and become part of your style too.


Be careful of becoming a caricature. If you try to adopt somebody's signature look—say, coloring your hair and dressing like the latest popstar confection—people will think ""popstar wannabe,"" not ""wow, now that's hot!"";
, Remember, the goal here is to be sexually attractive, and that takes some work. Maintain your appearance, learn and maintain good posture, keep your clothes free from ""wardrobe malfunctions,"" (especially if you're on the risk edge of dressing sexily).


Don't make it obvious that you're checking yourself out—that comes across as vain or narcissistic. Be discreet. The important thing is to keep up your appearance of hotness for as much time as possible while you're out and about.

, This is a common tip that covers a broad range of activities, from sports to music to hotness. Being considered hot doesn't mean just looking hot, it actually means you need to be hot, and who you are and how you act has almost everything to do with it! If you don't feel hot, there's an easy way around that: visualize your own hotness.


Carry yourself the way hot people do. They don't slouch, or sit in the corner with their arms crossed. They stand up straight. They make animated gestures with their hands. They smile and laugh a lot. That all stems from one key ingredient of hotness: confidence. There is nothing more attractive than confidence, whether you're a man or a woman.
Be larger than life. The reason hot people are called ""hot"" is because of the implication of heat, fire - not just an allusion to sexual energy, but also being passionate and lively in general. Be willing and able to speak your mind, but do it wisely. This requires a modicum of intelligence and the willingness and ability to learn. It is said that it's better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than open your mouth and erase any doubt.

, In addition to fitness, looking like you just don't care about yourself is not hot. Externally, that's obvious. Internally, if you don't care about your appearance, it indicates that you don't have much in the way of self esteem or confidence—traits that are not attractive in the short run, nor are they attractive in the long run. What can you do?


Wax or trim your eyebrows, and everything else that looks untidy. Get rid of that unibrow, wax away the upper lip hair, pluck the chin hair, shave your legs, and basically get rid of any hair you can stand to part with except the hair on your head.
Modern standards of beauty lean towards overall having no body hair. It helps create the whole smooth-skin look and also makes you look more polished and clean-cut.
Don't take it so far, though, that you have to draw on your eyebrows. That's where hot turns into trashy.
We all have different facial structures, features we love, and features we hate. Highlight those features that work, and downplay the ones that don't. Applying the right amount of makeup in the right places will do wonders. If you doubt the truth of this, just Google ""stars with no makeup,"" and see how truly ordinary even the hottest of the hot look without makeup. Then understand that hotness mostly radiates from the inside.

, Hit the gym, go tanning, and get your laundry done. This trifecta will not make you a better human being, but will be a step towards ""hotness."" After all, ""hotness"" is simply shorthand for being sexually desirable, and being physically attractive is what most people look at—initially.



Working out regularly pays big dividends. Is it shallow that we judge others by looks? Of course it is! However, the first thing people see is the ""surface"" you, so that's where we begin our journey to hotness. In general, people will find you more attractive if you're fit. The benefits don't end there, though. Not only will hitting the gym make you look better, but it'll also help you feel better, help boost your self esteem and confidence (more on that later), and even help you sleep better.

Tanning your hide is not always a bad idea. One hopes you do not aspire to the obvious fake 'n' bake look exhibited by reality show denizens and politicians, but a smooth, even complexion generally makes people more attractive. It doesn't have to be—and probably shouldn't be—too dark, but the tanning effect has the benefit of covering up minor imperfections. To keep skin cancer at bay, consider a professional spray tan. Avoid the orange tan by checking out photos of clients from your local spray tan salon to make sure they know how to get it right.

Laundry day is good for you! It sounds like a terrible bore, but in addition to keeping your clothes clean and wrinkle-free, you will always have the widest possible variety to choose from when you select what you're wearing. Put together outfits that emphasize your best features, and have enough variety to your outfits so that you're not always wearing the same thing.

, If you're good at pretending you're hot, congratulations. Eventually (even as soon as the next morning), people will see you disheveled, with no makeup, and sloppy clothes, the veneer stripped away. That's when your real self will be naked and exposed. Don't get so caught up in looking hot that you forget to be a decent person!

Assess your usual conversations.,
Don't limit these ""replay sessions"" to your social circle.,
Assess the way you are most likely to begin a conversation.,
Pay attention to the body language of others.,
Keep count of all the times you accidentally say more than you mean to say (also known as TMI, or too much information).",How to Tell if You Talk Too Much1," Say that you just met your friend for lunch and you're worried that you may have dominated the conversation ... again. Replay the lunch date in your head, resisting the urge to defend yourself. This will help you to see clearly whether or not you talk a lot in comparison to other people. Ask yourself some pointed questions, like:


""Who did most of the talking?""
""Did we talk more about me or about my friend?""
""How often did I interrupt my friend?"";
, Think about the way you talk to everyone, including — but not limited to — your boss, co-workers, mother, and the restaurant staff.

, Do you open the conversation by jumping in with a funny story of your life and your observations without being asked? Or are you likely to ask someone a question and let them tell you a story, tell you about their life and their observations? Conversation is a balance between both participants, and although you should take Sheryl Sandberg's advice and lean in, you hog the limelight when you focus too much on yourself.

, Do people sometimes roll their eyes when you start to talk, or maybe tap their foot impatiently? Do people begin to phase out, looking glazed or distracted when you begin to elaborate on something? Do people simply nod their head and throw out irrelevant ""Yeahs"" and ""Uh-huhs"" without wanting you to elaborate any further? Or worse, do people sometimes ignore you completely when you get on a verbal roll, turn the other way and start a conversation with the next person? An ultimate sign is a very simple one — the other person may say something as simple as ""you talk too much"" and move away. All of these provide some good indicators of whether you're boring or frustrating people by talking too much. If signs like these are consistent factors in your conversations, you're talking too much.

, Do you find yourself often giving away bits of information you don't mean to? A friend's confidence, or your own (sometimes embarrassing) problems? Or maybe you let slip rude or hurtful opinions about other people. Note how often this occurs in day-to-day conversations.


If it helps, keep a small notebook and mark in the times that you feel you've slipped up in this way. It'll help you to gauge how much this is happening.

"
"
Fix the problem.,
Make a conscious effort to listen more and talk less.,
Don't fill all the dead air.,
Don't give all the history or trivia on a subject that you are currently discussing with someone.,
Remember a good conversation is like a back-and-forth rally.,
Don't name drop in a conversation.,
Slow down.,
If you learn nothing else, at least learn to stop interrupting people.,
Consider the cause/effect.,
Learn to express yourself well in an entertaining manner.",How to Tell if You Talk Too Much2," Once you've finished your self-analysis and decided that you do talk too much and want to do something about it, it's time to get serious about curtailing the talk. Don't think ""I know, but I can't change."" If you can learn how to do other complex things in your life (musical instrument, computer games, cooking, gardening, etc.), then you can learn about this too. This section provides some solutions.

, Listening shows you are interested in the other person and what they have to say. People will be flattered by a good listener, because secretly, everyone loves to talk about themselves. There is no topic that interests them more than themselves. Remember, if you allow them to talk (ask open-ended questions, don't interrupt, stay in sync with their body language and make eye contact), and ask them lots of follow-up questions, they'll think you're a brilliant conversationalist without you needing to say much. Some people seem to think that by talking the most, they must be the best conversationalist. By the same token, if a dinner guest takes more than half of the food on the table offered for a group, would you consider them a great guest? Hardly — you're more likely to see them as being rude, selfish and possessing a complete lack of social skills.

, This is especially true in a group setting. Pauses are sometimes another person's thinking time; they are also moments for imparting gravity or emphasis onto what has already been said. Some people like to take a moment to think and compose their answer carefully. Don't feel you need to jump in at every pause; doing so swallows them up and throws them off their answer. If you hog all the gaps, you'll be talking for more than your fair share, and others will feel that you are interrupting them. Allow 5 seconds, look around, and if nobody seems to want to speak, ask a question instead of inserting opinions or statements. Most of all, don't jump in with a ""funny"" story; rather, rely on asking people about themselves.

, That can begin to feel like a college lecture to the other person. Instead give a brief summary or answer their direct question, and then wait to see if the other person really wants you to continue with more information. If they do, they will ask you more questions. If they don't, they may give you a general ""uh-huh"" or a non-verbal clue that that's enough info and they're not interested.

, If someone asks you a question (for example, ""How was your holiday?""), after you have given your reply about your great trip and experience, be brief and to the point. Then, return the favor by asking a question back (for example ""How about you, are you planning to go on any trips this year?"" or ""Enough about me, how was your week? How's the family?"")

, If someone you're talking to won't know that ""Mike"" is your neighbor, make sure you preface your comment with ""My neighbor Mike"" or follow-up in the next sentence with your explanation. Name dropping frustrates the listener; it either makes them feel out-of-the-loop or ignorant, or that you are passively showing off.

, This cannot be over-emphasized; the amount of conversationalists behaving like bulls at a gate is growing, possibly fed by the fast technological world we're now immersed in. Sometimes people simply get excited and begin an overwhelming monologue. They're so into what they have to say, they forget that you need two people to hold a conversation. This is selfish. Sometimes all it takes is a quick mental note to calm down.


Take a deep breath and collect yourself before breaking your oh-so-amazing news to your friends.
In essence, think before you speak. Truthfully, your special story will have more impact if you take time to think about what you're going to say and how you're going to say it.

, In today's fast-paced world, many of us have been guilty of interrupting others, either to save ourselves time, or in the guise of saving them time. Too many of us have been desensitized to this egotistical way of carrying on a conversation. It's now commonplace to find yourself rudely and callously cut off from finishing your sentences, only to find one's fellow conversationalist interjecting with their own personal stories, thoughts, or commentaries, rambling on and on incessantly. In effect, it's a practice which basically states ""I don't find you interesting enough, and so I'm just going to say what I want to say because I assume I am of greater interest."" This disregards the most basic rule of human interaction, namely that of respect. So the next time you are in a conversation, no matter what it is about, listen above all else. Personal input is a wonderful way to express oneself, but never at the expense of the other person's feelings. So go for it, this is a wonderful way to gain the revered honor of becoming a ""good listener.""

, Ask yourself why you're so chatty. Do you seldom have an opportunity to be heard? Were you ignored or stifled as a child? Do you feel inadequate? Are you lonely because you're holed up all day? Too much caffeine giving you the mile-a-minute jitters? Are you often pressed for time and have adapted by increasing your rate of speech? The effect that fast- and long-winded talkers tend to have is one of draining the other party, overwhelming and exhausting them until they can find a polite-enough exit strategy. When you catch yourself talking too much, try to take a moment to check in with yourself; take a deep breath and remind yourself that you can ""reset"" your speaking habits if you slow down and work at it.

, This will help in itself. If you enjoy telling stories, learning to tell them well means staying on topic, making them entertaining, pacing them well and keeping listeners' interest.


Conciseness is one important key. If you can tell it in fewer words you're more likely to get a laugh or move your listener.
Rehearse some of your better stories. Take drama classes. Give yourself the attention you crave by participating in talent shows and open mic events. If you're sufficiently entertaining, people mind it less that you talk too much and you'll attract shy people who would prefer to let someone else dominate the conversation.

Think of an opener.,
Try a bit of small talk.,
Be funny if you can.,
Pay attention to your body language.,
Don't forget to share information about yourself.,
Tell stories.,
Try to find something you have in common.,
Be sincere.,
Know when to end the conversation.",How to Talk to Someone You've Never Met," If you're going up to someone and planning on talking to them, you need a conversation starter. A conversation starter will reassure the person that you follow social cues, you're friendly, and are genuinely interested in them.


Don't always overthink it. A simple ""Hello, how are you?"" or ""Nice day, is this seat taken?"" work really well. Simple is best.
Comment on something that's happening around both of you. Maybe you're both at the mall, and she's shopping for shoes. You can go up to her and say: ""Those are nice shoes. They'd look great on you."" But don't get in their comfort zone.
Ask a question about something that's happening around you. Ask for directions to the library (and pretend you're going); ask for the time (and pretend you're busy); or simply ask them if they know of any lunch/dinner spots nearby.;
, Small talk gets a bad rap, but it shouldn't. Small talk tells us a lot about the other person, and hopefully leads to more meaningful conversation. But it's a step along the way.


Ask the person what they do for a living and tell them what you do. Having a discussion about your jobs isn't the most tantalizing conversation (unless you're a professional skydiver or underwater explorer), but it can be interesting to see what other people do for a living.
Ask the person where they grew up. ""Did you grow up around here?"" is a perfectly fine small talk question. ""What was the city you grew up in like?"" is a great follow-up question if they didn't grow up nearby.
Ask about their hobbies. A good way to frame this question is: ""So, what do you like to do in your free time?"" Hopefully they have exciting hobbies and fun stories to tell.
Don't talk about the weather, whatever you do. No one really cares about the weather, and it's a sign that you're trying to make small talk without being personal. Instead of relating to the rain or sun, try relating to the person you're talking with.

, Lots of people think they're funny or witty when they actually aren't. If you regularly get sympathy laughs from your friends, or crickets from strangers, when you try to be funny, don't make an effort here. If you're actually a funny person, don't be afraid to let some jokes fly.


Don't go overboard. This person doesn't know your sense of humor, and is probably still trying to figure out whether she or he likes you. A couple off-color jokes and your opportunity to impress them is probably long gone.

, Body language says a lot about us. It can betray us when we're bored, anxious, excited, happy, or sad. Be sure you're sending your new potential friend the right vibes with your body.


Maintain good eye contact. Look the other person in the eye, at least some of the time, when you talk. Don't stare at your feet or off into the distance.
Smile periodically. You don't have to have a smile plastered over your face the whole time, but make an effort to smile sincerely, even if that's not how you're feeling inside.
Keep your hands under control. Don't fidget with them. More importantly, keep your hands off the other person. Remember: They don't know you yet, and you don't want to come off as too friendly.
Talk slowly and laugh at their jokes (even if they're not that funny). Calm yourself down by talking slowly. It'll seem like it sounds weird, but it actually sounds normal. Do them a favor and laugh at their silly jokes, even if they're bombs.

, You don't always need to wait for the other person to ask you a question in order to talk about yourself.


Relate experiences they talk about to experiences you've had.

If the other person talks about having gone skiing over the weekend, you can say: ""Well, I'm jealous. I tried going last December but we had a white-out after a nasty blizzard rolled through. How was the powder?""


Offer information that fits the flow of the conversation. A lot of the time, you can get away with non-sequiturs simply because you move the conversation forward:

If the other person is talking about their horrible in-laws, you can say something like: ""I know, getting to know my in-laws was pretty rough. There's a funny story, actually, about my wedding night, when my dad mistook my father in-law for the bartender....""



, Stories offer other people a chance to take a break from talking while encouraging them to open up as well. Telling stories that encourage more conversation is all about striking the perfect balance between excitement and humility. Tell a riveting story, but don't get cocky.

, There's something bonding about having gone through the same thing or experienced something special together. We want others to understand us, and finding commonalities is a way for other people to understand us.


Socially acceptable commonalities to talk about include: school (any level), birthplace, role models, personal preferences (favorite foods, travel destinations, movies, sports teams etc.), backgrounds, goals, and many more. If, for any reason, you feel like the person might be threatened by your finding a common experience, shy away from discussing it.
Stay away from religion and politics. While religion and politics are acceptable topics to talk about, they're considered ""hot button"" issues and often provoke strong emotional responses. Wait until the third or fourth meeting to jump into religion and politics.

, It's okay to joke around a little bit, but sincerity should be one thing you offer the person throughout your conversation. Being sincere tells the other person you're showing them the real you. It's a little bit of an olive branch, a gift of trust.


If you do joke around a lot, follow up your jokes with phrases like ""No, to be perfectly honest,"" or ""I'm kidding, if you want to know the truth...."" These phrases show an ability to switch seamlessly between being funny and being sincere.
It's okay to be vulnerable, if you don't feel vulnerable about it. What does this mean? It means it's okay to share something you don't normally share with people (cancer diagnosis, fear of open spaces, etc.) if you don't act scared, bothered, or intense about it. In fact, people like it when you're vulnerable in a calm, collected way. It shows them how ""real"" you are.

, A conversation is like a date: There's a beginning, middle, and end to it, and it shouldn't go on forever. Know when it's time to end the conversation and potentially move onto the next one. Ending the conversation is natural thing to do; it does not mean that you failed.


If you manage to talk for 15-30 minutes with someone you've never met before, you've done a great job. You'll probably start running out of things to say or questions to ask, which is normal. End the conversation by saying ""Well, it was nice meeting you. Maybe we can talk again sometime?"" and exchange phone numbers if the other person seems interested.
If you manage to talk for more than 30 minutes, you've really hit it off with this person. You probably share a lot of similarities and you mesh well together. This does not mean, however, that you should talk through the night or monopolize all of their time. If the conversation is flowing naturally, keep with it. If the conversation starts petering out, look for ways to gently say goodbye. Since you hit it off, you'll always have another opportunity to talk again.
Friendships take time. You probably won't walk away from any first conversation thinking you've earned a friend or made an enemy. These things take time. Hang out with the people you have good conversations with. It might take weeks, months, or even years before your friendship is cemented.

Seek help from a counselor.",How to Handle a Cheating Partner1," When a partner is unfaithful, it is a serious breach of trust. And it is something that may indicate that this person is not worthy or capable of a healthy relationship. On one hand, good people make bad choices and if they are truly sorry and can make amends, forgiveness can lead to an even better relationship. On the other hand, if you simply cannot trust that person again, the relationship is effectively dead. Some key things to consider:


Is your partner truly sorry?
Did they voluntarily tell you, or did you find out from someone else?
Has this sort of behavior happened before, or has he or she promised to not do it, and it has continued or gotten worse?
Is this part of a larger picture of poor behavior towards you?
Is your partner willing to take steps to mend the relationship (if you decide you want to go that route) such as marital counseling, quitting a job, moving, etc.?
Do you feel you want to trust this person again? There is no right or wrong answer for this. This is entirely up to the person who has been cheated on. It does not matter if the person who has cheated is sorry, made amends, and so on — this can be a deal breaker plain and simple.

Feelings may change with time and further experience with the cheating partner. It can go one way or the other. This is natural.
Well-meaning friends and relatives may want to give simple advice to make a quick, definitive decision. Be aware that you do not have to make a decision right away in most cases. It is your life.

;
, People cheat for many different reasons and it is not always about sex. Sometimes people cheat because they are seeking an emotional connection, trying to deal with a loss or crisis, or seeking an escape. This is not an excuse or reason for the behavior, however. Do not assume that your partner’s cheating was all about sex. Find out why they cheated before you move forward. Try telling your partner, ""I need to know why you cheated and who it was. Please be honest with me and tell me what happened.""
Be aware that they may not really know why the infidelity happened. They may not really have deeply thought about it, or even if they did, they still may not really know why. And there may be reasons not fully understood by the person. This does not excuse it, but realize ""I don't know"" may be the honest answer. Some common reason include:

Attraction to a different person.
A desire for attention, excitement, or novelty.
A troubled marriage: poor communication, stress in the marriage, partners growing apart.
If the person's parent was unfaithful (especially the same sex).
The individual comes from culture or subculture that expects and tolerates infidelity.
Mental illness or disorders. People who cheat are not mentally ill, but a mental illness such as bipolar disorder, depression, or even severe attention deficit disorder can all contribute to poor decision making.



, The third (or even fourth or fifth) party needs to be out of the picture for the relationship to survive. Boundaries were breached, and they need to be re-established in a way that protects the relationship. That means asking your partner to break all ties with the person. This severing may be difficult if the third party is a coworker or someone else that your partner sees on a daily basis. This may require a change in lifestyle, such as quitting a job, the softball team, or moving to a new town.
If the relationship was of a very close family member (such as a sibling), this can be extremely awkward and difficult. Not only is your romantic relationship damaged, but close family relationships as well.
If your partner is unwilling to cut off contact with the third party, it may be a sign that they are unwilling to stop cheating. In this case, you may not be able to repair the relationship.
If the third party continues to pursue your partner despite being cut off, you and your partner may want to pursue a restraining order to keep this person away from you both.

, Learning that your partner has had an affair is likely cause you to experience a high level of emotional distress. You may need some time before you can talk to your partner about what happened. It is important to discuss the affair in order to move forward in your relationship, but don’t feel like you have to discuss the affair with your partner right away. Take your time and talk about it when you feel ready.If your partner pressures you to talk, say something like, “I appreciate that you want to talk, but I am just too hurt right now to talk about what happened. Please show your love for me by giving me space and time.”
It is OK to be very, very angry. You have every right to be hurt, angry, and otherwise furious. Expressing this is healthy, as it is not OK to be cheated on and your partner needs to know how his or her actions affect you. Not being honest and open about this means they do not have to face the reality of what has been done, and you may implode if you try to squelch these natural and normal feelings. If they try to avoid or blame you, this is a sign that they are not truly accepting responsibility. You can say something like, "" I want to keep the focus on your behavior.""

, Affairs often happen when healthy relationship boundaries are not respected. You have every right to make it clear what these are, even if the other person gives excuses or ""reasons"" for the affair. For example, your partner should not talk to a work friend about you or your marital issues. You and your partner can work together to compile a list of topics that are acceptable as well as topics that are not acceptable for conversations with friends and coworkers.
Friendships do not involve any sexuality. One does not kiss (except in polite greeting in certain cultures), flirt, or otherwise engage in even mild sexual behavior.
There should be no one-on-one outings with people that risks infidelity. This means no drinks with single (or even married) co-workers, for instance. This may seem harsh, but this can help re-establish trust.
Emotional intimacy belongs in the marriage. This does not mean you cannot have a best friend to confide in, but at some point it can cross the line to what is not appropriate.

, In order to reestablish trust, your partner will need to understand that they have lost your trust. For this reason, you will need to know where your partner is at all times. This may seem unfair to your partner, but it is necessary if they are committed to regaining your trust., You, as the betrayed party, get to decide your limits and what you want to know when.


One idea: schedule two 30 minute sessions each week to talk to your partner about the affair, rather than spreading the questions throughout the week.
Don’t ask your partner to reveal things that will be too hurtful for you to hear. You decide when and if you want certain information. You reserve the right to not know things as well.

, Your partner may be extremely apologetic and desperate for you to say that you forgive them, right then and there. But true forgiveness and healing will likely take time. And there is no timetable on that. The person who cheated must understand that they do not have the right to dictate when the healing happens. It is okay if you need more time to heal before you forgive your partner. To help your partner understand, let them know that you are still too hurt to forgive just yet and that you need more time.Say something like, “I appreciate your apologies and I want you to keep apologizing, but I am just not ready to forgive you yet.”
It is OK to not forgive. Cheating is a deep wound, and sometimes is fatal to a relationship. This does not necessarily mean you are not a good or nice person or otherwise not loving enough. It is OK to say you have had enough.

, Dealing with a cheating partner on your own is difficult. If it is too hard for you and your partner to work through this process on your own, seek the help of a licensed counselor who specializes in marital issues. A marriage counselor can help you to deal with your emotions and have more constructive conversations.


Keep in mind that marriage counseling will not offer an instant solution. Reestablishing trust in your relationship will take time.
Marriage or couples counseling can also help make ending the relationship smoother. Although counselors tend to try to fix relationships, they can help the individuals recognize when it is not working, and how to move forward in that direction as well. "

Notice if she shows up in places you frequent.",How to Know if Your Ex Misses You1," Tuning in to your knowledge of yourself, your ex, and your relationship is the best possible way to know how to interpret observed behavior. Think back about your relationship and how your ex communicates and deals with conflict. Is he blunt and straightforward? Then he's probably not hiding his feelings and you'll be able to tell if he misses you. Did he used to avoid you when he was mad and upset? Then his silence now probably means he's not pining for you — he's probably upset and angry and doesn't want to talk. Is he someone who lingers on things and dwells on the past? Then maybe he is thinking a lot about you. Use what you know about your ex and his personality to interpret his behavior toward you.


Keep in mind that behavioral interpretations are filtered through the observers biases and wishes (when it's a personal relationship), and thus you tend to see things that are not actually there. If your ex is big on texting and you haven't heard a word from him since your breakup, don't try to interpret that silence to mean he misses you — he'd probably be texting you if he missed you. Try to look at his behavior from a more objective perspective.;
, If your ex doesn’t miss you, she probably only contacts you if she really has to (for example, to arrange picking up her things from your house). If she does miss you, she will probably have a hard time resisting the urge to call, text, email, etc.


When your ex gets in touch with you, she may not have a specific reason. She might say something like, “Hey! I was just wondering how you’re doing.”
An exception to this might be if your ex was the one that ended the relationship, but also expressed a desire to remain friends. If this is the case, getting in touch with you could be a sign that she misses you, but she may also simply be trying to stay friends.
If your ex is constantly “drunk dialing” you, which means that she contacts you in the middle of the night after she's had a few drinks (and thus, is less inhibited) there is a pretty good chance that she has some feelings that she hasn't been able to work through.

, If he is contacting you, he probably is looking for excuses for calling so that he isn't continually contacting you for no reason. He might ask for advice or for help dealing with a problem. He might also try to steer the conversation towards deeper topics. For example, he might talk about things he wants to accomplish in his life or thoughts he's been having about the kind of life he wants to live.


When he contacts you does he “accidentally” call you by a pet name that he used when you were together? This slip of the tongue could indicate that he still thinks of you in that way.

, When, and if, you contact your ex, how quickly does she respond to your text or email? How long does it take to call you back? Although one instance of taking hours to respond doesn’t necessarily mean anything, if she consistently ignores you for hours or even days, she probably isn't missing you that much.If an ex is completely ignoring your calls and messages, avoid sending more messages or calling again. If you’re missing her, this can be very hard to do; however, imposing a rule on yourself that you won’t get in touch with her will help you move on.

, If you do end up in the same place as your ex, notice his body language around you. If your ex is avoiding eye contact, has his arms or legs crossed, and isn’t smiling, he probably isn't very happy to be around you.Although body language is a great indicator of how a person is feeling in that moment, it won’t tell you everything. For example, your ex may miss you terribly, but acts like he wants to have nothing do with you in your presence. This may be because he is afraid of being hurt again.
Try to observe his body language and combine it with the other information you have. For example, if your ex’s body language is suggesting that he doesn't want to be around you, but he is calling you every day, then it may be that he does miss you, but he is feeling defensive in your presence.

, If your ex randomly drops by your work, or shows up at a place that she knows you frequent, it probably wasn’t an accident.If you have mutual friends, she might find out where you will be and “coincidentally” be there too.


If your ex does show up somewhere that you are, don’t forget to observe her body language. Does she keep glancing in your direction? If so, she is probably trying to observe your behavior, too.

Encourage your partner to be more open with you.,
Be considerate of each other’s needs.,
Appreciate each other.,
Ask your partner to commit to change.,
Establish consequences to deal with the possibility of another affair.,
Know when to end the relationship.",How to Handle a Cheating Partner2," Sharing more of your emotions with your partner and encouraging your partner to do the same with you will help strengthen your bond. Make it a habit to confide in each other every day. Some opening questions for confiding in your partner include:


“Remember when we used to go walking and talking around the neighborhood, walking the dogs together? Let’s do that tonight… How about it?”
“What happened yesterday between us didn’t go so well, and I want to try another way — can we start over, and this time I will take some deep breaths and listen more patiently. I also want to say what works better for me and find out what you are hoping for.”

, In order to move forward in your relationship, you will both need to learn how to understand each other’s needs. The best way to uncover what your partner needs, and let them know what you need, is to talk about it.


If you are not sure what your spouse wants or needs, the best way to find out is to ask questions and listen. If you still are not sure, ask more questions. For example, you could say something like, “I think that what you need from me is ________. Is that what you mean?”, Showing appreciation through sincere compliments is an important part of a healthy relationship. Make sure that you and your partner are aware of the importance of complimenting each other and that you both know how to do it well. Good compliments should not only be sincere and specific, they should also be phrased as an “I” statement rather than as a “you” statement.For example, if your partner cleans the kitchen, don’t say “You did a nice job of cleaning the kitchen.” Instead, say ""I appreciate that you cleaned the kitchen.” Using I instead of you lets your partner know how you feel, not just that you noticed.

, If you decide that you are ready to move forward in your relationship with your partner, you should ask your partner to promise you that they will not follow the same pattern of behavior that led to the affair. Ask your partner to articulate or even write out what that behavior includes and commit to change., Since there is a possibility that your partner may cheat again, you should work together to establish consequences for another affair. These consequences may include things like divorce or other repercussions. You may want to get these consequences in writing and work with a lawyer to make them legally binding., If things don’t improve despite all of your best efforts and the help of marriage counseling, you may have to accept that the relationship cannot be repaired. Signs that the relationship may be beyond repair include:Constant fighting
Inability to connect with your partner
Inability to empathize with or receive empathy from your partner
Hurt and anger that does not subside with time
Inability to forgive your partner

Browse his social media.,
Notice how she acts around you in social situations.,
Talk to mutual friends.",How to Know if Your Ex Misses You2," If you are still friends on social media, observe his postings and interactions carefully. Is he posting lots of vague and/or sad posts (sad songs about lost love, etc.)? Is he commenting on old pictures of the two of you or “liking” them? If so, it may be a sign that he is having a hard time dealing with the break up.


Remember though that social media is not always an accurate depiction of what’s going on in someone’s life. Even someone who posts lots of pictures looking like he has the perfect life could be dealing with major emotional issues.
Don’t go overboard with browsing social media. Respect the privacy of your ex, and limit yourself to checking once each day, at the most.

, If you and your ex still hang out in a group of mutual friends, carefully (but discreetly) observe how she behaves when you are in a group of friends together. If your ex seems agitated when hanging out with you in a group, and tries to avoid interacting with you, it might be because they she is still dealing with lingering feelings.Be careful though. Your ex may still be dealing with old feelings, but that doesn’t necessarily mean she is missing you. For example, she may be very angry at you because you really hurt her with your actions. Try to keep your judgements about her behavior within the context of your breakup and past interactions.
Take note if your ex constantly glances at you even when interacting with other people. This could mean that she is interested in observing your behavior to see how you’re feeling, too.

, If you have mutual friends that you trust to keep quiet about your investigating, ask them if your ex has mentioned anything about you. Your mutual friends will probably be able to give you great insight into how your ex is doing.


If you have mutual friends, but are afraid they’ll tell your ex you asked about him, you can try asking very casually. For example, instead of being really direct, you could say something like, “I was just wondering how is doing? I know he had a big exam coming up, and I hope it went well.” They may still catch on, but it won’t be as obvious as saying, “Has said anything about me?”
Avoid constantly hassling your mutual friends about the topic, though. It’s OK to bring it up once or twice, but if you bring it up all the time, they will probably get annoyed.
If your mutual friends say something like, “I’m sorry, but I really don’t want to get involved in the situation” then respect their wishes. This doesn’t mean they don’t care about you; it means that they care about both and don’t want to get dragged into a “he-said-she-said” scenario or choose sides.

Decide whether or not this is a good idea.,
Get in touch with her.,
Keep it light.,
Wait for the right moment.,
Be honest.,
Decide what to do next.",How to Know if Your Ex Misses You3," The easiest and most direct way to find out whether or not your ex misses you is to ask him. Unfortunately, for most people, this is also the most intimidating way; however, simply talking with him is likely the quickest way to figuring out what's going on.


Be aware that, depending on the person, some people may not be honest about their feelings, especially if they are afraid that you are trying to hurt them.
If you and your ex aren’t able to communicate without getting into a big fight, meeting up to try and have conversation about a topic like this may not be the best idea.
Asking your ex outright seems scary, but it can save you a lot of confusion in the long-term — instead of spending time trying to interpret his silence or what, exactly, his use of that smiley emoji meant, you'll know flat-out if he wants to get back together. If he doesn't then you can begin the work of letting go and moving on and not waste your time on someone who no longer wants to date you.

, You can contact her via text or email, but the fastest way is probably just to call her. Keep your conversation as light and friendly as possible. Ask her if they’d like to meet up for lunch or coffee because you want to talk about something with her.


Understand that she might refuse. If she does refuse to see you it’s a good sign that she doesn't miss you, or if she does, she isn't ready to see you yet. Try not to get angry. Instead, be respectful of her wishes.

, If this is the first time you are seeing each other since the break up the situation will probably feel a bit awkward. Take the initiative and try to keep the situation as light as possible. Ask him how things are going for him (e.g. with school or work), and let him know a few things that are going on in your life.Try to keep the conversation on light things and don’t just jump straight into talking about your relationship. This will help lighten the mood, and let him know that you aren’t trying to start a fight.

, If you are at a restaurant or cafe, and are ordering food and/or drinks, it might be a good idea to wait until you have gotten your order to bring up the reason you wanted to meet. This will ensure that you aren’t interrupted continually by the staff wanting to take your order, bring you your food, etc.If you are ordering drinks, avoid alcoholic beverages (if it is relevant for you). Though you might think having a few drinks would help you relax it may also lead you to saying things you didn’t want to say or you might get emotional.

, Although it might be scary, at some point, you will need to bring up the reason for meeting. Start by saying that you appreciate him meeting with you, and that you’d like to talk about some things that have been on your mind. If you still have feelings for him, then be honest about it.If you miss him, telling him the truth about your feelings may make you more vulnerable, but it may also mean he is more likely to open up about his feelings for you.
For example, you could say, “The truth is, I’ve been thinking about you a lot. I know we broke up, and I respect your feelings, but I’d like to find out how you’re feeling about me.”
You could potentially do this over the phone or over text, but having a conversation in person will allow you to observe his body language and facial expressions.

, If it turns out your ex misses you, and you miss her too, then it’s time to decide what to do about those feelings. Try to have an objective conversation about the reasons you broke up, and whether or not it’s worth giving it another try.If it turns out she doesn't miss you, then you know you can move on with your life. Don’t try to make her feel things that she doesn't.
Although it is very difficult, try to think rationally about whether giving it a second try is a good idea. You may discover you both miss each other, but getting back together still isn't a good idea. For example, if you fought constantly about basic values (e.g. religion or ideas about how you should live your life) giving it another go probably won’t end any differently.

Protect yourself throughout this process.",How to Apologize For Cheating on Your Partner," The first thing to understand is that cheating often signifies that there is something wrong, or missing with the person who cheated. The goal is to find out what that problem is, so once you and your partner overcome the initial shock of your actions, you can decide how to best address the problem. Consider the following questions:


Are you feeling insecure or unattractive?Do you feel that something is missing in your relationship?Are you satisfied with your sex life?Are you (or were you, at the time of the infidelity) particularly stressed about some aspect of your life?
Even if it's the first time you've cheated, have you thought about it or wanted to cheat for some time now?;
, Based upon your self-assessment from the previous step, you need to give serious thought to whether or not you really are committed to staying with your partner.


You hurt your partner, and thus your partner deserves your apology, even if you will eventually decide to go separate ways.
If you decide to stay together and try to move past this betrayal, the road will not necessarily be smooth, so you shouldn't be willing to put your partner through that if you aren't fully committed.

, To help you figure out if you are interested in continuing your relationship, consider writing down your reasons: why do you want to stay together?


Try to be as specific as possible. Hopefully you do still love your partner—that should definitely go on the list—but it's fairly vague. What do you love about him/her? What do you enjoy about your relationship? How do you see your future together?

, Obviously you cheated, and you're going to have to apologize for that. However, you need to let your partner know that you fully understand how and in what ways you hurt them. Be ready to express the specific ways in which you damaged your relationship.


You didn't just cheat: you betrayed your partner's trust, you destroyed their idea of your relationship, you (perhaps) embarrassed your partner, and you possibly put your partner at risk for STDs., You may be tempted to humble yourself publicly when apologizing to your partner. For example, you may think that your partner will be touched by your willingness to open yourself up to embarrassment and judgment by posting a long apology on your Facebook wall. All this does, though, is place the focus on you and make your private business public.


You should even think twice about doing things like sending bouquets of flowers or apology presents to your partner's workplace. This will only draw attention from his/her coworkers—they will want to know what the occasion is—and your partner may not want to discuss your relationship problems at that time and place and with those people.

, It's important that you understand why you cheated, but an explanation is not the same thing as a justification.


Even if there are underlying problems in your relationship (for which you both may be responsible), you alone are responsible for cheating. Your goal in this discussion is to make sure your partner hears you acknowledge your mistake.

, You're not fully accepting responsibility if you frame your language by saying “I'm sorry if I hurt you,” or “If you hadn't turned me down so often I wouldn't have looked for a sexual outlet”. This sort of language will make your partner feel as though you are trying to shift the blame away from you.Instead of saying “I'm sorry if I hurt you,” acknowledge the fact that you are the direct cause of your partner's suffering: “My actions hurts you, and for that I'm very sorry.”

, Whether your partner caught you in the act, uncovered the evidence of your affair, or whether you confessed, s/he will most likely have a lot of questions for you.


Your partner may want to know the details of your affair: how you met, how often you were together, why you decided to stray, whether or not you love the other person, etc.
If you shut down now and refuse to answer your partner's questions, you are creating a wedge between the two of you. This will lead to further distrust and hurts your ability to communicate openly and honestly with one another.

, You need to avoid offering vague, elusive answers, but there's no reason for you to go into explicit detail about your hook-ups. For example, if you are asked what you found attractive about your lover, don't respond, “Well, Sam has the body of a model and the most piercing blue eyes I've seen”.


If your partner continues to press for details, you should be honest, but careful in how you phrase your answer: “I found Sam attractive, but that doesn't justify my transgression.”
You should certainly avoid comparing your partner to your lover when you answer your partner's questions. Don't say, “Sam is so much more open and giving than you”. This will only hurt your partner and of course deflects responsibility away from you.

, Even if your partner has known about your affair for some time before you make this formal apology, you should not expect (or demand) that the conversation be calm and rational. Emotions can be unpredictable, and you cannot dictate how your partner ought to feel about or respond to your apology.


If things get too emotional, you may need to give your partner some time and space to process before you attempt to finish offering your apology.

, Because you hurt your partner, you owe them an apology regardless of whether or not they decide to stay with you or not.


You shouldn't decide to apologize only if they are willing to forgive you or take you back. Your apology is not sincere if there are conditions upon it., You deeply regret what you've done, and you may think if you can make your partner see how sorry you are and how much you are hurting, they will take you back. This is only natural, but you can't go into this thinking that so long as you do everything right when you apologize, that things will work out well.


You can't control whether your partner will be able to forgive you, and even if they can, they may not be able to trust you again.

, While you are not making your apology contingent upon your partner taking you back, it's perfectly fine for you to let your partner know that you hope to be forgiven or that you want the relationship to survive.


For example, try something like the following: “Pat, I know that my actions hurt you deeply and that I've damaged your ability to trust. For that I am so sorry. I hope that you'll eventually be able to forgive me, and I'm committed to working hard for as long as it takes to restore your faith in me. But even if you can't commit to that, I hope you can believe just how sorry and regretful I am.”

, It's possible that after you've apologized to your partner, they will not want to speak with you at all, and if that's the case, you will need to respect their wishes. However, this apology isn't all about you—it is about and for your partner. If your partner wants or need to vent and express his/her feelings, then let them.


Make it clear to your partner that you hear them, and that you understand the extent to which you've hurt them. Do not interrupt your partner while they are speaking in order to try to justify or explain your actions

, Cheating on your partner was hurtful and disrespectful, and you are now trying to make amends. Listening fully and attentively to your partner is one way to demonstrate respect towards them. However, while it's very important that you allow your partner to be heard, you should not tolerate abuse from your partner.


Even though you were in the wrong to cheat, nothing justifies abuse, so be prepared to leave if your partner becomes violent or verbally or emotionally abusive.
If your discussions become too heated, try responding in the following way: “I understand why you are angry, but your language right now is not acceptable. Let's talk later –maybe it would help if we went to counseling together.”

, Obviously both you and your partner have been affected by your infidelity. Don't forget, though, that you've brought another person into your lives when you cheated. For your relationship to have any chance of lasting, your partner cannot fear that you will cheat again—with anyone, but specifically with this person.


Your partner may want to be involved with this step, for they may want the reassurance that you've really ended things.
You need to contact the other person, explain that your actions were wrong, and be clear that you will not continue to see them romantically.
Whatever you do, do not promise your partner not to see your lover again but sneak off to see them, even if only to say goodbye. You must be sincere when you vow to cut off ties.

, It may not be possible to completely cut off ties with your lover if you cheated with a colleague or someone you absolutely cannot avoid. If that's the case, then you need to have a plan about how and when you will interact with your ex-lover.


Limit the contact you have with your ex-lover to the fullest extent possible. You may need to communicate professionally at business meetings, but you do not need to eat lunch together.
Be sure to offer your partner reassurances that the relationship will never again be inappropriate.

, There isn't going to be any way you can put a band-aid on this situation. In order to fix it, you're going to have to reprove your love, which means dealing with your partner's lack of trust in you over a long period of time. This may mean that you need to consent to having less privacy, and you need to be willing to share the details of your day with your partner.


For example, your partner may want to have access to your social media sites, phone, and email. Consider granting them this access; if you don't, your partner will think that you are hiding something. If you aren't willing to make this concession, then you should reconsider whether or not the relationship is worth saving (or consider whether or not it can still survive).

, Quite understandably, your partner may have trust issues for quite some time. If you're just a few minutes late getting home, it may seem like no big deal to you, but remember that you are starting from scratch. You need to be fully reliable.


If you say that you'll be home by 11:00, then be home by 11:00, not 11:15.
Similarly, be willing to contact your partner if you're going to be late or if plans change, and if at all possible, be willing to come home early if your partner requests that.

, If your partner decides to give you another chance, you can't expect things to go back to the way they were. You are essentially starting over, and creating a new relationship together. You and your partner have both been changed by this experience, and you will have to learn to adapt to that.

, You cannot control how long it will take for your partner to be able to forgive you and move past your betrayal. Indeed, things may go well for a time, and then your partner may unexpectedly be angry and mistrustful again. If you try to move forward too quickly and demand that things go back to normal in a short period of time, your partner will not feel respected.If it is worth it to you to try to save the relationship, then you must be prepared to allow your partner to grieve on his or her own time-line, and you must also be willing to suffer set-backs.
You cannot control how long it will take for your partner to get over his or her anger and hurt, but you can control yourself: you can be consistent and reliable, and thus will demonstrate your remorse and commitment to your partner.

, It's not absolutely necessary that you and your partner seek professional help in order for your relationship to survive this infidelity. However, there's very little chance that your relationship will be hurt as a result of going to counseling, and there's an even greater chance that your relationship will improve because of counseling. Thus, you don't have much to lose.


As a neutral (and expert) third-party, a counselor or therapist can provide a safe space for both you and your partner to express yourselves, examine your relationship, help you come up with a specific game-plan, and assess your progress.
By offering to go to counseling, you also send the message to your partner that you are fully committed to repairing the damage you've done and doing what you can to earn your partner's trust back.

, Of course, if you do go to counseling, you must be fully engaged in the process. It's not enough to just show up at the therapist's office once or twice a week but expect your partner to do all the talking.


Answer your therapist's and partner's questions fully and honestly, and give any proposed exercises or relationship homework your honest effort.

, Even though you have done the hard work of admitting your mistake and working to save your relationship—which may require you to give up a certain amount of your freedom and privacy—be careful not to make concessions that fundamentally change who you are or violate your integrity.


If you feel that you are losing yourself in the process of making it up to your partner, or if you feel abused, it's time for you to reassess the relationship.
You may need to accept that it's time to move on, or if you haven't already, seek professional help.

It could be a coworker, a classmate, or just about anyone else in her life. And if she's suddenly putting a lot more time into her hair and makeup when she says she's just headed to the grocery store or to grab coffee with a friend, then something may be up.


If she's suddenly spent more time at the gym and is much more interested in getting in shape, she may be doing it for another guy.
Just to be clear -- she may also just start caring about her appearance because she wants to look nicer and be more in shape. But this point, coupled with others, can be a sign of cheating.;
, She might have loved going to your aunt's monthly barbecues, but when the last three rolled around, she was suddenly booked. Maybe she went shopping with your kid sister all the time before, but they haven't spoken in weeks. And as for hanging out with your parents? She might have been friendly and outgoing before, but when she's with them, she's suddenly quiet or just looks ready to leave.


If she's cheating, then seeing your family will be a reminder of her disloyalty, and she'll naturally want to avoid them.
If she starts withdrawing from your family, it may also just be a sign that she's ready to end the relationship, whether she's cheating or not.

, The same goes for your friends -- though she might have previously loved group trips to the beach or to trivia night with your friends, if she suddenly never wants to hang out with them, then it may be because she's trying to extricate herself from you. If she's cheating on you, then she may feel like she doesn't deserve to be in your social circle, or she doesn't want a reminder of how much fun you used to have before things went sour.


If this becomes really obvious, don't be afraid to ask her why. She could have another explanation for why she doesn't want to spend time with your friends.
And when she does hang out with you and your friends and their behavior seems to change and they act all uncomfortable around her, then they may know something that you don't. This is a classic sign that your girlfriend is cheating on you and you are the last to know.

, While cheating men are more likely to have sex even more with their cheating partner, it's less likely for a cheating woman to react the same way. If she's getting some love somewhere else, then she may feel guilty, or just plain not interested, in sleeping with you. If you previously had a pretty good sex routine going, and now she's been ""too tired"" or ""not feeling well"" the last ten times you tried to make something happen, it could be a sign that she's getting satisfied elsewhere.


If she's cheating on you, she'll also be less open with her body. She won't want you to see her undress, and she'll be more likely to cover up in bed.
Of course, her not wanting to have sex could just be a sign of her general dissatisfaction with the relationship, or just her unhappiness in her own life. Still, if she's flirty and fun when when she leaves the house, and completely withdrawn with you, it's a problem.

, Common wisdom holds that unfaithful partners will become withdrawn or distant. For some this may be true, but for many others an affair can spark renewed romantic interest in their relationship. Consider whether your partner’s levels of affection have changed dramatically in either direction.Increased affection can sometimes be accompanied by new moves in the bedroom. If your partner is suddenly pulling out new tricks, this may be an indicator that she is learning them somewhere else.
Once this happens, it's time to get some answers. There's no point in continuing on if she truly seems to have stopped caring.

, Were Sundays your brunch and cuddling days, and now she's nowhere to be found on the weekends? Did you watch your favorite TV show together every Tuesday, and now see that she's MIA on those nights? Does she not even apologize or notice that you're no longer doing your usual things together? If she's suddenly slammed at work, and spending a lot more time with friends, and spending a lot more time at the gym, then this may be a sign that another man is really eating up her time.


Notice how she acts when she steps out of the house to ""go meet friends."" Does she look extra sexy, hum to herself, or just act unnaturally giddy? If so, it may be because she's meeting a special someone.

, Previously, she showed you her computer to point out a funny article or asked you to check her texts for her and always left her phone out in the open. Now, she shuts her laptop any time you come into the room, never sends text messages in front of you, and even added a password to her phone -- or even her computer. If she wasn't previously private and has changed her tune, then she must not want you to see who she's been chatting with.


If you're really feeling bold and catch her texting, you can casually ask her who she's talking to. See how she reacts. Is she jumpy and defensive, or does she give a quick and honest-sounding answer?

, This is one of the biggest red flags that your woman is being unfaithful. If you call her or text her and hear nothing back for several hours, then you may have a problem. If it happens once or twice, fine. But if it's happened multiple times a week and she always said her phone died or that she didn't hear the ring, your guard should be up.


When she's MIA for a few hours, casually ask her what she's been up to. Try to read her face: does she deflect you and look embarrassed?

, Has a new coworker or classmate's name come up once or twice recently? Has it come up -- a lot? If so, then this may be the mystery man you're afraid of. Try asking some basic questions about this person. If she blushes or gets defensive, it may be because she doesn't want you to know anything about the man she's seeing.


Try to notice her tone or the look on her face when this person comes up. Does she look excited and giddy -- or just guilty? If so, she may be cheating.

, Though she may have a lot of reasons for nagging you, one of them may be that she no longer finds you so alluring and that the relationship is on the rocks. She could also be feeling guilty for betraying you, and can be using her nagging to justify her behavior. If she points out every little thing you've done wrong, then she may be doing it to feel better about acting badly.


Again, this could just be a sign that she's unhappy in the relationship. Still, it's not a good sign.
Of course, if your behavior has changed, then maybe she has a reason for nagging you more.

, If she used to tell you things like, ""I'm grabbing coffee with Katie -- I'll be home in two hours,"" and now rushes off without barely acknowledging where she's going, then something may be up. If you no longer know what she's up to for hours at a time and she's shady when you ask about it, then she may be spending that time with someone else.


If she tells you she did one thing and then later says she was doing something else entirely, then you've caught her in a lie.

, You may think that this is a sign that she really cares about you, but it could be her way of making sure you don't catch her cheating. If she asks you to be clear about when you're getting home and even texts you asking, she may not be eagerly waiting for your arrival. She could also be asking to make sure that you won't be hanging out anywhere near the place where she'll be having her romantic rendezvous.


If you want to try to catch her, tell her you won't be going to a popular spot in town -- like the go-to happy hour bar, for example, and change your mind at the last minute and show up there.

, Though this is a major breach of trust, if you've reached the point of desperation but are too scared to ask, then try to follow her to see if she's doing what she says she's doing. You don't have to drive off after her car like a creep, but you could try to drop by the locations where she says she's going to be to see if her word is good. Here are some things you can do:


If she says she's having a late night at work, show up with take-out to see how she's feeling. If she's not there, she's in trouble.
If she says she's going out to a bar or restaurant with her girlfriends and it's not too sketchy for you to be nearby, try walking by an hour or so into the meeting to see if she's really there. Think of a good excuse to be in the area.

, If she says she'll be ready for you to come over in thirty minutes, show up right away. Say you just couldn't wait to see her. Is she dying to jump in the shower, or to cover up the evidence of another man? Does she not let you come into her bedroom -- or worse, does she not let you come over at all? This is a huge red flag and a perfect way to catch her in a lie if that's really how you want to go about it.


When you get there, play dumb. Just say you wanted to surprise her, or that you misread her text or something, and don't act like anything is up.

, Again, this is another stellar way to lose her trust forever. But if you're getting desperate, check out her computer or phone if you can, to see if you can access her email or past texts. If she's deleted all of her past texts and emails, then that's a little bit suspicious too. Really, this is a pretty terrible way to go about it, but it is one way to know if she's really cheating or not.

, Tell her you have something on your mind, and ask if she has time to talk in a private space. Don't accuse her (such as, ""I know you're cheating!""), but do express your feelings (like ""I feel like you're losing interest in our relationship"").


Notice whether or not she gives you an answer. If she isn't cheating, she has no reason not to be straightforward and reassure you that everything is fine. If she is, she might talk in circles without really saying anything.
If she becomes defensive or tries to turn the tables on you, this might be her guilt talking.

, Sometimes, you just know things without having to second-guess yourself. No amount of crying and denial can rival the feelings you have in the pit of your stomach. After you've taken all the evidence into consideration, it's time to follow your intuition.

, If you believe your girlfriend is cheating, let her know directly what you think and why. Be prepared to have an open and honest conversation with your partner, rather than simply accusing them or getting into an argument.Ask your partner directly, “Are you involved with someone else?” Do not make accusatory statements. Allow them to answer.
Know that this will be a serious blow to the trust in your relationship. Be prepared for the possibility that your partner isn’t cheating and that you will have to work to rebuild trust.

, Let your partner know exactly what led you to believe that she is cheating on you. Discuss behaviors, communication patterns, levels of engagement, and any physical evidence you may have found.

Remember to keep this a discussion. Allow your partner time to talk and explain themselves, and listen to them with an open mind.

, Once you and your girlfriend have had an honest discussion about your concerns, you need to make a decision. If she confesses to cheating, do you want to try to save your relationship? If she says she is faithful, are you willing to accept her answer or is it time to move on?If your partner says she’s not cheating, do not push further or try to incite a fight. Decide whether you want to accept this answer and start to rebuild trust or if the relationship is too much for you to handle emotionally.

Identify the symptoms of your love-sickness.,
Realize that all these feelings have a source in grief and anger.,
Maintain a nutritious diet.,
Be kind to your body.,
Sleep well.,
Work through your clutter.,
Think positive.,
Get productive.,
Draw strength from your faith.,
Get out and spend time with other people.,
Use writing to move beyond your love-sickness.",How to Get Over Being Lovesick," The following signs might indicate a case of love-sickness:You feel physically sick, such as having a pit in your stomach, finding it hard to breathe normally, or aching somewhere; headaches and diarrhea or other bowel problems are also possible
You may feel nauseous, and have a desire to throw up from the stress
Your appetite changes, either losing it or finding it much increased
You feel exhausted and lethargic all of the time
You can't communicate very well with others, or you don't want to speak much, either about your love-sickness or anything at all
You cry a lot, either all the time or in on-and-off stages, perhaps easily set off by sentimental occasions
You feel anxious, maybe even experiencing panic attacks
You might have flu-like symptoms without being sick with flu.;
, You feel as if something is lost from or missing in your life and it's a truly deep hole. If you've just broken up with someone, you're likely to be going through the stages of grieving but even those who are lovesick from loneliness or fear of being left behind can also feel a sense of grief at not experiencing what others seem to have. Grief consists of shock at the change in your situation, denial of what has or is happening, emotional pain, anger, bargaining, and then acceptance.In the case of the situation where your loved one lives away from you for work or study reasons, your anger is similar to that of a person with a broken heart because you feel alone, unable to reconnect when it matters, and exposed to seeing happy couples together around you all of the time.


Note too that these symptoms can mirror depression but depression tends to involve more intense emotional and psychological responses, such as a feeling of hopelessness, lack of enthusiasm for anything, feeling that you and/or your life is worthless, or even feelings of suicide.If you do experience any of these latter emotions and psychological responses, see your doctor straight away for diagnosis and good outside help.

, While it might be tempting to munch on fast food and snack foods, your body needs good, wholesome sustenance right now to help you think straight and to stay strong. If you are not in good physical condition, your love-sickness might lead to physical illness because your immune system is inadequately nourished. Eat healthy foods and why not try new dishes from a cookbook you've fancied trying out for a while. You can discover all sorts of new tastes and delights as part of your healthy eating, which will serve as an enjoyable distraction.



Drink lots of water, mineral (sparkling) or still. Keeping hydrated is important while you have a lot of thinking to do.
Avoid drowning your sorrows in alcohol or drugs. The after-effects will be painful and using these to put off thinking your way through the love-sickness won't help but will simply prolong the pain.
Little amounts of dark chocolate and treats are permissible. There's no need to prevent yourself from having a few delicious treats now and then!

, This isn't the time to be slouching on the couch, bemoaning your fate and feeling sorry for yourself by tucking into tub after tub of ice cream during Sex and the City reruns. If you're already part of an exercise group, sporting activity, or other physical exercise, be sure to keep it up. If not, or if you'd like to rev it up and make a change, choose something new to be your physical activity. Choose something like yoga, Pilates, cycling, a team sport, gym workouts, martial arts, etc. If it's new, so much the better because you'll be both mentally and physically challenged by something that needs your full attention to get it right.


At the very least, take a 20 minute walk around your neighborhood daily. Take your dog or someone else's for a walk if you're lonely, or ring up a friend or neighbor and ask to go walking with them.

, Love-sickness can bring on anxious thoughts and worries that can keep you up late if you let them. Don't. Instead, maintain a very regular sleeping routine by going to bed at the same time every night and waking up the same time every morning. Clear out distractions from the bedroom such as the TV and computer but allow yourself a few books and magazines for night-time reading just before falling asleep. Ensure that the room is just the right temperature for you (not too hot, not too cold) and have delicious bed covers that make you want to snuggle into them. Sleep hygiene is a very important part of staying healthy and whole.

, If you've just broken up with someone, it's possible you've got some of their stuff to return or to bin. Go through it and get it out of your life now. And even if your love-sickness is related more to loneliness and feeling left behind, it's possible there's a lot of romantic clutter in your life that needs a clean sweep. Donate the romance novels to the local charity, start using your treasures you've been saving for sharing with a companion and enjoy them for yourself, and clean out the romance DVDs. If you're lovesick because your lover works or studies far away, do a proactive clutter clean by putting their mementos into a memory box or album, and by tidying up their things neatly and out of the way while they're gone.


Put away all photos that bring back the memories (unless you're with a long-distance lover). Moping over the images of the guy or girl who has long departed your life is unhealthy and won't do a thing to bring back what has gone. Keeping it has the power to make you feel rotten!
Clear out your online clutter too. Delete the former lover's emails, updates, photos, etc., that bring on your love-sickness.

, You don't need to wake up and pretend everything's rosy but it does help to start seeing your life in a more accepting and positive way. So, you're alone right now, but why does this need to be a negative thing? Think of all the good things you do have – your space, freedom to come and go as you please, no arguments about who gets to watch what on TV, no hogging the bed quilt, no budget blowouts from a partner's secret spending, etc. Think of all the good things you are – a great person who thrives as an individual as much as someone in a couple relationship, an individual with integrity and self-responsibility, and a person who can run their own life without being needy. These are all tremendously good things!


If you have a lover living or working far away, look up at the sky, day or night. And think about how the two of you see the same sky, the same stars and moon. You're not in separate worlds; some day you will be back together again, when the time is right.

, Love-sickness implies mooching about, and where there's mooching, there's very little productivity. What are the things in your life that aren't getting attended to while you're wallowing in love-sickness? Write a list of what you'd like to get done and achieve and start planning how you'll work on each goal. Start small but at least start!


Work through the backlog of little things you've been neglecting for a time. Congratulate yourself when every small thing is achieved and reward yourself when items are ticked off the list as ""done"". Rewards can be as small as a magazine or a walk to the park, or they can be as large as treating yourself to a meal out or seeing a theater show.

, If you have a belief in a higher power or in a spiritual path, draw on your faith or spirituality as a source of inspiration for improving yourself and unburdening your love-sickness.


Use meditation or prayer as a source of self-calming. Inner peace will give you the space you need to reflect on your emotions and feelings and to question the utility of your feelings of love-sickness. Inner peace also provides the space needed to start working out your own solutions.

, You don't need to ""meet"" people for the purpose of dating. Simply being around other people doing activities such as sport, exercise, hobbies, visiting the library, attending workshops, going shopping, etc., is an important part of connecting with other human beings and may well fill some of your understandable neediness for company. As social beings, our cravings for being around others is normal, so if a large part of your love-sickness derives from being alone, reach out and connect with others.


Connect with your family if you haven't seen them for a while.
Don't push for intimate relationships. It is best to simply be around people, just being yourself, than to treat every meeting with others as a potential hunting ground for a possible date. Just allow things to flow as they will.

, Use a journal to work through your feelings about love, breakups, and the future you'd like to have. In writing it all out, you'll find it easier to assemble the pieces together that really matter to you and to discard the things that are no longer relevant.


For the person whose love lives a long way away, use emails and even snail mail to stay in touch and occasionally surprise one another with a poem, a love letter, a special token of love, etc.

It might hurt you to do this, but leaving yourself the option to call your ex in emotionally weak moments can be indicative of dependent behavior.It may also be wise for you to block your ex's number/email, to prevent any unwanted surprise contact.;
, Discard all of the special items that remind you of this person. Get rid of the things that remind you of your love. Some articles that can make a breakup especially difficult: clothing, jewelry, photographs, and gifts.


You don't have to throw everything away, but you may need time away from these items before you can fully move on. Why not box up any items that remind you of your ex and put them somewhere out of sight and mind?

, When your anniversary rolls around, or when there's a holiday that reminds you of your ex, make plans with other friends to take you mind off times you shared with your one-time lover. Did you and your ex watch movies every Monday? Call up a friend and make sure you have replacement plans for Monday night while you readjust to single life.Organize a party, outing, or dinner among friends to fill a lonely night with laughter and good times.

, Seeing your ex gallivant around with someone new might make your heart ache and complicate moving on. Even if you have hopes of maintaining a friendship with this person down the road, understand that you may need time and space before you allow your ex back into your life., Some people find writing a goodbye letter, where you can summarize all your feelings and the hopes you had for the relationship, to be a useful tool to aid the healing process. You don't have to show them the letter, but the simple act of writing your feelings down on paper can bring you closure you need.Another technique you may find beneficial is confessing your feelings to this person in your head. The simple act of releasing bottled emotions can speed the healing process."

Join a group.,
Learn to distinguish between the imagined and the actual.,
Hold no resentment.,
Use your logic to beat the blues.,
Keep the faith.",How to Forget the Love of Your Life2," These words might be difficult for you to swallow, and maybe even sound insensitive. Breaking up is tough, even if you're the one that left the relationship. But it's important to acknowledge that life goes on and that the pain you are feeling is a natural part of the human heartbreak and the healing process.


Each person takes a different amount of time to process strong emotions. Respect the time you may need to process this emotional change.
Though healing is an individual process, some studies assert it may take you up to 11 weeks before you finally feel free of the potent emotions associated with your romance., Even if you aren't particularly talented at it, the distraction provided by something new will help you turn your thoughts from your ex. Now that you're out of that relationship, it's time for you to rediscover what makes you happy and do it!Exercise and enjoy associated mood boosting benefits.

Use art as therapy, which may be especially helpful if you are still uncomfortable expressing your feelings in words.Raise a pet or a plant, as having a living thing depend on you can lessen your feelings of depression., You can volunteer in the community, participate in a book club at your local library, or enlist in an intramural sports league. The camaraderie of a new group can be a source of strength through a hard breakup. Some groups or group activities to consider:Community gardening groups
Community clean-up
Local sports teams
Tabletop gaming groups

, Sometimes, post breakup, it can be easy for you to only think of your past lover in a way that is more perfect than is possible. Try to identify where you've allowed yourself to believe something unrealistic, like when you tell yourself that you'll never find love again.


Think about your ex in terms of the positive, past tense feelings you used to have. Separating what was from what is can change your negative feelings for the better., Despite everything that's happened, bring yourself to truly forgive your ex. If possible, go up to the person and tell him/her that you have been deeply hurt, but you forgive them for any negatives, both those perceived and real.This will help you to let go, and relieve you from the cycle of negative emotions so common in breakups., If your ex wasn't the best partner, getting over the breakup should be easier. Even though you might be hesitant to tarnish the good memories you hold precious, it can help you to focus on the healthier place you are in. In what ways can you now grow now that you are out of your relationship? Looking toward these can go a long way toward helping you feel better.


In the event your ex is genuinely a good person, be happy that you had the opportunity to meet. Remember that everyone that comes into our lives can be a potential teacher.

, It's easy to become bitter or fall into negative patterns, but remember, that will not make you happier. Allowing yourself to feel your feelings does not mean becoming a slave to them. Reexamine your personal philosophy. Are you the sort of person who gives in to negativity? Will you allow your ex to exert this emotional control over you even after your breakup? Recognize your own emotional responsibility in the matter; you won't be able to blame your ex for your heartbreak forever."

Refrain from talking about your ex-love.,
Surround yourself with positivity.,
Talk to an expert or trusted adult in serious cases.",How to Forget the Love of Your Life3," Remember that there is always love to give and there is much we can do to enrich our lives. Talk yourself through where you were before the relationship and the ways in which you've grown throughout your time together. The powerful connection between learning and memory and the mood benefits you'll receive from acquiring new knowledge will assist you in getting over your lost love.Ask yourself:


What would I never have done before this relationship that through this relationship I could accomplish?
What were some strengths of my ex-partner? Did I learn from these or develop these in myself?
What did we accomplish together that I could never have accomplished by myself?

, You've probably had to put some goals on hold, prioritizing your past relationship over your personal desires. Once you are done with the list, you will not only see how much life has to offer, you will also have some goals to work toward in the near future.Contemplate trips you could afford on your own but not as a couple; now might be the right time to book a trip!
Enroll in a class that you didn't have time or energy for while in your relationship.
Try a challenge, such as entering a local chili cooking competition or a photography contest.

, You don't need money to walk down your street, look at the sky, enjoy a book or sunrise, or other simple pleasures that life has to offer us.Also, a change of scenery can have a powerful impact on your mindset; the first step you take on your walk may be the first step toward a better mental state., Or go out with the goal of making friends. In any case, the happiness of your friend-group could positively influence your own mood.A good way to meet like minded people is to join a club related to your interests. Studies have shown that being with friends and people of a similar mind can:


Calm you
Increase your sense of belonging
Increase perceived self worth
Assist in overcoming challenges, This can turn into a sore point among your friends, who might find your repeated laments too negative to be around. Take some time to acknowledge the support of your friend-group so they don't get burned out helping you process your loss. Try saying things like:


""I know this breakup's been especially bad for me, and I'm sorry about venting to you all the time. You've been such a good friend through all this. I'm so thankful for your support.""
""I wanted to thank you for forcing me to go out the other night. I was mopey and a little depressed, but a night out was exactly what I needed.""
""You've been so patient with me through all this. Thank you. Without you here to listen and give me advice, this would've been so much more difficult for me.""

, It may be encouraging for you to put positive quotes in visible places around your home. Or maybe you should plan a viewing marathon of a show or movie that never fails to improve your mood.

, Many people struggle with difficult breakups. These can be a huge emotional shock, and you might need the emotional support of a professional or someone more emotionally experienced to reach a place where you can heal. A psychologist, an older family member, a friend or a school counselor can guide you through the process. Talking it out can help you release the stress, gain advice, and build your self esteem."

You will most likely be better off having this conversation at home in your living room than in a public setting such as a restaurant or café.
Try not to choose a time when your spouse is already stressed, such as right after he or she gets off of work.;
, You may also want to check with your partner to be sure that the time and place you are considering for this conversation will work for him or her. Try telling your spouse that you have something important that you want to discuss and ask when he or she would like to talk.


For example, you might say, “I have something important that I need to talk to you about and I want to make sure that we will have enough time. When would be good for you?”

, If you’ve decided to come clean, now is the time for the truth. Even if your partner asks painful questions, complete candidness is necessary. Try to be as straightforward as possible and do not leave out any details.


You may think that leaving out some of the details of your affair may be a good idea, but only offering up a partial confession will end up making you feel worse.For example, if you cheated on your partner multiple times, then a partial confession would be telling your spouse that you only cheated once.

, While you have a lot to get off your chest, your mate will probably want to say some things as well. Avoid talking over him or her and simply listen. Showing respect for their thoughts and feelings will go a long way towards repairing the relationship.


Show that you are listening by leaning towards your partner and maintaining eye contact.
Remove all distractions to avoid interruptions. Turn off your phone, TV, laptop, etc.
Don’t interrupt your partner when he or she is talking. Listen until he or she finishes saying what he or she has to say.
Rephrase what your partner has just said to show that you were listening. For example, you can start by saying something like, “If I am understanding correctly, it sounds like you are saying….”, Unnecessary details and long-winded stories will only derail the conversation. Stick to the pertinent details to avoid prolonging an already painful conversation.


“We met at work.” is better than beginning a long story like “The mailroom manager needed a new assistant. So she hired this new guy and began training him. . .”
Be ready to elaborate when asked, however. Don't skimp on the details if your mate wants to know more.

, No matter how many questions your spouse has, patiently answer them as best you can. Being willing to talk, even about uncomfortable details, signals openness and a commitment to rebuilding trust. Therapists urge, therefore, divulging all so that the healing process can truly commence.Further, if the shoe were on the other foot, you would expect the same patience and respect from them.

, Refusing to take responsibility or downplaying your mistakes will only inflame tensions. Your focus shouldn’t be on protecting yourself, but on being there to support your partner in their time of need. Relationship experts have concluded that defensive statements not only sabotage individual conversations but, given enough time, entire marriages too.Avoid these types of statements:


""I didn't mean to hurt you!""
""It only happened once.""
""You don't know what you're talking about!""

, This sends a clear signal to your partner that you have feelings for your former companion. Why else would you feel compelled to defend them? If you are truly dedicated to repairing your current relationship then you must make it clear that your mate is now number one.

, Sincerely apologize for your wrongdoings. Feelings of guilt aside, seeing how painful this process is for your partner should be motivation enough to admit your errors. Science has show that those who are willing to offer up a mea culpa are also generally happier people., A heartfelt apology usually includes a statement that not only acknowledges your error, but also shows remorse for injuring the other person. Confessing aloud that you've wounded your spouse shows them their feelings matter too. If you're still at a loss for words in saying you're sorry, here are a few suggestions:


""I'm so sorry I lied to you. You did not deserve to be treated that way.""
""This was all my fault. I apologize for hurting you.""
""Lying was wrong and I'm sorry I violated your trust.""

, If you’re committed to making the relationship right again, suggest a joint therapist visit. Dealing with the fallout of infidelity can be a long and messy process. A trained counselor might be able to help you and your partner put the pieces back together.

, It will take a long time to rebuild trust. Being completely truthful with your partner from this point forward, however, shows that you're willing to work hard to make your relationship work.


You may need to agree to some terms that will help your partner to trust you again. For example, you might agree to check in more often when you are out or to allow your partner to have access to your phone, email, and social media accounts.

, Therapists emphasize that in order for a relationship to truly heal after an affair, it requires sharing insights and feelings with your partner.Take time to understand your motivations for seeking extramarital companionship and then share what you've learned with your spouse. Some useful questions to ask of yourself include:


""Was I feeling lonely?"" ""If so, why?""
""Why did I choose that person over my spouse?""
""What feelings did I have for my former lover?""

, While 70% of couples will go on to work on the relationship and try to stay together, some couples will not stay together after a spouse cheats.Make sure that you are prepared for the possibility that your relationship may end.


You should also be prepared for anger from your spouse. Remember that your spouse has a right to be angry. Be willing to listen to your spouse as he or she expresses feelings of anger.
Keep in mind that you have had lots of time to prepare yourself for this discussion, but it may be a total surprise to your spouse.

For example, if you lost a loved one because you were emotionally vacant, try to spend less time in the office and more time at home.
Or, for example, the fact that your current partner does not do something that made you end a previous relationship should be comforting.;
, Deciding if the person is ""right"" has much to do with how high of esteem you hold them in. Do some serious thinking if you will retain your respect for them during inevitable life changes. Their aspirations may be a good way to determine this.


What kinds of things might cause you to lose respect for your partner? Drinking habits, money management, treatment of friends? Are these areas where you already have issues with your partner?
Think about the history of your relationship with your partner. How has your partner dealt with conflict or other issues thus far? Can your partner's behavior give you clues about past, current, and future respect, flexibility, and compromise?

, Are you in a career track that will develop over the next several years or decades? Are you making car payments over the course of years? Do you have a house or rent an apartment by the month, or is it a multi-year lease? Nervousness over adding long-term commitments is a common aspect of fearing marriage. If you want to get married, you should make other long-term commitments, such as those named above, to acclimate yourself to the idea.

, There are two kinds of commitment: dedication and constraint.A commitment based on personal dedication means you imagine growing old with your partner, you work together with your partner (like a team), and you can't see yourself with anyone else.A commitment based on constrains means you feel forced to stay in the relationship due to internal or external pressures (children, sharing of possessions, family, a feeling of obligation), you think about leaving your relationship but it feels too difficult or like you have gone ""too far"" to end it, that starting over sounds too difficult.Note that all relationships acquire constraints over time. Think about whether the constraints outweigh your personal dedication to the relationship.If you feel your constraints have increased but your personal dedication has decreased, consider if there are ways to reduce your feelings of constraint and increase your personal dedication., Even if you feel fully committed to the relationship, you may be wondering how to maintain that dedication or worry about it slipping away. Or maybe you feel that it already has begun to decrease. There are actions you can take to increase your commitment to your partner:Invest in your relationship. Remember that difficult periods are temporary. Put in the work to struggle through the hard times with your partner (inevitably there will be some) to emerge a stronger couple. Good times will return.Avoid scorekeeping.You may feel that you are doing more in your relationship; this is because you don't know everything your partner does throughout the day, you only know all the things you have done. Instead of keeping score to determine who loves whom more, focus on the good things your partner does and think about what you can do to make your partner happy.Don't ""hedge your bets."" Don't hold back from your partner because you're afraid things won't work out. Trying to protect yourself in this way may hurt your relationship, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Assume that things are going to work out and be open and honest with your partner and work hard to strengthen your relationship., Your fear may be more specific than these. It may also prevent you from wanting to talk with your partner. You need to open up those channels of communication, however.


If you are scared of losing your individuality or changing, remind yourself that everyone is changing, constantly. Staying unmarried will not keep the earth from spinning. Also, it's not like you lose all agency when you get married.If you are afraid of getting divorced eventually, think about the stigma attached to divorce. Is it warranted? Even if you still think so, remember that your future is not determined by marriage or divorce statistics, and you can hold on to a marriage if you put work into it.

, Commitment-phobia isn't a phobia like a fear of snakes or clowns — it is most often a fear based on a lack of trust, which may come from a previous violation of trust.If you have experienced a betrayal by someone you loved or trusted, you may not have healed.This betrayal could have come in the form of abuse, an affair, or another devastating violation of your trust, which may have been traumatic.In addition, you may be afraid of being responsible for another person, or of losing your independence, or afraid of losing the other person, which may all relate to feeling unable to trust., You may feel that you are protecting yourself by not opening up to your partner. But consider your reasons, and whether or not they outweigh the chance to have a rich, fulfilling relationship with someone who loves you., Make sure you and your partner know each other — the good and the bad. It is common to ignore the less positive qualities of a partner, aspects like anger, jealousy, or selfishness, or a need to feel free or powerful.But these aspects are part of who you and/or your partner are, and they may surface from time to time. Make a conscious effort to explore, discuss, and be open to learning about the ""shadow"" side of you and your partner.As you learn about these qualities, you and your partner will build trust not on the idea that you will never hurt each other (because, unfortunately, that will happen), but on the understanding of who you and your partner truly are.Instead of promising to keep your ""shadow"" side always at bay, promise that you will be aware of and express when you are hurt. Promise to work together to address the situation and use it to strengthen your relationship., If your inability to build trust stems from a trauma, then you should seek the assistance of a mental health professional to address it.A counselor, group therapy, or a program designed to treat trauma can help you work through your experience., If your fear of marriage causes you stress, find a way to unwind. This may help you come to terms with it. When you find yourself worrying about marriage, try some methods for dealing with anxieties that apply in other parts of life.Try yoga or meditation. These exercises are designed to help you stop dwelling on your anxieties.
Drink less coffee and alcohol. These are drugs that can affect your mood as well as your brain chemistry. If you are feeling high-strung because of marriage anxiety, decrease your consumption of coffee and alcohol.
Get enough sleep and exercise. These are essential to your physical and emotional health, and help you reduce your fears and anxieties.

, The act of putting your anxieties down on paper forces you to pinpoint what it is that scares you about marriage. It is also therapeutic. As you write about your fears, try to come up with solutions to them. Write about why you want to get married, and how your partner can help you achieve your goals.

, Write down the stable, unchanging qualities you see in your partner. Think about struggles and conflicts you have faced in the past and how you overcame them. Don't let your anxiety or fear make you forget how amazing your partner is and all the reasons you want to be with him or her.

, This is the perfect opportunity to exercise the communication skills that are essential for any healthy relationship to last. For many people, important life goals come to fruition as a part of marriage. Though everyone changes their mind on issues throughout life, not everyone sees themselves in the same place down the road. Talk about kids, careers, money, and ""deal breakers.""Everything is a little less scary when said out loud, so let it out.

, You, your partner, and everyone on this earth are imperfect. There will be rocky periods in your life whether you’re married or not. Periods of unhappiness or struggle are inevitable. Think about whether you will be more able to overcome unhappy moments with a life partner.


Work on building a relationship with your partner that helps you handle sources of stress and angst. In doing so you also create a built-in defense mechanism in your marriage.

, In the west, successful marriages have typically depended on monogamy. Before you proceed with marriage, you need to establish that you will remain faithful to each other. It is an uncomfortable but necessary conversation, and it may even bring you closer together.

, Your plans will change, but in general, do you see yourself married? Although everyone’s ideal time frames change throughout life, having an idea of what you want to achieve puts a positive spin on future planning. Not wanting your life to drastically change is OK, just make sure your partner has the same aspirations.

, Not everyone's culture allows this, but it has worked for many as a way to determine if they would live well with their partner. Use it as a way to explore each other's living habits before the vows. Make sure you approach this experiment with acceptance as a goal. They will have little quirks that you notice for the first time, but so do you — you just haven't perhaps identified them.

, If your parents are still married, they will almost certainly be able to tell you that they weren't always sure about the idea. They should also have tips for overcoming fear of marriage that they have realized over the years. It will also give you a real-life example of people for whom marriage has worked.

, Though it may feel uncomfortable to seek professional advice before there is a problem, it may help you come to terms with marriage. They will also be able to help you identify warning signs for future conflicts.Ask friends, family, or a doctor for a referral to a licensed marriage and family therapist, or search online. Your place of worship may also offer (or require) premarital counseling or courses."

Consider if he is more concerned with his physical appearance than usual.,
Notice if his sleeping habits or daily schedule start to change.,
Ask yourself if he seems more distracted or distant.,
Note any changes or shifts in your sex life.,
Notice if he gets defensive or angry at you easily and more often.,
Pay attention to how he handles the aftermath of a fight.,

Read How to Detect Lies.,
Consider talking to him about your suspicions.",How to Catch a Cheating Boyfriend1," Has he started working out more, dressing better, grooming himself with more care, or using a new musky cologne? While self improvement through physical fitness and grooming are healthy life choices, consider if he is trying to improve his physical appearance for someone else., If your boyfriend is usually in bed by 9 and is suddenly out all night or sneaking around the house late at night, this may be a sign of cheating.


Similarly, if he usually sticks to a set routine of going to the gym in the morning or heading home from the office by 5, but he is now sleeping in or staying at the office late, these adjustments in his daily schedule could hint at time spent elsewhere, possibly in the company of someone else., If he is usually a very attentive, supportive partner who asks you how your day is and enjoys having long conversations with you over dinner, and then suddenly appears uninterested in your day or bored by long conversations with you, this may be a sign his interest or engagement is focused elsewhere and not on you.Your partner may also lose interest in domestic activities like spending time with the kids, fixing up the house, mowing the lawn, etc.
He may also spend more time on his phone texting or on the computer in private chat rooms or social media pages. If his phone or computer use goes up dramatically or if he becomes secretive about his phone or computer use, this may be a red flag., Perhaps there has been a decline in the amount of sex you are having or a strange, sudden increase in sexual activity, with new sexual preferences or tastes that you did not experience with him previously.You may start wondering where he learned a certain sexual move or what caused him to develop a certain preference in bed. One possible reason is he may be trying out new moves with someone else.
He may also have a lower sex drive or spurn off your attempts at being intimate with excuses like “I’m tired,” or “Maybe another night.”, If he seems to be picking a lot of fights, get angry at you for something small he would usually not be upset about, or gets defensive when you ask him about his night out with the boys, these may be signs of cheating.Changes in his normal behavior that involve anger towards you could in fact be a reflection of his guilt for cheating or fear that you may find out about his affair.

, Does he leave, get some space, and then return to apologize? Or does he neglect to apologize or show remorse for hurtful words he said to you? If he is usually good at forgiving and forgetting after a fight and this is not happening anymore, this may be a red flag.It’s important to remember that your boyfriend’s inner turmoil has nothing to do with you and is a reflection of his own anxieties and fears. Try not to take his anger towards you personal or put pressure on yourself to try to make him forgive you or feel better, as this could also mean he is actually feeling guilty about an affair.

, This will help you compile evidence of his cheating and determine the times, dates, excuses given, etc, that helped him lie to you about the affair.A cheating spouse is likely to change their story, question your memory or deny your accusations, so keeping a record of their activity is critical.

, This article will help give you the skills to determine if your boyfriend is lying. Most people are bad liars, so if you use the right technique to detect his lies, you may be able to get him to confess to his affair.


Keep in mind that once he knows you're suspicious of his behavior, he might work overtime to cover his tracks. If so, you'll need to be more vigilant and work harder to get evidence of his cheating.

, If you are noticing shifts or changes in his behavior, it is possible he may be treating you this way not because he's cheating, but because he is dealing with other internal issues like depression, grief, severe anxiety, etc. Talking to him about your suspicions rather than resorting to drastic measures like snooping around or encroaching on his privacy, will show that you care about the relationship and about making it work.

Think about your motivations.,
Set ground rules.,
Agree upon appropriate questions.,
Keep the conversation focused.,
Be judicious with details.,
Tell the truth.,
Think about your partner’s feelings.,
Concentrate on positive outcomes.,
Know that talking about exes can help you know each other better.",How to Have a Healthy Conversation About Exes with Your Current Partner2," Being clear with one another about why you want to discuss exes is an important part of having a healthy conversation. If you are talking about past relationships to coerce your partner into a specific behavior, you should reevaluate why you are sharing that element of your past., Before you and your partner begin a conversation about exes, you should agree on some common ground rules. These rules will vary from couple to couple, but having rules in place will allow both partners to be open and honest while remaining comfortable., Once you decide on some basic ground rules, you can work together to agree what types of questions are appropriate to ask. For example, you might agree that it is okay to ask why you broke up with an ex or what you learned from the relationship. You might also decide that it is inappropriate to ask about an ex’s sexual performance or preferences

, Having a focused, candid conversation with your partner about past relationships can help build trust and encourage communication. Once you set ground rules about what, precisely, you will be discussing, make an effort to stick to the issues at hand.


For example, if you agree to discuss general overviews of past relationships, avoid going into details about your former mother-in-law.

, While it is important to be open and honest with your current partner while discussing exes, you should minimize the details. Providing your significant other with detailed accounts of past sex lives and relationship woes is unnecessary. Give details when necessary, but avoid lengthy narratives that might spark insecurity in your current partner.For example, you should avoid providing or asking about intimate details of your sex life with exes.

, When you’re discussing past relationships with your significant other, it’s important that you are honest with them. If you lie to your partner, you are missing a critical opportunity to build trust and practice open communication. While a detailed account of your past isn’t necessary, it’s important that you are honest and open.If your current partner asks why you broke up with your ex, you should provide them with an honest answer. You can say, for example, “He did not support my goal of returning to nursing school.”
If you feel uncomfortable answering a question, try saying, “Jim, I do not feel comfortable answering that question about my relationship with my ex, I would prefer to leave it in the past.”

, When you decide to have a conversation with your significant other about past relationships, it’s important to take the other person’s feelings into account. Talking about exes can make both parties feel vulnerable and it’s important to take this into consideration when you decide what you will or won’t be sharing.


For example, you should avoid discussing intimate details of past sex lives that might make your partner insecure.

, When talking about your ex, try and stay focused on what you learned from the relationship and how those lessons made you a better person. Breakups often fuel self-growth, and relaying this to your current partner can help them understand why you are the person you are today.For example, you could say, “While our breakup was messy, I really benefitted and grew from becoming financially independent and being able to pursue my own interests without constraint.”
Keep in mind that complaining about your ex may give people the impression that you are not over them. It can also take away the focus from your new developing relationship.

, When you talk with your partner about past relationships, both of you can gain insight into how the other person grew into who they are today. Relationships are learning experiences that test your needs and boundaries, and talking about them will help both of you better understand each other’s character, history, and behavior.For example, you might learn that your current partner was really hurt by his ex lying to him. This will help you understand that he values honesty in a relationship.
Or, your new partner might learn that your ex did not take your opinions into account. This could enhance his communication with you in this new relationship.

Take note of his cell phone activity.,
Notice if he has changed all the passwords for his computer or moved his computer to a private area or room.,
Check his social media accounts.,
Look through his apartment or his side of the bed for love notes, gifts, and photographs.",How to Catch a Cheating Boyfriend2," Notice if he has been making long phone calls at strange times of night or receiving text messages from other girls. He may also have new phone etiquette where he needs privacy or space when talking to someone, he hangs up as soon as you walk into the room or he brushes you off when you ask him who he is talking to on the phone.If you can get your hands on his cell phone bill (on paper or online), you can look at every call made for that month, which will give you a chance to check for any long conversations at odd times, or lots of calls to one particular number that you don’t recognize.You can also try to check his phone messages and voicemail, though this may be an easy way to get caught snooping around. A good time to check his phone is when he is in the shower or out for a walk and has placed it on the charger.If your boyfriend tends to misplace his phone, another thing you can do is simply take it and let him assume he lost it. This way you can see who is calling or texting him on a daily basis.

, Be wary if his computer activity becomes sneaky or secret and if he gets defensive or distant if you use his computer or ask to see what he is looking at on his screen.This may be a sign he is trying to limit your access to his computer and hiding something on his hard drive or browser history.
Try to get access to the computer when he is out and check the hard drive for hidden folders with images of other girls or partners, as well as love notes. See How to Find Hidden Files and Folders in Windows for how to do this.

, This could be his email, Facebook, Instagram, and instant messaging accounts. Many times, cheaters use the Internet to carry on their sneaky business, especially if they are worried about you checking their phone or monitoring their calls.


Some cheating partners may be using cheating websites like meet2cheat or ihookup. Search the computer’s browser history to see if he has visited any of these cheating sites.
Some cheaters may also create different Facebook profiles to then find other people online to message or meet up with and have an affair. So check if he bookmarked or viewed any Facebook profiles or pages multiple times.You can also search for your spouse’s hidden online profiles using a service like Spokeo or Rapleaf.There are websites that set out to expose “liars, cheats, and bastards” by posting stories about cheating men as warnings to others about a bad spouse., Consider where he would hide personal items or things he doesn’t want you to see.


Examine any physical evidence of cheating closely to make sure you are not misinterpreting a note or item that may have sentimental, rather than romantic value. Just because he kept his ex girlfriend’s picture or his first love’s note doesn’t necessarily mean he is cheating on you.
It’s important to get solid evidence of his cheating before you confront him, so look at any notes, gifts, or photographs with a discerning eye."

Get yourself together.,
Do not spend time thinking about what your jealousy is ""actually"" about.,
Look around.,
Get a buffer, at least in the beginning.,
Take the high road.,
Look your best.,
Keep yourself busy.,
Be your major priority.",How to Overcome Jealousy After a Break Up," Repeat to yourself as much as it takes that eventually everything will turn out for the better. Remember that it is not a real, physical factor that instigates your anger, fear and panic. There is nothing coming up that threatens you; rather, it's all inside of you and your job is to get rid of it in order to feel in harmony again. Once you convince yourself you're safe, you will start feeling in control and capable of dealing with all sorts of negative emotions.


Take a head-on approach to your negative feelings. Rather than regarding them as inevitable and natural, seek ways to change them into helpful attitudes, ones that will support you rather than cause you to feel powerless and helpless. Be fully aware that negative emotions keep you connected to the loss, while a positive attitude allows you to let go of the person while still acknowledging that you once had a relationship with this person without causing you to feel upset.Be kind to yourself. Do you really need to put yourself through this? No!;
, Focusing on the negative emotions will put you in a vulnerable position. You can easily confuse the anger and fear as meaning that you're still in love with your ex and that you need to get them back. Obsessing over their new flame - who they are, what they do, how they can be eliminated - is even worse and more dangerous. Thoughts about them will not help you realize what you don't like about yourself and what you need to change. Such thoughts will only trap you in more fear, self-doubt, pain, and jealousy and will prevent you from moving on.


Bear in mind that dissecting the nitty gritty of what could or should have been is living in the past by letting nostalgia trap you into a past period of life. Although often stated, the apt adage ""It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all"" is as equally often overlooked; yet, it is far healthier to appreciate that you once loved this person but that now it is time to move on. It is possible to cherish the experience for what it was without letting it drag you back all the time.
And if you really can't stop wondering, at its most basic, jealousy is about wanting something you feel you don't have. The only lesson for you to take away from this is to answer for yourself what it is that's missing inside of you and to remedy it by concentrating more on personal growth (see steps below). Think of it this way – even if you did get X person back, would this deep gnawing gap inside be filled? No – because no person can fill an internal dissatisfaction; only you have that power.

, Yes, look around - your home, your office, your family, friends, career, etc. Acknowledge all the great people and opportunities surrounding you. Focus on the people who make you happy. Think of as many as possible nice things people have complimented you about; doing so will help you to start feeling confident and grateful, triggering you to want to accomplish more of the good stuff that brings you joy, salvages the burns from jealousy and fills the emptiness.

, If you're extremely lucky, you will rarely or never see your ex and their new boy-/girlfriend again. However, if you cannot avoid bumping into them, make sure you're not alone whenever you know you can't avoid the awkward encounter. Having a buffer, an accomplice, will make you feel more secure. Friends and colleagues will also distract you and prevent you from obsessing over the happy couple.


Listen to your friends and family. It is possible that they have a sound perspective of the situation as it has developed and can provide you with solid advice for coping with it. Don't automatically assume that they'll say anything just to make you feel better; look for the gems of truth.

, Of course, you can't always be accompanied by someone else to help you balance the delicate situation. When the inevitable meet-up happens and you're by yourself, be both nice and reserved. It is essential to be polite, but no one expects from you to treat them as your best buddies. Trying that would look both awkward and insincere and would only stress you more.


Have quick exit excuses already planned, such as: ""It's great to see you Bob/Jane. I'm sorry I can't stay and chat, I've got a hair appointment I'm already late for.""; or ""Great to see you Bob/Jane! Wish I could talk but I've got to collect my boss from the airport and the traffic's bad.""; or, simply: ""Hi Bob/Jane. It's good to see you looking so well. I'll see you around!"" You don't need to offer an explanation unless you want to, but try your best not to give away your feelings through facial expressions or by brushing them off rudely.

, This is not in order to make your ex realize what he or she's lost (and want you back) or to prove to anyone that you're better than their new beloved one. Do it because you deserve it, you owe it yourself to shine and show the world the best you can be. There is no better remedy for overcoming jealousy and spite than a fresh infusion of self-confidence.

, Finding something to keep you occupied constantly will take up all your time, ensuring that at the end of the day you'll be too tired and proud of your accomplishments to even think about negative stuff. On the other hand, this will guarantee you the admiration and jealousy (!) of the others and once again convince you how amazing you are. This can be a great opportunity to let your creative side blossom and to improve professional self if you treat it as a time of personal growth and allow yourself the necessary opportunities.

, Whatever you do, remember that all your actions should be focused on moving on. Once you become the most important person in your life, you'll realize you've been moving on so fast, that the past will be too far behind to think about. Your ex and the other woman/man will be just a vague memory, a part of your experience and nothing more.

Decide exactly what you want to talk about and why.,
Pick a time and place that is both relaxing and intimate — preferably in private.,
Ask your question and be honest.,
Take care not to scare the person away or be too emotional.,
Keep it casual.,
Be confident and direct.,
Listen to the other person completely when they answer you.,
Be prepared to compromise.",How to Tactfully Ask Emotional Questions," Think about what you want to see happen in the future, and try not to dwell on every shortcoming from the past.



Concentrate on the current situation, not past ones.
Try not to get too wordy — explain what you're feeling and why.
Finally, say what you would like to see happen. After that, answer any questions they have.
It may help to write out what you need to say before talking to this person. If you are convinced that the words won't come out right, put your written words into a letter — edited more than once for a balanced delivery — and personally give it to him or her. Effectiveness goes way up when you stay while your friend reads it, so that you can stay to answer questions. Always an excellent standard: good news by letter, bad news in person.;
, If you are afraid of a harsh or intimidating reaction to your emotional question, meeting in public may help, such as a cafe where you can both sit and talk without interruption, as opposed to a sports bar. '


Turn off any cell phones or pagers that might disrupt the flow of the conversation.

, It is still important to keep the other person's feelings in mind when you are honest but don't make up stories just to ease the asking.


Ask a genuine question that is based on facts as you perceive them.
Ask an open-ended question – that is, one that the other person can respond to without the conversation being shut down.
Ask with respect and kindness.

, Avoid acting as if your life is hanging on the answer they give you. (If it is, are you a safe person for him or her to be close to?!) This is especially true if it is a new relationship. It is unattractive and makes you seem desperate or unstable. (Even if you are, you don't want to show it!) If you are melodramatic, you risk making things more complicated and less obvious. Equally, don't be cheesy or fake in an effort to act contrary to how you feel. Just be honest.


For example, if you are asking someone that you have been casually seeing if they are interested in moving the relationship along, be upfront, but avoid being melodramatic.

, Don't put too much pressure on the other person. You want the person to be honest, and even if what they say isn't what you want to hear, it is better to know how they really feel so that you can adjust your plans accordingly and move forward with wisdom.


For example, if you're asking someone if they want to be more serious and they don't want this, even though it is disappointing, it is good to know that so that you don't set yourself up to get hurt by falling for him or her too much.

, Don't beat around the bush. The ability to take on a sensitive issue delicately but directly is an attractive trait that reveals your maturity.


If you need time to cool down or to keep from getting too emotional, excuse yourself to the restroom, take a few minutes and a few deep breaths.

, Make a genuine effort to understand their answers. Look them in the eyes. This will show the person that you care about what they think.


Don't preach or try to change the other person's answer. You must assume that they are speaking honestly and in good faith.
Allow the other person to share what is in their heart – listen for it.
Be very patient. Some people may want to tell you, but they will need to battle their own ego and concerns to speak of it.
Don't try cut in and talk until you are sure that the other person has finished talking.

, If the other person doesn't want to do what you're asking for, try to find the middle path. If they don't want to do something, ask yourself what other ways you will be happy to reassess the solution:


For example, the other person doesn't want to take dance lessons 5 days a week. Maybe you could try once or twice a week? What arrangement or changes might put the two of you on the road to freedom for 5 dance lessons a week? What would that take from you, and for how long?

Determine if your date is a workaholic.,
Try to be understanding before jumping to negative conclusions.,
Talk to your date about his or her work life.,
Look to your own beliefs and attitude about working.,
Talk to your date about how their workaholism makes you feel.,
Agree on some ground rules.,
If, after talking it through, you feel that continuing to date your workaholic date isn't going to work out, cut your losses now.,
Look for the warning signs when dating again.",How to Date a Workaholic," Some telltale signs include:


You're the only person outside of your date's family who is intimate. He or she has no other friends (unless they're also at the same workplace).
He or she puts aside everything in favor of work, including you.
Every time you contact your date, he or she is ""still working"", no matter what the hour. Your date seems to have a poor perception of time.
Even important events such as a family birthday are not enough to convince your date to drop working.
Your date answers the phone, checks and sends emails, or makes orders for new supplies all the way through a date.;
, It can be really frustrating when your date is never available to attend the same functions and activities as you but it is important to try to understand the drive, passion, and importance of work for your date. Learning why work is so important to your date can increase your own understanding and appreciation of the needs behind working so hard. Consider the possible reasons behind what you're seeing as workaholism:


The job matters a great deal to your date.
It is a passion, especially if it is your date's own business or something that he or she wanted to do all of his or her life.
There is a current heavy workload and your date is conscientious at doing his or her part to meet deadlines and workloads.
The job comes with long hours, including nights and weekends. If your date accepts this, it is important for you to learn to accept it too.
It has become a habit well before you came along, and it's tough to break it.

, Find out all that you can about what inspires and drives your date at work. Perhaps understanding this better will help you to cut them some slack. Although all of these are indicators that your date may be permanently busy, they can arouse some sympathy in you.


It's a business start-up (always a very hard time of life).
Your date is seeking a promotion and the only real way to be considered for it is to be seen working hard all of the time.
Your date comes from a family of hard-workers and was brought up to perceive excessive working hours as the ""norm"". And is perfectly happy with it!

, Ask yourself what your own attitude to work is to see whether you're making more of the matter than it deserves, or perhaps confusing ambition with workaholism. If you don't think it's a good idea to do more than the bare minimum at work, or you're someone who has a job that doesn't bleed beyond set hours, you might have a very different mindset from your date about the level of dedication to work. On the other hand, if you're a reformed workaholic, or someone who believes deeply in a work-life balance, what you're observing may already be a good indicator of warning signs for your relationship's prospects. It can help to see some of the benefits of dating a workaholic:


You get a lot of time to yourself to pursue your own interests without having your date breathing down your neck all the time.
Your love life might be better and healthier than you expect – research undertaken by psychology professor Jonathon Schwartz showed that sexual satisfaction scored the highest for women dating or married to workaholics.You won't end up feeling suffocated by a date who is needy, compliant, or dull.

, This is the point at which you might be able to reach a compromise. If so, great! Or, it might be the time when you realize that your workaholic date is taking the workaholism too far and won't ever really fit you in. Tell your date how it feels to play second fiddle to his or her job and provide some factual examples of times when your date's work has interfered with your dating life together.


Explain that you fully understand his or her passion for the job but that you want some balance so that the two of you also have quality time together.

Avoid laying blame. Just state the facts and how the merry-go-round of never being sure whether or not your date is available is affecting you personally. It is important to remember that ""for workaholics, all the eggs of self-esteem are in the basket of work"", so criticizing their work decisions won't endear you to your date.
Explain how you would like things to be, and in doing so, be realistic. Asking for a little more time together is reasonable but asking for your date to get a new job is not!

, If you feel that your date has responded well to your talk, suggest that the two of you make some ground rules, or compromises, to ensure the health of your dating life. While you will probably not get the extent of agreement to more time together that you're looking for, go into this negotiation in good faith, expecting to lower some of your own expectations as well if you're prepared to make this work.


Ask that your date turn off his or her phone during a date unless it is an extreme emergency.
Ask for no texting or emailing during the date.
Consider having certain nights set aside for just the two of you minus work. Perhaps Saturday or Sunday night is a good night for both of you to touch base, eat together and watch a movie. Try to make this a regular date night.
Consider meeting up for lunch once a week. If you're prepared to compromise, make the lunch date near your date's place of work to encourage him or her to see this as an easy thing to do.
If your date accepts that there is probably an over-reliance of spending more time at work than putting into place more effective work practices and is willing to look at the possibilities, consider if you can help with any suggestions for improving work/life balance.
Avoid nagging, pleading, or whining at this point. It won't make any difference but it will make you appear petty and clingy. If your date is non-committal or refuses to discuss the issues, start thinking seriously about where this relationship is headed.

, If you feel the following experiences apply to you, it's probable that your dating relationship is doomed:


You haven't got it within you to keep being patient with the work excuses.
Your date doesn't want to reach any compromises under the previous step.
You feel that your date is never fully attentive to you when you are together, that there is always one ear to the phone, thoughts about work going through his or her head even as you converse.
You are intensely jealous of the workplace as being ""the other interest"" and feel that the time work takes up is way more than your relationship.
You feel he or she is being neglectful of you or if he or she is consistently breaking one or more of the ground rules you agreed together.
Nothing ever changes. It feels like a treadmill that goes around and around and that your date will never get off it, no matter what. For example, your date's business ""start-up"" is still ""starting up"" years after it began!
You can't help but feel that your date has a poor sense of prioritization, lacks the ability to plan properly, or is simply throwing hours at work problems instead of finding creative and sustainable solutions.

, If you get out of a relationship with a workaholic because of the workaholism, always keep the signs in mind for future potential dates. It is probably a good idea not to get into a new relationship with somebody who:


Makes dates with you but keeps canceling them at the last minute.
Says that he or she will make time for you but never manages to do so.
Talks about work non-stop, including telling you that the business is going through rough times, or has a lot of work to get through, etc.
Behaves as if he or she is indispensable when you discuss work.
You're left waiting ages, more than once, for an arranged date together.

Look beneath the argument.,
Communicate what's most true for you in one sentence.,
Take responsibility.,
Be humble.,
Let go of being right.,
Let your partner learn in his or her own way.,
Appreciate your partner.,
Set boundaries.",How to Make Up with Your Partner After a Fight," There's a saying: ""You're never fighting for the reason you think."" It may look like you're fighting about money, sex, or something else, but there's usually some feeling underneath that hasn't been fully expressed, maybe even something you hadn't realised you were feeling. Identifying the root feeling can help you calm down and make up with your partner. Common feelings that many fights can be traced to include:


Inadequacy. You feel like you're not good enough and you can't quite believe that your partner would want someone like you - at least, not for long.
Fear of abandonment. You're worried that your partner will leave you - literally, perhaps by cheating on you or by becoming emotionally distant. A little bit of alone time after a fight is good, though. It lets each partner cool down so that hot-tempered things aren't said.
Feeling taken for granted. You feel unappreciated, perhaps used.;
, Learn how to practice nonviolent communication. Telling your partner something like ""I feel scared when I see you talking to other girls,"" or ""I feel angry I don't have the money to pay for this right now"" allows you to get to the core issue and often helps him or her to understand your feelings without arguing about it.

, Did you snap at your partner? Are you trying to control the outcome of the fight? Is it easier to get what you want by manipulating the situation rather than asking directly? We all do these things to one degree or another. If you can find a way to own up to your part in the argument, without trying to blame or wrong yourself or your partner for it, it may open up a whole new dialogue.

, Sometimes if you can apologize for something you did (even if you didn't ""start"" it), it can disarm your partner and result in him or her apologizing as well. Something like, ""This is not where I wanted this to go, and I'm so sorry it has. Can we take a breather from the disagreement, collect ourselves and try again, only this time less angry?"" Always remember: don't apologize for things you didn't do just so the fight will be over. Be sincere.

, Wanting to win an argument is the surest way to keep it going. It's a no-win situation and keeps you from truly connecting with your partner. There's an old saying: ""Would you rather be right, or be happy?""

, You can only control yourself and your own pace of learning. If your partner isn't getting it, you can't force him or her to see what the issue your way. There's information in any argument for both of you, but it's impossible to make someone see things from your point of view. Either they do, or do not.


If you're holding out for an apology, and your partner isn't giving it, consider openly forgiving him or her anyway. This kind of acceptance, if you don't do it in a condescending way, might show that you accept your partner's imperfections, which can help him or her be less defensive. Example: After succinctly expressing how you feel (as described earlier), say ""I know you didn't mean to hurt my feelings by forgetting about our anniversary. I do still feel hurt, but I'm willing to trust that you didn't do it on purpose, and you'll try to remember next time. OK?""

, The sooner you two can experience some form of joy and lightheartedness, the better. Successful relationships have a five-to-one ratio of appreciations to criticisms. Actions that create genuine positive feelings will help to replenish the emotional bank account of your relationship by noticing and expressing lots of things that you really like about your partner and yourself, and the way you are together. If you're still feeling down about the whole thing, though, start with yourself.

, If your argument has been a nasty one, you may want to make an agreement with your partner about the boundaries and terms of your relationship. For example, ""I agree not to call you nasty names."" Or, ""I'd like for us to agree that we talk about what's going on without yelling at each other.""

Place a hidden camera or recording device in his room and car.,
Download spy software to his computer.,
Attach a GPS monitor to his car or track him with his phone.,
Create a fake social media profile.,
Set up the ideal opportunity for him to cheat.,
Consider hiring a private investigator.",How to Catch a Cheating Boyfriend3," You can get a hidden camera or small recording device at most spy shops or online. Place it in an area your boyfriend frequently hangs out in or spends a lot of time in, especially when he is talking on the phone or surfing the web.


You can also download an app called Night Recorder on your phone that will record the sounds in any room you leave your phone in, including any sneaky calls or sex sounds that are not yours., Keyloggers spy software, like SpyPal, are available for download online and can be installed in a computer without the person knowing they are running in the background.These types of programs can record information like passwords, emails typed, pages visited, or even record a video of the screen as your boyfriend uses the computer. Keep in mind, however, that many of these types of spyware are highly illegal, so be very careful when downloading them. Also, a watchful boyfriend can find a key logger or screen recorder, so download a high-end logger that keeps its files hidden and under password. Some of these can still be found, but with great difficulty. However, some spyware can be made completely invisible both to the user and to the operating system. You probably won't need this last option unless your boyfriend is a professional computer engineer or a professional hacker., If you’re looking to catch your partner red handed, place a GPS device on the underside of his car and track his movements so you can pounce on him if his pants end up around his ankles in a sleazy roadside motel.The “Find Your Phone” app can also be used to “Find Your Cheating Boyfriend”. If you have access to your boyfriend’s iCloud, you can log in and watch his phone move in real time right into the immediate proximity of someone else., You can then use the profile to log onto websites that promote cheating on spouses to see if your partner has a profile on the site or is using one of the sites to arrange hook ups.You could also bait your boyfriend by using the fake account to friend him on Facebook. You could then start flirting with him over a period of time and see how he responds to you. If he starts sending your fake profile naked pictures or inquire about a meet up at a hotel, he is clearly not being monogamous with you.

, While this may be the most elaborate option, as it requires some planning and setup on your end, it is another way to catch your boyfriend red handed. Provide an excuse like a hair appointment or a meet up with a friend and then watch from across the street or in your car down the block to see if your boyfriend uses your absence as an opportunity to meet up with someone.


Keep in mind this is also the riskiest option as it involves lying convincingly to your partner and then staking out his movements until he slips up.

, Private investigators are licensed to do surveillance and are knowledgeable about the best and most legal tactic to uncover evidence of infidelity.If you are in a long term relationship where your finances are tied or if you are married, so your finances are legally bound, it’s a good idea to hire a PI.
Look for a PI that specializes in infidelity investigations.

Reframe the situation.,
Don’t rush things.,
Be yourself.,
Avoid obsessing over the rejection.,
Use this as an opportunity to become better friends.",How to Communicate With a Guy After He Rejected You1," Don’t view this situation as a failure. Being rejected by someone doesn’t mean you have failed in some huge, measurable way. On the contrary, it means that you were brave and put yourself out there and gave yourself an opportunity to learn from your mistakes.Try to think of the rejection as an opportunity to grow as a person and figure out what works for you.
Take some time to think about what you might’ve done differently to turn that rejection into an acceptance. This will help you learn from your mistakes and make changes for the future.;
, Rejection can be a difficult pill to swallow — it can create feelings of hostility, embarrassment, shame, and denial. Allow yourself to take it slow after an instance of rejection and to process all the feelings you have.The guy will need to process his feelings too. If you want to be friends again after he rejects you, you’ll need to give him a bit of time and space to figure out what he thinks about it too. This will help eliminate any potential awkwardness.
Of course, the length of time that you need to wait will vary from situation to situation. But a good rule of thumb is to wait at least two weeks, or until you start feeling more comfortable with the idea of talking to him again.

, Even if he rejected you, there was a reason you liked him in the first place. And clearly you got close enough to him to know that he likes you too (at least as a friend). Don’t change who you are just because you got rejected. Continue dressing the same, talking the same, and liking the same things that you did before the rejection, but also continue your normal activities online. Keep posting things to friends, pictures of yourself, and whatever you used to do before the rejection.Don’t ever change yourself for anyone. Your uniqueness is what draws people to you.

, One of the hardest parts of communicating with a guy after he rejects you is letting it go. Don’t obsess over what you said, what you could have said differently, or how you might have handled the situation in another way. It happened; move on.Running through alternative scenarios in your mind over and over will only prolong your agony. Just accept that it happened and try to avoid thinking about it too much.
Tell your friends that you don't want to rehash the rejection and that you'd like their support in not talking about it.
If you find yourself obsessing over the situation, try distracting yourself by doing something else. Call a friend to meet up or start watching a movie. Try rereading a book you love or going for a walk outside.

, Try not to view this as a hurtful rejection, but more as an opportunity to get to know him better and possibly gain a good friend. Act in a civilized manner after he rejects you and show him you want to continue a friendship.Don’t ice him out and ignore him so you can pretend like what happened didn’t hurt you. Instead, make efforts to continue the friendship and get to know him better.
If you want to reach out to him to try to maintain the friendship (or start one in the first place), you could try to talk to him about it. Tell him that you value him as a friend and you don’t want to lose the friendship. Invite him to hang out with you casually — like going to a movie or hanging out with a group of mutual friends.

"
"
Offer your friend support.,
Let them cry.,
Say ‘what else?’ Though your friend is looking for a shoulder to cry on, they are likely cognizant of the fact that you may feel overwhelmed or even bored with them talking at length about the breakup.,
Be open-minded and don’t judge.,
Validate their feelings.,
Boost them up.,
Get them out and about.,
Have a sleepover.,
Take care of yourselves together.,

Remind them of why it didn’t work.,
Tell them you’ll always be there.,
Help them find things to fill their time.,
Call for backup.",How to Calm Someone Down After a Breakup," When we see the people we love hurt or upset, it can be tempting to immediately begin providing them with advice on how to fix their problems, even if they are not looking for a fix. Sometimes we get so caught up in problem solving that we don’t allow them to actually discuss the problem. Give your friend the space and the comfort to be able to discuss the breakup at length until they have gotten it off of their chest. Do not try to tell them what to do, just allow them to talk.For example, if your friend says that their ex cheated several times, don’t say something like “well, you should have left him once you knew he was a flirt.” ‘Should haves’ will be counterproductive in this conversation.;
, Your friend may be sad to the point of tears and that is okay. Crying is an important part of the process of grieving and you should allow them to cry without trying to silence or stop them. Typically when someone cries, people are quick to say “aww, don’t cry!” but this is unhelpful. Crying allows them to release their sadness and can be cathartic for many.Provide them with a tissue if you have some on hand.
If you know that crying is difficult for the person, then try to let them know that it is okay to cry. For example, you can say something like, “It’s okay. Just let it out.”
Cry with them if you feel so inclined!

, Even if you are beginning to feel those things, you should instead strive for empathy for your friend. Instead of saying “are you done now?” say “what else?” instead to encourage them to get everything off of their chest.Remember that you would want this same courtesy if you were going through a breakup. Try to be understanding.

, Perhaps you hated your friend’s ex and are thankful that they have finally broken up. Perhaps your friend’s ex was a jerk or abusive. Despite the things that they did and your own personal feelings about them, this is a person that your friend cared for a great deal. All the things that they did do not negate how your friend feels, and that is what you should try to focus on and understand. Listen to them without judgment and try to understand where they are coming from.Think back on all the times that you have been foolish and in love. You probably did some things that your friend thought were unreasonable but did not need to be judged for it. Practice empathy and understanding with your friend.

, Instead of trying to downplay the relationship or make them feel better immediately, tell them that you understand why they feel that way. Remind them that this devastation is normal and natural when a relationship dissolves and that you understand their hurt.You might say “I know you are so hurt. I know how much you loved your ex. Breakups really suck.”, Your friend is probably feeling at their lowest at this point. They may be feeling a lack of self esteem, particularly if their ex was verbally abusive. In addition to being listened to, your friend likely needs a boost of confidence. Remind your friend of how wonderful they are and that this breakup does not alter that in the slightest.You might say something like “I just want you to know that even in this difficult time, you are still one of the most wonderful people I know and I’m so lucky to be your friend.”

, After you have sat and listened to your friend at length about their hurt and you feel that you have reached a proper endpoint in the conversation, now is the time to get them out of the house for a bit and spend some time doing something to get their mind off the breakup temporarily.


You might go see a movie together; make sure it’s not a romantic movie. That might upset them.
Go out shopping for a bit or to a bookstore. Anything to divert their attention from their heartache.
Be sure to remind them that you are still there for them if they need to talk now and then.

, Your friend might need a lot of emotional support during this time. Invite them to spend a few days at your house or go and stay with them. You can binge out on junk food and watch movies together. This will prevent your friend from being alone and sinking even further into sadness.

, After a breakup, people tend to take care of themselves rather poorly. Help your friend begin feeling better by encouraging them to take care of themselves and making a day of it together. It’s never a bad time to do a little self care for yourself, too.


Go get haircuts or get your hair done together.
Go get a massage or have a spa day.
Get pedicures or manicures.

, One great way to help your friend relieve some stress (and to relieve some of your own) is to go to the gym together. Pumping some iron or running on the treadmill can help your friend get out some of their negative energy. Also, when you work out, endorphins are released which trigger happiness in us.If you don’t want to go to the gym, go for a walk or a run instead.
If your friend starts to feel better from the exercise, be sure to remind them that it is okay to feel good in spite of what they are going through.

, Again, your friend is probably not taking the best care of themselves right now. Don’t let them forget to do the things they need to do that are necessities. Often times when a person is very sad, they might lose their appetite. However, you should encourage them to continue eating regularly. One way you can do that is to cook them a meal or bring them dinner from their favorite restaurant.This will make them feel special and cared for.

, After you have talked to your friend and taken them out to get their mind off of the breakup, they will likely begin soliciting advice from you about how to move on. The first bit of advice you can give to them is to help them develop a plan to get over their ex, with the first step being to delete their number. This will reduce the risk of them calling them in a moment of weakness.You can also program your own number under their exes contact info so if they do get the temptation, they will call you instead.

, Beyond just phone calls, however, there are other ways for your friend to keep in contact with their ex. Help them to disentangle themselves from these possible sources of weakness. Have your friend to deactivate their social media for a while or to even consider blocking their ex if the breakup was particularly bad.Remind them that if they feel weak, they can always reach out to you.

, Your friend will likely become weak at some point and begin either regretting their decision to breakup or wanting to get back together with their ex. Encourage your friend to think about the situation reasonably and think about why they broke up in the first place. There are certain behaviors that are never acceptable in a relationship like being abused or cheated on. If those behaviors were present, discourage them from reconnecting with their ex, but do so gently.


You might say something like “remember that you broke up because he disrespected your mother. Don’t just remember him for the good he did, remember the bad, too.”

, Though your friend has lost their significant other, they may feel that they have lost a close friend, too. Sometimes we tell our significant others more intimate things that we even tell our best friends. Remind your friend that though they are going through a loss, they have not lost you.


Say “I want you to know that I am here for you through thick and thin. I know you are feeling very down but anytime you need me, I’m there.”
You may also want to help them brainstorm some of the other people they can reach out to when they need someone.

, You must remember that, however, you can’t ALWAYS be there. Empower you friend to seek out new hobbies and activities to fill their time so they aren’t either obsessing over their ex or calling you constantly. Neither behavior is healthy.


Encourage them to try something new like a new sport or instrument or perhaps even learning a new language.
Ask them if there is something they always wanted to do but didn’t have the time.

, Remember that you, in and of yourself, cannot cure your friend. You are not their savior; they have to save themselves. However, everyone needs a little help along the way. Call your other mutual friend in for support for both you and your friend during this time. Your friend needs to be surrounded by people who love and care for them during this time.


You might call your mutual friend and say something like “Hey, I’m here with ____ now and things aren’t looking so great. Can you come over and maybe bring some ice cream and a movie?”
Pay attention if your friends has any cuts, or begins to engage in risky behaviors such as drinking or using drugs. Consider their past history, and assess if there is any reason to worry that they might harm themselves. If so, make sure you reach out to an adult, such as parent or teacher, or you can also call a hotline, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the US at 1-800-273-8255."

Wait for the right time to interact.,
Use your friends as a buffer.,
Engage in conversations.,
Try to be friends.",How to Communicate With a Guy After He Rejected You2," Don’t try to push your way back into his life right after he rejected you; try to wait until you are both more comfortable. This process may take weeks, or maybe even months, to gather your courage to talk to him again. But just try to be patient and give yourself the time you need to heal and move on.You can tell when he starts being more comfortable by how he acts – if he starts treating you like he did before the rejection, then it is close to being back to normal.
Some signs that it may be the right time to start trying to interact with him again include increased eye contact between the two of you, noticeably fewer awkward encounters, or if your mutual friends tell you that they think he will be receptive to it.

, Instead of sulking around like it’s the end of the world, spend more time with your friends. This is especially important if the guy who rejected you is part of your friend group. Hang out with your friends and show him that you aren’t just sitting around your house super depressed because of that happened.Have a party at your house and invite him. Or go with your friends to the movies, even when you know he’ll be there. Show him that you are a fun person to be around.

, Starting conversations with someone who rejected you can seem difficult at first. But you’ll quickly get over the awkwardness after a little initial effort. Try to talk to him like you used to before he rejected you. If you struggle with this, try asking him questions about his life. This is a good way to get him to open up and for you to both move past what happened.Try asking questions like, “How did you do on the Math test?” or “Did your sister come home to visit this weekend?” or “What did you do this weekend?” Really, just ask anything to get him talking.
If you are friends with the guy or became friends with him, avoid bringing up the rejection. It only makes things a bit uncomfortable and you might regret it. It just makes him feel bad that he had to reject you, for whatever reason. And it may seem like you cannot let go of the past.

, Moving forward after a rejection can be difficult, and you’ll need to make a little effort if you want it to work. Try to forget about any embarrassment you may feel from the situation. Make the effort to be friends and show him that you’re not a person who can’t handle it. Stand by him in lines and talk to his friends. Make sure you glance at him in classes. And if he stares back, there’s a good chance he might want to talk. This will help make him think you're not afraid of talking with him.Treat him like any other person you would normally talk to.

"
"
Use social media.,
Send messages sparingly at first.",How to Communicate With a Guy After He Rejected You3," A good way to reach out slowly over time after a guy rejected you is by doing so on social media accounts. These platforms allow you to let a guy know you’re thinking about him without going overboard with messages, texts, or potentially awkward in-person interactions.Start by liking a photo he posted. Don’t leave a comment, just like the photo. Wait a few days and then leave a light-hearted comment on something he posted. Nothing too personal – just a joke or a funny reference.
During this period, be sure to continue posting a few things on your own accounts to give him an opportunity to return the gesture. Don’t go crazy with the posts, but post enough that it’s clear you’re still a fun person living your life, not just someone who is moping around after the rejection.

, You don’t want to bombard him with text messages (or messages on any other online platform), especially in the first few weeks after he rejected you. Once you have let some time pass, try sending a simple message inquiring about something unrelated to your relationship or what happened between the two of you.


Try texting something like, “Hey. Did you ever get around to watching that movie I recommended?” Or maybe, “Hey. See you at the party this weekend?” Keep it light and casual. You can build from there.

Give yourself space.,
Give yourself time.,
Stop checking up on them online.,
Get rid of reminders.,
Think of their faults.",How to Stop Liking Someone1," The old proverb, ""Out of sight, out of mind,"" is true. When you surround yourself with different people and things, this person will become an object of the past.


If you share the same friends and cannot avoid your crush, hang out in large groups. Cut down on the one-on-one time and stay nearer to other guy/girl friends.
If you share the same extra-curricular activities, don't drop out -- that just avoids the problem. Keep yourself with friends -- or use this as a reason to make new ones!
Don't go where they go! If you know parts of their schedule and where they'll be, busy yourself somewhere else. You don't want to be running into them -- accidentally or on purpose.;
, Emotions don't go away overnight. Slowly but surely, though, they'll fade.



Keep a journal. Getting your feelings out will help with closure. Bottling anything up is not healthy and leads to frustration and stress.
When you start thinking of them, stop. You have the power to do this. Divert your thoughts to anything else -- what was that funny thing Allie said today? Who's that cute new student in third period? Will global warming be the death of humankind? Often, there are much bigger issues at hand.

, Being consistently reminded of them will only make things harder.



Unsuscribe to them on Facebook. This will still list you as a friend, but remove their stories from your news feed. Doing so avoids the classic and awkward, ""Hey, why did you delete me?"" conversation.
Unfollow them on Twitter. If they ask, there are loads of excuses you can make: ""I'm wasting too much time on the Internet,"" or, ""I did? Weird -- my friend said the same thing.""
If you aren't good friends, delete his or her phone number. This removes any temptation to call or text.

, It's harder to forget someone if you're surrounded by items that spark unwelcome thoughts.


Did you write their name on a notebook? Do you have an old note from them? Did you use to drink Orange Crush together? Get rid of things that make you think of them. Put yourself in positions where fantasizing about them is avoidable.
Or, if you can't permanently get rid of something (like a piece of furniture or a school textbook), try to find ways to keep it out of your sight as much as possible. Wrap a book in a new cover, or toss a throw over the couch you used to sit on together.

, Everybody has them. Odds are, you've been unable to see them because you've been idolizing that person.


Why do you want to stop liking them?
Why do others not like him or her?
What don't you have in common (that you do have in common with someone else)?

Make new friends.,
Busy yourself.,
Better yourself.,
Change your tastes.,
Keep your eyes open.",How to Stop Liking Someone2," (Or rediscover old ones!) Reinvigorating your social life will give you an absorbing distraction, and you'll spend valuable time building up your support system. Here's how to expand your circle:


Join a new club or team. If you play a sport or have a favorite hobby, hunt down ways to practice with other people.
Volunteer your time. Check out your local hospital, nursing home, or pet shelter.
Get a part-time job. Ask around to see if anyone you know is hiring part-time help, or browse through local job postings.

, You'll barely have time to think about him/her.


Pick up a new hobby (i.e. painting, an instrument, a sport, cooking)
Organize events for you and your friends (as simple as going to the movies.)
Get more involved with your family.
Get more involved online.

, Take time to focus on becoming the person you aspire to be. After a while, you'll be too good for -- who again?


Work out. Go for a run, take up yoga, or start practicing a sport. The endorphin rush that comes from exercising will lift your mood, and you'll look better than ever!
Take a class. Have you always wanted to learn pottery, or find out more about martial arts? Now is the time!
Read up on your interests. Pick up that new novel you've been meaning to read, or spend more time catching up on the news.

, You both like the same music? Well, not anymore.


Experiment with new TV shows
Find new, up-and-coming bands (or break out your parents' records!)
Catch on to a new fashion trend -- or start your own!

, Like they say, there are a lot of fish in the sea. Remember to keep having fun. Hang out. If you put yourself in new situations, you'll find new (and better) potential interests.

Forgive.,
Forget.,
Take care of yourself first.",How to Stop Liking Someone3," Sometimes, people just aren't good for us. If this person leaves you feeling sad or not good enough, odds are you're in a toxic friendship.


Don't hold grudges against the person. They may be too wrapped up in their world to notice their effect on you.
Make peace with your feelings. Whatever they are, they're legitimate -- you wouldn't be feeling them if they weren't! Forgive yourself, too.

, A toxic friendship isn't worth having. Though you may hope, change is unlikely to come. A better way to spend your time is around people who let you thrive and make you feel comfortable.


Stop putting effort into the relationship. Be kind when near, but don't seek out opportunities to be noticed or appreciated by this person. Put effort into relationships where the other person is willing to meet you halfway.
Concentrate on other friends. You have a support system all around you of friends and family who care about you. You are not dependent on this person.

, You are the most important person in your life. Above all, you need to be happy. And this person isn't cutting it.


If they confront you on your avoidance, be clear. Tell them, ""I need to spend more time with other friends; I feel like I'm doing all the work in our friendship."" If they want to salvage the relationship, they will try. If they don't, good riddance! You can walk away knowing you did the right thing for you.

Listen.,

Help your friend feel understood.,
Avoid bringing up your previous breakups.,
Discourage your friend from contacting the ex.,
Distract your friend within reason.",How to Cheer Up a Friend After a Breakup1," Immediately after a breakup—regardless of whether the relationship was six months or six years—your friend is likely to feel confused in addition to sadness. Your friend will likely want to start talking through this confusion almost immediately, and genuinely listening is one of the first and most meaningful steps you can take to show you care.No matter what reason someone gives us for breaking up, we’re always left with questions—“What could I have done differently?” or “Can I still fix this?” It’s perfectly logical for people to be confused about being rejected, especially if they don’t see the rejection coming.;
, It’s always easier to maintain a friend through the good times, so it’s natural for hard times such as breakups to feel straining and frustrating on a friendship.Constantly remind yourself that it’s your job as a friend to be empathetic and involved even if it means listening to the same questions or stories repeatedly as your friend processes the new source of grief. Having patience through the process begins immediately and lasts the entire time.


If it helps you, remind yourself of a similar time the friend helped you either through a breakup or maybe the loss of a job. Think objectively about how patient the friend was with you during your more difficult moments.

, Obviously, your friend doesn’t want to feel as though he or she is talking to a wall, so make sure you engage with the stories and questions raised to help make the person feel understood.During your responses, try to avoid empty cliches and platitudes about breakups, though.The last thing your friend wants to hear is that there are other fish in the sea because it invalidates his or her current emotional state.


In general, you should say things that both reassure your friend and acknowledge that his or her feelings are valid. Avoid telling the friend how to feel such as telling them to stay positive, and avoid immediately giving advice unless you are asked for it.For example, instead of telling a friend to try to be more positive, acknowledge that the situation isn’t fair., While you may feel tempted to compare your friend’s situation to a previous breakup of your own, you should avoid doing so in the immediate aftermath of the breakup. We may see this as relating to the person, but you may accidentally cross the line in the eyes of your grieving friend, making it seem like you’re stealing their thunder or making the situation about you.Give the friend time to make it about him or her.

, It’s pretty common for someone who has just been rejected to deny the finality of the situation. Your friend may be tempted in the early stages to reach out to the ex in ways that you know aren’t going to help. While you should discourage this course of action when the friend asks, don’t allow yourself to get too involved in the outcome.


Your friend has likely made up his or her mind to contact the person by the time the topic comes up, so you cannot allow yourself to get frustrated if the person doesn’t follow your advice.A breakup awakens an irrational part of all of us. Forbidding your friend from contacting the ex is like a parent forbidding a teenager from doing something. Your friend may do it just to spite the voice of reason., The emotional effects of a breakup represent a grieving process. It’s not only natural for people to grieve, but it’s also necessary if the person wants to move on in a healthy manner. You may be tempted to immediately begin getting your friend out of the house to bombard the person with distractions from the pain and sadness, but you must allow your friend to grieve instead of constantly making him or her ignore or forget the breakup.Due to this, only use distractions sparingly and within reason.


While taking the friend out shopping or to a baseball game occasionally is a good break from the stress of the grieving process, attempting to subject the person constantly to outside stimuli will only prolong the process or possibly even lead the person to repress the emotions he or she needs to work through."
"
Allow your friend to find his or her own path.,
Help with day-to-day details.,
Keep having fun together.,
Watch the person’s alcohol consumption.,
Focus on what helps your friend feel better.,
Let the friend get angry.,
Dissuade the person from rushing into another relationship.",How to Cheer Up a Friend After a Breakup2," Everyone grieves in a completely different manner and over a completely unique time period. Don’t focus on how long the grieving period should take based on the length of the relationship or anything else like that. Accept that your friend will need to find his or her own way and in his or her own time.This process is likely to continue testing your patience, but you simply cannot force the situation to click. It’ll click when the person is ready for it to.

, Grief often feels all-encompassing in a way that may make your friend put off going grocery shopping or keeping up with other errands that we all hate to do even when we’re not getting over a breakup. While you shouldn’t mother your friend completely, offering to pick up some basic necessities or even help with the laundry can mean more to the person than you might think.


By offering briefly to take something even so simple and mundane off your friend’s plate, you will help in a way most others won’t even offer., While you should allow the friend to work through the pain and sadness in the short term, don’t feel as though you cannot have fun together in the weeks and months after the breakup. Especially in cases of long-term relationships and cohabitation, being single again can feel a bit to anyone as though they’ve lost part of themselves or their identity. If you and the friend had standing dinner plans on the same night every week or other common friend rituals, resume them as soon as the friend seems ready.These gestures can reestablish a sense of normalcy that helps the friend move on.
Remember that getting over someone isn’t a perfectly linear process. Even after resuming fun routines, your friend will still have good and bad days.Resist the urge to push or cajole to get the process back on track. The friend is still seeking a safe, nonjudgmental place in your friendship., While not advisable, we all know it’s perfectly normal give in to a night or two of too much to drink after a breakup. However, as the immediate breakup turns into the long process of moving on, ensure that your friend doesn’t appear to be finding too much solace in drugs or alcohol.In addition to the risks of dependence, a healthy body will help lead to a healthy mind much more quickly, and no one sleeps, eats, or exercises enough when they party too often.

, Though your friend should not avoid or repress the pain and sadness of the breakup, those feelings often find other outlets in the weeks and months that follow. Channeling negative emotions into positive activities is a process referred to as sublimation. Find out the activities your friend is using to sublimate the hurt feelings and encourage them.The person might be exercising more, taking up painting or an instrument, or even doubling down on working toward a promotion. Offer your friend plenty of positive reinforcement for the productive ways in which he or she has managed the situation.

, In most people’s grieving process, anger comes after the confusion, denial, and sadness involved with a breakup. Anger usually means your friend has accepted the rejection and moved past the immediate loss. While your friend obviously shouldn’t be driven to negative or violent action based on his or her anger, being mad alone is not a sign of backsliding.


However, discourage your friend from thinking that all women or men are evil or fickle. Not everyone is evil when just one person hurts you.

, In the absence of being loved and needed by the ex, your friend may seek it in another, ill-advised relationship.. This is a terrible idea for the same reason that offering your friend too many distractions is a terrible idea—distraction versus dealing.


Try to dissuade the person from jumping into another relationship if it looks that way, but remember to approach it the same way you approached the person trying to contact the ex. In other words, don’t get so invested that you’ll be upset if the person does it anyway, and don’t forbid it so harshly that you tempt them to do it to spite you.

Write down all the pros and cons of your relationship.,
Re-think every fight you and your ex had.,
Consider ways you might have made positive changes.,
Be objective in your analysis.,
Accept that certain relationships would never be satisfying in the long run.,
Feel the freedom!,
Get your flirt on!,
Don't jump right into the next relationship.",How to Benefit From a Breakup," Did you have great movie dates together? Did your boyfriend/girlfriend never let you watch a certain type of movie or play a certain video game? Were they flirting with other men/women behind your back? What did you love about being in a relationship? What did you not love so much? These are all things you need to write down.;
, Think about what caused the arguments you had. Did you pick fights needlessly? Did s/he? Did you do things you knew might make your partner angry? Were you courteous and considerate to your partner? Respectful? Did you feel respected? It's very important to analyze the sorts of problems you had. Pay particular attention to recurring arguments - did you fight about the amount of time s/he spent with pals, versus the amount of time you spent together? Did you feel like you always had to give in and do what s/he wanted - or were you the one who always got your way?

, You knew this person well - were there things you might have done to help make things better? If there were, remember this: you cannot change someone else, but you can change your own behaviors. If making a few changes will not compromise your integrity or individuality to an onerous degree, make some changes next time around.

, When you look back on the relationship, it may be that you realize you were mismatched from the start - if you had only known then what you know today. Still, it's valuable to look back and know that even though this relationship was probably doomed from very early on, you can move on having learned to be on the lookout for the things that caused this breakup, and avoid them in the future.

, Lots of people seem to feel that they should keep on trying, even though they began having problems very early on. Let's face it - if you've only been dating for 3 months, and you're already bickering often, things aren't likely to improve. Why waste a year or more, trying to ""make it work""? Why not just accept that the reason we date someone is to find out if we're well-matched. When you can see that it's probably a bad match, why prolong the agony, wasting both of your time? Now that you have this relationship experience and breakup under your belt, you should be better prepared to make key decisions earlier on - if you have to bend too far to accommodate someone often - that's not a match. Bending once in a while is fine, but all the time means your interests are too far apart.

, Now that you're single again, you can finally do whatever you want, whenever you want! You don't have to worry about dates, anniversaries, or missing birthdays. This may just be the breathing room that you've been craving.

, Go out and meet some new people. Hit a local club, party, bar or that new restaurant you've been dying to try with your friends. Just don't miss out on the fun life has to offer because you're moping about your ex.

, Give yourself a little time to re-orient and let your own personality re-assert itself. A lot of times, we do a load of suppressing our own likes and dislikes for the sake of that new squeeze. After the breakup, there's no need to pretend you're into the Three Stooges any more if you really still don't get them. Take some time to breathe in your own space before you get involved again.

Encourage her in other areas of her life.,

Help her see her value.",How to Comfort Your Daughter After a Break Up," In order for her to effectively process her feelings and move on from her loss, she needs to be talking to someone about it.As her parent, you might hope it will be you, but understand that as long as you know she is talking to friends or someone else she trusts, do not force her to talk to you about it. Still, you can do your best to encourage her to talk to you with these strategies:


Be ready to listen to her wherever and whenever, even if it is inconvenient for you. She is in a crisis mode right now, so now is not the time to tell her “We’ll talk after dinner,” or put off the conversation. Drop what you are doing and be ready to listen.
Listen without judgment. Don’t provide opinions on what you are hearing. It may be obvious to you that this breakup is a very positive thing in your daughter’s life, for example, but now is not the time to let her know that. Instead, focus on listening to your daughter and try to be accepting of what she says. Avoid offering a “silver lining” response.
Reinforce that talking about it is healthy and will help her feel better.Express to your daughter that it’s okay that if she doesn’t want to talk to you about the breakup, but encourage her to be talking to others about it. Do not be pushy about making her talk to you if she doesn’t feel like it. Try saying, “I know how upset you are. When you’re upset, it’s really important to let those sad feelings out by talking to someone. Don’t keep them bottled up inside. It’s okay if you don’t want to talk to me about it. I hope you do, but it’s okay if you don’t. I just want to know that you are talking to somebody who is a good listener.”;
, Put yourself in your daughter’s shoes. Try to remember how you felt after your first breakup. Although your daughter might not feel exactly the same way as you felt, reflecting on how you felt after your first breakup may make it easier for you to show empathy for what your daughter is going through right now. Focus on your feelings for your daughter, instead of your feelings about the relationship or her ex. Remember that even if you are happy to see the relationship end, it is still a loss for your daughter.


Let her cry. Don’t tell her to stop or tell her, “it will all get better” or “this was for the best.” Just be with her while she deals with her sadness. Hold her or put your arm on her shoulder if she will let you.
Be supportive with statements like, “I know this must be very hard for you,” or “I’m sure this seems like the worst thing in the world right now.”
Now is not the right time to bring up the “bright side” of the breakup. For example, “Well, you never liked that family anyway,” might be true, but she might be in a place where she would instantly take her ex back, family and all, if she could. She will get to the bright side on her own eventually, and find her own positives about the relationship ending.

, Let her express her anger over the breakup. You can provide her a healthy outlet for this by listening to her with empathy.She is allowed to say whatever she wants about her ex, and you can nod and encourage her to tell you more.


You need to tread lightly about what you say about her ex, however. Do not go on a tirade about her ex and all the things you didn’t like about them, because it may make her feel worse that she was “blind” to all of these terrible things.
Make sure she is keeping her tirades off social media or isn’t badmouthing them in a way that will come back to haunt her.

, She might want some space from her parents, or she might want to spend lots of time with you. Go with the flow and understand that her feelings may change from day to day.


For example, you could say, “I know it’s not always the coolest to hang out with your parent, so don’t worry if you want to do something else. You’re going through a hard time right now, and I want to be able to support you however you prefer, whether it’s by spending time together or letting you do your own thing.”
Encourage her to spend time with her friends and plan some fun activities with them.Offer to help in any way you can to foster those connections for your daughter. For example, you could give her a ride to an activity or host a fun evening for her and her friends at your house.

, This is a loss and she will not bounce back from it overnight. It takes time to heal.Helping her understand the grieving process will give her perspective on her emotions. Encourage her to learn about grief and look at her feelings as a process she needs to go through, not feelings that will be around forever.For example, you could say, “You have been through a big loss, and your heart and mind are processing this loss. It takes a lot of energy to grieve a loss, but you have to work your way through it. That might mean crying a lot or being really tired. But it’s important to let the grief out, because it will be harder for you if you try to hold it back.”, Remember that we are not ourselves when we are grieving. Your daughter may be more disrespectful or distracted than usual.


Help her with details and staying organized. When people are grieving, it is often hard for them to find the energy to stay on top of bills, appointments, and other minutiae of daily life. They are focusing all their energy on the loss.Remind your daughter about homework assignments, family parties, or other details if you see she is struggling.
If her behavior seems beyond the normal range of grief -- for example, if she tells you she is drinking a lot, or if she gets suspended from school -- confront her on her behavior. Get or encourage her to seek professional help.

, Help her take her mind off her sorrows and plan some fun activities with her. This also is helpful to her grieving: she is able to see that she can enjoy herself again.This can also be good bonding time for the two of you. Some activities you might consider:


Try a new restaurant she’s been wanting to check out.
Take a day trip to a nearby town, or get away for the weekend.
Visit a museum you are both interested in.
Go walking, hiking, or biking together.
See a movie. (Let her pick -- she might want a good cry, or she might want to laugh.)
Go shopping.

, Be indulgent, particularly in the first few days after the breakup. It is a nice way to remind her that there are still people who think she is special and love her. For example, you may want to:


Indulge her cravings for her favorite foods. Stock her freezer with ice cream if it’s her favorite comfort food, for example.
Watch her favorite movies or TV shows with her.
Treat her to a pedicure.

, Self-care means taking deliberate steps to take care of your mental, physical or emotional health.While indulging cravings or binge-watching TV have a place, these actions are more numbing behaviors than self care (“numbing” meaning to avoid feeling one’s unpleasant emotions). Encourage your daughter to take care of herself in healthy ways, like:


Keeping a journal.
Exercising.
Taking a social media break.
Going out in nature.
Getting enough sleep.

, A romantic relationship is just one aspect of a person’s life, and isn’t the only important part of life. Encourage your daughter to explore other pursuits.


Encourage her to focus on her schoolwork.
Ask her about her job and encourage her career growth.
Tell her to take this time to focus on a sport or hobby. For example, if she is a runner, encourage her to train for a big race to take her mind off the breakup., Breakups are difficult and painful. Let your daughter know how impressed you are with her ability to deal with a hard situation. This can help her feel strong and resilient.For example, you could say, “You have really been through a lot lately with this breakup. I am so impressed with you are managing it. I know that it is been really hard for you, but I am so proud to see how you are working through it. I know you are going to get past this and be even stronger than before.”

, After the initial shock and grieving period wears off, you will probably hear your daughter start to rationalize the breakup. You might hear things like, “He was such a picky eater! We could never go to any interesting restaurants. I’d be stuck eating meat and potatoes for the rest of my life!” or “She was such a scary driver. I always feel like I got lucky when we arrived somewhere unscathed. I’m glad I don’t have to drive in her car anymore.” This is a good sign that she might be ready to think of the positives of the breakup.


Suggest that she make a list of all the good that has come out of the breakup, no matter how small and insignificant the items seem.Maybe she doesn’t have to deal with her ex’s stinginess anymore, or maybe she has learned to better stand up for herself.
Suggest she write a letter to herself to be opened a year from now, expressing all that she is feeling and going through. When she opens it a year later, she will most likely be amazed at how her life has changed and how much she has grown.
Ask questions to help her get some perspective on the situation and to help her figure out what she has learned about herself through the experience. For example, you might ask, “I wonder what you find most important about relationships now that you've been through this?” Or, “What are some characteristics that you would look for in someone new now that you know x about yourself in this relationship?”
Remind her that she will likely look back on this experience as a time of great learning and change, and not necessarily sadness.Though it seems hard now, she will bounce back.

, Her self-esteem has probably taken a hit after the breakup. Let her know how much she means to you, her family, and friends.


Remind her of all the good things she brings to the world: her sense of humor, her kind heart, or her strong work ethic, for example.
Remind her that she is far more than one person’s opinion of her.
Remind her of times when you know her presence made a difference. For example, “Do you remember how much all those little girls in your dance class looked up to you?” or “Your grandma always loved how you would visit her in the nursing home and do puzzles with her.”

Identify your motivation to marry.,
Reflect on your relationship patterns.,
Pay attention to your instincts.,
Talk to your friends.",How to Avoid Marrying on the Rebound1," A rebound marriage might be the result of an impulsive decision. To avoid acting impulsively, it is important to take a look at the reasons why you want to get married.Take some time to identify your reasons for wanting to marry someone.


Positive reasons to marry someone include your emotional connection, satisfaction with the relationship, and shared goals.
Negative reasons to marry someone include money, convenience, revenge, and sex.;
, Looking back at past relationships can also help you to determine whether or not you are moving too quickly.Think back to the relationships you have had before this one, how they started, how they progressed, and how they ended.


For example, you might notice that you tend to go for the same type of man or woman, such as a bad boy/girl, even though relationships with this type of person have not worked out. This could prompt you to seek out a different type of person to date.
Or, you might notice that you often move quickly in relationships, such as having sex right away. This might prompt you to wait longer than you usually would to start a physical relationship with someone.

, Although you might be trying to ignore it, you probably have a sense of whether or not remarrying is the right move. Consider any doubts you have about the person as evidence that the marriage might not work. If you have doubts, then it is likely that you will have problems down the line.For example, you might have doubts about the person who you are considering marrying because he or she is not a good listener. Or, you might have doubts because the person does not want to have children, but you do want children. These things are unlikely to change after you get married and could lead to a divorce.

, Discussing your feelings with trusted friends can help you to determine if you are moving too quickly in a relationship.Try sitting down with a friend and telling him or her how you feel and why you are considering getting married. Ask your friend if he or she thinks you are moving too fast.


Make sure that the friend is someone who will be honest with you and who will not sugarcoat things. Deciding to remarry is a big deal, so you need honest feedback.

Even if she isn't as polite as she could be, be the bigger person and accept the rejection.Just end the conversation with a simple, ""Okay, I'll talk to you later,"" or something like that.
When you see her afterwards, just smile and say hi.
Don't bring up the rejection again, at least for a while. She made her decision and you'll only pester her if you keep bringing it up.
Never insult or threaten her. It's this girl's right to decide who she wants to date, and she doesn't deserve to be insulted because she rejected your advances.;
, Getting rejected always hurts, and it's normal to feel bad about it. Don't try to suppress your feelings of disappointment, but rather allow yourself a few days to get those feelings out. After you go through this grieving process, you can get back to building your confidence.Everyone grieves at their own pace, and it's normal to feel sad for a while. If you can't seem to get over it or are feeling depressed for some time, however, you might be suffering from some psychological issues. Consider talking to a guidance counselor or mental health professional to get the help you need., Things always seem more serious than they really are when they first happen. It might seem like this rejection is a huge deal, but think about it a little more. How much does getting rejected for a date impact your life? Probably not too much.Remember that this rejection doesn't mean anything about you as a person. You're not a bad or undesirable person because one girl didn't accept your advances. All the good qualities you had are still a part of you. Once you realize that, moving on is much easier., Any time you're feeling down, doing nothing just makes it worse. This allows your brain to dwell on the problem. Instead, distract your brain. Watch a movie, go outside and walk or ride your bike, go to the mall with friends; anything you enjoy and that will keep your mind busy.It especially helps to do activities you're good at. This will help rebuild your confidence. For example, if you're great at basketball, go play a pickup game at the park. Your good performance on the court will help help improve your mood and confidence level.

, If you're still hurt, you won't be able to focus on being a friend. You'll still be wondering why she rejected you, what's wrong with you, etc. This could result in you lashing out or acting angry at her. It's much better to work on getting over the rejection first before moving on, or you could cause unnecessary heartache for yourself.

, Before trying to cultivate a friendship with the girl, question your own motives. Do you really want to be friends with her, or are you just hoping it turns into something more? Even if you still like her, you shouldn't be friends with her just in hopes of getting into a relationship with her. This will probably end up in more rejection if she gets into another relationship or still doesn't want a serious relationship with you.


Also, if she realizes you have other motives, she might think twice about being your friend too.

, Soon after the rejection, she may feel strange seeing you or talking with you. Show her that you've moved on and you're okay. Don't get tongue-tied or act shy. Talk about school, music, TV, and normal things you would talk with any other friend about. This will help her get more comfortable around you and view you more as a friend than a person she rejected.It's normal to be nervous about talking to her for the first few times after the rejection. Try reading Talk to a Girl for some ideas on how to overcome your nerves and hold down a conversation.
Start a conversation with her about something you know you have in common. For example, you may have a class together. Talking about the teacher or an upcoming test is a good way to get a conversation going. This will break the ice and show her that you're someone she can talk to normally.
Again, don't bring up the rejection. This will make her uncomfortable and she probably won't be too excited to talk to you.

, Any friendship requires mutual interests. When talking to her, try to find out her hobbies and interests. You may find that you like a similar band or sports team. This will give you a ready-made topic to talk about when you see her, and can also give you ideas on where to hang out with her.During one of your conversations you could casually bring up a band or something that was on TV the night before. Pay attention to her response and see if she is interested in it. If she doesn't like what you brought up, use that as an opportunity to ask what she prefers instead.
Learning about one of her interests will give you even more common ground with her and can help foster your friendship. However, you should only take up a hobby or interest if you legitimately like it. Doing something just because she likes it means that you're not being honest with her or yourself.

, Recently after the rejection, you shouldn't ask her to hang out with you alone. She might think you're just trying to trick her into a date. Instead, invite her to hang out with your friends. Tell her she can bring friends too. She'll probably be more comfortable around her friends and you too can socialize as normal friends would.Movies, sports games, bowling, and going out to eat are all great activities that can be done in a large group.
If your friends know about the rejection, make sure to tell them not to bring it up while she's around. An off-hand comment from one of your friends could make her uncomfortable and mess up what would have been a fun time.

, This will probably take a while, and may never happen. She simply may not be comfortable enough to see you alone, and there isn't anything you can do about it. You can still be friends if you don't see her one-on-one.


If you do ask her to see you alone, make sure she knows that you don't mean it as a date. Let her know that you just want to see her as your friend.
Also sticking to public places will probably make her more comfortable. She may get the wrong idea if you ask her to come watch movies at your house.

, Calling or texting her constantly will probably make her think you're still interested in her, and you'll end up annoying her. Treat her the same way you would treat your other friends. Would you call your other friends three times a day? Probably not. Remember, treating her normally is the way to make her your friend.There isn't a concrete rule on how much contact is too much, so it will depend on the situation. Paying attention to her responses will help you see if you're going too far. If she's giving you one-word answers, taking a long time to respond, and you're doing most of the talking, these are indications that she isn't interested in talking so much. Scale back the amount you contact her.
If she comes out and tells you you're contacting her too much, take this seriously and cut back.

, There are a few things that should be off-limits when you talk to her. Avoid bringing up her love life, her relationship if she's in one, the fact that she rejected you, and any romantic topics. Keep your conversations on safe topics.Of course you can talk about these things if she brings them up first. Let her take that first step to show that she's comfortable talking about more serious topics with you. Until then, don't push the boundaries or you risk making her uncomfortable.

, While it may be difficult to see her in a relationship with someone else, this is something you have to accept. You're not in a relationship with her and it's none of your business what she does romantically. Not respecting the boundaries of her relationship is rude to both her and her significant other.Don't insult her significant other or compare yourself to him or her. In fact, it's really best not to bring up her significant other at all unless she mentions him first. This will keep conversations from getting into inappropriate territory.
Sometimes people talk to their friends of the opposite sex less often when they're in a relationship. You might find this hard to deal with, but it's common and you have to respect her choices. Don't harass her if she withdraws from you after getting into a relationship. If you two became very good friends and she stopped talking to you altogether, then you could bring it up to her and say you're disappointed that your friendship has suffered. If you're only casual friends, however, let it go.
Never make further advances on her when you know she's in a relationship. While this would be inappropriate after a rejection anyway, it is especially disrespectful to do so when you know she's in a relationship.

, It's possible that after being your friend for a while, this girl may start liking you as well. If that happens and you're still interested, great. But don't make anymore advances until she expresses interest in you. This could ruin the friendship you've been working so hard to cultivate."
"
Consider the quality of your relationship.,
Go beyond physical attraction.,
Remember that people rarely change.",How to Avoid Marrying on the Rebound2," For a marriage to work, your current relationship should be high quality. If you are already in a relationship with someone and considering marriage, then you will need to take time to evaluate the quality of your relationship.Some other things you might consider include:


how well you work together
your shared interests and goals
how well you listen to each other
whether or not you encourage each other

, Physical attraction often brings two people together, but it should not be the basis of your relationship.Make sure that you have more than just a physical attraction and great sex before you decide to marry someone. These things are temporary and will not sustain your relationship.

, People do not usually change after marriage, so if you have problems now, then they are probably going to get worse after you get married.Make sure that you love the person as he or she is, even when he or she is having a terrible day! If you cannot accept this person on the good days and the bad days, then you may want to reconsider marrying the person.


For example, you might not be able to stand your partner when he or she is angry and this can make it difficult to work out any problems that arise in the relationship.

Decide if you want to get remarried at all.,
Consider getting to know someone as a friend before you date.,
Wait as long as possible to have sex.,
Think about moving in together before marriage.,
Keep in mind that rebounding can be healthy.",How to Avoid Marrying on the Rebound3," Keep in mind that marriage is not the only option for a long-term relationship. Many couples are opting not to get married at all.If you are worried about marrying someone on the rebound, then keep in mind that you have the option to have relationships without marriage.


If someone is pressuring you to get married, then try saying, “I care about you, but I am just not interested in marriage right now.”

, Emotional intimacy is the most important factor in a successful relationship.You should be able to talk to your partner about anything. One way to develop emotional intimacy is to spend time talking to the person. Spend time with your significant other as you would with a friend.


For example, you might go for coffee with the person and ask questions to get to know him or her better. Once you get past basic details, such as family, hobbies, likes, and dislikes, start asking about more personal things, such as dreams, fears, and life goals.

, Having sex within the first month of a relationship has been linked with lower quality relationships.Therefore, it is best to wait for as long as you can to become physically intimate with someone.


Try to wait for at least a month to have sex with someone you are dating. If he or she asks why you are declining invitations to have sex, you can say something like, “I just really like you and I want to get to know you better first.”

, Living with your significant other before you consider marriage might be a good opportunity to determine whether or not you want to get married to your significant other. Despite the findings of previous studies that indicated cohabiting was bad for relationships, more recent studies have shown that cohabiting before marriage can increase a relationship's stability and quality.Cohabiting also has other benefits that are similar to marriage, such as in increased sense of well-being, better health, and more social connections.If your partner is interested in moving in together, then you might want to consider it. It may help you to determine whether or not you want to marry this person.

, Although there are lots of negative possibilities associated with rebounding, there is also some evidence that rebounding is healthy for some people. Rebounding can help you to move past your ex more quickly than staying on your own for a long period of time.While you should still be cautious about remarrying, don’t be afraid to get into a new relationship.
There is no evidence that waiting to form a new relationship is healthier than forming a new relationship right away."

Stop making excuses for his behavior.,

Avoid magical thinking.,

Heal your heart.",How to Accept That He's Just Not That Into You," If a guy really likes you and is ready for and available for a relationship, it will be obvious to you.Otherwise, he is either stringing you along, is not ready for a relationship for some reason, or does not want to tell you the truth himself.


He may have gotten hurt in his last relationship and is still healing from that experience, or he may simply not be interested for whatever reason. It’s not your job to try to figure out why he’s not calling, or to try to fix the situation.;
, If you constantly have to reassure yourself that he’ll come around eventually if you just wait a little bit longer, you are likely in a one-sided relationship. Some say that distance makes the heart grow fonder, but most likely his distance is only making him seem more enticing to you, while he is free to come and go as he pleases.


Some behavioral signs to watch for include one partner taking an interest more than the other such as by doing things like asking about their life/day, inviting them to events, asking about what they like/prefer, etc. Another sign might be one person prioritizing the relationship more than the other such as by checking in about plans, thinking of the other person prior to making plans, setting aside time for phone calls or dates, etc.
If you find yourself listening to sad songs on the radio, and staring at the phone which may never ring, you are likely in a one-sided relationship.

, Often, actions speak louder than words, and when you stop making excuses for him and see his uninterested behavior for what it really is, you will free yourself to find a more balanced relationship with someone who deserves your love. After all, you deserve someone who can’t wait to spend more time with you, not someone who you have to convince to call you.


If you are unsure about his feelings toward you, are constantly questioning where things stand or whether he is in or out of a relationship with you, then he probably just isn’t that into you.If he tells you that he doesn’t know what he wants, take him at his word! He is not reciprocating your interest, and you deserve the type of relationship that doesn’t make you question your place in his life.If he calls you or wants to see you on the weekend, but drops off the face of the earth during the week, there is something going on. You tell yourself that he is busy with work or school, but when a guy is truly interested and committed to a relationship, he will find the time to reach out and communicate with you.If he talks about his ex often, he most likely isn’t over them yet and is therefore not ready or available for a relationship with you., The best way to cope with the pain of rejection is to not lie to yourself as if you don't care at all. Just accept the truth that you read his interest wrong and that you got hurt in the process.


Consider the possibility that your feelings for him have become inflated simply because they aren’t returned. We often want what we can’t have.Keep in mind that there are things you can't control. You can't make someone like/love you or even change their behavior, no matter how much you want to. They have to be willing to do that

, Your feelings are real and valid, and it can help to know that falling in love with someone is a perfectly normal, healthy human behavior. Even if the love is not reciprocated, acknowledging that you feel deeply about someone is important.


Talk it out with a trusted friend or a counselor to help you work through your feelings and to avoid the urge to suppress them just because they are painful.
Give yourself permission to think about how you feel about him, but try to limit your thoughts to just a few minutes each day, so that they don’t become all-consuming and obsessive.

, Think positively about yourself, and remember all of your good qualities, and all of the activities that you enjoy. Indulge yourself with a relaxing spa day, go for a hike on a beautiful day, or spend some time with a good friend.


Create a mantra. Think of a brief positive phrase that you can say to yourself when you are feeling down and need reassurance that it's all going to be okay. This can be something as simple as “keep your head up and your heart open”.Spend a few minutes each day meditating in a quiet place. Think about this experience as an opportunity for personal growth, and keep in mind that you won’t always feel this way. The way you deal with your loss will help you grow stronger as a person.

, Your value and worth as a person have nothing to do with his perception of you. Remember that his lack of interest in a relationship with you does not mean that you are not worthy of a great relationship with the right person. Never let someone else’s interest or lack of interest in you define your own self worth.Put yourself in his shoes. Unless he is a sociopath, he is likely not trying to hurt you. Have you ever had the experience of having to let someone down easy who you are not that interested in? Keep in mind that next time, you may be the person who is just not that into someone who has unrequited feelings for you.

, Once you have found some clarity regarding the situation, and realized that your feelings for him are not reciprocated, it is time to match your expectations of what will happen to reality. The expectation that today will be the day that he asks you out, wants to get back together, or finally realizes that you are the girl of his dreams only serves to keep you in the painful cycle of getting your hopes up and then disappointing you over and over.


Center your expectations of the day on things that you have some control over such as having lunch with a friend, getting to class on time, and enjoying some time outside in nature.
Begin each day with a positive outlook. Don’t allow yourself to pin your happiness on whether or not he reaches out to you. You have no control over how anyone else feels, acts, or behaves. By reining in your own expectations of what you believe should happen on any given day, you can give yourself some peace.Be open to any possibility. For example, if he hasn’t called you in several days, you can stop stressing yourself out with the notion that it might happen today. By letting go of the expectation, you release yourself from the pain of it not being fulfilled.

, Magical thinking is the tendency that we learn as children to romanticize everything, and to find extra meaning and purpose in a relationship when it really doesn’t exist. When you think that you have met “the one”, that fate has brought you together, or that the two of you are meant to be, it can be difficult to let go of the hope that he will eventually see that you are the perfect girl for him.


Take off your rose-colored glasses. Allow yourself to see through your idealized version of him and notice his flaws. The truth is, there is no “perfect” person or relationship. Magical thinking is unhealthy because it creates fairy-tale standards that no real person could possibly live up to.Let go of unhealthy beliefs and rituals, such as getting up on a certain side of the bed every morning in the hope that doing so will make him call you that day. Accept that there is no causation between your actions and his actions., When his lack of interest in a relationship has become undeniable, it's time to cope with the pain. Be gentle with yourself, as you are likely embarrassed and reprimanding yourself for putting your heart on the line. Remember that you are just a human being. We all have feelings, and hope for and have a need for love, it's in our nature...Forgive yourself because you never meant to hurt yourself.


Pamper yourself with a hot bubble bath or a trip to the nail salon.
Talk to your friends and family, and let them comfort you. We have all been in a similar situation before.
Take yourself out on a date to a movie you’ve been wanting to see.

, It can be rather difficult to swallow your feelings when you’re around him, especially if you work with him or have a class together. Rather than focus on him and your uncomfortable feelings, concentrate on doing your best work, or help someone else out with a project.


Make plans to be somewhere else right after class or work, so that you won’t have to worry about making awkward small talk with him.
Always be kind yet reserved when you do have to talk to him.

, Go ahead and remove his telephone number from your phone, so that you’re not tempted to call or text him. De-friend him on social media as well, so that can’t reach out to him that way, and there’s no risk of getting your heart broken all over again by seeing a picture of him with another girl.


Make sure that you delete his voicemails and texts too, so that you can’t go back and re-read or listen to them.

, Make sure that you get involved with new activities and enjoy your own life. Now is the time to sign up for that art class you’ve been wanting to take, or go on a trip somewhere.


Keep yourself busy with plans with friends as a way to cope with rejection/sadness. Develop a daily routine for yourself and spend time with your friends and family to get support.

, Having feelings for someone that are not returned is a painful experience. Give yourself plenty of time to heal and reflect on what you’ve learned about yourself. By taking the time for introspection and self-evaluation, you can take stock of what happened, and notice any patterns that tend to permeate all of your relationships.Release your regrets about what happened, and think of this as a time to mend your broken heart.

, By being open to seeing other people, you will probably realize that the guy who broke your heart wasn’t the right one for you after all. There are a lot of other fish in the sea!


Before you jump into a rebound relationship with another person, say to yourself, ""I am not hoping to meet the one. I am not in a fairy tale, and I am already complete. I don't need a guy to be happy.""

, You are perfect just the way you are; you are the most important person in your life. Build a life that you can be proud of and don't let any guy decide your value and worth for you. Love yourself and make yourself happy before loving anyone else!


Make sure that your heart is fully healed before you share it with anyone else. You may want to hold off on dating for a while.
Rebuild your self-esteem. Your self-esteem has likely taken a hit. Immerse yourself in activities that make you feel confident, such as playing your favorite sport or making dinner for your family.Set aside time in your life for the things that make you happy and fulfilled. Don’t forget to spend some time alone, too.
Be patient with the healing process. It can take some time for your heart to recover from the pain of unrequited love.

Just tell him no.,
Try a little less direct approach.,
Make sure you include the word ""no."",
Don't apologize.",How to Reject a Guy Who Wants Your Number1," You don't necessarily have to give him an explanation or a reason why. You can just tell him that you're not interested, or you don't want to give him your number. If you use this method, make sure you really don't want to keep in touch with the guy, even if you see him again.For instance, you could say, ""Thanks for asking, but I'm not interested.""
You can also just give him a number to stay in touch as friends, as long as you are abundantly clear about it. For instance, you could say, ""I don't mind giving you my number, but I would only do so as friends. I'm not interested in anything else right now."";
, If you want, you can take a direct, but not quite as direct approach. For instance, you can try to soften the blow by leading with something you like about the guy. That way, the rejection won't come as hard.As an example, you could say, ""You're really attractive, but I don't think I'm in a place to be dating right now. I have to say no."" This approach helps make it less about him, so he won't feel as hurt.

, When you're using the direct or indirect approach, ""no"" needs to be in what you say. If you hem and haw around it without actually using ""no,"" you leave him thinking he may still have a chance with you. You don't need to be mean, just direct.For instance, saying ""I'm not sure I want to date right now"" leaves it a little uncertain.
Instead, make sure you make it clear. ""I'm not interested in dating right now, so I have to say no.""
Be polite but firm. Thank the guy for his interest. Say that you're flattered he is interested. However, let him know that you're not looking for a relationship at the moment, and hence, you're not able or willing to share your number.

, It's a natural reaction. You want to apologize for making the person feel bad. However, you don't need to apologize for not wanting to give out your number. In addition, it can draw attention to the fact that you feel sorry for him, which in turn can make him feel worse."
"
Give out a fake number.,
Give out a hotline number.,
Use a friend as a boyfriend.",How to Reject a Guy Who Wants Your Number2," This option can be a little risky, since he can call it right then and see if it is actually your number. However, it can be a way to get someone to stop asking you out in an indirect way.Also, make sure the number you're giving isn't someone else's number. You can look up most numbers online to see if they connect to a person. You don't want to be giving out a person's number to a stranger.
If you happen to run into him again and he asks you about it, just ask to see the number, then say ""Whoops! Wow, I spaced out. I totally wrote down one of the numbers wrong."" And when he asks for the number again you can do the same thing. (If you're going to see him more than twice, it's best to just tell the truth.)

, Some hotlines have been designed specifically for rejecting guys. Others are just a silly way to give a fake number. Either way, you can use these numbers to hand out to the guys you meet so you don't have to give your number.Another option is the rejection line. It explains to the guy that you've given him a false number as a way of rejecting him with a bit of humor thrown in. The number is (605) 475-6968., Another option is to take a guy friend with you when you're out who's willing to pretend to be your boyfriend. That way, if you need to reject someone, you can use him as a decoy.


You could say, ""Oh, I would if I were single, but I'm here with my boyfriend."" It helps to grab your decoy boyfriend's arm at this point.

Use safety as an excuse.,
Use a boyfriend as an excuse.,
Turn the tables.,
Stay safe.",How to Reject a Guy Who Wants Your Number3," One way to sidestep the issue is to say that you don't ever give out personal information to strangers as a way of staying safe. Of course, this has an element of truth for most people, so you're really not lying.You could say, ""I'm sorry, I don't give out my number to strangers. I've had some bad experience with doing that in the past, so I don't give out my number anymore.""
If you make it so he realizes it's a general rule, he won't feel so personally rejected.

, Even if you don't have a boyfriend, you could use a pretend boyfriend to make the rejection easier. If the guy thinks you have a boyfriend, then it's nothing personal against him.As an example, you could say, ""I can't give you my number. I have a boyfriend."" Most guys will walk away without another thought at that point.

, Another way to sidestep the issue is to ask for his number instead. That way, the power is in your hands, and you can do with it what you want. Just make sure to take the number yourself. Don't hand him your phone, as he could use it to give himself your number.It may seem cruel to take a number just to blow the guy off later. However, if a guy won't leave you alone, it's a good way to get him to stop.

, Don't be afraid to walk away if you need to do so. If a guy turns hostile after rejection, get security involved and then leave where you are as soon as possible. It's always better to be safe than sorry.If you're not in a place that has security, tell management or call the police if you feel your safety is threatened.
It's also a good idea to go out in groups. While guys don't limit asking girls out to clubs, when you are going out to the club, take some friends with you.

Get some space from the person.,
Nurse your wounds with self-care.,
Journal about your feelings.,
Confide in someone you trust.,
Reframe how you look at rejection.",How to Accept Rejection When You Tell a Friend You Love Them1," If you want to preserve your friendship with this person, resist acting out on your emotions. Rejection can make you feel angry, embarrassed, and just plain hurt. Don’t react on impulse and take these feelings out on the other person.


Before saying anything more to the person, immediately take a few breaths to collect yourself. Don’t rush into making any decisions. Give yourself time to calm down first.;
, Being around the person may be especially difficult after saying the “L” word. Ask for some space to deal with your feelings. You guys can discuss how you want to move forward later. But, right now, it’s not going to do you any good to have to pretend and keep spending time with them.Say something like, “I need some time to come to terms with your reaction. I want to hang out again, but can you give me a few days?”

, It’s second-nature after a rejection to feel defeated. Counteract this by pouring on the love. Treat yourself gently, like you would a friend who’s got the flu. Treat yourself to a special lunch or dinner. Binge-watch your favorite TV show. Work off some steam in the gym. Do things that help you feel better.You may be tempted to reach for numbing substances like alcohol and drugs. These won’t make you feel any better.

I don’t know what to do.”

, Another way to cope with rejection is to change how you look at it. You may be viewing the situation as if there’s something wrong with you. Change this thought process by coming up with some realistic alternatives.For example, the person may have said “no” because they want to keep you as a friend—they don’t want to risk losing you if a relationship doesn’t work out.
Another way to look at it is the person rejected you because there’s someone else out there who’s a better match for you. You just have to wait to meet them.
Remind yourself that it takes a lot of courage to step up and declare your feelings. Admire that trait about yourself!

If you can’t think of any, you can find some by doing a quick search online.Examples of positive affirmations may be “I am good at many things,” “Lots of people love to be around me,” or ""I am a lovable person!""
Repeat these affirmations each morning after you wake and periodically throughout the day when you feel down on yourself.

, Your friend may feel uncomfortable hanging out with you after you revealed your deeper feelings. In a similar vein, you may still feel humiliated about the rejection. No matter how hard you two work to salvage the friendship, you may find yourselves spending less time together.


Accept that once love enters the picture, things change. Be okay with not spending as much time with the person, if that’s what either of you wants.
Your friendship might not improve until both of your are in fulfilling relationships, so be prepared for it to take a lot of time for things to get better between you.

Stay alert for warning signs of suicide.",How to Help a Friend Cope With Rejection," If your friend has just been rejected, she may not want to hear the things she could improve on in order to improve her odds next time. While there may be things that she’s said or done that contributed to the rejection, or her even if her job loss or her relationship with the boyfriend wasn't ideal, unsolicited advice may be difficult for your friend to benefit from at this time.For example, this isn’t the time to remind her that she spent a lot of time complaining about the job she just lost, or the man who just broke up with her.
Rejection can hurt regardless of the circumstance, so being a good listener is an effective way to help a friend cope with this initial sting.
If your friend says that she doesn’t know what she’s doing wrong, and asks you for help figuring it out, then you might offer a gentle suggestion.;
, You don’t want to be too quick to talk about the “opportunity for growth” inherent in a rejection, but at the same time you might help your friend find ways to benefit from the experience. There are always positive aspects to any situation. Sometimes it takes a friend to help you find them.For example, if she didn’t get the job she wanted, now she’ll be able to attend the family vacation she’d been looking forward to.
Being single means having more freedom. Having a story rejected for publication means being able to submit it somewhere else.

, One way of supporting your friend is to help him navigate his pain. Ask him how he’s feeling, and affirm that his feelings are okay. If he knows that he can share painful things with you as a friend, without being rejected, this may help him feel better.Saying things like, “It sounds like you’re pretty broken up about things,” can help him feel supported.

, If your friend was deeply wounded by the rejection, she may not have words to articulate how she feels. She might just want to sit quietly with you. Being present and showing that you’re ready to listen when she’s ready to talk will be enough.You can always offer a hug, or a gentle supportive touch.
Talking about something other than the rejection, or doing an activity together are other ways you can offer support for a friend who’s not ready to talk about her feelings yet. For example, try going on a hike, or playing video games together.

, Rejection is a side-effect of trying something new and brave. Even if it ultimately didn’t work out — the guy stopped calling, she didn’t get the role in the play, she was turned down for a promotion — she deserves credit for trying to get what she wanted.It can help to remind her of the chances she had of rejection. For example, writers often paper their walls with rejection letters because they are so common. Even famous writers collect hundreds of rejection slips before publication.
If the rejection was for something that had a low chance of rejection — an anticipated job offer, for instance — you can remind her that although she didn’t get it this time, she can try again.

, After all, everyone experiences rejection, repeatedly, over the course of a lifetime. Going out for the team, applying for colleges, trying to get the perfect job, or asking out the person you’ve been into all summer are all opportunities for rejection.Even though every rejection feels personal, most of the time it’s just a matter of bad timing.
It really doesn’t matter how smart, funny or talented you are — everyone will experience rejection. If it helps, find people who’ve eventually succeeded and look at the number of rejections they experienced.

, It can be helpful to remind your friend that he's not the only one who’s had rejection. Sharing your own rejections — the jobs you were fired from, the rejection slips you’ve received, the relationships that didn’t work out — can help your friend feel more normal and less alone.At the same time, you’ll need to be aware that your friend’s experience might be very different from your own. Don’t talk too much about yourself, and don’t claim to know what your friend is feeling.
Never say, “You will…” or “You should..” to encourage your friend. Although these phrases might seem supportive to you, they’re likely to be misunderstood by someone trying to cope with rejection.
Instead, you can share how you coped with a rejection experience similar to what your friend is experiencing, and then state that everyone has their own way to cope with rejection.

, While your friend may have qualities that could use improvement, she certainly has positive qualities too. Remind her of what others appreciate about her. Offer specific examples that she can’t argue with.


For example, reminding your friend of her great sense of humor right after she’s cracked a dark joke about her situation can help her notice the truth of your statement.
Don’t go overboard on compliments, or say things that you don’t really believe. Your friend will pick up on your insincerity.

, Being able to accept the rejection will help your friend move on to the next chapter in his life. If you’re helping hims to cope with the rejection, take the rejection at face value.No one can predict the future. Maybe the person offered the job will refuse it, and he’s next in line. Or maybe his ex will change her mind. But holding out hope for a dramatic turnaround isn’t productive or practical.
You don’t have to insist that he definitely won’t be offered the job, or that his ex won’t be changing her mind. Simply stay quiet, without agreeing. He’ll get the message.

, Rejection is a universal experience: some people will like us, some people won’t, and there’s very little we can do about it. Not every person we fall in love with will feel the same way; we won’t get every job that we want.Encourage your friend to divert her attention to someone who might return her affection.
Remind your friend of what she’s done recently that has earned positive attention and praise.

, What are some of the things that your friend used to enjoy before the rejection? Find ways to get him interested in some of these things again. Make a point of spending time together, going on hikes, watching sports games together, or going to movies.If the rejection meant a loss of income, your friend may be financially stressed. Make sure that you’re finding things to do together that don’t require money, which may only make him feel worse.
Try to avoid doing things together that might trigger memories of the rejection.

, Some of the signs of depression include getting angry about small things, or being uncharacteristically moody and irritable. Changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping too much or not being able to sleep, can signal depression.Your friend may not seem like herself, even long after she should be “over” the rejection.
You may notice loss of interest in things that she once enjoyed.

, If your friend is starting to talk about death and dying, listen carefully. Saying things like, “I might as well be dead,” or “Why don’t I just end it all and put everyone out of their misery,” may signal suicidal thoughts, even if said lightly.


If you believe your friend is in any risk of harming himself (or someone else) you should talk to him directly about this. Ask him, “Are you thinking of hurting yourself?” He may deny it, but he may be grateful for the opportunity to talk.
If you feel that he’s unsafe and in a crisis situation, you should call 911 for emergency support.
Encourage him to seek help. If your friend is suffering from clinical depression, he may not be able to recover without treatment. Talk to him about what you’ve noticed, and explain why you’re concerned for him. Let him know that you’re willing to help him make an appointment, or attend a support group.
Remember that you can’t force him to seek help. If he’s not ready to seek treatment, let him know that you’ll be available to help him whenever she is ready.

, The warning signs of suicide are too often recognized only in hindsight, but they’re surprisingly common. If your friend is experiencing untreated depression following her experience of rejection, she may be at risk of suicide. If you notice significant increase in the signs below, talk to a medical professional or counselor immediately. If this is an emergency situation, call 911. Some warning signs include:


Obtaining the means to commit suicide, such as stockpiling medicines (for an overdose) or purchasing a gun.
Sharply increased use of drugs or alcohol.
Giving away one’s belongings, or taking urgent steps to get all affairs in order, when there’s no apparent need to do so.
Saying goodbye to people as if they won’t be seen again.
Doing very risky or self-destructive things.
Showing signs of personality changes, severe agitation or anxiety, especially in combination with some of the signs listed above.

Be absolutely clear that the excuse is not about your personal value.,
Quell the voices of self-recrimination.,
Let yourself cry and wallow for a short time.",How to Get Over a Guy That Dumped You for a Lame Reason1," Devaluing yourself as a result of the guy's breakup excuse is allowing the negative voices in your head to get the upper hand. He has used an excuse to try to get out of a relationship that he no longer wants to pursue, for his own reasons, not because you are less of a person or unworthy.;
, When you start telling yourself ""If only I had..."" this is a warning to stop. Nobody can reinvent the past and going over many different scenarios of how things could have been different if only you had made certain changes, spoken differently, being someone else, whatever, is unhelpful at best and destructive at worst.

, It's okay to cry and feel down temporarily. Everyone needs to let emotions through. However, don't let it drag on incessantly; life goes on, change is inevitable and Mr. Right might not see you for those swollen eyelids.


Cry indoors, away from prying eyes. If you cry in public, you will feel like you're making a fool out of yourself. If you feel like you're about to burst out in tears in the classroom or in front of his friends or siblings, quickly pop out to the bathroom, cry a little, then wash your face and get back to it.

Revisit your friends.,
Turn up to events with friends if he is going to be there.",How to Get Over a Guy That Dumped You for a Lame Reason2," Keep your friends around you and spend plenty of time with them. Talk things through with your most trusted friend or friends but don't go on about the excuse or the breakup with people in your wider circle, as it can be overkill and make everyone feel worse. Instead, let everyone know that you're free to spend time with them again and that you are up for activities together.

, For moral support, don't go to events alone when you know he will be there too. Tell your friends that you're worried you might feel weak in his presence and say or do something you might regret and have them monitor things for you.


Have a friend on speed dial in case you need to quickly talk about your feelings in the case where you accidentally bump into your ex and feel like taking things out on him or crying in public.

Realize that after breaking up, keeping your ex as a friend is a danger zone.,
Be friendly if you want to be but don't overdo it.,
Give yourself at least a week apart before attempting to see one another again as ""friends"".",How to Get Over a Guy That Dumped You for a Lame Reason3," For some people it may work but for many, it is a minefield and if you harbor any feelings that he didn't really mean to break up with you and that his excuses can be proven wrong, then you are dallying with unreality. Guys rarely exit a relationship with the intention of being proven wrong; they've made up their mind already that it isn't working and they're moving on.

, When you see one another again, it's up to you whether or not to acknowledge him. The reality is that it pays to stay polite but distant. A simple ""hello, how are you doing?"" is fine. On the other hand, a ""hey, do you miss me and wish I were back by your side and giving you my kisses?"" won't do either of you any favors.


A simple smile or wave is sufficient if you can't muster any words. He doesn't need to know you're cut up in inside; that's what your friends are for.

, By then, hopefully you will have started to sort yourself out. If so, try talking to him in a friendly way––about anything except your former close relationship. Don't put too much pressure on him; just have quick chats and don't follow him around or be clingy. Give it a couple more weeks and you two may just develop a better platonic friendship.

Respect yourself enough to not want to do bad things to your ex or to flirt outrageously.,
See things from his perspective.,
Try to give it a break for a while.",How to Get Over a Guy That Dumped You for a Lame Reason4," Acknowledge that it is sad, disappointing and painful when someone stops caring about you intimately after a close relationship. But you cannot change the person or change their mind. Remember that you are not the lesson he needs to learn; he has already made up his mind and trying to make him ""see reason"" is not your role. Ditch any thoughts of revenge or proving yourself irresistible; you will only confirm his decision.

, Maybe he liked you a lot but was confused at the time and truly not ready to commit; if so, at least he has had the courage to liberate you to move on. Be considerate of his feelings, he's trying to get over you too. And don't think that because he hasn't cried or looked at you, or seemed upset, he's forgotten about you. He's probably trying the best he can to distract himself from getting upset because he doesn't want to show his emotions.

, Don't go running after him and asking questions or give him a big hug. Just stick to the smiles and waves for now. Spend time with your friends, hobbies and family. Make some goals for your future. If it gets really bad, go for a trip somewhere to get fresh perspective. In time, you will heal and you'll be ready to look for someone who is ready to commit and leave the lame excuses behind.

Do not call, text or email them. If they reach out to you, do not reply. You can even consider blocking them if you feel tempted to respond. You should establish no contact for a minimum of 90 days while you detach emotionally from them.If you have children or assets together, this will not be possible. But you can limit your interactions to only those that are absolutely necessary.
If you feel like reaching out to them, write them an email but don’t send it. The process of getting your feelings into words will be cathartic without you running the risk of opening your wound even further.;
, Unfollow or delete the person on Facebook, unfollow them on Twitter and Instagram, and cleanse their pictures from your social media profiles if you find that helpful.


You can also unfollow their friends so that you don’t run the risk of seeing a picture or post about your ex.

, Though they have been an important part of your life for some time, and your body and brain are used to having them around, know that seeing them will only set you back. Avoid places that you know they frequent. Take a different route to work or class. These small inconveniences will help you heal much faster.


If the person loves going to the gym early Saturday, only go during the weekday. If the person loves going to the local farmer's market, try to go really late or early if you have to go.

, Say ""hi"" the way you would to a friend, have a short, impersonal chat, and say goodbye. Being rude to them will not make you feel any better nor will lingering around to rehash old feelings.


Keep the chat at one or two minutes max.
You might say “Hey, how are you?” and allow them to respond. Then you can say “I’m doing good as well. Great to see you!” and then you can walk away.

, You may be feeling completely miserable following this separation, which is normal and understandable. Though smiling and laughing might be difficult, fake it until you make it. Research shows that telling yourself that you are happy and behaving as if you are happy actually does improve your mood. For the time being, even while you are still hurting, still put a smile on your face for the world., True healing can only come if you allow yourself to feel your emotions rather than constantly stifling them. However, you should not allow yourself to wallow. Set aside private time every day to think about the breakup. Don’t hold in your tears, but instead allow them to flow, freeing you of some of the sadness that you are carrying.Every day, devote less and less time to grieving. You will eventually find that you think about the breakup less and no longer need lots of time to process or grieve.

, Writing things down can be a powerful release. It's called ""catharsis,"" where you purify your mind through expression. Write about whatever you want to write about, be it the breakup or any other issue you are going through. You'll feel a lot better after you do.

, Breakups can leave you feeling at your lowest. It is common to blame yourself after a breakup, and this may damage your self-esteem. This is why it is important to remember your strengths during this time. Take some time to think about all of the good qualities that you possess. Write them down and remind yourself of them daily.You might consider writing them on sticky notes and putting them all over your room or house.
Strengths can include humor, intellect, beauty, persistence, diligence, or compassion.

, Remove all the memories of the person from your everyday life. Remember that you're not trying to pretend like the person never existed, just trying to remove the reminders which are currently painful for you.


Go through your room and remove all pictures, letters, and references to the person you're trying to stop obsessing over.
Removing is different from destroying. Don't burn or destroy any objects associated with the person, unless you're sure that you never want them to be any part of your life in the future.

, Go the gym or get outside and sweat. Physical activity increases the amount of serotonin in the brain, which acts like a natural antidepressant and improves your mood. It's okay to eat ice cream and milkshakes every once in a while, but it's best to have a diet rich in fruits, veggies, lean protein, whole grains, and water. These will not only make you look fantastic, but feel fantastic as well.Take some group fitness classes or hit the gym with a buddy.

, Laughter is truly the best medicine. Take some time to engage in the things that make you laugh. Watch films that you find hilarious, revisit some of the funny memes you’ve seen on social media, or call up one of your humorous friends.Try to avoid funny things that will remind you of your ex.

, Whether you choose to go hiking, surfing, or dancing, take some time for yourself to do new and exciting things. Enjoy your new freedom and independence. Take this time to do all of the fun things that your partner never wanted or enjoyed doing with you.


For instance, perhaps your partner never wanted to try Indian food. This is a perfect time for you to do so.
You might also consider linking up with people who also want to try new things, such as by finding a special interest group on Meetup.com.

, With this change in your life, you might also want to change up your look as well. Reinvigorate your look by getting a haircut, color, or style change. Clean out your wardrobe and give away anything you no longer wear. Buy yourself a few new and fun outfits.


Consider getting a facial or a massage. Massages can help to release the tension in your body.
Get a pedicure or a manicure.

, During this time of grief and sadness, don’t forget to tend to your other responsibilities. Continue to work hard at your career or in school, but don’t add any new tasks to your plate at this time. Make sure you are remaining connected with family and friends so that you don’t lose those crucial support systems.


For example, make sure that all of your bills are paid and that your house is clean.
Even completing a small task can help to make you feel like you are making progress and moving on with your life.

, Your friends are there to help you, comfort you, and have fun with. Do everyday activities with your pals. Plan a movie night either in theaters or at home. Go to the zoo, to the beach, or out to dinner. Accept their invitations when asked to hang out. Remember the fun you used to have with them and try to recapture that part of your life.Lean on your friends as you deal with a broken heart. Have a talk with your best friend about your heartbreak. Confide in them. Give yourself a chance to vent to someone who completely has your back.
Try to spend less time with your and your ex’s mutual friends and more time with your own friends.

, Use this time to reinvent yourself by exploring potential areas of interest for you. Remember that it is never too late to be the person that you have always wanted to be. Explore new hobbies, try new foods and live a life of excitement and novelty every day.


Pick up a new skill. Try doing something you know little about, so it forces you to engage in the world in a different way. Try glass-blowing, ceramics, a new instrument, or cave diving.
Read a book every night before you go to sleep. You might never have read books, but nothing moves you outside of yourself better than a book. It will help you heal.
Invite friends to try these new things with you or do them alone.

, Give back to your community through volunteering. Volunteering will help you see the real impact you have on people's lives, and should show you how fortunate you are to have everything you do. Consider finding a local homeless shelter, soup kitchen, nursing home or school to volunteer at.Research local organization with missions that align with your passion and volunteer with them.

, After whatever time you deem necessary, you might feel ready to date again. Be sure you've fixed some of the issues you had in your previous relationship, and try not to make the same mistake twice!Don’t feel the need to be serious right away.

, If you have the time, resources, and desire to care for a pet, then this might be another good way to improve your life. Having a pet takes a lot of time and responsibility, but it can be rewarding. Consider adopting a cat or dog for companionship.


Having a pet may also help you to connect with other pet owners. For example, if you walk your dog or take him to the dog park, then you will probably encounter other people with dogs who you can talk to.
Keep in mind that caring for a pet is a big responsibility. Do not take on a pet unless you can afford his food, veterinary care, grooming, and other expenses. Also, make sure that you are allowed to have a pet where you live, such as by checking with your landlord if you rent.

Do it quickly.",How to Handle Rejection," You are going to feel upset because of a rejection, whether it's having your manuscript rejected, an idea rejected at work, being rejected by a potential romantic partner. You are allowed to be upset about that, and, in fact, it's healthy for you to give yourself some to time to process and grieve.


Take some time out of your life to process the rejection. For example: if you can take the rest of the day off work, do that. Or if you were planning on going out that night, stay in and watch a movie instead. Go for a walk after an upsetting letter rejection, or allow yourself to binge on that chocolate cake.
Make sure that you don't go overboard and spend days sitting in your house wallowing in your misery. That will only make you feel worse in the long run.;
, Now, this is not to say you get free rein to shout your pain about the rejection from the rooftops. This will only tell people (your potential publisher, that girl that you liked, your boss) that you're whiny and dramatic and can't handle life. So get a trusted friend/family member or two and talk it over with them.The friend you want is the one who will tell it to you straight. They can help you sort out what went wrong (if anything; sometimes there aren't things you can change and you should just let it be). They can also make sure that you stay on track with your grieving period so that you don't start wallowing.
Avoid getting on social media to air your grievances. The internet never forgets and when you're trying to get that fab new job, your employer might check the internet and see that you don't handle rejection well. No matter how upset or angry you are, just don't.
Don't complain too much. Again, you don't want to wallow in the rejection, otherwise you're going to work yourself up into a state of righteous (or depressed) fervor. Don't start in about your rejection every time you're talking with your friend. If you think you've gone overboard, make sure to ask them ""Am I dwelling on this rejection too much?"" If they say yes, adjust accordingly.

, The earlier you accept the rejection and attempt to move on from it, the easier a time you're going to have. It will also mean that you won't let rejections in the future absolutely flatten you.


For example: if you don't get that job you were really hoping for, allow the appropriate time to be upset and then let it go. It's time to start looking for something else, or examining what maybe you could change for the future. It's good to keep in mind that when one thing doesn't work out, something else usually will and usually in a way you didn't expect.

, Remember that the rejection says nothing about you as a person. Getting rejected is part of life and it is not a personal attack. For whatever reason the publisher, the girl, your boss, wasn't interested in a particular thing.


Rejection isn't your fault, per se. The other person (or people) was rejecting something particular that didn't work for them. They were rejecting the request, not you.
Remember, they can't reject you as a person because they don't know you. Even if you've gone on a few dates with someone, that doesn't mean they know everything about you and are thus rejecting you as a person. They are rejecting a situation that doesn't work for them. Respect that.
For example: you asked out that girl you really liked, and she said ""no."" Does this mean that you are worthless? Does this mean no one will ever want to date you? No, of course not. She simply isn't interested in the request (for whatever reason; she could be in a relationship, she could be not interested in dating, etc.).

, You need to get your mind off the rejection after the appropriate grieving time. Don't immediately get back to work on whatever it was that was rejected, because you'll still be dwelling on the rejection. You need a little space and time from it.


For example: say you sent a novel manuscript off to a publisher and it got rejected. After grieving for a bit, move on to a different story, or take some time trying your hand at different writing (trying out poetry, or short stories).
Doing something fun can be a great way to get your mind out of the rejection and to help you other focus. Go out dancing, buy that new book that you really wanted, take the weekend and go to the beach with a friend.
You cannot let rejection bring your life to a screeching halt, because you are going to have lots of instances of rejection in your life (as everyone does). By moving on with your life and doing other things, you aren't letting rejection ruin your life.

, Remembering that rejection is not about you as person, it's time to re-frame your rejection into something else. People who talk about ""being rejected"" tend to take rejections more poorly than people who re-frame the rejection into something that focuses on the situation itself, not them.For example: If you ask someone on a date and they say no, instead of saying ""they rejected me,"" say ""They said no."" This way you aren't framing the rejection as something bad about you (they aren't rejecting you after all, they are saying no to a proposition you made).
Some further examples of ways to re-frame the rejection are ""the friendship grew apart"" (instead of a friend rejected you), ""I didn't get the job"" (instead of ""they rejected my job application""), ""we had different priorities"" (instead of ""they rejected me"").
One of the best ones to use is ""it didn't work out"" because it removes the blame from them and from you.

, When something doesn't work out, that doesn't always mean you should give up, but it's important to recognize when it's time to give up and move on. Often not giving up, actually means, moving on from that particular instance, but trying again in a more general sense.For example, if you asked someone out and they said no, not giving up means not giving up on the idea of finding love. Move on from them (do not hound them to give you a chance), but don't give up on asking other people out.
Another example: if your manuscript gets rejected by one publisher, it is good to stop and reflect on what it was that didn't work for them, but you should keep trying with other publishers and agents.
Always remember, you are not entitled to a ""yes"" response. Since it doesn't invalidate your existence to be rejected, don't turn it around and blame someone for the rejection.

, Rejection, as has already been said, is a part of life. Trying to avoid it, or dwelling on it will make you unhappy. You need to be able to accept that things don't always work out the way you want them to and that's okay! Just because one thing didn't work out, doesn't mean you're a failure, or that nothing will work out.


Each instance is unique. Even if that one guy said no to a date, it does not mean that every guy you are interested in will say no. Now, if you start to believe that you will always be rejected, you will! You will set yourself up for failure each time.
Keep yourself going forward. Dwelling on the past rejections are going to keep you mired in the past and won't let you enjoy the present. For example: if you keep thinking about the number of times you were rejected for jobs, you're going to have a hard time sending out resumes and pursuing different avenues.

, Sometimes rejection can be an important wake-up call and can help you improve your life. The publisher might have rejected your manuscript because you still need to work on your writing (it might not have been publishable, but that doesn't mean you'll never be publishable!).If you can, ask the person who rejected you to give you some feedback on why they weren't interested. For example: maybe your resume wasn't up to snuff and instead of going off in a huff and saying no one will ever hire you, you ask the potential job what you could do to improve. They may not get back to you, but if they do they might offer you valuable insight for your next attempt.
For a relationship you can ask why they aren't interested in dating you, but it could be something as simple as ""I just don't see you that way."" There's nothing you can do to change their mind, so the lesson here is how to deal appropriately with that disinterest and how to keep being positive about the potential for a relationship in your life (even if it isn't with that person!).

, It's time to let that rejection go. You've already given yourself time to grieve, you've talked it over with a trusted friend, you've learned what you can from it, and now put it in the past. The more you dwell on it, the bigger it will become and the more you'll feel like you can never succeed.


If you find yourself really and truly unable to let go of the rejection, you will need to seek professional help. Sometimes thought patterns (""I'm not good enough,"" etc.) get entrenched in your psyche and each rejection only furthers the entrenchment. A good professional can help you move past that.

, This can be a hard one for a lot of people, especially women, but you are under no obligation to say ""yes"" to something you don't want to do. Of course there are caveats; when the flight attendant says ""sit down"" you do so.


If someone asks you on a date and you don't want to go with them, you can tell them in a straightforward manner that you simply aren't interested.
If your friend really wants to go on a trip that you don't want to do/can't afford, it won't destroy their world if you say no!

, One of the best ways to reject a proposal is to be as direct as possible. Don't be cagey or talk around it. Direct does not equal mean, although some people will take it that way. There isn't any way to reject someone's proposal (of anything: a date, a manuscript, a job) without giving some pain.


For example: someone asks you out and you aren't interested. Say ""I'm really flattered, but I don't feel that way about you."" If they won't take the hint, get angrier and tell them in unequivocal terms ""I am not and will not be interested and the fact that you won't leave me alone is making me even less likely to ever be interested.""
From the second example above, when your friend proposes the trip say, ""Thanks for thinking of me! I really can't afford to go on vacation, even for a weekend. Maybe next time."" This way you don't cut off possibility of future fun, but you tell your friend straight up that you don't want to go without saying ""maybe"" and things like that.

, While you don't owe anyone an explanation, it can help the person whose proposal you're rejecting if you're specific about why you aren't interested. If there are areas of improvement (especially in things like a manuscript or a resume) you might mention those as things that could work on.


For a relationship one, simply tell them that you're not interested and you don't feel that way about them. If they press for more reasons, tell them that attraction and love aren't things you have control over and that they need to accept that you're not interested.
If you're rejecting someone's poem from your magazine (and you have time), explain what about the poem didn't work for you (poem structure, clichés, etc.). You don't have to say that it was terrible, but you can say that it needed some work before it was publishable.

, By doing the rejecting as soon as possible you aren't letting emotions build up and fester. It's like ripping off a band-aid (to use a cliché). Within as short a period as possible, explain to them that the proposal (a trip with a friend, a date with someone, a person's manuscript, etc.) doesn't work for you.


The more quickly you do it, the more quickly they will be able to get over it and use the experience to improve.

Realize that no matter what led to this event, you remain a good and worthy person.,
Remove reminders.,
Let out your emotions.,
Let others know.,
Spend time with people who care about you.,
Take that honeymoon.,
Learn, forgive and grow.,
Give him (or her) the engagement ring back.",How to Get Over a Broken Engagement," For whatever reason, it is an outcome that has forced you to see a different future. And while right now it is hard to see a path ahead, there is one, and likely it is one that includes the right person coming along when the time is right. Do not begin to think that you are never going to find someone ""as good as him/her"" again. You will, it just doesn't seem like that right now. And resist the temptation to find yourself unworthy in any respect. It is a situation of two people not working out rather than you as an individual not working out.;
, Anything that reminds you of your ex-fiancé needs to leave your surroundings. This is important so that you can move on and let go. That means either throwing it away (if you cannot bring yourself to return it) or putting it in a box out of the way. Get someone else to return items of value and sentimental interest to your ex-fiancé if you cannot face seeing him or her right now; this is kinder than junking it. Be the strong one.

, Cry if you see fit and perhaps wallow in your sorrows for a few days. It is OK to feel rotten; this is life-dashing stuff you are experiencing. However, set yourself a deadline to pull yourself up and get ready to make a new life for yourself. Every ending has a new beginning, that is the way of life, the world and the universe.

, After you have a good grip on yourself, inform anybody that was aware of the wedding (if a date had been set) that one will no longer be held. The sooner this is done, the better, so that airfares can be redeemed, accommodations canceled and gifts returned. If you already have gifts, be sure to send them back promptly with a kind ""thank you"" message.

, Go and spend time with friends and family to get your mind off your broken engagement. You need to be around people who support, love, and cherish you right now. And you never know, during times like these, you often find one person who has been through just what you're going through right now. Let them reach out to you; they'll have good advice to share, as well as being living proof you'll get through fine.

, Even if you hadn't yet booked one, it is a really super idea to grab a friend or even go it alone and take a break somewhere away from your hometown. Go and do something different, something wild, something unique. The difference will do you a lot of good. And while you're away, remember to relax and totally pamper yourself. If you want that gold bracelet and triple decker chocolate ice cream, now is not a time for holding back.

, An engagement is made of two people. Trying to see fault on either side is a situation that will feed resentment and hold you back. You might want to see him or her as being at fault but it is more likely that both of you saw signs along the way but chose to plow on regardless. Analyze a little but don't over-analyze. Accept that both of you might have done things differently but that perhaps this is a sign that it was not going to be a match made in heaven and it is better to know now than later. Be grateful you have had the experience, wish the other side well, and work on letting your forgiveness override blaming either yourself or the other party.

, If you have one, this is not only fair but wise. You don't want to hold onto it, and if you sell it, you may feel rotten.

Accept you will be sad for awhile.",How to Get Over Your First Love," You may think that you should eliminate your ex from your thoughts altogether. However, this strategy can very easily backfire. If you try to force yourself not to think about something, you'll only think about it more. Instead of trying not to think about your ex altogether, limit the time you spend thinking of them. This is a more sustainable strategy.Choose a certain time in the day where you can thoughts of your ex out of your system. You could, for example, think about your ex for half an hour every morning. If you're having trouble coming up with memories, try listening to a song or thinking about a movie the two of you loved.
After this, try to avoid thinking about your ex for the rest of the day. If thoughts creep back in, say something to yourself like, ""I've already thought about this today. I can save these thoughts for tomorrow."";
, If you're reeling from the loss of a first love, you may be prone to catastrophic thinking. For example, you may think things like, ""I'll never love anyone again"" or ""I'll never be happy again."" When you catch yourself engaging in such thoughts, stop and challenge them.No two relationships are alike. You're right to think you'll never feel exactly the same way again. However, this does not mean you'll never love or be happy again.
Be realistic. Most people do not end up with their first love. Think about your parents, friends, or other family members. They probably all experienced the loss of a first love, but ended up in healthy relationships later on.
Remind yourself that, while things are difficult now, in all likelihood you will love again and be happy again, even if it takes time.

, Remind yourself of what you have going for you right now. Think about things like your friends circle, job, interests, and passions. While you may not have the romance you want right now, there's a lot in the present to focus on.Do things to keep you grounded in the present. Take up a new hobby. Join a club. Volunteer somewhere. Join a gym. Anything that can keep you in the present moment can help.
New memories can help you get over the past. Taking concrete steps towards making new, better memories can help you let go of your ex.

, It's very difficult to think positive when you're not caring for yourself. You may find it hard to sleep, exercise, or eat right after heartbreak. However, you need to keep up with basic self-care. This will allow you to stay strong and avoid negative thinking.In addition to sleeping and eating right, give yourself treats. Do not be afraid to baby yourself slightly after a breakup.
Have a night out with your friends. Order takeout. Go for a long walk or bike ride. Watch a movie you love.

, You can learn something from every relationship. It's all a process of growing and changing so you can find a healthy, happy longterm romance. When striving to get over your first love, look for any negative patterns you should work on breaking in your next romance.Think about why the relationship ended. Is there any way you could have behaved differently? Is there any reasons the two of you weren't compatible? Why were you drawn to this person? Was it for the wrong reasons?
Most of the time, relationships end because two people are just not right for each other. You can take this as an opportunity to examine how you can pick someone more compatible in the future.

, You don't have to shut out all thoughts of your ex. With time, you may be able to smile on some of what has occurred. Love can trigger wonderful, happy emotions, and your first love will always be special. If you find yourself smiling at a memory, allow yourself to enjoy this rather than shutting the memory out.You can find strength in old memories. You can look at them as a way to remember yourself as a loving person. It can be healthy to remember your best loving self.
Old memories can also help you feel better on bad days. You may suddenly remember some encouraging words from your ex when you're feeling bad about yourself. It's okay to embrace the good memories, as long as you do so while acknowledging the relationship is over.

, First loves can be a wonderful experience. You learn a lot about yourself and are able to experience love for the first time. However, people have a tendency to romanticize their first experience with something. There is likely nothing special about your first relationship beyond the fact it was your first. Remember, you are wired to place first experiences on a pedestal. You do not want this mentality to get in the way of embracing the present.You may remember experiences with your first love in a somewhat inflated manner. In new relationships, this may result in a tendency to compare current feelings to past feelings. However, think about your first experience with anything. You probably inflate these experiences as well. Your first day at a new job probably felt very exciting, but chances nothing that different happened that day than any other day.
Instead of seeing your first love as the perfect partner, view your first love in terms of experience. You learned how to love someone and be in a romantic relationship. However, the person you were with is likely not the one and only person for you. You are simply wired to romanticize the memory because it was your first.

, Reflect on what you learned during the relationship. Think about what you liked about yourself in the relationship. Did you learn to be more selfless? Did you learn how to care for another person? Even though the relationships over, do not disregard it as a failure. Most romantic relationships you have in life are, in a sense, practice. Value what you learned about yourself and your capacity for love instead of trying to forget the relationship altogether., In the wake of loss, you often forget your bigger goals in life. You may think losing your first love means you've failed on the goal to find a loving relationship in life. However, look at your larger goals in terms of relationships. One failed relationship does not mean you've failed on your goals.Revisit what you want out of life. In addition to finding a loving partner, think of other goals. What kind of career or education do you want, for example?
One loss does not mean you have failed. In fact, the vast majority of people face a lot of loss and rejection on the path to larger goals. You do not need this one particular person to eventually reach your goals.

, Many people feel getting involved with someone else will help them forget their first love. While a new relationship can help distract you from thoughts of the current one, you're not likely to find relationship success this way. Instead of jumping into a new romance, take some time to reflect.Think about what you want out of a relationship. Think about the ways your need were and were not met. This will help you figure out how to find a more suitable partner in the future.
Many people jump from romance to romance, hoping to find the right person. However, if you're not okay on your own, you will not be able to have a functional romance. You need to grieve your first love and figure out what you want for the future.

, Look for a friend, family member, or c-worker who has also suffered heartbreak, but moved on successfully. Try to model your behavior off of someone who does not need a relationship to feel fulfilled and happy.Find someone who does okay on their own. You want to lean on someone who does not need a relationship to feel fulfilled.
Once you've found someone, think about how they cope with heartbreak. Look for the ways they stay independent and strong after a relationship ends.

, While you may want to move forward, it's important to acknowledge your feelings. Take steps to feel better, but accept sadness is a normal part of the process. Getting over a first love is hard, and even if you're doing everything right it will not happen over night. Do not beat yourself up for having bad days. This is normal and it will take time to move on.Don't panic if a reminder of your ex leaves you feeling bad. If you try to hard to avoid the bad feeling, you may make it worse.
Instead, accept that you're going to feel sad for a bit. Let yourself cry if necessary. Get the bad feelings out so you can continue to move forward.

Rescuing and animal from a shelter can offer a greater bond and sense of self-worth since without you the animal may have gotten put to sleep.

",How to Combat Loneliness," Apply the same sort of wisdom toward your social interactions if you want to develop relationships with other people that are rewarding, fun and interesting. To do this, you're going to have to examine why as well as how you are lonely.

, Think about and write down how you feel about being lonely. Example: I have no friends as most have gone away to school, my current friends aren't interested in what I find interesting now, I want to be able to call up someone to do X with and have them show up, I need a date and don't have quality dating candidates in my life now etc. You may discover that you do have existing friends that just don't know you're lonely - this is an area you can work on by just reaching out to them and asking them to do the things you want to do! It's so easy - especially in an economy where people are losing their jobs or for any given reason don't have (or wish to spend) the money they used to spend doing the same things. Lives change, people change and with that can come separation. You may have also decided that someone you considered a friend really isn't a friend after all. This is not uncommon as sometimes people violate our friendship and trust and while we should forgive them for our own peace of mind, we do not have to put up with bad behavior. There is nothing wrong with cleaning house in the friend department; just don't make yourself suffer loneliness as a result since there is no reason to do so! There are plenty of great people out there that are probably in a similar situation and have things in common with you. Determine why you're lonely so you can turn it around.

, In other words think about the things you enjoy doing and how you want to interact with people. Do you have specific interests or hobbies you'd like to share with a friend or a few friends? Are there new experience in life that you know exist but you have yet to experience? Thinking about the ""how"" of loneliness will help you determine how to go about meeting new people that are most likely to share common interests, even if it's dating.

, don't isolate!) by setting goals to meet new people based upon what you've discovered about the why and how questions you took the time to answer and explore. Examples of this are: ""I'm going to do X in order to find people I want to date"", ""I will find new people to do X with at least once a week (i.e. go to the movies or watch a movie in, discuss a book, have coffee, take a walk etc.).

, This will help your opportunity to make new friends greater than it will be if you sit home and do nothing. See the tips section for some information on internet sites that organize meet ups for people with common interests. Set some goals around what you want your social circle to look like and what types of things you want to be doing that you are not currently taking part in.

, you just don't have the same things in common anymore with your old social circle of sorts) Meetup.com is an excellent way to find people in your area who are interested in the things you are be it a particular genre of books, music, meditation, karaoke, video games and (gasp) singles groups that go out and meet up (thus the name meetup.com). Check it out - you might just find something that describes your new hobby even if you don't know it's your hobby YET!

, As well, it doesn't cost much if anything to clean and getting organized has an immediate pay off that releases these great hormones in our brains that make us feel great. It also encourages having people over after to smoothly show off our shiny digs. If you are living in a mess now, invite a couple of people over now so you have a deadline to get things done. If you don't have people to invite over, don't know how to clean or would rather take your time in getting organized, http://organizedhome.com, www.flylady.net and housekeeping.about.com are great sites for all things cleaning/organizing. To some this could sound a bit odd but you can really help yourself by tidying up, deep cleaning (if applicable) and getting organized. It gives you something to do and you might find some things that you no longer need or use that you can donate (blankets, towels go to an animal rescue, coats to the needy etc.). In addition, a disorganized or messy living space can keep you from wanting to invite people around. Clutter or messy living can also lead to (or be a symptom of) depression which also can become isolating.

, Even some web based contact with the world (i.e. using your iPhone, Blackberry etc. to communicate to the world via Twitter, Facebook or Myspace can give you more social contacting than staring at a wall and may lead to actually meeting people). Plus, calling a friend will often help if you're in a social slump.

,, Be brave! People are almost always willing to have a friendly conversation. The proof? This article and millions like it exist!

, People can be just awful and some far worse than others. Don't put up with your ""friend"" that steals from you/takes advantage of you, talks smack on you behind your back or even treats you like trash. If you have an issue that can be worked out, you know it can be worked out though if you have discovered that your friend has changed in a bad way (become involved in drugs, theft, lies etc., turned out to be someone you don't like or just a jerk) it is FAR better to have no friends at all than one that will hurt you with no regard for making amends or getting help. I'm not saying to ditch a friend during bad times rather don't let yourself become a doormat for someone amoral. I promise you will lose so much more than you gain and actually may suffer much pain. You can find people who will appreciate you for you. Never allow yourself to be used or treated poorly over and over!

, Be sure, however, if you are going to do this you seriously think about it for the sake of the animal and do not do it on an impulse. Rescuing an animal from a shelter can offer a greater bond and sense of self-worth since without you the animal may have gotten put to sleep.

Forgive and forget.",How to Forget a Person," You cannot forget someone if you still see him or her all the time, or constantly hear about his or her activities. Consider these strategies:


Make sure you won't run into this person during your day-to-day activities. If you go grocery shopping at the same time, or take the same route home from work, tweak your schedule slightly so a chance meeting becomes more unlikely.
For right now, avoid social gatherings where you know he or she will be present. Politely explain to the host that you hope the event goes well, and that you are staying away only because you want to avoid a painful encounter.;
, In today’s day and age, the people we associate with are more often than not through a screen. Even if you don’t see the person, it’s far too easy to see what they’re up to. Though it may seem harsh, remove him or her from all the forms of social media that you use.


Delete his or her contact information from your phone and email account
Block his or her Facebook profile, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
Take any other measures to prevent unwanted contact. If necessary, change your email address.

, Something terribly interesting might have happened, but you do not need to hear about it. If your friend forgets and accidentally mentions this person to you, gently remind him or her of your request, saying something like, ""I'm sorry, Jane, but it's too upsetting for me to think about Bill. Maybe we could talk about something else.""


However, you may wish to add an addendum to this policy: sometimes learning the right things will help you find closure. Maybe this person has taken up smoking, moved to a different town, or lost their job. Let your friends know that if they think knowing something may help you find closure, they should say something.

, Purge your life of anything that brings up painful memories of this person. Not looking at these things every day will help you move on.


If you can't bear to get rid of certain items, bag them up and ask a family member or close friend if you can store them in their house, away from easy access. Request the items be kept out of your reach for at least 6 months.
Go through your MP3 player and delete any songs that remind you of him or her. Replace them with encouraging, upbeat tracks that encourage you to be confident and forge ahead.
If you have a child or a pet with this person, obviously you cannot just get rid of them. Instead, focus on the things you have done to nurture this being and give it a good life.

, Recognize that wanting to take revenge on someone (by making him or her jealous, upset, or sorry) still qualifies as thinking about them. You can't move on and forget if you're obsessed with vengeance, so learn how to let it go.


If you believe in a higher power, karma, or some form of cosmic justice, reason that he or she will get the appropriate payback eventually.
If you do not believe that someone else will dole out payback on your behalf, make peace with the fact that life is not fair. This person may have hurt you unjustly, but that does not give you the right to act out.
Remember the old George Herbert quote: ""Living well is the best revenge."" Going on with your life and refusing to sink to the other person's level communicates to him or her that you will not be affected by what happened, essentially rendering it insignificant.

, If you have tried everything and still cannot resist thinking about him or her, try a new approach. Set aside a limited amount of time (such as an hour or two) to sit down and write out all your feelings about what happened. Once time is up or you've run out of things to say (whichever happens first), close the document and put it away somewhere. Next time you are tempted to dwell on this person, tell yourself, ""No, I've already expressed my feelings about that. I won't waste time by doing it again.""


If absolutely necessary, grant yourself 10 or 15 minutes each day to feel emotional. When those minutes are up, tell yourself you’ll think about it tomorrow. As the days tick by, you’ll need fewer and fewer of those minutes. Even noticing that you need fewer and fewer minutes will help you feel good, too.

, Luckily enough, you control your thoughts. If you don’t want to think about something, you don’t have to. Busy yourself with school, work, or a project that will keep your mind focused. When you have other things to think about, they’ll fade into the background.


If you do find yourself thinking of them, shift your attention. We all daydream and find ourselves thinking things we’re surprised we’re thinking. The second they creep in your mind, tell yourself you’re not going to think about it, or that you’ll think about it later (hint: you won’t need to). Find someone to talk to, a game to play, or anything else that can keep your attention, even if it’s just for a few minutes – that’s all you’ll need.

, Trying to forget a person is a set up for mood swings and depression. Right now you may feel like you’re in a very vulnerable place. The last thing you need is outside stimuli that cultivates this emotion, so keep the music you listen to upbeat and only watch feel-good TV or movies.


Ask your friends to keep this in mind, too. They can help keep things light and airy to keep your mind off of things. When you need the boost, call them up, and they'll know just what to do to make you feel better.

, Odds are this person you’re trying to forget did you some kind of wrong. In the end, they didn’t value you like they should’ve. This is the type of person that shouldn’t be in your life anyway. By valuing yourself, it’s much easier to realize that. They didn’t treat you right and that’s that. You only surround yourself with people who do.


Keeping in mind your self-worth will make it much easier to get the ball rolling. Remember: you're awesome! The whole world is in front of you and just bubbling with opportunities. What are you going to do next?

, Keep yourself on the right track by replacing the time you would have spent with this person (or would have spent thinking about him or her) with a new activity. Take up a hobby you have always wanted to try, join an intramural sports league, or start a new form of exercise. Whatever it is, it should be so interesting and engrossing that you can't manage to think of anything else while you're doing it.


Mastering a new skill and bettering yourself will make you feel good. You may even feel like a new and improved person that’s too good for the person you’re forgetting, improving your self-esteem. Improving yourself is the best thing to do in this situation for you, your self-worth, and your peace of mind.

, Have you ever gone through one of those periods where you can’t seem to stop eating junk food and all you want to do is sit on the couch and watch terrible reality television? And the kicker is that it doesn’t feel good – being lazy and unhealthy feels pretty terrible. Eating right and exercising makes it much easier to feel energized and positive about your circumstances and yourself.


Have a diet that’s mostly fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Get a balance of fiber, protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats (like the ones found in fish, nuts, or olive oil). Stay away from processed junk that gives you a kick initially, but in the end just slows you down.
Aim to exercise for 30 minutes a day, whether it’s walking, swimming, running, or even dancing or cleaning the house. Do it in small chunks if your schedule doesn’t allow for large chunks of time. Even small efforts, like parking far away from the entrance, will add up over time.

, The best way to keep your mind busy, your schedule busy, and yourself positive, is to surround yourself with fantastic people that genuinely care about you. Whether that means your mom, your sister, your best friend, a theatre group, or your basketball team, stick with them. They’ll keep you laughing and help you see that you have a million things going for you.


When you feel like you’d rather hole up and hide under the covers, allow yourself to be a homebody for an hour or so and then put a stop to it by saying yes to that invitation and going out and being social. You won’t feel like it initially, but by the end of the night, you’ll be glad you did.

, The human brain is wonderfully self-healing. The old adage “time heals all wounds” has always been true and always will be. Naturally, the brain starts focusing on the here and now, forgetting the past and often modifying it how it sees fit. So if it’s been a few weeks, relax. These things take time. Your brain will do the job for you if you’re patient.


The grieving process is natural and, in most cases, has to be gone through. There are 5 stages, and they may take a while to complete. Be patient with yourself – you'll see progress as times passes.

, In the end, forgetting someone is virtually impossible to do if you can’t forgive them. If you’re following all the above steps and still can’t manage to forget, work on forgiving instead. They’re just a human and things happen. Life goes on.


Don’t forget to forgive yourself. For many of us, we hold grudges against ourselves more easily than we hold grudges against others. Remember that at the time, you did what you thought was right. They did, too. No one is to blame or is at fault. The past is in the past and it’s going to stay there. And that is for the best – this way, you’re free to move on.

For example, never kiss and tell, and when people ask what you do for a living, tell them you dabble in a bit of everything.

, Take pride in your appearance and present yourself in a way that commands respect. Wear nice clothing, keep your hair coiffed, stay well-groomed and maintain your physique through exercise.

, Stay socially active and keep a log of female acquaintances that you can call on to spend time with.

Decide whether you want to live in complete solitude or partial solitude.,
Find a location away from large populations of people.,
Purchase all the equipment you'll need to help you find a location, and make it livable.,
Prepare yourself physically and mentally for this journey.,
Once you arrive at the small airport near your destination, rent a vehicle, find a guide (who will be sent away later with the vehicle), buy weapons (they'll most likely be legal in any place you choose to settle in), buy lots of food, water and equipment.,
The journey begins!,
Now that you are all by yourself, find a place to unpack your heavy bags.,
Whatever geographical location you've chosen, you will have to travel a lot until you get to a good place of settlement.,
Once you are settled in an isolated place away from those annoying humans, you have water and food available, and there is no danger for your life, enjoy the silence.",How to Begin Living in Solitude,"


Complete solitude - living away from any other human beings, and relying only on his skills to survive in pure nature. (i.e. that person will have to get his food and water, find a place to settle, and guard his health all by himself, without the help of other humans, but may rely on animals)
Partial solitude - find a place to settle near, but not very close, to a certain village or any similar settlement, with a very small population. This way the person will have the option to get his food and water from others.;
, Fortunately, there are still several parts left in the world where you can live in solitude:


rain forests (South America, India, Australia)
northern areas (northern Scandinavia, northern Canada, Siberia)
mountain areas (Tibet, Africa)
on a sea or ocean

, You will need money, tents, and camping items. If it's possible, take a weapon with you, a ""cold"" one and a ""hot"" one. Remember that you are traveling one-way, so buy the right ticket and take EVERYTHING you need with you. Take important things that will help you survive in extreme weather and conditions, like first aid kits, ropes, knives, and a flashlight. What you don't need are stuff like toothpaste, shampoos, etc.

, Prepare yourself with the idea of not returning to your friends, family and home. This is a one-way journey. Whether you will return home after some time or not shouldn't be your concern before taking this trip, but only after you have experienced life in solitude - then you will find a way to return.

, Use the guide to ask for tips and recommendations. Be smart, this is a critical step in your journey. Are you ready to dive into the solitude?

, Travel with the local guide into the area which will best suit for life in solitude. Under absolutely no circumstances tell him about your plans. Remember that you are just another adventurer looking for new, undiscovered places on earth. Travel with the guide until you will feel that you don't need him. Then send him away with the vehicle or back to the vehicle.

, This is the hardest part of the journey. If needed, use the tent for the night, and keep your weapons close.

, For your place of settlement, you have several choices. The most important thing, regardless of the place you choose: silence, and the feeling of total solitude.


For a cave, the hardest part is to find a safe one which will suit you. Remember that you need fresh water and food near your settlement, and you don't want any dangerous animals around. Equipping the cave and preparing it for long settlement will be difficult, but not as hard as finding one.
A hut or an igloo or something similar is a good choice, but the tricky part is to construct it. It will be extremely hard to build a wooden hut all by yourself, but it has to be done. Have you brought an ax and a saw? Chop down a few trees and start working. Choose a location close to fresh water and food. A hut can be built almost anywhere.
A tree house is a realistic choice. You have to know how to climb high trees and build a wooden hut on the branches. The tricky part is to find a good stable tree(s) in a good location.
Boat: A larger boat will have better chances to survive a storm. The optimal choice is an abandoned army battleship - there is lots of place, it is as stable on water as a building on the ground, and usually the equipment is inactive. Sailing and being surrounded by water is proper solitude, and you can always sail to a quiet port town to trade fish for food and water.

, Meditate a lot, develop your own martial art or write a philosophy. Do the little things you couldn't do before. Without those watches, computers and other gadgets, time will walk at your pace and won't fly by unnoticeable, just like in early childhood. Isn't that great?

Consider the health benefits of being single.,
Appreciate your freedom to spend your time how you want.,
Consider the financial benefits of being single.,
Enjoy the ability to maintain friendships and create new ones.,
Savor the less frequent, but more enjoyable sex.,
Know that you have the ability to seek out romantic relationships if you want to.,
Ignore media depictions of happy couples.,
Focus on becoming the best person you can be.,
Treat yourself.,
Surround yourself with supportive people.,
Encourage yourself.,
Become an optimist.",How to Be Single and Happy," Being single is associated with a decreased risk of adverse health effects from dysfunctional marriages or intimate relationships. Some studies have shown that bad relationships can actually make you physically unhealthy. But singles are more likely to be fit and healthy. Singles also tend to go to the gym more, eat better, and have lower stress levels.Single people tend to be thinner than people who are in a relationship. One study found that people gain an average of 14 or more pounds after starting a relationship.Single people also get more, good quality sleep than people who share a bed with a partner.Single women have better mental health than married women, especially married women who have children.;
, When you are in a relationship, you can’t disregard the needs and desires of your partner. Sometimes you have to do things that you don’t want to do in order to keep your partner happy. But when you are single, you can spend your time how you want. You don’t need to worry about pleasing anyone but yourself. That means that you have more time for your hobbies, personal interests, career, and overall well-being. Enjoy this freedom while you are single!








Spend extra time on your hobbies. Did you want to write a song? Climb a mountain? Finish that big history book? Now is your chance! Make goals for yourself, and feel proud of your new accomplishments. Do something fun for yourself.
Work hard at your school or career. When you're single, it's easier to put in more work, because no significant other needs your attention. Try taking on an extra project, or putting additional effort into a difficult part. Enjoy the raised eyebrows as you impress people with what a hard worker you are.
Pamper yourself. Give yourself some extra care, and set aside time just for you. Read a good book, take a long hot bath, put on your fuzziest bathrobe, and listen to your favorite music. Now you can take extra good care of yourself.

, When you are in a relationship, you may have to deal with a spouse who is irresponsible with his or her money. This can cause financial problems for you as well. But when you are single, you don’t have to worry about anyone else’s spending and saving habits. You can use the money you earn how you want to use it.







, When you are in a relationship, it is much harder to maintain relationships with friends and make new friends because your partner consumes most of your time and affection. But when you are single, you have more time to devote to your friends and to go out and meet new people. Remind yourself of this when you are feeling down for being single. Consider the relationships that would suffer if you had a significant other who occupied most of your time and energy.








Work on the relationships you care most about, and build yourself a strong support network. Spend time with your loved ones, talk about your life and your fears, and you will feel more and more loved.

, When you are in a relationship, you may have sex every day or at least a few times a week. When you are single, your sex life may be much less active than that. But studies have shown that although singles tend to have less sex, they enjoy it more than people who are in a relationship.







, If you are still having a hard time seeing all of the benefits of being single, keep in mind that you can always seek out a romantic relationship if you are truly unhappy. Being single is not for everyone and some people thrive when they have the love and companionship of one person. Remind yourself that you can always seek out a relationship if you prefer.









Consider an online dating site to find people who are also looking for a committed relationship. Seeking out others who are interested in a relationship and not just casual dating may save you from some heartbreak later down the road.

, Part of the reason why some people may feel unhappy when they are single is because of media depictions that reinforce the idea that we need to be in a relationship to be happy. Try your best to ignore this message because it is not true. Avoid romantic comedies and magazines that reinforce the idea that being single is bleak and being in a relationship is bliss.









Depictions of being a single woman may be just as troubling because they are often idealized (a superwoman who has it all) or villainous (a sad lonely woman who has nothing). Neither of these depictions are realistic, so do your best to recognize them as false representations of what it’s like to be single., Being single is an opportunity to focus on yourself and work towards your ideal vision of who you want to be. Take classes, work out, grow a garden, do volunteer work, go to therapy, or do whatever your heart desires. Just remember that everything you do should be for you!









Concentrate on yourself while you are single and figure out what you like and don't like. Developing a stronger sense of who you are will help you as you go through life and it will also help you to identify people who you would be truly compatible with(if you ever choose to enter into a relationship again).Take up a new hobby! Learn guitar, join a tap class, grow a garden, write a novel, cook some gourmet meals! Whatever you've ever wanted to do, do it now. Trying something new can lead to new skills, friendships, and increased self-esteem.

, It is important to maintain a positive self-image while you are single. Buy yourself a new outfit, get your nails done, treat yourself to a spa day, or get a massage. Just because you don't have someone to impress or please doesn't mean you should stop doing nice things for yourself. You are a strong, independent person who deserves the best. So give it to yourself!








, Whether you’ve found yourself in the middle of a dating cold streak or recently gotten out of a serious relationship, spending too much time alone has the potential to make you feel even worse.Try to make plans with people as much as possible. If you don’t feel like any of your friends are supportive, consider joining a club or a gym to make some new friends.









While being supported by others might seem like a luxury that not everyone needs or can afford, psychologists now know that strong social relationships are actually essential to emotional well-being and physical health.So while you don’t necessarily need to be in an intimate relationship with another person to be happy, feeling supported by a group of people who you trust can be an essential part of being single and happy.

, Say things that you like about yourself to help yourself feel happy. Positive daily affirmations can help you to feel happier day by day. Take a few moments every day to look at yourself in the mirror and say something encouraging to yourself. You can either say something that you believe about yourself or something that you would like to believe about yourself.Some examples of positive affirmations include:









“I am intelligent.”
“I am a caring friend.”
“People enjoy spending time with me.”

, Being optimistic can help you to feel happier whether you are single, married, divorced, or widowed. Practicing optimism will help you to stay focused on the things that you like about yourself and your situation and stop dwelling on things you don’t like about yourself or your situation.








For example, instead of dwelling on something you dislike about being single, remind yourself of all the things you do like about being single, such as being able to flirt without feeling guilty and being able to do what you want with your free time.
Try keeping a gratitude diary. Every night, think of three things you are grateful for and write them down. Doing this every day will help you to develop a more positive outlook over time and it can even help you to sleep better and enjoy better health."

Stop blaming yourself for how things ended.,
Give yourself some time to be sad.,
Understand that being single will feel weird, foreign, and uncomfortable at first.,
Remove pictures, items, and memories of your ex from regular view.,
Mix things up with a vacation, furniture shuffle, or a new outfit.,
Rekindle and strengthen your friendships and support network.,
Recognize and be proud of yourself, knowing that you aren't defined by who you're dating.",How to Be Single Again1," It does not matter who ended things, or who said what. If you broke up, it meant that one or both of you weren't right for each other, and though it is hard to acknowledge, this makes the break up a good thing in the long run. But that is for down the road -- for now, the only thing to remember is that this isn't your fault. Relationships are a two-way street -- and it is no one's fault when they don't work out. So stop beating yourself up. It's not worth the emotional energy., Everyone is going to be telling you ""it's going to be fine,"" ""you were too good for him anyway,"" and other platitudes to try and cheer you up. But the truth is that you're going to be sad, and fighting it off or ignoring that sadness will only make it last longer. The trick isn't to avoid sadness but put a deadline on it. Let yourself be sad for a week or so -- eat the ice cream, watch the sad movies, and have a good cry. But once your week is over, it is time to pick up the pieces and move forward.There is no right amount of time to be sad. However, you should not let your sadness destroy your everyday life and other relationships.
While colloquial, there is some evidence that most people feel ""normal"" again after roughly three weeks.

, But you must also know being single is not the weird part -- you're just adjusting to something new. Being in a relationship impacts almost every part of your life, so losing that constant force may make everything feel different and strange. But this is just your brain and body shifting into single gear -- it has nothing to do with your decision, or a permanent change in your personality., Constant reminders of your old relationship will make it much harder to feel single. You don't have to throw anything away if you don't want, but put it all in a box in the basement for the time being. Even if you don't think you need to get rid of stuff, or feel bad doing it, you should do a light purge.


Invite a sympathetic friend to help out if this is emotionally difficult. It will take half the time, and you'll have a support system to boot.

, Don't go out and change your whole life now that you're single, of course. But a few cosmetic changes, ones you might not have made with a partner, make the rest of the changes in your life much easier to swallow. Even a weekend trip or hike can be enough to shake off some of the sadness and see things in a different light.


Changing your surroundings, even temporarily, is a good way to put your ""normal life"" in perspective, helping cope with your difficult or painful emotions., If you have good friends, they've most likely been passively but patiently there for you throughout your whole relationship. Use this time to go out and make up for all those lost times and declined invitations. Now, you have the chance to bond with your old friends and the freedom to make new ones. Friendships are very positive, and the stronger they are, the more they'll help you get through this tricky period., Being single is a blessing, and it is a vital part of growing up and learning more about yourself. The states of singleness found between intervals of relationships can be the most rewarding times in your life. These are the times when you grow stronger and redefine your priorities and interests as an individual. Good luck, and cheers to the new you!"

Go easy on the conversation.,
Don’t make it awkward.,
Keep a friendly contact.,
Never take sides.,
Use your friends as wingmen.,
Look to your phone.,
Invite someone new.,
Have other conversation in mind.,
Change your scenery.,
If you’re a third wheel, know why.,
Be in control if you’re the only single one.,
Be a part of the planning.",How to Be the Only Single One in the Group," The worst feeling as a third wheel is never knowing how or when to be a part of a conversation between two romantic partners. Sometimes it’ll feel like you’re stuck on somebody’s else date, and maybe you are. So don’t be afraid not to participate when it doesn’t feel right.Naturally, always speak when spoken to. Don’t be purposefully un-talkative or it might come off as rude.
Chime in every once and awhile, especially in conversations the topics of which don’t involve their relationship. If they start talking about future plans, or reminiscing together, feel free to opt out.;
, While it may certainly be an awkward situation for you, nothing will compound the awkwardness worse than acting awkwardly in response. Not butting into conversations that seem personal to the relationship is important here; being comfortable with your single-dom is crucial here as well.


Don’t point it out. You may feel compelled to make light of your situation by addressing it outright: “Feels weird being the only one here without a girlfriend;” “Always awkward being the third wheel, right?” Don’t make it seem any more than a conversation between friends.
Let them go on in conversation. Sometimes being around others in a relationship will mean hearing about those relationships, possibly for a long time. Accept the situation and let them talk. It’s better than shifting the impetus of the conversation to yourself.

, When the couple you’re with is droning on to one another, or friends in relationships are chatting endlessly about fun couples activities, it’ll help to have a friend to text during the boredom. Use them to blow off steam about the awkwardness or poor conversation.

, If you’re stuck with a couple who has begun a disagreement, things can get uncomfortable fast. Many times couples will want you to weigh in on their squabble; don’t. You’ll only alienate one or the other of the people you’re with. Be upfront about your neutrality.


""Hey, let's not do this now. Try to keep it civil, we're out to have fun!""
""I'm not going to be roped into your argument; why don't we try having a good time since we're out together?
Fortunately this is a situation where it’s alright to speak a little more plainly, or to voice your awkward position. Hopefully they’ll understand the spot they’re putting you in and back off.

""You know it's not nice to put me on the spot like this. You guys can argue, but I'm not going to be a part of it.""


Be sure to keep up this neutrality after the fact. Even if there’s one or the other you agree with, don’t reveal this later on. It’ll make you come off as dishonest.

, Couples can be a big help when you're out and looking for someone to introduce yourself to. Any awkward discussion of your personal life can be avoided by turning the conversation on them by asking their opinion on someone. Unsurprisingly, many couples or friends in relationships will delight in your asking them for dating advice.Finding someone else to chat with also means escaping your situation for a bit. This itself isn’t a bad opener for introducing yourself: “Do you mind if I sit here? I have to get away from this couple I’m with.”
If it’s something you can control in advance, demand they bring another single friend as a set-up. People in relationships often jump to play matchmaker, and it will at least give you a single person to speak to.

, Beyond just having a friend to text every once and awhile, go for all the other distraction your phone can provide. If the couple you’re with is reasonable, they won’t mind you entertaining yourself while they talk amongst themselves. Be sure not to be completely absent, however; only go for the phone when it’s a conversation you clearly don’t have to be a part of.If you’re not with a couple, but instead are stuck as the only single one in a group of friends, it unfortunately won’t do to use your phone to avoid the awkward parts of that situation. In that case your only distraction will be to change the subject.

, If you’re lucky, you might have a fellow single friend who’s open to an invitation. Before you invite someone new to stop being the odd one out, check with your friends already together. Hopefully it’s a mutual acquaintance of everyone’s; plenty of people won’t appreciate a stranger joining in unexpected., As mentioned previously, changing the subject may be the only certain way to avoid the awkward conversation topics which normally befall the single in the group. Feel free when doing this to be a little obvious; anyone especially perceptive with you should take the hint and join in.


Discuss your surroundings. If you're in a bar or restaurant, talk about your food or drinks. Talk about the atmosphere, the decor; talk about the music they're playing.
Talk about the near future. Vacations planned and events taking place are good fodder for conversation. Take an interest in what your friends have got going on in their lives.
Try to expand on any one topic. If you end up talking about the decor of the bar, talk about how you might change it. If you talk about the music in the bar, stretch that to talking about music you like.

, Unless you're locked into something like a dinner or a particular event, suggest a change of location to shake things up. Having the group move and do something new helps to move any attention away from you. Even the discussion of ""what to do now"" can work as distraction enough when desperate.


What you suggest will depend on where you are. If you're at a bar, look around for a dartboard, pool table, or air hockey. Games are a great distraction from conversation.
If pressed for ideas, just suggest walking the town. It'll give you and your group a chance to see what else there is to do.

, When you’re stuck out with a couple, there are a number of reasons this might be happening. Knowing just why you’ve found yourself in this situation will be key to navigating it. It will determine your social rules of engagement: how to act, what to say, or (perhaps most importantly) when to leave.It might be out of sympathy, or heavy-handed thoughtfulness. Your friend(s) in a relationship might feel like they’ve neglected you, so they’ve offered an invitation to what would normally be their couples activity. Unfortunately in this instance there’s some pressure on you to be grateful.
You may have been enlisted as a distraction. Maybe the relationship involved isn’t going smoothly or the two involved want to spend time together, but not only together. Here you’ll do a courtesy to your friend(s) by being engaged.
It could just be an accident. You’re out with a friend and their significant other just happens to be around the corner. The friend doesn’t want to end your night but doesn’t want to snub their partner. Though it might not be any fun for you, there’s nothing wrong with bowing out in this scenario.

, If you’re in a situation where you’re not stuck between in a couple, but are spending time with friends in relationships, things might feel awkward for you. Fortunately it’s only talk of significant others or prodding into your love life which should make you feel uncomfortable. Steer clear of these by directing the conversation away from sensitive areas.


Turn the tables and inquire into their love lives. If you’re stuck out with friends in relationships who feel like offering unsolicited advice, get them talking about their own relationships. If you’re with a number of people who aren’t single, they may just turn to each other for conversation leaving you comfortably out.
When among close friends, feel free to give an honest “I don’t feel like talking about this/that.” Anyone who presses will have to suffer coming across as rude.

, Sometimes the setting of a get-together can make your position as the only single one much worse. Dinners or nights out at a bar are constricting, and limit you to only conversation as the source of entertainment. Insist on being in on the planning, and don’t fear being honest about why.Suggest something active. This might be as plain as moving the group from the bar to the dart board. Or going to a bowling alley or pool hall. Look for anything that’ll allow you interaction without conversation.
Try something among a crowd, like a concert. If they insist on a mutual outing, something like a movie or a band’s show would be useful because it doesn’t allow for much interaction. That way you avoid the conversational troubles that come with being the only single one.

Try something new.,
Invest in your future with a gym membership, online class, new career goal, etc.,
Say ""Yes"" to life.,
Get a little sexy.,
Return to dating slowly, whenever you're ready.",How to Be Single Again2," The time and energy you used to dedicate towards your ex and your relationship can now be transferred and directed towards priority number one: you! Relationships, even good ones, often end up ""merging"" people a bit -- you pick up the same hobbies, patterns, and friends. But being single again is a chance to think once more about you, who you want to be, and what you want to do.


Ask yourself -- ""what do I want?"" Are there things you wanted to do with your ex, but couldn't? Hobbies you put on the shelf when the relationship kicked off? New things you've never had time to try? Now is the time to ask the question, because your answers no longer have to take the other person into consideration.

, Your energy, money, and time are now all yours -- so put them to good use. A great way to get out of the rut is to plan your life outside of your romantic encounters. Focus on things that have nothing to do with dating or sex, and commit to making yourself a better person. You'll be more confident, happier, and better suited for the single lifestyle.

, The best part about being single is waking up every morning not knowing exactly where the day will take you. Being in a relationship can be so predictable and has a tendency to feel like a love song on repeat. It gives you those butterflies in your stomach and all those other cheese ball effects, but after a while, it can start to feel dull or routine. But now is the chance to say ""yes"" to any odd opportunity you feel like. If you have a friend who plays in a band, tag along to one of their shows or plan a weekend getaway for just you and your girls. Do anything! Try everything! But most importantly, say yes to opportunities that present themselves to you. This is the best time to explore and be adventurous. It is valuable to discover new things about yourself and even learn about things you may be afraid of or unfamiliar with., A big rut in most relationships is the ""sweatpants phase,"" where neither of you really need to tend to impress the other with looks. It can be easy to carry this trend into single life, but the boost happiness and self-confidence that comes from your own sex appeal can't be ignored. Start dressing like you're single again and you'll feel single again in no time.Work out -- not just for the looks, but for the proven emotional and health benefits.Try to keep a smile on your face, even with strangers.

, Just because you're avoiding relationships does not mean flirting and dating are off the table. If you play your cards right, a good flirtatious interaction can boost your self-confidence and effortlessly remind you that being single is fun. It's too soon to get back on the serious-relationship horse, but it's perfectly fine to take a casual ride here and there. Dating different types of people helps to refine your overall likes and dislikes, and this could be key in determining what you are looking for in the next relationship when you are finally ready again.


Again, there is no perfect amount of time to wait until if you want to start dating. And there is no line you can or can't cross. If all you want to do is flirt and chat -- go for it. If you want to go out to dinner with a Tinder flame or online match, you should do that too.
The important thing is to keep your mind open. One date does not mean you're in another long-term relationship if you don't want it."

Surround yourself with support.,
Get childcare and find a job.,
Go to school.,
Stay focused.",How to Be a Successful Young Single Mother," Being a young single mother isn't easy but with the right help and support from family and friends, your life will be less difficult. If your parents are allowing you and your child to live with them, accept that offer. There is nothing wrong with living with your parents until you get on your feet. Don't feel pressured by your friends or anyone else to move out of your parents house too soon. It is nice to have your own place but you don't want to move out and be struggling as a single mother, be patient.;
, If you don't have money to pay a babysitter, there are resources available. Depending on which US state or country you live in, you might be eligible to receive childcare assistance through the government. If you aren't eligible for assistance, or your state/country doesn't have a childcare assistance program, ask your parents for money to pay a babysitter until you can save up and pay the babysitter yourself. If one of your parents doesn't work, have them babysit while you work.


If your parents can't babysit your child or don't have money to help you out with a babysitter then maybe try taking out small student loan to pay for childcare. When you enroll in college you are able to apply for financial aid including the pell grant and loans. See the section below for more information.

, If you were in high school and had to drop out due to having your child, go back. Without a high school diploma, some places won't even hire you. If you have finished high school and received your diploma, enroll in college. Look into local community colleges in your area and apply. If you can't afford to pay for college out of pocket, you might be eligible to receive the federal pell grant (go to https://fafsa.ed.gov/ ). Another option is going to a trade school. Trades such as certified nursing assisting, medical assisting, dental assisting, phlebotomy, etc do not have to be complete at colleges and they don't take two or four years to complete like college degrees.


Some colleges allow students to take certain classes online. Online classes are great for mothers because you can do classes from home as long as you have an internet connection.
There will always be many jobs available in the medical field that pay well, that is just one possibility.
Try to choose a career that you like and one that will allow you to spend enough time with child.

, Keep your eye on the prize and don't get distracted. It's okay to have some free time and spend time with your friends but your main focus is being a parent and school. Keep up your grades and maintain a good GPA. Once you get that degree in your hand and find a good paying job, you are all set!

Pursue healthy relationships, if you want.",How to Be Single," Whether you are in an abusive relationship or you just aren't happy with your partner anymore, there comes a time when you have to put your foot down and do what's best for you.People stay in unhealthy relationships for many reasons, such as guilt, financial stress, or children. It's important to realize that you are actually trapping yourself in the relationship by focusing on these fears.
You can start standing up for yourself in small ways by, for example, developing your own interests, making your own decisions, and spending more time away from your partner.;
, Many people are reluctant to leave long-term relationships because they are not used to living alone and do not know what the future will hold for them if they leave. In order to start over as a single person, you need to be willing to take the plunge and accept that you don't know what will happen next.If you're not quite ready to leave the relationship yet, try to focus on having compassion for yourself. If you consciously work on doing things that bring you more happiness, you will eventually develop the strength you need to leave a relationship that is holding you back.
Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't have the courage to leave the relationship right away. These negative thoughts towards yourself will only worsen your self-confidence, which will make it even harder to leave.

, Some people are actually happier being single, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you find that you don't have a problem with living alone and not having a partner, don't try to force yourself to do anything different. Even if you don't like being single, take this opportunity to find out what's really important to you in life.It's easy for people to lose a bit of their identities in a relationship, so it may take some time to adjust to being on your own. Whether you plan on being single forever or just for a short period of time, learn to embrace your individual interests and preferences.Take time to explore all of your interests. If you had a hobby before you were in a relationship that you no longer participate in, consider getting back into it. If not, try out some new hobbies until you find something you enjoy.
There's no need to stick to routines that you created with a former partner. If you used to watch television every night from 8:00 until 10:00, think about whether there's something you would rather be doing now that you're single.

, If you were in a relationship for a long period of time, you probably relied on your partner to take care of at least some day-to-day tasks, whether it was mowing the lawn, cooking meals, or paying bills. As a single person, you need to be able to take care of all of these things on your own. Try making a list of all of the tasks your partner used to do for you, and learn how to tackle them one by one.Being independent is incredibly empowering! Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, try to remind yourself that you are completely capable of taking care of yourself. Even if you choose to get involved in a relationship in the future, you will always know how to do things for yourself.
Try not to get overwhelmed by everything you need to do, and don't be afraid to ask a friend, family member, or neighbor for some help if you don't know how to do something.
Financial independence can be a huge hurdle if you previously depended on your partner's income. Take a careful look at your budget and try to find areas where you can cut back. For example, you might be able to live in a smaller apartment as a single person, or you might learn how to cook instead of eating out all the time. You can also consider getting a roommate.

, Just because you're single does not mean you are alone in the world. In fact, single people typically have stronger relationships with friends, family members, and neighbors than married people do. To avoid becoming lonely and isolated, surround yourself with the people you love.Don't fall prey to the belief that you must have attachment problems if you are single. Studies have shown that single people are just as capable of forming healthy relationships with the people around them.If you previously spent a lot of time with other couples, you might find that you are no longer invited to socialize with them now that you are single. They may be intentionally excluding you, or they may just be trying to avoid making you feel awkward. Either way, you need to decide if these former friends are important enough to you to have a talk with them about your relationship.You might need to make some new friends if you are newly single. Try joining clubs, participating in volunteer work, or socializing with people from work. Having other single friends will make the transition much easier for you.You may want to try joining singles groups or hanging out at singles bars, but be aware that you will probably encounter a lot of people who are looking for relationships, rather than trying to enjoy being single.

, There's a prevailing notion out there that people are only single because they can't find a partner, when in fact many people are single because they prefer living that way. If you are single for a long period of time, you will probably encounter people who think that there's something wrong with you. There's not much you can do to change society's view on relationships, so just try to ignore this kind of discrimination.Research has shown that single people are no less happy, successful, or psychologically healthy than people who are in committed relationships. Take solace in this information, and remind yourself that people who believe otherwise are not well-informed.If you experience this kind of discrimination from close friends or family members, it might be worth it to have a conversation with them about your choice to be single. If you can make them understand that you are happy being single and that you feel very hurt that they think badly of you for that, they may become more compassionate.
If you're feeling lonely and isolated while single, these feelings may in fact be caused by discrimination, or ""single-shaming"" more than they are by the reality of your single life. This is why it's so important to stay away from people who make you feel bad about yourself for being single.If people try to set you up, be very clear with them about whether or not you are interested. It's entirely up to you if you want to date or not.

, It's been shown that single people exercise more than married people. This may be because they have more free time or because they are more concerned about their appearances. Either way, take advantage of your single status to get healthy and enjoy life to the fullest., Because they rely more on themselves and have to deal with society's negative opinions about their relationship status, single people tend to be stronger and more resilient than couples. The next time you feel bad about not having a partner, remind yourself that you are a better person because of it., There's a tremendous amount of freedom that comes along with being single. If you were in a relationship for a long time, you may have forgotten how liberating it can be to make all of your own decisions, without having to worry about another person's opinion.Now that you are single, enjoy your freedom in these simple ways:


Travel when and where you want.
Create a schedule that works for you.
Decorate your apartment or house the way you like it.
Eat the foods you like.
Go out, stay in, or have people over as you prefer.

, Single people tend to value meaningful work more than people who are in relationships. If you want to be happy while single, it might help to commit more of your time to something you genuinely care about, whether it's your job or volunteer work.Being single can make it much easier to truly commit yourself to your work because you don't have to worry about fulfilling the needs of your relationship. If you plan on being single for a long time, look for a job that gives you a sense of purpose and makes you want to get out of bed every single morning. If your life is already that fulfilling, being single won't feel like a void at all.Spending time alone can make you more creative and help you see the world from a different perspective. Take advantage of your alone time to pursue your creative passions, whether it's writing, painting, or just taking the time to admire the clouds in the sky.Trying new things is one of the best ways to fend off loneliness when you're single. Take advantage of your ability to do whatever you want whenever you want and discover new interests and passions to keep your life exciting., Once you've learned how to survive when you are not in a relationship, you can decide if you would like to stay single or find a partner. Either choice is perfectly acceptable, so don't let others pressure you.


Don't rush into a relationship that isn't right. The relationship should be reciprocal, and you shouldn't have to give up your personal identity."

Watch television.",How to Be Happy Despite Solitude," One such circumstance is Agoraphobia, the fear of open spaces, which can literally render a person unable to leave the confines of their own home, effectively creating a solitary life. Others are what are known as the ""shut in"", who because of medical or physical conditions are unable to go out even to the local market or local church. These may be able to benefit from medical help and social services, but there is still some amount of solitude to be dealt with.;
, These may not be suitable for every situation, but with the host of possibilities, there may be some that will help fill hours with enjoyable activities. Learning to knit, sew, crotchet, or macrame are crafts that can fill hours productively, as can painting, drawing, or writing.

, Music has long been recognized as a medium to give emotional boosts when a person is in a dark or gloomy mood, and with the many sources which music can be accessed, from online, to radio and satellite, there is unlimited selection almost anywhere on the globe. Find a genre of music that suits your taste, and don't just listen to it, but learn it, immerse yourself into it.

, This is the obvious, and with a good novel, you may be alone in the room, but you can feel yourself transported to strange and wonderful worlds beyond imagination, filling hours upon hours with adventures. If you are not able to read, there are thousands of titles available on audio books, and they can be delivered by mail either from retail sources, or from exchanges, a much less expensive option.

, There are dozens available for most topics, from gardening to fishing, crafts, to travel. There are also lots of ""E-zines"" online, many of which are free to the user.

, You may find hundreds of friends who share your circumstance, and many close friendships develop between people who will never meet in person, living thousands of miles apart.

, This may appear to be a way of talking to yourself on the surface, but then, you can do that, if you are living in solitude anyway. Writing your ideas, thoughts, and feelings in a journal will keep you verbal when there is no one else around to talk to, and going back and reading what you have written is a way of looking at yourself from a different vantage point, helping to give you a broader perspective on what you are thinking at any particular time.

, Solitary living means not having anyone else to turn to if your resources fail, and no one to borrow basic supplies like food and toiletries from in the event you run out.

, Depending on the cause and nature of your solitude, you may not have access to veterinary care and food for a large dog or other conventional pet, but there are other options that may have simpler upkeep. If you are unable to care for a pet at all, you may still be able to feed wildlife or birds in your situation, and watching these can give some solace to your solitude.

, Make a regimen of regular exercise a part of your daily life, within your ability and the resources available to you. Unless you are bedridden or some other way impaired, you should at least be able to do some stretches, perhaps sit-ups, walking, or riding a stationary bike.

, Keeping your grooming and hygiene at a good level will help your self esteem, and thereby increase your level of happiness. Dress as well as you are able, brush your hair and teeth twice daily, and pamper yourself in other ways you may think of.

, Being alone offers the temptation of eating whatever you like, when you like, since there is little in the way of accountability. That is no reason to neglect yourself by poor diet. If cooking meals seems like too much trouble for one, then only cook occasionally, freezing portions for later use. Keep what ever fresh fruits and vegetables you have access to around for snacks, and treat yourself to these as often as you like.

, This is an obvious outlet for relief from being alone, but even in this technological age, it is not available everywhere, or to everyone, and it is not a cure-all in itself. Still, there are movies, sports, news, and all manner of entertainment where there is access to it, and if you have electrical power, you may at least be able to watch movies on DVD or other media if broadcast television does not exist where you are.

Spend less time with them.,
Cut back on contact over the phone and social media.,
Stash things that remind you of that person.,
Focus on the person's negative aspects.",How to Avoid Falling in Love1," If you hang out with them on a regular basis, you'll never be able to detach yourself. Occupy your time with healthy diversions. This way, you'll be telling the truth when you tell the person you don't have time to hang out.

If you hang out with them, avoid physical contact. Don't hug, touch hands, kiss, or have sex. These actions can stir up the feelings you're trying to conquer.;
, Don't read their posts or timelines on social media. Don't call, text, or email as often (or at all). If they call you, keep the conversation short. If you're busy distracting yourself with other things, you'll have a valid excuse for saying, “Sorry. Gotta go!”, Gather them together in a box or two and bury them in a closet or attic. If you have the money, rent a personal storage garage. Store digital files on a flash drive that you can store with the other mementos. Keep them hidden until your feelings for the person cool down., Forget about their cute face and concentrate on their annoying neediness. Recall that argument you got into over politics or religion. Think about how you felt when they told you they want five kids, but you don't want any. Focus on the real deal breakers that would make a relationship difficult or impossible."
"
Stay busy with academic or career goals.,
Avoid romantic plots.,
Do fun things with your friends.,
Take up a new hobby.",How to Avoid Falling in Love2," Map out a detailed but realistic six-month plan. Highlight what you need to do now to reach your goal. Then, hit the library to do research for your senior thesis. Customize your CV or résumé for each job you have your eye on. Chances are, your dreams will soon shift from love to graduation or that dream job., This can be a tall order, but it's not impossible. Read the plot lines of books, movies, and/or TV shows before you delve in. Make sure that historical drama about Queen Victoria doesn't focus on her relationship with Prince Albert. Read a murder mystery that's not about a crime of passion. Watch a vampire movie that doesn't have a romantic subplot., Invite them over for pizza and a non-romantic movie. Play sports. Go out for ice cream. Spending time with your friends will lift your spirits and keep your mind off of falling in love.

, Think of an activity you've been curious about or really want to involve yourself in. Take local classes or watch online tutorials. Join a club on campus. If you're not in school, check social media sites for local groups that might interest you. You'll be so busy learning your new hobby that you won't have time for love."
"
Assess your motivations.,
Write down your feelings.,
Talk to a friend.,
Exercise.,
Practice yoga or meditation.",How to Avoid Falling in Love3," Think about why you can't fall in love. Maybe you have too much on your plate right now. Perhaps you know the person who caught your eye isn't really right for you. When you know why you should avoid falling in love, you'll have a better chance of success., Keep a daily log in a diary or journal. Even if it's just a sentence or two, write something. Read over your entries to come to terms with your feelings. Put the date by each entry to keep track of how your feelings change. Pay attention to these changes and celebrate your evolution., Choose your best friend or at least someone you can trust. They'll understand your emotional state and your motivations. If your friend managed to avoid falling in love, ask them for some advice., Fill your spare time at the gym, on the track, or around your neighborhood working up a sweat. Focus on breathing and hydrating. Enjoy the rush of endorphins that will boost your mood. You'll also have the bonus of better health., Either of these will help you to relax, come to terms with your feelings, and eventually move on. Find a quiet place and turn on some soft music. Focusing on your breathing throughout your practice will help to ground you and calm you down."

Take stock of what you have.,
Remove any painful mementos.,
Do something you've always wanted to do but never had the time for.,
Go for a night out with your friends.,
Tell yourself the truth: There will be others out there.,
If you were in a hurtful relationship with your family, resist the urge to see them.,
Be patient.",How to Be Alone1," After you've broken up with your ex, it's easy to feel depressed. The person you'd shared your life with is no longer by your side. The things that were constant in your life no longer feel so safe. That's why it's important to take stock of what you have.


Think about or make a list of all the things that you do have. We often lose track of these things after a breakup. Focus on the intangibles, especially:

Family. They love you unconditionally, not for who they want you to be, but for who you are.

Friends. They have the ability to cheer you up during the darkest of times. Offer real perspective, and are people you can really talk to.

Experiences. You've done a lot of things in your life. Celebrate your accomplishments and risk-taking; it's what keeps you going.

Health. Hopefully you are healthy, even if you are temporarily lonely. Are any of your friends or loved-ones not healthy? Take stock of how lucky you are to be healthy.

;
, Those pictures of your ex you hung up? Take them down and put them in storage. Those love letters s/he wrote you? Shelve them in a box. Dredging up old memories will only make the healing process more difficult, unfortunately. Do the hard thing and put away any painful mementos.


It may seem refreshing, but destroying those mementos probably isn't a great idea. In the heat of the moment, take a little time to cool down and think about it. It's irreversible. You might later discover that holding onto those memories would have been the smarter thing to do. Be 100% sure the mementos are a bad influence in your life before you destroy them.

, A relationship can be a lot of work. That's why it's important to reward yourself when you do have time to. You probably sacrificed a lot to help the relationship grow. Now it's time to give yourself a little bit of:


Adventure. Travel someplace you've always wanted to travel. Maybe it's Calcutta, or maybe it's Charleston. Wherever it is, you'll find that exploring a different part of the world is downright exhilarating.
Excitement. Maybe you'd appreciate taking a self-defense class, or skydive, or signing up for a local half-marathon. Put a little excitement into your step by getting doing something thrilling or unexpected.
Fulfillment. It doesn't have to be ""spiritual,"" but it should be fulfilling. A lot of people gain a lot of happiness and fulfillment by giving back to people less privileged than themselves.

, Your friends probably know your predicament, which will give them an even bigger reason to show you a great time. Maybe you and the rest of your girls stay in for a movie night and give each other mani/pedis. Maybe you and the rest of your boys go out for a night on the town. Being with your friends will help you naturally get over the breakup instead of forcing you to feel okay with it all by yourself.

, After a breakup, it's tempting to think that you'll never find someone as good/sweet/cute as the person you now call your ex. This is a mistake. Not only is there a good chance that you'll find someone else who's good, sweet, and cute, but there's also a chance that the next person you connect with is an improvement over your ex. That's personal growth, right there.


Start learning from your mistakes. Think about the mistakes that you or your ex made in your last relationship. Resolve to learn from them, to grow into a person who doesn't make the same mistake twice. Making a mistake is forgivable; refusing to learn from them is not.

, Don't put yourself in a situation where you're likely to see him/her. It's probably best to make a clean break, and seeing the other person just magnifies the possibility of a messy entanglement. It hurts now, but it'll feel a whole lot better a month from now.

, Don't expect to find someone a week after you just broke up. Relationships take time. Just like it's unreasonable to lose 20 pounds in a month, it's unreasonable to expect that you'll find another person to start loving right away. Things that you can do if your loneliness starts getting to you:


Be social. Nobody ever got a boyfriend or girlfriend by sitting around in their room alone, listening to Celine Dion or Kenny G. In order to find your next partner, you need to put yourself in social situations. That's where you're likely to have most success.
Rely on your friends. Ask your friends if they know anybody who's eligible, or someone who could set you up. It seems old-fashioned, but it works sometimes. Plus, beggars can't be choosers.
Don't let setbacks set you back permanently. Everyone has a bad date or gets rejected. If you've never had a bad date or gotten rejected, you're probably a little too choosy. Brush yourself off when the other person isn't right and put yourself right back out there.

You’re a single mom.",How to Be a Happy Single Woman," You spend more time with yourself than anyone else, and you should learn to enjoy your own company. One key to being a happy single woman is to be comfortable spending time alone with yourself, understanding that you don’t always need to be around others. You will ultimately discover qualities about yourself that you love, and some that you’d like to change. This process of self-discovery is invaluable to truly being a happy, single woman., Being single means that you have more time for yourself. Now is the time to develop your own interests outside of work and other relationships. Pursue what makes you happy, what fulfills you, or what piques your curiosity. Don’t let your work or other people influence which interest you pursue. Choose something that will bring you joy or fulfillment.You might take up bike riding, or yoga, or a book club, or even sign up for sewing lessons at a local shop.

, Negativity breeds more negativity, and that can stifle your happiness. Instead, look around you, really think about your life, and take stock. Think about your friends, your family, your job, your house, your collection, your hobbies, your health, and your wit, and appreciate what you have. Focusing on the positive will shift your perspective to one of gratitude and happiness., You might choose to be in a relationship in the future, and there’s no better time than when you’re happy and single to figure out what you want and need in a partner. Consider why you’re happy right now and what traits in a future partner could enhance that happiness. This is the best time to define what you want, expect, and need in a future relationship. It’s also a great time to concretely lay out your dealbreakers.Perhaps you want your future partner to have a certain level of education or affiliate with a particular political party.
On the other hand, you might decide that a partner who is disrespectful to servers and strangers is a dealbreaker for you.

, You’re a happy, single woman and you deserve to treat yourself. In fact, you should treat yourself. Splurge now and then, and if your budget allows, incorporate little treats as part of your monthly expenses. Make yourself a priority and reward yourself for being fabulous now and then.Schedule a spa day.
Get your eyebrows waxed every month.
Take yourself to the movies.
Go get that bag that you’ve been eyeing for some time.
Book yourself a room at the nicest hotel in town for a night.

, You don’t have to choose between being in a relationship and having a career, an outdated idea that doesn’t accurately represent opportunities for modern women. As a single woman, though, you undeniably have more opportunity to focus on advancing your career, as your time and flexibility is entirely yours. Seize professional opportunities for growth and training, taking advantage of your flexibility.Opportunities may include:


You might be asked to travel regularly or even relocate for a better position.
You might be asked to work unplanned overtime.
You may have several after-work networking functions to attend.

, Humans are social creatures, and research shows that people are happier when they have an emotional connection with someone.This doesn’t mean that you have to be in a relationship to be happy, though. Your platonic relationships can be just as rewarding as a romantic connection, and should not be overlooked as a source of happiness., Having a circle of friends and support network is a must for a single, happy woman. Women tend to form friendships easier than men, as women are usually more social. And everyone needs confidantes, those people with whom you can share your highs, lows, and true self.Some women aren’t as comfortable meeting people or being social. If you are somewhat uncomfortable meeting people, consider joining a variety of meetup groups or getting involved in a variety of your interests, which will naturally lead you to people who share at least one interest of yours., Your time, money, and energy is yours and yours alone. You get to spend each as you see fit without consulting with anyone else, which makes scheduling time with your friends and family all the easier. And just as you need a good support network, it’s important that you be a strong member of other support networks.Ask your parents if they’d like to have weekly dinners.
Invite your friends over for a wine tasting.
Suggest that your friends or family take a short road trip with you to a popular tourist attraction.
Organize a camping adventure with a group of friends or your siblings.

, Some women fear being single because they are scared of being alone when they’re older or ill. Because more and more people are choosing to be single, new communities are forming for older, single people. These intentional communities offer comradery, support, and socialization. Having a plan for how you’ll approach aging and illness as a single woman will alleviate your worries and uncertainty, allowing you to be happier.These intentional communities are not retirement communities, although there are retirement communities for single people.
Intentional communities are typically housing cooperatives, or land trusts, or even communes.

, Many societies prioritize and even celebrate marriage as the ultimate achievement for women. From a young age, society tells women that they should grow up, find a partner, get married and then they’ll be happy. This might not be the right path for you, though, and that’s perfectly alright.You can find examples of social expectations everywhere, from commercials for cleaning products to reality television shows to print magazine ads for wedding dresses and engagement rings.
Nowadays, marriage is usually seen as a union founded on love and mutual affection, versus a financial or security arrangement between two families. Remind critics that a woman doesn’t need to be married to be secure or successful anymore.If being a single woman is frowned upon in your culture, ask your family to explain their concerns, and be prepared that you may ultimately disagree on what is right for you – and that’s okay.

, Your family’s cultural background might place an extraordinary emphasis on you getting married. If your family routinely asks you when you’re going to settle down, or offers to set you up with someone, remember these cultural motivations before you get too upset with their persistence. Bearing these expectations in mind will help you best determine how to respond to your family. Remember, too, that you might be the first woman in your family to voluntarily remain single and succeed at being independent and happy, which is a foreign idea to some.

, Understand that there will always be neigh-sayers who cannot accept that you’re not actively working on finding a future spouse. They will typically ask questions like, “did you give up on love?” or “don’t you want to be happy?” or even, “what’s so wrong about wanting to be close to someone?” These questions usually come from a good place, with the questioner just not understanding how you could be happy without a partner. Preparing stock answers to this line of questioning will alleviate stress for you, and ensure that you respond with a concise, direct answer that ends the line of questioning.For example, if someone asks, “don’t you want to be happy?” you could respond with, “I certainly do, which is why I’m focusing on myself and my happiness. I am happily, voluntarily, single, am quite fulfilled, and am not looking for a relationship. I really appreciate you thinking of my happiness.”

, You’re a strong, single woman and perhaps you’ve always wanted children, or have just recently realized that you do, in fact, want to have a child. You might feel disappointed that you’re not in a relationship and think that limits your options. Fortunately, you can freely have a child as a single woman, if you choose to do so.You have a variety of options that weren’t available to single women even 15 years ago. If you do want to have a child, look into sperm donation, adoption, and even fostering children for the state in which you live.
On the other hand, you might feel discomfort with the idea of raising a child as a single woman. You’re not alone. Almost 20% of women are child free and the number grows annually.

, Not all single people are lonely, and not all lonely people are lonely all the time. You’re a single woman, and you might be disappointed that you’re not in a relationship. You’re bombarded daily with images and cultural reinforcements that tell you that you should be in a relationship, making you even more aware that you aren’t. Whether it’s by choice or not, you’re single, and acknowledging that you do want a relationship can be difficult because it makes you vulnerable.If you’re single by choice, you may occasionally consider that you’d like a relationship. That’s entirely normal. Remember, you’re not committed to being single and can change your mind at any point, but you don’t have to do so.
If you’re disappointed that you’re not in a relationship, consider getting into the dating scene. Join a dating website, join a singles club, or even a hobby club, where you might meet like-minded single people.

, You’re single but that doesn’t mean you’re alone. You are in an extraordinary position to choose your family – the group of friends that you hold most dear. You will support one another, laugh with one another, celebrate with one another, and cry together. This is a family of your creation, and while you might not be in a traditional relationship, you are certainly not alone., You may not have imagined raising a child or children by yourself, but here you are. You worry, cry, celebrate, and discipline by yourself, and you don’t have a partner to rely on, which can be challenging. This may not be how you imagined raising your family, and you might be a bit disappointed. Acknowledge your strength, appreciate your power and fortitude, and importantly, know when to reach out to friends and family to ask for help."
"
Love yourself.,
Lose yourself in your hobbies.,
Focus on becoming a better person.,
Learn from your social interactions.,
Go online for people who may share your interests and passions.,
Take social chances.",How to Be Alone2," It sounds cheesy to say, but no one will love you if you don't first love yourself. Give yourself permission to love yourself, if you haven't already. You'll feel better about the fact that you're alone and about your chances of eventually smashing your loneliness.


Say something encouraging to yourself every day. Don't get too proud, but compliment yourself about something you do well. If you can't find a reason to compliment yourself, say something like ""I love myself all by myself"" and really believe it. It can be pretty uplifting.

, Whatever your hobbies are, lose yourself in them. They give you lasting happiness and pleasure. As long as they aren't illegal and don't hurt people, they're perfectly acceptable. Having a social hobby gives you an opportunity to meet new people, as well. Seize every opportunity you get to turn your hobby into a social occasion.

, This is a lesson that applies to every single person, but it's true here especially. And it's not true that you don't have friends because you're a bad person. It just means that you probably have more time on your hands, which means you have the opportunity to use that time productively:


Treat your body well. Take long walks, preferably in nature. Run and swim and bike to your destinations. Join an intramural sports team so that you can be competitive and build a bit of muscle while you're at it.
Think about developing a new skill. This is purely for yourself, not to impress other people. Maybe you know C++ and you want to learn Java; maybe you're an ace on the balance beams and still need to master the pommel horse; maybe you know how to play guitar but still could learn the banjo. The world is your oyster!

, There's a chance your lack of friends is purely circumstances or bad luck. In that case, you'll probably end up with friends in no time flat. But there's also a chance your lack of friends is because you haven't been picking up on social cues, and could learn a little bit in that department.


Pay attention to:
People's body language. Do smiles turn into smirks? Does getting too close to another person cause them to take a couple steps back? Your words and your body will have a visible effect on other people's bodies, if you learn to look.
What people tell you without actually saying it. ""Yesterday I went to Coachella"" is really just an invitation for you to ask them how awesome it was.
Not dominating the conversation. Let other people talk once in a while; on the other hand, don't be a mute. Learn to ask questions of people and volunteer information so that you keep the conversation going.



, Internet communities are excellent places for you to find people who may be unusually shy in person, but who are unusually forthcoming online. Maybe it sounds weird to you, but try it out. You could find a treasure-trove of like-minded individuals who are fun and exciting to be around.

, Nothing is ever a sure bet, but life rewards people who reward themselves. If you're never putting yourself in situations where you could fail socially, you're probably being too shy. Go and talk to a friendly-looking person. Invite an old friend over for tea. Introduce yourself to a group of strangers and ask a provoking question. Fortune favors the bold.

"
"
Determine your surroundings.,
Free yourself from distractions, such as electronic communication devices.,
Start your activity.,
Remind yourself of the importance of independence.,
Lose yourself in your activity.,
Balance out your time alone with time spent being alongside other people.",How to Be Alone3," If it is not possible to be alone in your surroundings then leave the area and find a quiet place undisturbed by other organisms. Such places include the forest, your own room, or a quiet outdoor park.

, (Cellphone, etc.) You may wish to keep an iPod or other music playing device with you in order to block out noise if you cannot find a quiet enough area.

, Whether you have chosen to be alone in order to have time to yourself to think or to finish reading a novel, this is the perfect time to get it done.

, Learning how to be independent is a skill. Independence means that you don't have to rely on other people for help. Independence means that you determine the outcome of your actions, not anyone else. Once you think of the benefits of independence rather than its disadvantages, you'll find yourself a lot happier.


If you need a little inspiration, think of these quotes about independence that might help you adjust to being alone:

""I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will."" - Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre


""Freedom (n.): To ask nothing. To expect nothing. To depend on nothing."" - Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead


""To find yourself, think for yourself."" - Socrates



, Put your heart and soul into whatever you are doing. That way, you won't think about being alone — you'll distract yourself from being distracted. Humans are naturally social creatures: we crave attention from other people, and recognition from our peers. If you lose yourself in your activity, you'll be a lot less likely to care about that stuff.

, As much as you might think that being alone is all you'll ever need, it's probably not healthy. In fact, being with other people from time to time will help you be alone.


Think of it like this: We need to recharge certain batteries. When we're tired, we need to sleep. When we're hungry, we need to eat. When we're lonely, we need to be around other people. Being around other people will help you ""recharge your battery,"" hopefully enough so that you'll feel energized by and excited about the idea of being alone again.

Don't be a crowd pleaser.,
Know how to deflect.,
Add humour.,
Say no.,
Be mature.",How to Avoid Unwanted Come Ons," It seems like it's the ""nice"" people who become easy targets for unwanted attention in public spaces. The reason is simple: everyone fears rejection, and nice people can sometimes be so attentive to the feelings of others that they can fail to assert themselves (for example, they laugh at jokes that they don't find funny, so that the person telling the joke won't feel bad). Lonely people gravitate toward people who seem inviting: who make lots of eye contact with strangers, smile a lot, and have a gentle (non-sarcastic) sense of humour. If this describes you, experiment with the opposite sort of behaviour. Reserve your warmth for the people you feel comfortable around; you might be surprised at the results!;
, You might not notice it happening, but before someone approaches you they will usually make their intentions evident in their body language, and look for a 'signal' from you: they will attempt to catch your attention, smile at you, or say something loudly, hoping you'll laugh. This is their way of minimizing the risk of being rejected; they will take your reaction as ""pre-approval"" to an approach. Be aware of when this is happening, and make your disinterest evident. If someone is trying to catch your eye, ignore them entirely and focus your whole attention on your friend. It may seem cold, but this is actually the kindest thing you can do in this situation.

, A little sense of humour goes a long way. If someone does approach you and strikes up a conversation, this is your last chance to show them you've got no intention of flirting with them, without actually telling them to go away. Don't be cruel, but gently remind them that you've got a head on your shoulders by having a bit of a laugh. If someone approaches you when you're with some friends, say something gross or bizarre like ""oh, we're just having a few pints before our cult leader arrives"" or ""oh, just unwinding after a grueling week of mindless service to the Hive Mind"" or ""oh, just celebrating our first day out of quarantine."" Even if they find you hilarious, they might be too intimidated to keep vying for your attention.

, If you've done all you can to deflect attention and they start ""making moves"" anyway, it's important to be clear and succinct: say ""I'm sorry, but I'm not looking for anything right now."" Be polite and firm. Avoid making excuses for your feelings -- you have nothing to explain, and you don't want to provide them with the opportunity to bargain with you. Then physically leave their presence, even if you just put a few people between you. Don't strike up a conversation, as this can open up a grey territory where they might feel encouraged to try again.

, Although it can be quite unpleasant to be approached this way, as long as this is done respectfully, be mindful of the person's feelings. Don't be rude, and don't gossip about them afterwards. If you see them again on a separate occasion, nod at them and say hello in a curt, professional way, and then go about your business; they'll get the message that you bear them no ill will, but your previous state of mind still stands.

Be honest about your intentions.,
Go out in public places.,
Keep friends out of the picture.,
Don’t see somebody too often.,
Lock up the inner flirt.,
Avoid cultivating emotional intimacy.,
Refuse a relationship.",How to Avoid Being in a Relationship1," If you want to date casually, make sure your new fling knows that you’re not looking for anything serious. Being honest about what you want will give you the opportunity to have some fun and date around without hurting anybody’s feelings. It will also eliminate the possibility of getting locked into a relationship that you don’t want.


Establish whether you want to be exclusive or non-exclusive with somebody you’re dating. It’s best to have this conversation in person so that both people are on the same page.;
, Going on dates in public places will help you to avoid the sense of intimacy that is often cultivated on a date in somebody’s home or an isolated environment such as an empty beach or park. Instead, try mini-golfing, bowling, dinner at a restaurant, a carnival, or a concert. This will keep things light and casual.

, Don’t introduce somebody you’re dating casually to your friends, and avoid letting yourself getting dragged into your new fling’s friend group. The more intertwined somebody becomes with every aspect of your life, the more you will be seen and thought of as an exclusive couple.

http://www.askmen.com/dating/player_150/169_love_games.html</ref>, Space out your dates so that you’re not seeing somebody every night of the week. If you see somebody too often they might get the impression that you’re interested in something more serious. Try to only see somebody once every week or so, and in the meantime take some time for yourself.


If you are seeing somebody casually and it seems like there is the possibility for something more to develop, keep an open mind. Don’t discount a relationship just on principal.

, Copious flirting will lead people to believe that you’re interested in them. Keep your interactions platonic by not engaging in common flirtatious behavior such as touching the other person, teasing them too coyly, or making prolonged eye contact., Being in a relationship often involves sharing personal details and having deep conversations with the other person. Of course, do not be rude or uncaring to the other person, but try to focus your relationship on having fun, rather than getting to know each other on a deeper level.


Keep the topics of conversation light, like common interests, sports, movies, and food.
If you want to talk about more personal topics with this person, it might be a sign that you want something more than a casual relationship with them.

, If your partner expresses interest in a relationship with you, tell them that you don't want a relationship. Be clear about your expectations for your current involvement, and be nice if you end up refusing the other person.


You can say something like, ""I'm flattered, and I have a lot of fun with you, but I don't want to be in a relationship right now. I'd like to continue to see you, but I can also accept that that might not be enough for you.""

Do things by yourself.,
Pick up a new hobby.,
Take a solo trip.,
Love yourself.,
Take a break from nightlife.",How to Avoid Being in a Relationship2," People tend to avoid doing things alone because they are self-conscious and fear the judgment of others. Studies have shown, however, that people enjoy activities just as much when alone as when they’re with company. The most important thing is getting out there and doing something new. Go out to dinner, a movie, a show, or a coffee shop by yourself, and let yourself be empowered by your aloneness.Research has also shown that we tend to overestimate other people’s interest in our affairs. Generally, we tend not to even notice people who are out and about by themselves. Keep this in mind next time you want to do something and feel defeated because you don’t have anyone to do it with. Just go out there and have fun with yourself!, Hobbies help you to build self-confidence and have new experiences. Choose something you’ve always wanted to do, such as salsa dancing, learning a new language, or joining a club sports team, and look up classes or meet-ups in your area.


Hobbies are proven to help you relieve stress, which leads to overall improved mental health and self-esteem. Plus, it feels good to be good at something. Tackling a new hobby and watching yourself improve is an overall valuable experience.
Trying new things also lets you meet new people. If you’re trying to avoid being in a relationship make sure you’re not being too flirtatious with the people you meet. Instead, look to cultivate new friendships that will let you connect with other people and learn something about yourself., Travel is one of the best ways to learn about yourself and your needs and goals. A solo trip can be anything from a weekend getaway to a yearlong trek around the world. Spending time with yourself in a new place will push you out of your comfort zone, an experience that forces you to grow as a person and increases your sense of self-esteem and self love.Giving yourself time to travel alone also helps you to filter out drama from your life. If you take some time to appreciate nature on a camping trip, you might change your perspective on some of the relationship drama in your life.Traveling alone helps you avoid the potential for settling down with somebody in a serious relationship as you’re constantly on the move.

, Take time everyday to remind yourself that you are enough just as you are, and don’t need a relationship to validate your existence. If you aren’t interested in being with anybody for the time being, devote yourself to exploring self-love. Write in a journal and meditate or practice yoga to increase self-awareness, and be kind and patient with yourself.Take time away from technology in the morning. When you wake up, don’t check social media until after you’ve eaten breakfast. Social media places many demands on people and makes us feel as if we need to be constantly engaging in endless relationships. Instead, read or write in a journal, enjoy a cup of coffee, or go for a nice walk., Bars and clubs are chock full of people looking to be in a relationship. If you’re truly trying to avoid any sort of relationship, steer clear of places that are bound to have people on the prowl. If you’re feeling social, try getting together with a group of friends, seeing a show, or hosting a game night.


If you can’t stay away from the nightlife, try to avoid drinking at the very least. Alcohol impairs your judgment and might cause you to make a decision that leads to a complicated relationship.

Hang out with an old friend.,
Ask somebody out on a friend date.,
Make time to talk on the phone.,
Do something nice for someone else.",How to Avoid Being in a Relationship3," Friendships are too often ignored in favor of pursuing a romantic partner. However, a recent study at the London School of Economics showed that friendships make people the happiest, even above a romantic partner. Take some time to appreciate the friendships that you have in your life.Take an old friend out for coffee, cook them dinner, or make a plan to do something fun with them once a week such as a fitness class, a movie, or a hike.

, We all have friend crushes. What not pursue a friendship with a stranger? As long as you make your intentions clear, meeting somebody new in a platonic setting is a great way to form a deep connection and expand your horizons without the messiness of sex or romance., In our era it’s more and more common for people to move frequently and lose touch with good friends. Call up friends and family and have a genuine conversation.

Staying in touch with people you care about will make you feel more connected and loved.
If you’re not interested in dating, socializing with friends, even if they’re far away, decreases a potential sense of loneliness.

, Surprise a friend with a thoughtful gift, a coffee, or a pre-planned adventure. Keeping other people’s needs in mind makes you a better friend and ultimately will make you feel better about yourself.Tell people why you appreciate them and why you are grateful to have them in your life.

Practice by talking to people in stores.,
Move on to small interactions.,
Smile and make eye contact.",How to Approach a Girl if You're Shy and Don't Know What to Say1," An important step in overcoming your shyness is practicing with other people to increase your comfort with conversations. There are many scenarios in which you can interact with strangers in a pleasant and pressure free environment to develop your social confidence.Approach customer service associates at retail stores to ask for help finding something or to ask an opinion on a product.
Say hi to cashiers when cashing out at the grocery store and ask them how their day has been going.
Be polite but be brief. The intention is not to strike up a long lasting conversation but rather to develop experience interacting with people you don’t already know.;
, Once you have strengthened your social skills through brief conversations with strangers, you can move on to having interactions with other people that aren’t necessarily the girl you like. By starting with other people, the pressure won’t be as great as you don’t need to worry about the possibility of rejection.Approach people at work or in social occasions that aren’t the girl you like so you can get practice making conversation with people.
Comment on something to engage people in conversation. Try approaching someone at a party and saying, “do you know who plays this song? I really like it.”
Approach someone at work or school to discuss a recent assignment and steer the conversation toward more personal matters. Try saying something like, “I was going to start working on that last night but then I got caught up in a great show about dolphins.”
Practicing conversations in low pressure environments can help you overcome the fear of rejection and get more comfortable talking to people.

, Regardless of who you are talking to, smiling can make you seem friendlier and more personable. Making occasional eye contact can demonstrate your confidence, but avoid making prolonged eye contact as that can be unnerving to some people.Practice smiling and looking people in the eye when you introduce yourself. It may be difficult at first but doing so can make you seem friendly and confident, which are both things girls often find attractive.
Smiling can also serve to make you feel better about the situation that you’re in. Studies have shown that smiling alters the chemicals in your brain to make you feel happier and more confident."

Define what you are and aren't going to do.",How to Avoid Dating1," It's important to understand exactly why you are making your decision, so that you can maintain your resolve and re-evaluate your decision as needed.

Do you feel that you aren't in a place in life where you can handle a relationship?
Do you have a difficult history with dating, and want a break?
Are you aromantic, asexual, and/or questioning?

Understand that disabled people are no less human than non-disabled people.,
Treat them as your equals.,
Stay calm if something happens.,
Smile, and be friendly.,
Make small talk with them.,
Don't overthink it!,
Be supportive of them.,
Refrain from using unkind words.,
Involve them.,
Don't assume what they can or can't do.,
Don't be afraid to ask.,
Understand that they'll have good and bad days.",How to Act Around People With Special Needs," They have wants, needs, and people who love them just like others do. They may have a different way of living, and may learn things differently, but they are smart, wonderful people.;
, Many people talk down to people with disabilities, as they would to a child. However, plenty of disabled can pick up on this and will be hurt, annoyed, or angered by it. Patience is key. If a person with a disability doesn't understand you, try to accommodate them instead of giving up.


Rephrase what you said, pronounce things carefully, and/or say it a bit slower as needed.
Avoid using complex or technical terms if they have issues with understanding them. So instead of Expand that stub please try Write more things about the title, if you can, please.

, Don't panic if they fall down, experience sensory overload, or get injured. Kindly ask ""How can I help you?"" and let them tell you what they need (if anything).


Sometimes, they can handle it themselves. If they say they don't need help, don't try to force your ""help"" onto them.
During sensory overload, a person may not be able to speak or advocate for themselves. See if they can write, sign, or type. If not, take them somewhere quiet and relaxing, and encourage others to leave them alone.

, It makes you seem nice and approachable. Plus, it can boost your mood!

, They like to talk and share their feelings, just like us. Ask them about their day, school/work, travels they have taken, friends, hobbies, anything! People love to talk about themselves and their interests.

, Again, people with disabilities are no different from anyone else, so simply treat them like an average person.

, If they seem very proud of something, tell them when they've done a good job! If will make them proud to know that they have done something to be happy about.

, Being considerate is important, and respectful language makes it clear that you care about them and don't view them as lesser than yourself.


Never ask what is ""wrong"" with them. Not only is prying about someone's disability rude, the word ""wrong"" is hurtful and insensitive. Discrimination and careless behavior by others can cause a person more problems than their disability does, at times. Be sensitive and, if you really want to know the details, ask a friend or relative about it, or read up on their condition, if possible. It's typically best to give people with disabilities the benefit of the doubt when they do something that you find odd or rude.
Especially avoid using the word r*tard(ed), which is known as the ""R"" word. It's considered an insult, and many people within the special needs and disabled community find this word deeply hurtful and offensive.

, Include them in the conversation, throw the ball to them during a game and notice if they are confused or putting themselves in danger, at which time you should discreetly offer a hand.


If they are in a wheelchair, sit down on some steps or swings and indicate to the group to follow your example to keep everyone at the same eye level.
If they're blind, try not to rely on humorous facial expressions or mimes. If you're talking about something that looks funny or interesting, provide a quick description so that no one is left out.. Instead of pointing say Wow, there goes a really cool car. I think it's a Ferrari. and instead of just laughing along as your friend does a daft impression, say something like Honestly Darragh, you look more like Father Christmas when you pull that face than some sort of pop star!

Explain jokes or sarcasm if it looks like someone doesn't get it.

, Each disabled person is unique, and two people with the same disability may have very different needs and capabilities. Get to know them as an individual. Use this knowledge to be aware of any potentially dangerous or awkward situations or to know if you can do anything to help, such as gently pointing out an unexpected step.

, If you aren't sure about their needs or how to accommodate them, just ask. They are the experts on their own needs, and can tell you how to be helpful and respectful.


""You seem a bit distracted and uncomfortable. Should we sit somewhere less busy?""
""You usually turn down my help when I offer to help out with jars and doorknobs. Do you want me to keep offering, or should I wait until you ask?""
""This building is kind of a maze. Do you need help finding your professor's office?""
""If you ever have a shutdown when I'm around, what should I do to help you?""

, Their needs and abilities may vary day to day. Some days they may be able to do something easily, and the next they may find it difficult.

Don't approach her if she's clearly busy or distracted.,
Approach her soon after you make eye contact.,
Give your conversation purpose.,
Embrace your shyness when you speak to her.,
Ask questions or make observations to keep the conversation from dying.,
Be yourself.,
Ask for a way to reach out to her.",How to Approach a Girl if You're Shy and Don't Know What to Say2," Different environments can make the girl you like more or less apt to be willing to have a conversation with you. If you interrupt her while she’s doing something she feels is important or if it’s clear that she would rather not be bothered right now, she probably won’t react well to you introducing yourself.If the girl you like is in the middle of a conversation with other people, looks deeply focused on what she is doing, or has headphones in she may not want to be bothered. You should consider approaching her at a later time.
Places like bars, coffee shops, book stores or even the gym may be good places to strike up a conversation. Many people go to such places for the social element and she may be expecting to talk to people while there.

, If you and your crush meet eyes from across the room, approach her soon thereafter. If you look at her for a long time before approaching you may make her feel uncomfortable.Looking at someone from a distance for a long time without approaching may make you seem creepy rather than friendly.
Your conversation should seem impromptu rather than planned, so allow making eye contact from across the room to be the catalyst that made you want to strike up a conversation.
Approach her and say hi, then introduce yourself the way you’ve practiced.

, Don’t simply introduce yourself and allow the conversation to fizzle out immediately. Try making a friendly observation that invites her to continue the conversation if she’s interested in doing so.


You could try being direct in your conversation. Start by saying something like, “I noticed you from across the room and knew if I didn’t introduce myself I’d be kicking myself all day.”
You could ask her a social favor like, “Hi, I’m new here and don’t really know anyone. Would you mind if I talked to you for a minute?”
If you already know each other loosely you may want to bring up a class you were in together or a party you both attended.

, No matter how much you practice, you still may get nervous talking to your crush. If you are nervous, don’t hope she won’t notice because she likely will. Instead get out in front of your nervousness by addressing it in conversation.Say something like, “I’m always so nervous when I meet new people!”
If you want to compliment her you could say, “I can’t help but be a bit nervous when I’m talking to such a pretty girl.”

, After you’ve sparked a conversation with the girl you like, you may find it starting to fizzle out quickly. That doesn’t necessarily mean she isn’t interested, so use questions about her and observations about things going on around you to fill awkward gaps.Ask her to elaborate on a statement she recently made. If she mentioned that she moved to the area recently, for instance, ask her about where she used to live by saying something like, “did your last town have a good nightlife?” Her response will help let you know what sorts of things she enjoys doing when she goes out.
Try pointing out something interesting that is going on around you. If you are in school, bring up a nearby teacher and ask if she’s had any classes with him yet, then offer your opinion on that teacher. Try saying something like, “have you had a class with Mr. Thompson yet? He’s good, but he really loads on the homework.”

, You may be tempted to lie or act like someone you aren’t to seem cooler or more confident in front of your crush, but remember that if you were ever to end up in a relationship with her you would want it to be based on honesty.


If she doesn’t seem interested, that may be hard to swallow but at least it won’t be because you were trying to be something that you’re not.
If she responds well, you know that you can be yourself with her and that’s a great place to start a relationship.

, If she seems as though she’s interested in you, the conversation will likely progress well. Take advantage of the situation by asking if it would be okay for you to call her or add her on social media.Asking for a phone number often seems flirtatious in nature, so it may be easier or more casual to ask if you can add her on social media if you’re unsure of her level of interest.
Try saying something like, “would you mind if I gave you a call sometime?”
If you would rather use social media, bring it up casually by asking if she uses the platform of your choice. Try saying something like, “are you on Facebook?” If she says yes, respond by saying, “would you mind if I sent you a friend request?”

Approach shyness like any other problem.,
Practice at home.,
Re-frame your idea of rejection.,
Stop trying to predict the future.",How to Approach a Girl if You're Shy and Don't Know What to Say3," Being shy is an emotional obstacle that you can overcome with effort and practice. If you needed to lose weight, you would create a plan to follow a diet and exercise. To overcome shyness, you can also create a plan.Come up with a plan to help yourself overcome your fear of talking to a girl you like.
Use the plan to create short term goals that culminate in being comfortable approaching her.

, The first step in your plan to overcome your shyness should be to practice engaging with people at home. Get comfortable saying things out loud like introducing yourself or giving a pleasant greeting.Practice can make giving a greeting or an introduction a matter of muscle memory, so you don’t really have to think about it when meeting with people in person.
Practice in front a mirror so you can see what you look like when you interact and make adjustments to present a more confident demeanor.

, Shyness often comes from a fear of being rejected. It’s perfectly natural to take rejection personally, but that doesn’t mean that you should. Instead of thinking of rejection as a personal failure, see it for what it really is: a learning experience.More often than not, being rejected has less to do with you than it does with the other person. People have bad days, experience bad moods, or struggle with their own insecurities when it comes to dealing with others.
Rejection won’t kill you. In fact, if you adopt the right perspective, it may not even hurt. Instead of seeing rejection as a failure, see it as a chance to learn from your experience and develop a better understanding of how to interact with others.

, A fear of rejection comes from the common practice of trying to predict how events will occur before you experience them. Humans developed the ability to imagine worst-case scenarios as a survival skill, but this trait can be difficult to overcome in situations where danger isn’t a factor.Don’t allow yourself to ruminate on all the ways approaching a girl you like could go wrong.
If you can’t help but imagine the ways a social interaction may go, try to focus on imagining it going well. This can increase your confidence and make you come off as a more self-assured person.

Hang out in groups. Sometimes, you cannot avoid the person who likes you. Perhaps you work in a small office or go to a small school. In these cases, ensure that any time spent in proximity to the person who likes you is spent in the presence of others, as well.;
, There is no need to be rude to someone just because they like you unless they have acted rudely or inappropriately. This person likely has feelings for you, so being cordial and polite to them will avoid any unnecessary hurt on their part and will also keep your conscience clean in relation to your dealings with them.


For instance, if they greet you with a “good morning, beautiful” you can just say “good morning” to them very politely and keep walking to your destination.

, Even if you do not like this person, it is still flattering to know that someone has a crush on you, making it easy to play into it occasionally. However, such should be avoided as it can cause confusion and produce mixed signals, which will likely cause their behavior to continue and their feelings to deepen.


Don’t laugh excessively at their jokes.
Don’t be touchy feely. Avoid touching them unless absolutely necessary.
Don’t compliment them unless related to work or school. Any other compliments could be misconstrued as flirting. For instance, you could tell them “great job on that project!” at work or school as opposed to complimenting their looks or intellect.

, Responding to texts or calls consistently and enthusiastically can send the wrong message. If they text you about work or school, reply to their message directly and succinctly. If they text or call you about non-work or school related issues, it may be best to not respond or to find a way to end the conversation.


For instance, if they text you something like “what’s up?” you could respond by saying “I’m a bit busy right now, see you at work tomorrow!”

, Being around someone who likes you who you don’t like can be stressful. You may feel nervous, guilty, or even annoyed. When you see them, do your best to keep these emotions in check. A person who likes you is looking for an emotional response from you; don’t give it to them.


Monitor your facial expressions. Don’t frown or smile too broadly when you see them.
If you feel nervous, take a few deep breaths and sit down for a few moments.

, If your friends know about the crush and know that you don’t like the person, they will likely help you avoid interacting with them. If they see the person approaching you, they can intervene by either pulling you away or by interacting with both of you so you don’t have to be alone with them.


If your friends are not around and you are alone with the person, you can text them and ask them to call you instead, therefore giving you an “exit” from the situation.

, Perhaps the person who likes you is someone who you like as well, just not in a romantic way. These situations can be tricky because you still want to see the person but you don’t want to lead them on or cause them to misconstrue your actions. In these instances, give the person some space from you.


Don’t initiate contact with them unless necessary.
If your mutual friends are going out and you know the person will be present, take a raincheck for a while. Over time, their feelings may dissipate.

, If you are not friends with this person on Facebook or if you have an Instagram or Twitter, consider making your accounts private so they can’t see your pictures or read your posts.


If you are already friends, don’t delete or block them unless they are stalking you or commenting on every one of your posts. You can, however, restrict what they can see on some accounts. For instance, on Facebook in the sharing settings, you can choose who can or cannot see what you post.

, You may find that simply limiting your interactions with them is not enough. Even if you feel that you have been clear through your actions that you don’t want a relationship with this person, some people need to hear that directly. This will quell any confusion or doubt about your affections on their part.


You may begin the topic by saying something like “I get the feeling that, and please correct me if I’m wrong, that you may have a crush on me. I want to let you know, that while I am flattered, I am not interested in the same way. I hope that you understand.”
Be swift! If the person is making it clear that they like you, don’t let their feelings linger. Talk to them as soon as possible., During these conversations, it can be easy to backtrack or sugarcoat as not to hurt any feelings. However, this will not be helpful in the long run. Be very honest with the person and careful not to tell any white lies.


For instance, many people make the mistake of using the excuse “I’m dating someone” to avoid unwanted contact from someone else. You should make it clear to the person that you are not interested, regardless of your relationship status.
Don’t be dramatic. Though this person may like you, if they are reasonable, they will understand. Also, though you are certainly likeable, this is not the end of the world for them.

, Think about if you have led them on in the past, if you have spent a lot of unnecessary time with them alone, accepted gifts from them, or flirted in any way. When you talk to them, you should apologize for your role in the confusion.


For instance, upon thinking back on your relationship, you may realize that you have been flirtatious in the past. You could say something like “I know that in the past I have flirted with you, and I want to apologize for that. Sometimes I can be flirtatious, but I realize that I must have given you the wrong idea and I am sorry.”

, Rather than saying what you don’t like about them, focus on why you personally don’t want to be with them. “I” statements tend to sound less accusatory and often result in the other party feeling less defensive than when using “you” statements, while still conveying the message you want to say.


For instance, rather than saying “You act strange to me” you can say something like “I just don’t have feelings for you in that way”. There is no need to make them feel bad about themselves.

, If you genuinely like this person as a friend, offer your friendship to them. This will allow the both of you to progress politely and kindly but in a non-romantic fashion.


You can say something like “even though I am not interested in being in a relationship, I think that we could move more towards a friendship with one another” and see how they respond.
However, you must be prepared for them to potentially turn down your offer. Their feelings for you may be too strong to accept friendship. If they tell you this, thank them for their honesty and respect their wishes.

, Accepting a call after work from a coworker or after 10PM in general could send a mixed signal. Instead, if you feel it necessary, return their call the next day during daylight hours.


Don’t answer drunk texts or calls.

, Don’t allow sympathy for them to cause you to backtrack on your word. Remind yourself of the conversation you had with them. It is unkind to feed into their feelings if you don’t feel the same way about them. Show them kindness by honoring your word and holding firm to your commitments.


For instance, if they person calls you asking to reconsider, firmly remind them that you do not have feelings for them in that way. They need time to get over you, and giving them false hope won’t help either one of you.

, Don’t allow guilt over your unreciprocated feelings to consume you. Your feelings are valid and it is okay to not like someone. Remind yourself that everyone is not for you and focus instead on your own happiness. If you feel badly about your decision, put yourself in their shoes. Would you want someone to be with you out of guilt or pity? Of course not! Continue to focus on yourself and

, Though it can be easy to want to avoid this person at all costs to prevent awkward situations, this may hurt their feelings and cause them to seek you out even more. If you see them coming towards you, greet them and keep it moving.


Not ignoring them does not mean that you have to linger, however. Keep your conversation to a minimum while still acknowledging their presence.

, If this person is annoying, mean, or continues to makes passes at you, it can be easy to want to gossip about them to others. However, focus instead on continuing to show them kindness and not adding fuel to the fire.


Take special focus on not badmouthing them to coworkers; this will cause even more issues for you if you work together.

Really listen to the speaker.,
Recognize that validation does not require lying or agreeing with them.You can recognize that someone's feelings are valid without liking what they're doing.

,
Don't try to fix their feelings.,
Don't try to ""hoover"" their feelings.,
Avoid judging them or blaming them for their emotions.,
Be present.,
Summarize their feelings to show understanding.,
Put yourself in the other person's shoes and see the situation from his or her perspective.,
Place their feelings in general context.,
Share genuine empathy and sympathy.,
Use body language to show that you're listening.,
Use mirroring to show you share their feelings.,
Give them utter patience.,
Use small auditory signals to show you're paying attention.,
Show caring curiosity about their feelings.",How to Validate Someone's Feelings," When listening to a person's troubles, the first instinct is to respond with your advice, opinions or relevant stories in order to help. However, what most people really want is to just be heard and understood. Listen more closely to what they are saying, and empathizing first.


Listening does not mean be stonily silent. Saying things like, ""uh-huh"", ""what did he say about that?"" and ""that's terrible!"" show you are listening and facilitate talking.
After the person finishes, that is the time to ask if and how you can help.
If unsure whether the person needs advice or support, ask. Unsolicited help is rarely listened to, but if the person says they would like to hear what you have to say, that is typically listened to.

""Are you coming to me for advice, or would you just like to vent?""
""I had something like that happen to me. Would you like to hear about that?""
""I have some ideas that might help you. Do you want to hear about it?""

;
,, Sometimes people try to make their loved ones stop hurting simply because they don't want them to be upset. While well-intended, it usually doesn't help them feel better long-term, and they may feel like it is their fault for still being unhappy after your efforts.If you want to help, try listening to the whole story and validating their feelings along the way. Then ask how you can help or offer to brainstorm solutions.

, Hoovering means vacuuming up any unpleasant feelings and pretending they aren't there.Examples include:""Oh, it's not so bad.""
""It's not a big deal.""
""Let's stay positive.""
""Just toughen up.""
""Look on the bright side.""

, Treating people badly for feeling bad is an easy way to get them to stop trusting or talking to you. If you catch yourself doing this, stop yourself and apologize, then focus on having empathy for the other person. Here are some things to avoid.


""Whining about the situation isn't going to make it any better. Man up and deal with it.""
""You're overreacting.""
""So you decided to be mad at your best friend. How's that working for you?""
""Well, maybe he wouldn't have treated you that way if you hadn't been wearing such a short skirt.""
""Quit bellyaching -- it's not a big deal"".

, The most basic form of validation is to stay with them, even when their feelings are difficult or unpleasant. Put aside your own discomfort, and focus entirely on being there for them. Here are some ways to show you are listening:


Holding their hand
Sitting with them or rubbing their back
Saying ""I'm here""
Nodding and using fillers such as ""uh-huh"" and ""right"" (be careful not to use these in a sarcastic way, though)

, Repeating their feelings back to them shows that you hear them and are paying attention. You might rephrase their words, or infer how they must be feeling. If you get it wrong, let them correct you, and try again.""So you're frustrated that the professor gave you so little warning.""
""Wow, you seem really excited!""
""That must have been hard.""
""Tell me if I've got this straight: you felt hurt when my brother mimicked your disability accent, and I didn't say anything.""

, Place their feelings in personal context to validate them. If you are close to them and remember a past experience that's affecting them, you may choose to bring it up as a reason why you think their feelings are understandable.

""Given how Amy treated you, I totally understand why you'd want to take a break from dating. That's a lot to recover from.""
""After that last roller coaster ride, I can see why you'd be hesitant about this one. Want to ride the merry-go-round instead?""
This technique can be tricky, especially if you are basing it on conjecture, or talking about a way that anyone would feel in that situation. If you're unsure, try using another validation technique.

, Stating that anyone would feel a similar way in a given situation can help them feel that their emotions are normal and justified.


""It's okay to be squeamish about your flu shot. Nobody likes those.""
""Of course you're worried about asking your boss for a promotion. This sort of thing is scary for everyone.""
""Well, no wonder you don't feel like going out today.""
""I understand why you feel as if what Ryan said was demeaning to you. As I know from being called that before, calling anyone a 'big, fat loser' is very cruel, deprecating, and brings self-confidence way down"".

, Give a ""radically genuine"" responsethat shows complete identification with their feelings. This might mean sharing them (e.g. if you are experiencing something together) or saying that you personally can relate.


""That sounds difficult.""
""I totally understand. I would have responded the same way.""
""Yeah, I miss her too. It's more fun when she's here.""

, Look at them, and turn your head or entire body towards them while they speak. You may want to stop whatever else you are doing. Show that you are attentive and present.


If you are doing something else while you listen (e.g. folding laundry or cooking), then look periodically at the person and use other cues to show you're paying attention.
If your body language is affected by a disability, you can still show that you are listening. Try accommodating your needs (e.g. fidgeting with one hand while looking at their chin) or explaining outright that your body language is different, but you are still listening.

, Mirroring is the practice of mimicking someone else's body language: smiling when they smile, leaning back when they lean back, or looking concerned when they look concerned. It is an easy way to visually demonstrate empathy.


You don't need to perfectly copy their body language or facial expression. A loose approximation will clearly communicate that you're empathizing.

, Some people's communication may be awkward, halting, or otherwise unusual, especially if expressing feelings or communicating in general is hard for them. You can show you care by continuing to listen, and not pressuring them to hurry up and finish what they are saying. This helps them relax and communicate better. It also helps them feel a bit better.

, Cues like ""uh huh"" and ""yeah,"" along with periodically nodding your head, show that you're paying close attention and caring about what they have to say.

, You can ask questions to help you learn more about the situation, and to encourage the person to keep talking and letting out their feelings.


""Then what did you do?""
""How so?""
""What bothered you the most about that?""
""Has this situation happened before?""

Wear clothing that conveys friendliness and approachability.,
Strike a friendly pose.,
Smile more.,
Make and hold eye contact.",How to Avoid Being Seen As a Loner by Others1," Although your clothing is not a perfect representation of who you are and how you feel, it reinforces your own attitudes about yourself while conveying those sentiment to others. Research has shown that the clothes we wear not only affect other people’s impressions of us, but also change our attitudes about ourselves. If you want to be approachable, wear clothes that make you feel good about yourself and people will talk to you. Avoid clothes that others might be turned off by. For example, overly revealing clothing might make others feel uncomfortable and, therefore, avoid talking to you.;
, Body language is an important indicator of how you feel about yourself. If you want to convey approachability put your shoulders back, straighten your spine, and hold your head high. Much like your clothing, taking a confident posture also has the added bonus of convincing brain that you are not a loner. Avoid slouching or an posture that makes you appear to be hiding. People are less likely to approach you if it looks like you are avoiding them.

, Smiling conveys friendliness and a willingness to engage. Keeping a grin on your face and a glint in your eyes conveys friendliness and will help you appear less like a loner. , This is the primary tool for establishing nonverbal connections with others and conveying your approachability. A furtive glance tells others that you are insecure, untrustworthy and, therefore, someone they should avoid. If eye contact makes you uncomfortable, try looking at a spot on the spot one the other person’s forehead between their eyes. This gives the appearance of eye contact without actually doing it.

"
"
Spend some time in close proximity to others.,
Talk to people.,
Hang out with your friends.,
Spend some time with your relatives.",How to Avoid Being Seen As a Loner by Others2," If the thought of striking up casual conversation with someone sounds intimidating, being near people others might challenge the idea that you are a loner. Sit near a group of people at lunch or find a crowd to hang around. You will look more social and you might inadvertently have a conversation.


Go to the library, a public pool, or some other place where people hang out and just chill.
In a library you might strike up a conversation by inquiring where a specific section is and then asking about a book they would recommend.

, Interacting with strangers can be a little scary, but it can be an important part of not appearing to be a loner. Strike up a conversation with someone and see how it goes. Remember, it is practice with little social consequences. Pay attention for topics that you have in common with the person you are talking to. These are great starting points for beginning a conversation.
For example, if someone is from a similar geographic region as you, or if you are familiar with where they are from, make a point of talking about that. Try to find a point of commonality with others. For example, you could ask, ""Have you always lived in this town?"" and you might find out that an acquaintance has lived in town the same amount of time as you or that you have relatives in the same neighboring state.
Talking to someone who has to talk to you can be a good way to practice. Chat up a customer service representative at a store or a waiter at your favorite restaurant.

, Your friends are the perfect group to help challenge the idea that you are a loner. Make time to for social activities with your friends and do it in a public place. Go to the mall or the arcade together.


Invite a friend to get coffee or meet up for lunch. Set a date and time and then stick to it.
Do not simply hang around people. You need to interact with them and chat.

, Your family members are a natural social network that you can tap. Go to family events and gatherings, or organize them yourself. This is a great way to socialize and challenge the idea that you are ambivalent about interacting with others.


Organize a family picnic or an outing to an amusement park. Create an event for your family to get together.
Although family is important, it is also key to develop friends besides your relatives. Grandma is great, but she might not be able to understand you the way as someone your own age.

Join a club or organization.,
Attend concerts, sporting events, plays, or other large gatherings of people.,
Volunteer your time with a charity or organization.,
Exercise with a group or join a team.",How to Avoid Being Seen As a Loner by Others3," The best way to not be perceived as a loner is to join a social group and engage with a large body of people. Find a school, religious, or community organization that shares your interests and become a member. You will squelch the idea that you are a loner and make new friends in the process.For example, join the local soccer organization, find a reading group, or become a member of a Sci-Fi fan club.
Although it is easier to find commonality in this setting, you still need to pay attention other people’s interests. Be attentive and engage in the conversation. Ask specific questions that address the other person’s interests and explore other areas of shared experience. For example, “Oh you really like the original Star Trek TV series. Have you watched Star Trek: The Next Generation?”
Be an active member. Your loner status will not disappear if you join a group and then do not engage with anyone. Join the club and then work to be an active member in it.

, Being seen in public will help dispel the idea that you are a solitary person. If you attend these same events enough, you will likely meet other regulars and build new relationships.


The comradery around sporting events can be a great place to socialize. Buy a jersey or cap and attend a game or viewing party.
Concerts are a great way to be social. Some diehard fans of certain bands travel around the country to attend shows, making news arounds across the nation.
Gain some specific knowledge about the event and use it as a conversation starter. For example, “I can’t believe that U2 still has all of its original members! How does a band like that stay together for nearly 40 years!?”

, The underlying assumption that many people have about loners is that they do not care or are ambivalent about other people. The best and easiest way to challenge that notion is to give your time to others.


For example, volunteer to serve food in a soup kitchen, read to the elderly, or work on a political campaign.
Strike up conversations with other volunteers by asking them about other charity work they are involved in and the issues they care about. There is a good chance you will have some common ground.

, Physical activity is a great way to engage with other people. It provides you with the opportunity to meet others who share your interests while helping you feel better about yourself.


Joining a gym will provide you with the opportunity to meet new people, while helping you stay fit.
A sports club provides you the space to exercise with the bonus of a strong social group. A team sport can be a particularly good place to build strong social ties and dispel the idea that you are a loner.
For example, strategize with your teammates about a new play or approach to utilize in your next game or match.

Acknowledge each person's intrinsic value as a human being.,
Allow others to maintain their dignity.,
Acknowledge each person's personal autonomy.,
Consider each person to be of equal worth to yourself.,
Practice self-respect.,
Really listen.,
Treat other people's ideas with due consideration.,
Don't intrude on the time and privacy of others.,
Be mindful of your words.,
Cultivate good manners.",How to Treat People With Respect," No matter who they are, each person has an intrinsic value that must be recognized and respected by you. When you ignore someone's value as a human being, you basically erase their humanity and any respect that they should be allowed.


Denying a person's basic value as a human being is a tactic associated with racism, sexism, and other dehumanizing practices. To treat each person as having intrinsic value is a step towards eradicating such terrible treatment of others.
For example: When you're with a woman, don't treat her as if she's simply a prize to be won, a vessel to have sex with, or an empty slate for you to cast your ideas on. Instead, treat each woman as a human being who has intrinsic value and worth.;
, This means, not only treating people as having intrinsic value, but also treating them in a way that allows them to maintain that sense of worth and well-being. Don't manipulate, exploit, or take advantage of others. And don't try to negatively tear them down.


Don't press unwanted sexual conduct on another person. For instance, don't ever send unsolicited naked pictures of yourself. Don't touch someone without first getting their consent, especially in a sexual area. And don't, absolutely don't, force someone to have sex with you, whether through manipulation, threatening, or intoxication.
Another example is, instead of ridiculing the poor as ""lazy"" or ""stupid,"" educate yourself about the things that can cause poverty, such as: the biased education system that fast-tracks middle income and rich kids and leaves the poor kids in the dust. Educate yourself on what lack of sleep and proper nutrition does to a person, so that you can have compassion on them instead of be prejudiced against them.

, This means allowing people to make their own choices, and to trust them to know what this means. Of course, you can give advice or offer your help, but remember, in the end, each person has to make decisions for themselves and be their own person.If you run into someone who is in a wheelchair and they are opening a door, offer your assistance, but only as the person in the wheelchair directs. Don't simply grab the door or the wheelchair in an attempt to help them. Likewise, if they decline your offer of assistance, say ""no problem"" and go on your way.
This is true even for children. It is important to offer them opportunities to have a say in decision-making, especially decisions that affect them. It teaches them that you both trust and respect them.

, It is important to remember that each individual has as much worth as you do, and that you should treat each person with the same respect that you yourself would like to be treated. This is often referred to ""The Golden Rule."" This means that you should not do something to someone that you yourself wouldn't want done to you.


It is also worth remembering that just because you believe in something, everyone else is not obligated to believe that same thing. For example: if you're a vegan, that's great, but acting as if that makes you somehow better than other people (who may not have access to the types of food that make veganism possible, or because of their diet issues) is rude and disrespectful.
Likewise, if you're a religious individual, and you start condemning people who do not share your religious viewpoints, you are being disrespectful to those people you are condemning. If you want to share your views with them, do this with gentleness and respect.
No matter what your own beliefs are, intolerance, prejudice, and discrimination are always disrespectful.

, Because you want to respect others as you would hope to be respected, it is incredibly important that you extend to yourself the same respect and courtesy that you would extend to another person.If you're thinking something along the lines of, ""I'm selfish if I don't spend all my time helping other people,"" reframe that thought into something like, ""By allowing time to myself, I can take better care of other people.""
If someone is disrespecting you and not seeing your intrinsic value as a person, you have the right to call them out on it. If someone says something discriminatory or cruel, speak up. Tell them what you found to be disrespectful and why.

, A lot of people don't listen very well, because they're distracted, checking their phone, or thinking about the next thing that they are going to say. Learn to ""really"" listen when other people speak.


Look people in the eye when they're talking to you. Don't let your gaze dart all over the room, or they will feel that you aren't really listening to what they are saying,
Pay attention as they are talking. You should keep your phone off or on silent.. If you find that your mind has wandered, ask them to repeat what they just said, so that you can be actively involved again in the conversation.

, This means listening to another person's ideas, opinions, and advice with an open mind. Even if you don't necessarily agree with them, give them the benefit of thinking about what they have said.For example, if a coworker approaches you with an idea that you think is completely off the wall, or unworkable, give them the benefit of listening to their idea and weighing the pros and cons. You might be surprised.
Now, if someone's ideas are disrespectful or harmful (like they present racist or sexist views, for example) you are under no obligation to listen to them and should, if you can, let them know that they are presenting disrespectful views.

, Time is something that we don't have a lot of in the modern era. Make sure that it's really necessary that you invade someone's privacy, before you try to. An example would be like the house is burning down, or there's been an accident etc.


If someone is reading in a public place, such as a coffee shop, public transport, or at the park, don't interrupt their reading time, especially if they have headphones in.
If you share a house with someone, check in with them before inviting a bunch of people over, and ask them for their permission first.

, The little children's rhyme about sticks and stones is completely not true. Words are ""very"" powerful and they can be incredibly disrespectful if used improperly. Think carefully about what you're going to say, and to whom. Otherwise you might hurt someone.Use the term ""someone with a physical disability"" rather than words like ""crippled,"" ""lame,"" or ""deformed."" This way you are not defining a person by their physical or mental disability.
Another good thing to remember is that a word like ""gypsy"" has a derogatory meaning towards the Romani people and is really unacceptable to use.
Even using a word like ""girl"" or ""chick"" to describe a woman above the age of 18 is infantilizing and disrespectful.

, This is as simple as saying ""thank you"" and ""please"" when you're requesting something from another person. It shows that you respect the time and effort that it will take for them to help you, and it will allow them to feel respected.Another example of showing manners is to not interrupt a conversation. If you have something to say, wait until the appropriate time to jump in.

Be confident.,

Join a support group.",How to Ask Loved Ones for Help when You Live Alone," It can be difficult to reach out for help, especially if you’re used to living alone and being independent. If you need help due to mental health problems, addictions, or you’re just really in a bind, remind yourself that this person loves you. They may be flattered that you confided in them or asked for help.It’s okay to reach out to your loved ones when you have a need.


If you discuss a personal matter in confidence, say to your loved one, “Thank you for listening and being a friend. I want you to know that what we discussed is private and stays between us. Please don’t share this with anyone else.”;
, Before you reach out for help, think about what it is you hope your loved ones can do for you. You may want emotional support, social support, medical assistance, help in the home, or financial contributions. What you want may influence how you ask and who you ask. For example, a request for money may be very different than a request for emotional support.


Think about something specific that you’d like help with before you make a request. Instead of saying, “I want help with my addiction” say, “I’d like help making sure I get to therapy and group therapy each week. Can you drive me?”

, You might need $52,000 for medical expenses; however, it’s unreasonable to ask for or expect someone to pay for that. Instead, you may say, “Recovery is difficult and I haven’t made it back to work yet. It’s hard to take care of the house by myself, and I’m wondering if you can help me with finances.” Asking someone to take time off from their full-time job to help you after surgery may be too much, however, it’s more reasonable to ask someone to check on you after work a few times.Don’t make demands of people. Often, the tone of voice and words chosen are the difference between asking and telling. Say, “Would you be willing to buy cat food?” or, “Can you help me with my laundry?” instead of pressuring someone or demanding something.Try giving the person two or three options for ways they can help you so they can choose what works best for them. You could tell them some of the things you need help with and ask, ""Do you think you could help me with one of these things?""

, While it is important to consider what your loved ones have going on in their own lives before you ask for help, this should not necessarily stop you from asking for help. You may be afraid that the person is too busy and you don't want to disrupt their lives, but don't assume your friend cannot or will not help you because they have their own struggles. Remember that this person cares about you, and part of being a friend is being able to ask for help when you need it. Just remember that they may not be able to help you, and that's okay.


Consider how you might return the favor. If it’s an hour-long drive for your loved one, consider offering something in return for their help, such as babysitting their kids or helping them in a way that they need it.
If someone does agree to help you, be sure to express gratitude for their care and kindness.

, Whether it’s a lunch or dinner date or a yoga class, find time to meet with a loved one in-person.If you need help, it may be easier to ask over an activity than completely out-of-the-blue. Don’t make the meeting all about asking for help, but do use it as an opportunity to state your needs.


Say, “Your friendship is important to me and I care about you deeply. This is why I’m hoping you’d be willing to help me.”

, If getting together isn’t possible, use technology to get in touch. While face-to-face interactions are better, technology can be a good substitute, especially if loved ones are far away. Write an email, send a text, or schedule a video call to your loved ones and let them know what’s going on.You can say, “It’s difficult living on my own, especially when I’m in need of help. Even though you’re far away, I’m hoping you can help me.”

, If you’re getting surgery and are asking for help with recovery, let your loved ones know ahead of time what you need. For example, you can say, “I need someone to drive me to and from my surgery in two weeks. Are you available?” or, “It would be helpful if someone could give me my medications once I’m home.”


If your loved ones need to take time off of work, travel, or buy something, they should have time to prepare for these circumstances.

, If you have a large request, consider asking several loved ones for help. For example, if you have a medical problem, reach out to several people to help you manage it. If you have daily appointments, have someone help you for one day each. This ensures that you get your needs met without relying too heavily on one person.


Say, “Because I cannot drive, I need help getting to my regular appointments. Would you be able to drive me on Tuesdays?”

, Whatever you need help with, it can be cathartic to talk about it with someone you love. Think about someone who makes you feel safe and understood and reach out to them. Even if there’s nothing the person can do to make the situation better, it can still be calming for you to talk about it.Be clear about what you want. If you just want a listening ear, say so. If you’re looking for advice or another perspective, communicate that. This can help shape how the person responds to you.
You can say, ""I'm feeling lonely and depressed, do you have time to talk?"" or, ""I need some advice on dealing with insurance, do you think you could help?""

, Asking for support from friends and family may be as simple as inviting someone to join you for activities. If you feel lonely and want to try new things, enlist the support of a loved one. For example, go to a yoga class together or take a bike ride. Activities are a great way to spend time together, build friendship, and build your hobbies and skills.Make jewelry, learn a new language, or begin painting. You can also volunteer or join a gym.
Consider, too, that these activities may help you expand your social circle further, especially if you don't know anyone locally.

, If you are sick, unwell, or in recovery, ask for a weekly or daily check-in.This can be a personal visit, email, phone call, or video call. Tell the person why you’d like the be checked on and what time would be best. Let them know any questions you’d like them to ask you or specific things to check in on.


Say, “It’d be helpful if you could check in on me each week. It’s hard for me to get back on my feet, and knowing you’re looking after me would help me.”
Even if you live far from loved ones, these check-ins can be helpful in feeling loved and supported from a distance.

, If you feel alone or isolated yet your loved ones are far from you, consider joining a support group. Support groups exist for people who have medical and mental illnesses, addictions, or share similar life circumstances. Attending a support group can be a great way to receive social and emotional support from your community.If you’re nervous to attend a support group, ask a loved one to attend the first meeting with you, if at all possible.
Join an in-person group in your community by calling up your local hospital, mental health clinic, or asking a spiritual advisor. You can also join on-line support groups.
Becoming involved in a church/spiritual community or another close-knit group can help increase support and take the weight off just one person.

Try to be memorable during an interview.",How to Talk to Strangers," Talking to strangers is like any other skill: the more you do it, the better you get at it. With enough practice, it will feel completely natural to you. You won't even have to think about how to manage conversations with strangers. The best way to practice is to set weekly goals. Don't overwhelm yourself! If you find talking to strangers overwhelming, take it slow at the beginning. You might begin by promising yourself that you'll talk to two strangers in a week. Add one person each week.
Keep pushing yourself, though! There's a fine line between taking on too much and not taking on enough. While you don't want to overwhelm yourself, you also don't want your fear to hold you back. Get out of your comfort zone.;
, That’s right — don’t invite anyone along. Put yourself in a social situation where you won't know anyone else. Without any friends to hide behind, you'll be more likely to put yourself out there. Keep these outings low-stakes. If you don't talk to anyone the first couple times, that's fine! You still went out and were among strangers, which you never would have done before! Look for events around town where you'll be able to start conversations with strangers:


Art shows
Book readings
Music concerts
Museum exhibitions
Outdoor festivals
Geek gatherings
Parades/rallies/protests

, With her help, you can practice talking to strangers while still having a familiar face to make you feel comfortable.


Don't let your friend carry the entire conversation, though. Make sure she knows that you want to contribute more than you might normally contribute.

, If you obsess over all the ways things can go wrong before you start a conversation with a stranger, you're setting yourself up to fail. The more you think about it, the more anxious you'll get. When you see someone you want to talk to, break the ice immediately, before you have a chance to talk yourself out of it. The adrenaline of the moment will carry you past your nerves., If you go on a job interview or want to talk to an attractive person, you might worry that everyone can see how uncertain you feel. But no one knows how nervous you are but you! Just pretend you're more confident than you actually feel, and the person you're talking to will see what you want them to see.


Remember, the more you practice talking to strangers, the less you'll have to fake your confidence.

, When you start putting yourself out there, you may well get the brush-off from someone you approach. But as a shy person, you know perfectly well that sometimes, people just don't feel like talking. If someone rejects your approach, don't take it personally!


Try to see failure as exciting — it’s a chance to learn and improve.
People don’t bite. The worst thing that can happen is that someone will say they're busy or want to be left alone. That's not the end of the world!
Nobody's watching or thinking about you but you. Don't worry about people laughing at you — they're all busy thinking about themselves.

, If you look anxious or grim when you open up a conversation, you’re going to put the other person on edge immediately. Even if you feel like a mess inside, try to look relaxed and friendly to put other people at ease. This will result in better, longer conversations.


Make eye contact. Instead of fiddling nervously with your phone, look around the room and observe the people. Make eye contact with people to see who else is looking for conversation.
Smile whenever you make eye contact with people, even if you don't plan to talk them. It both gives you practice in non-verbal communication and raises the odds of someone being receptive to a conversation.
Open up your body language. Throw your shoulders back, stick your chest out, and raise your chin. The more confident you look, the more people will want to talk to you.
Don't cross your arms over your chest. People might interpret crossed arms to mean that you're closed off or uninterested in conversation.

, Others might find it strange if you start talking to them without giving any hints that you were going to approach them. Instead of walking up and starting a surprise conversation with the side of someone's head, ease into it nonverbally. Make eye contact and give a smile to establish a connection before trying to start a conversation.

, You might want to get to know someone, but opening with deep conversation topics out of the blue might turn people off. If you're doing a cold-approach (not reacting to something you've both observed), start small. Instead of opening with a question about life goals, just make an observation or ask for a favor:


Man, the bar's slammed tonight. We'd better leave good tips!
Traffic's a nightmare today! Do you know if there's an event in the neighborhood?
Could you plug in my laptop cord for me? The outlet's behind you.
Do you know what time it is?

, Once you've opened with your small interaction, you want to find out the other person's name. The best way to do that is simply to offer your own name. Etiquette will basically force the other person to introduce themselves in kind. If he ignores your introduction, he's either in a very bad mood or is rude — either way, it's best you don't try to pursue this conversation.


After you've finished your opening interaction, just say ""I'm , by the way."" Offer a firm handshake as you're introducing yourself.

, Instead, ask questions that encourage the conversation to open up rather than close down. For example:


""What have you been up to today?"" instead of ""Are you having a good day?""
""I've seen you here a lot. What keeps you coming back? What's so great about this place?"" instead of ""Do you come here often?""

, Everyone likes to feel like they're an expert on something. Even if you know a lot about the subject you end up talking about, ask the person to explain things to you. For example, if a news event comes up, say ""Oh, I saw some headlines, but didn't have time to read the article at work today. Can you tell me what that was about?"" People enjoy conversations more when they feel like they have something to teach.

, Finding common ground in a conversation is very important. As strange as it might seem strange, though, a good disagreement can be a great way to form a new relationship. Show the person you're trying to talk to that hanging out with you won't be boring. Engage him or her in a debate that lets each of you show off your intelligence.


Keep the debates light-hearted. If you see the other person getting worked up, back off immediately.
You want a good-natured back and forth, not an argument.
Make sure to smile and laugh often while debating to let everyone know you're having a good time, not getting upset.

, While you want to have a debate, you don't want to stray into areas that will lead to an actual argument. A debate about religion or politics might result in hurt feelings, but one about the best travel spots or football team will stay light-hearted and fun. Other safe topics might include movies, music, books, or food.

, You might be tempted to stick to a prepared list of conversation topics. Doing that would limit the conversation's potential, though! Let the conversation grow organically. You can try to steer it gently toward topics you're more comfortable with, but don't manhandle it awkwardly. If your partner wants to talk about something you don't know much about, just admit it. Ask them to explain it to you and enjoy learning something!

, Talking to people in line at the grocery store or in an elevator is a great way to practice talking to strangers. Because you'll be in the same place for such a short time, you know that you'll be able to leave the conversation quickly, which can calm you down. Don't get into deep topics during these interactions. Keep it light and observational: ""Man, this elevator smells terrible"" or ""Please convince me not to impulse-buy all this checkout aisle candy.""

, If you're at a coffee shop, bar, or lounging in the chairs at a book store, you have more time to spend in the conversation. Try to enjoy it! Joke around and show off the fun side of your personality that only your long-time friends usually get to see.

, If you meet someone you think you'd like to ask out, ask more personal questions. Not only does this make the new relationship immediately more intimate, it also teaches you a lot about the person you're talking to. You can size them up to see if they'd even be a good match for you.


Don't push too far, though. Asking someone if they want to have kids in your first conversation would be very overbearing.
Instead, offer semi-personal details about yourself, and let the other person decide whether they want to share. For example, ""I'm a real mama's boy/daddy's girl. If we don't talk every day, I just don't feel right.""

, You might find yourself at a party with someone influential in your line of work. You might be at a professional conference. In any networking interaction, you want people to get the impression that you're confident and capable. Even if you feel anxious about talking to a stranger, fake it till you make it.


Don't make the kind of off-color jokes that might work well at a bar.
Stick to talking about the industry you work in. Show people that you know your stuff and are good at your job.

, The interview itself is important, but so is the small talk before and after the interview. Engaging the interviewer in pleasant conversation shows that you're someone they should want as a colleague. Furthermore, every single interviewee might answer the exact same questions. They might start to blend together in the employer's mind. Small talk is when you get to bring up a topic that makes you memorable.


Share something unique about yourself: ""I skipped rugby practice to come to this interview, so you know I want this job!""

Accept that people might not forget.,
Talk to people about it.,
Turn it into a strength.Maybe your bad reputation is a superpower in disguise.,
Change how others think.,
Denounce accusations as lies.,
Do good deeds consistently.,
Volunteer.,
Use the situation to learn.,
Impress others.,
Change parts of your life.,
Change yourself.,
Avoid superficial changes.",How to Repair a Bad Reputation," They may care less with time, but still remember. This doesn't mean fixing your reputation is impossible. Bad reputations are always potentially temporary. It all has to do with time. After some time, people stop caring so much about what you did in the past.


Many people encounter their own failures and the failures of others over time. These stand out more, and they forget about you. Remember that you remember your own failures better than other people. Your bad reputation may be worse in your head than it is in the eyes of others.
Research shows that, contrary to popular perception, when compared to other means of social evaluation, reputation matters measurably less than other factors.Go off the grid and take a break from social media and online.;
, Be frank when addressing the issues surrounding your bad reputation. If you are calm, respectful, and genuinely concerned, they are likely to help you. By not verbally addressing the problem, you let people's imaginations run wild, and you give rumors free-range. If someone is actively spreading news of your bad reputation, talk to them first.
Ask friends their opinion on the matter.
Try not to be defensive.

, Take some time to think about how your bad reputation may be a positive thing and reframe your perception of the situation. You might not be promiscuous, you could be in charge of your sexuality. If people think you play a sport too aggressively, maybe you're your team's heavy artillery.

, Sometimes you just need to control the perceptions of others. They may not be seeing the situation in the right light. If you can, help others to see the situation in an entirely different light.


Provide a calculated positive perspective. This means finding ways to reframe events and actions that give you a bad reputation.For example, sometimes people shame promiscuous behavior, while others present promiscuity as “owning your sexuality” or being “sex positive.” Think of ways you can help people see your actions in a new light.
Be aware that you may not be able to sway everyone's opinions.

, You may just need to say the reputation is not true. If you have been lied about, it may take some time to undo the damage. Be assertive(not aggressive), and make sure you spread the word as soon as possible. Ask other people to help set the story straight. The longer this bad reputation exists, the harder it may become to manage it.


Clarify any misunderstandings.
Be vocal when challenging lies.

, A quick way to improve your reputation is to do good deeds. Be careful: if you've recently developed a bad reputation, you might seem desperate or like you're overcompensating by doing a bunch of good deeds. This isn't a quick fix. You must do good deeds consistently for your reputation to improve, otherwise you risk seeming insincere. It is hard and time consuming to build a reputation, but quick and easy to ruin it. Consistency is crucial to firmly establishing your reputation.


Get your co-workers coffee, or offer to pick up a shift if they need time off.
Offer your friends help, like a ride or a hand before they need to ask.
Go out of your way to make sure people are feeling okay if you sense there might be something wrong.

, There are a great number of ways to volunteer your time. Care for the elderly or disabled, community gardens and events, as well as church-centered opportunities all are great ways to volunteer. Animal shelters are also great opportunities to help. By giving up your time in the service of others, you can do a great deal to improve your reputation.


If you're still in school, see what sort of opportunities they can help you find. Many public schools and colleges offer different volunteer opportunities for students.
Some businesses offer volunteering programs that may come with perks. Talk to your supervisor or HR department to see what sort of opportunities they provide.
Give talks or lectures at a local school, organization, library or civic group on a topic you know and that would be helpful for others.

, Become compassionate towards others with bad reputations. By being nice to those who are not thought well of, after having gained insight from your reputation experience, you can develop positive perceptions. Take the opportunity to see the people who have bad reputations around you that may be in need of a friend.

, Go above and beyond.Do something amazing. Learn to play a musical instrument. Win a scholarship or award. Run a marathon. By doing impressive things, you can improve how people view you. Respect from others can go a long way toward improving your reputation.

, External factors, such as friend groups, habits, and workplace can be part and parcel to how your reputation evolves. A toxic environment with toxic people and relationships may be the source of your problems. Take some time to consider whether or not you need to make some changes in the people and places of your life.


If you have a bad reputation among friends, maybe it is time to spend time with different people. Maybe your friends are encouraging habits that make people think poorly of you.
At work, toxic employment environments can create unreasonable expectations of people. A work environment which encourages an unhealthy work-life balance can make it seem that a hard working, dedicated individual is lazy. Examine your workplace culture, and think about whether or not a value clash is causing your reputation to suffer. You may want to find a new job.

, This can be a very difficult thing to accomplish. But when you see yourself through the eyes of others, and you don't like what you're looking at, make a change. Changing yourself is hard because we develop strong patterns and habits in life. However, by making big changes in your behavior, people will take notice. This will change how they see you, and it may cause others to re-evaluate their perceptions of you as a person.


Seek professional help, such as a therapist or psychiatrist.
Find a life coach or a spiritual guide to help you find ways to make internal changes.

, Superficial change is not the same as an authentic change. Inauthentic behavior is hard to keep consistent.When you're not being authentic, people notice. Real change is harder than pretending to be different.

Show gratitude.,
Compliment the achievements of others.,
Be sincere.,
Do what you say you'll do.,
Offer your assistance.,
Respect the abilities of others.",How to Show Respect1," Thank people for their assistance and their support on a regular basis. It's important to remember all the people who've helped you on your journey. Show respect by saying thanks. Even if there's not an obvious occasion for thanks, showing it regularly will mean a lot to people. Send letters, calls, emails and texts to people you've lost touch with. It doesn't need to take more than a few minutes to express yourself. Remember to thank your:


Parents
Siblings
Co-workers
Classmates
Friends
Teachers
Neighbors;
, When others are successful, draw attention to it and celebrate their ability and their achievement. Learn to recognize when other people put forth extra effort and achieve something and praise them for it with sincerity. Take them aside and do it in private, so your compliments will seem genuine.


Instead of making your first reaction, ""Why didn't that happen to me?"" try saying ""That's so great for them!"" Keeping a positive attitude will focus attention away from yourself and spread goodwill.
If someone you respect seems to be having a rough time, or seems to have less to compliment than others, make an extra effort to compliment their effort, their attitude, or other positive attributes.

, While it's important to thank people and praise others, most people don't usually respect brown-nosing. Be genuine in your thanks and in showing your respect to other people's effort. Speak from the heart.


Even something as simple as ""It's always good to see you"" can mean a lot and show lots of respect. It doesn't need to be complicated.

, If you commit to an event or make plans with someone, come through on your end of the deal. Being reliable shows respect for people's time, and shows that you're making a special effort to be there for them. Respect other people's efforts by being on time, being prepared, and being enthusiastic.


Always come to work, school, or sports practice ready to go. Have your materials in order and complete all the necessary work ahead of time. You'll show respect for others by not wasting their time.
It can seem like telling someone ""No"" will be disrespectful, but you've also got to learn to be consistent and realistic with your abilities. It's hard to respect flakiness.

, Go out of your way to help people when it seems like they need it, especially if it isn't required of you. Volunteer to help your friend move, or stay late to help clean up after school events. Go above and beyond. Even helping your little brother with his homework or helping your dad clean the yard without being asked shows a tremendous amount of respect.


If it seems like one of your friends or neighbors is feeling down or going through a rough patch, give them the encouragement that they might need. Learning to say, ""You've got this"" can make all the difference in the world for someone who might be struggling.

, Offering too much help can sometimes be disrespectful. Sometimes, it's also smart to take a step back and let other people prove themselves and take care of manageable situations or problems on their own.


Try to recognize when someone is capable of doing something on his or her own and mind your own business to show that person the respect he or she deserves. There's a big difference between offering to help someone emotionally when he or she is going through a bad break-up and insisting on helping someone make cereal.

Be a good listener.,
Ask lots of questions.,
Learn about the perspectives of others.,
Pick your battles.,
Respectfully disagree.",How to Show Respect2," Practice active listening to show people that you have respect for their opinions and ideas. Watch and be quiet when someone else is talking and spend time thinking actively about what they're saying.


Too often, we wait to talk instead of really listening to other people's ideas. Even if you think you disagree, try to consider the point of view and empathize with it before responding. You're showing respect to the person by hearing them out and letting them make their own case. You might be surprised.

, To show respect for other peoples' opinions, question them. Ask open-ended, leading questions that show you're fully engaged with their ideas and that you're listening closely. Questioning doesn't mean that you're trying to poke holes in their story, or that you don't believe them. Ask for more when it seems like they might have more to give.


Instead of asking for more details, ask about how someone feels about a particular topic. If someone's telling a story, ask ""How'd you feel afterwards?"" Even if you think you know, let them tell you. Let them make their own case.
Learn to spread the wealth. If it seems like someone isn't talking much in a group conversation, ask them a specific question to open the door for communication. You don't need to draw attention to it by saying something like, ""You're awfully quiet, Steve"" just say, ""Steve, what did you think of the Super Bowl?""

, Learning to empathize with other people who have very different experiences and perspectives than your own will help you learn to show respect. Be proud of your own opinions and perspectives, but don't assume everyone feels the same way and avoid putting them in an awkward position. Temper your attitudes and learn where people are coming from before you share your opinions so you can know how to respond.


While it might seem easy to make a casual comment about how ""dumb"" football is in a mixed group, you can never know if someone's recently-deceased grandfather made a living as a ref and loved the sport dearly.

, Sometimes it shows respect to speak up and voice your opinion, as a way of respecting the intelligence of others. On the other hand, sometimes it's better to hold back on your opinions and avoid unnecessary arguments that raise tempers. Showing respect


Try softening your arguments the first time you bring something up. If you think college football is a vicious and disgusting money trench, package that message in a respectful way and voice it, even if others will disagree: ""It worries me that so much money is funneled into student athletes at the expense of other more important things. What do you think?"" Show respect for their opinion by sharing your own and listening to their argument.
Perhaps there's little use in arguing with your great uncle about gay marriage for the umpteenth time. Will it be worth it to bring it up at the dinner table?

, When you have to dissent, do it calmly and by treating your conversation with tact. Respect the perspective of the other person. Don't insult their opinion or ideas, even if you disagree with them.


Try to acknowledge common ground before adding your disagreement. Straight with praise and then move to your addition to the conversation. Even something as simple as ""That's a good point. I think I'm seeing it a little differently though..."" does the trick in lightening your disagreement.
Be specific with your critique, avoiding simple or insulting language like ""You're wrong"" or ""That's dumb.""

Take care of yourself.,
Avoid self-destructive behaviors.,
Stay healthy.,
Stand up for yourself.,
Be ambitious.",How to Show Respect3," To show respect for yourself, Try to give yourself the same consideration that you give everyone else. Don't short-change your own ideas and wants at the expense of others. You're worth it.


Know when to ask for help. Have respect for your own abilities and skills, but learn to recognize when you're out of your element. Don't make it harder on yourself than you need to.
Treat yourself to well-deserved trips and gifts every now and again. Spend time with your friends and do fun things in your free time.

, Drinking to excess on a regular basis or habitually self-deprecating yourself will tear you down in mind and body. Try to work actively to build yourself up and surround yourself with encouraging, enlightening, helpful people.


Are your friends the kind of people you want to be around? Do they ever criticize you or Try to keep you down? Consider moving on.

, Make regular visits to the doctor to make sure you're healthy and fit. Take care of health problems as soon as they arise and don't put off ""bad news."" Avoiding the doctor's office because you don't like it isn't showing respect for yourself and your own well-being.



Exercise regularly and eat well. Start developing easy routines, even walking a few miles a day or doing some light stretches to get in touch with your body and maintain it. Cut out junk foods and eat a variety of nourishing foods.

, When you want something, go out and get it. Don't let your fear about stepping on toes get in the way of making things happen that will better your life and achieve something positive for yourself. If you've got an opinion, share it. If you want to change jobs, start a band, or take up acting in your 40s, do it. Make a decision and follow through.

, We all get caught in ruts, many of them of our own making. Develop plans for yourself and specific steps for carrying them out. Plot an upward trajectory for yourself to keep yourself moving forward in life and staying satisfied. Show respect for yourself by being the best version of yourself you can be.


Consider making a five-year plan to get where you want to go. If you're a student, what are your college plans? Your after college plans? How might you realistically achieve those goals?
If you're in the working world, are you happy in your job? Are you doing what you love? What would it take to get paid for your passion? How long would it take to make it happen? Is it possible? Answer these questions honestly and specifically to develop a plan of success.

Don't judge people before you get to know them.,
Decide to like people.,
If you can't say anything nice...well, you know.,
Worry about your own backyard.,
Reach out.",How to Show Respect4," Give people the benefit of the doubt, even people of whom you might have a bad first impression. Everyone is fighting a big fight. Assume they have good reasons for being the way they are, doing what they do, and believing what they believe.

, It's too easy to come up with reasons to dislike someone, to disrespect someone, or to dismiss them. Instead, look for the spark and the warmth in people. Decide to like them, and it'll be much easier to show respect.


Translate a person's quirks into strengths to help change your attitude. Instead of thinking, ""That person is mouthy and egotistical"" say ""That person really speaks her mind. I like that spark.""

, Keep a lid on it sometimes. Learn to distinguish between confrontations that need to happen and silly arguments. You'll keep yourself sane and earn the respect of others by learning to keep quiet. Don't get dragged into the muck.

, Don't get mixed up in other peoples' business and create unnecessary enemies. Busybodies make quick enemies, usually because there's not enough going on to keep them occupied. Stay busy and keep your life full of interesting and engaging activities so you don't have the time and energy to worry about what your neighbors are doing, or how your classmates are doing on their homework.


Take up new hobbies and spend less time on Facebook. Getting your stalk on is a good time filler, but it can breed resentments and jealousies where none need be.

, Giving people you don't like the cold shoulder may be the easiest way to avoid confrontations, but it can also be cruel and rude, especially in school or at work where everyone likes to feel included. You don't have to be best friends, but respect people by including them.


Aim for at least one friendly attempt with people you don't especially like. ""How are you today?"" will at least show that you're trying. You might even change the way you feel.

Without this awareness, you may not be able to realize the underlying problem. After having made the decision to carryout a rather difficult task of breaking the pattern, it helps to have someone to support you go through this; however, once you are consciously aware of a behavior that you’re looking to change, it becomes easier to break it down into attainable goals.;
, Self-esteem can be described as your positive or negative evaluations about yourself. We all have good and bad days, and how we feel about ourselves often changes daily to reflect events. Self-esteem can also be thought of as a stable personality trait that develops over your lifetime.Do you have a pretty good opinion about yourself? Do you allow others to control the way you feel about yourself? If you find yourself looking to others to determine your self-esteem, this is a sign that you could work on your happiness.

, Comparative behavior happens when you compare yourself with other people, whether they are in superior or inferior positions to you. Usually, you compare positive or negative characteristics with your own. Sometimes, social comparisons can be helpful, but negative comparative behaviors can damage your own self-esteem.An example of positive behavior is when you compare yourself to someone with qualities you admire. Rather than just envy this person for his good quality (he is a caring person, for example), you strive to make yourself more caring.
An example of negative behavior is when you compare yourself with someone who has something you want. For example, you are jealous of this person’s new car.

, Write down the attitudes that are a direct result of comparing yourself to someone else. If you can, write it down immediately after having the thought or recalling the memory. This way, it's fresh in your mind, and you're more likely to be descriptive.


Think about how this comparison made you feel. Write down all the thoughts and feelings that come to mind. For example, you feel depressed because you are jealous of someone’s new car, and you still drive a 20-year-old car.

, Attempt to write about a time in your life when you can remember not comparing yourself to others and begin journaling from there. Eventually, you may remember where your comparative thoughts originated.


For example, you may think back to your childhood before you started comparing yourself to a sibling. You may then realize that you began comparing yourself to a sibling because you felt neglected. You can now start exploring the cause of your comparative behavior.
One of the hardest things about comparative behavior is realizing that it's having a negative impact on you. By tracking and acknowledging the way comparing yourself makes you feel, you'll be more likely to change the negative behavior.

, Once you realize that comparing yourself to others doesn’t work in your favor, you’ll look for additional measures of your success. If you start to feel and express gratitude for the gifts that you do have, you will shift your focus from others to yourself.


Spend more of your time focusing on the positive and good in your life. You may find that you start noticing more of it when you're not busy comparing yourself to others.

, A gratitude journal is a way to remind yourself of what you have. This will help you look at things that you may have taken for granted. Then, you can give appreciation to them. Think about several of your best memories. They can be things you did, places you went, friends, you spent time with, whatever makes you most happy. Focus on being grateful for those things.By keeping a gratitude journal you can increase your chances of success. However, just going through the motions without motivation will work against you.You need to force yourself to look at things you may have taken for granted and give appreciation to them. Make the decision to acknowledge the depth of your gratitude and enhance your life.
Write in depth. Instead of just making a laundry list of things, give a thorough explanation of a few things that make you feel grateful.
Write about surprises or unexpected events. This will give you a chance to savor the good feelings that you experienced.
You don’t need to write every day. In fact, writing a couple of times a week might be more beneficial than writing every day.

, By being kinder and less harsh with yourself, you will encourage yourself to go the extra mile and to try harder.

, It is tough to resist comparing yourself to others. But you are ultimately in control of your life. You make choices to lead your life in a particular way. You make decisions that are best for you, not for anybody else.It doesn’t matter what other people do or have. You are the one that matters in the course of your life.

, The Transtheoretical Model of change says that we go through stages leading up to our awareness of a situation. The individual goes through a process that finally ends by accepting the new behavior. These stages include:



Pre-contemplation: During this stage, the individual is not ready to change. Often, this is due to being uninformed or under-informed on the issue at hand.

Contemplation: This stage involves considering making a change. The individual begins to weigh the positive angles of change, although he is aware of the negative sides of changing.

Preparation: During this stage, the individual has made a decision to change, and has started making plans to institute the change.

Action: During this stage, the person is making efforts to change the behavior. This may involve a reduction in certain activities, or an increase in other activities, for example.

Maintenance: This stage involves maintaining a level of activity to ensure that the behavior has changed and remains changed.

Termination: During this stage, the behavior has changed so that the individual does not experience relapse, even under stress, depression, anxiety or other emotional states.

, We only focus on certain aspects of the person we idealize, and they become a grandiose fantasy that we create. We choose only to look at those features we idealize while we reject other characteristics that were not appealing to us.

, When you compare yourself with others, you may view yourself negatively. If you have negative thoughts about yourself, tell yourself to change those thoughts into something about yourself that you are proud of.


For example, if you know someone else who can write well, instead of envying her talents, think about your talents. Tell yourself, “I may not be the best writer, but I can draw very well. Besides, if I want to improve in writing, I can work towards this goal for myself instead of envying others for their talent.""

, Achieving your goals will help you establish your life and set of experiences separate from others’ expectations. Begin by stating your goal.


If you want to run a marathon, state this as your goal. You can assess where you’re at (for example, get a sense of how much distance you can run before any training begins).

, When you set a goal for yourself, track your progress so that you can see how you are moving toward that goal. This will help you focus on yourself and not on other people.


Go at your pace. Take your unique situation into account when you track your progress. For example, if you are taking longer to get a graduate degree than some of your friends, you can think about how you are also working full-time, or you are raising a family, or you are caring for your elderly parents. Everyone faces a unique situation that enables or restricts progress. Think about your circumstances as you track your progress.
If you are training for a marathon, you can track how much improvement you see every week. Run for a longer distance each week until you hit the 26-mile mark. At the same time you are gaining distance, you are also increasing your speed. By charting your progress, you can see how far you’ve come and how much further you have to go.

, If you see areas that you would like to improve, take classes, workshops or lessons to hone your skills and techniques. This will add to your self-confidence and help you find your place and value.


It's important to recognize that perfection is an unproductive thought pattern where one holds an unrealistic ideal as a standard of achievement. Recognize that everyone's circumstances are entirely unique. You can work on improving your abilities to make yourself happy.

, Many high achieving athletes and actors have said that they compete against themselves. They constantly try to improve their own personal best. That is a good way to elevate your esteem as you see yourself reaching higher and higher goals. When an athlete aims to be the best in his sport, he may be encouraged to set goals for himself and push himself to run faster and sharpen his skills., When you learn to use your standards to assess yourself, you will stop comparing yourself to others. This practice takes away the competition you may be feeling because other people’s expectations are not yours. If you acknowledge your ability to create the life you desire for yourself, you have control over the outcome. Judge yourself by your standards, and not by anyone else’s standards.

, Consider the advantage that others can bring you. If you have friends who are highly achieving people, you might consider that their networks are full of people who might be able to help you become more successful in your life. Instead of envying their success, use their success to your advantage.


For example, you might look at pictures of athletes to admire their fitness. Instead of feeling inferior and jealous, you can use these as motivation to make changes in your life. You might decide to change your eating habits and get more exercise. Then, you are using the pictures productively instead of negatively.

, Once you learn to judge yourself by your standards, you will feel freer to start with small, incremental risks. These risks will enable you to raise the bar even higher for yourself. Often what prevents people from reaching their personal best is that they’re afraid to take risks. They become bound up in fears that keep them from achieving beyond others’ expectations.


Start with small steps. This will help build your self-confidence in your abilities.

, When you surround yourself with supportive people, you will find that you improve your perception of yourself.

, Good coaching comes in many forms. There are those coaches who scream and humiliate their players. There are those who insist on excellence, push their athletes to run faster, jump higher, or swim more laps, but follow up with love and support. The coach who teaches with love is the one that will help produce the most balanced overall human being.


Think of yourself as your coach, pushing you toward excellence. Give love and appreciation for your efforts. Then you will reach goals that you set for yourself by raising your esteem, instead of destroying it.

, If you find that idealistic representations in the media are having a negative effect on your self-esteem, it may be a good idea to decrease your exposure to media and social media outlets. Limit your time spent on social media websites, or eliminate it altogether. Delete or disable your social media pages.


If you don’t want to completely disable or delete your Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account, then limit the time you spend each day, or each week, checking up on your accounts. For example, keep it to 10 minutes a day or 30 minutes a week, but use caution since even small amounts of exposure can lead to negative comparative thinking., Limit your exposure by avoiding fashion magazines, reality television shows, certain movies, and music, etc. If you found yourself frequently comparing you to a certain model or athlete, avoid magazines, shows, or games that feature them.


Even temporary exposure to media depicting ideal images has been shown to impact self-esteem and self-image negatively.This can even put you at risk for rumination and depression symptoms., Idealistic images in the media cannot always be avoided, so be aware if you're comparing yourself to them. Think about the realities of those seemingly perfect people or things.


For example, if you envy the perfect relationship that a friend has with her spouse, remember how difficult it was for her to find that partner and the challenges she may have faced. Empathy will replace jealousy.
If you see someone with the body, car, or life you want, try to think of actions you can take to get yourself closer to these goals and write them down.

, Find ways to use them that will enrich your life. Follow educational, informative, or inspirational pages. If you want success, follow entrepreneurial accounts. If you want to achieve a better physical condition, follow fitness and healthy eating pages. If you want to improve your mind and personality, try following brain and psychology-related accounts.

The skin: We, as people, show and reveal our personalities and traits towards others without even knowing it. It could be a simple conversation at the bus stop about the weather or other topics about lifestyle and the world around us.
Second layer: People whom we appreciate or get to know better, such as co-workers or classmates, rather than a random stranger, is now allowed to comprehend you better due to the comfort and trust between your relationship you have with them.
Third layer: Relationship bonds, such as best friends and marriages, create a ""locked"" sense of security between people. This layer is defined as presenting ourselves in ways where we connect on a personal basis, such as sharing secrets based on a trust factor, explaining fears and worries to another person, etc.
The core: Each person has a ""core"", where the thoughts and secrets aren't shared with anyone but oneself. This layer is more psychological rather than anything else, due to grasping onto the reality of something and the acceptance or failure to accept it.;
, Prepare to accept the truth that is handed instead of forcing oneself to believe something that is not.


Many situations may result because of embarrassment, guilt, and insecurity that blind us from accepting life in a reality state.

, Prejudice in psychology is far beyond race and gender. Acknowledge that prejudice is basing opinions on ideas without knowledge or facts. Keep yourself in a neutral state of mind before consuming your mind into false statements.

, Refrain from strangers, as you will need to observe them for some time. Suggestions include your significant other, co-worker, or friend.

, A baseline of a person is defined as their comfort zone or rest state.

, Make note on how they react to certain events, evaluate them on different days, and see how they interact.


All of us have different stress levels at work versus relaxing at home or if one holds a grudge against a specific person and acts completely different towards another.

, Shape your list to structure the most common traits and acts the person has shown or done. These patterns of the person is the foundation to start knowing the truth or false being of them.


Different vocal tones (normal tone, excited, fear, defensive, etc)
Eye movements
Facial expressions
Body language (how they present themselves)

, Draw a list of unexpected moments, behaviors, or ticks of this person that does not fit into their ""baseline"" profile.

, Allow their personal being, appearance, and styles become ""them"".

, Soft toned vocalization might mean that they are shy beings, but also consider other environmental factors such as tiredness. Loud tones show the need to feel higher than others or to take command or charge of others.


Does their voice change when defending an opinion, or are they neutrally balanced?
Do they communicate with you in a mature or immature manner? This would give you a better sense of their highest completed education level and vocabulary knowledge.
Make sure you're aware and can differentiate between exaggerations, sarcasm, slang, and other verbal expressions used in a conversation. Watch the context flow of words being used, as it would signal to you if they have a good educational background or making themselves sound smarter than they really are.

, Relate their home and/or work life to how they present themselves towards the public view.


What kind of neighborhood do they live in? Low-income housing tends to tell people that they can afford to be on their own, with assistance versus a person in a known wealthy neighborhood placement.
Organization skills tell a great amount, but don't judge that quickly. If they follow a heavy life schedule, an unkempt home might be that they don't have the time to keep it clean, while someone whom does have the time might come off as the lazy type. Usually the more organized a person is and they are willing to show it in public, the more confident they are and not stressed in an array of situations.
How do they share their personal life with others? Many of us aren't secure in doing so in public view, however, if you walked into a business office, you are walking into that person's ""comfort zone"" at work. A lot of business workers (even doctors and psychologists) position pictures of their family on their desk. It can decipher to you that the person cares about their family and reminds the person of them every time they see it.

, Handle these judgments as you do with cars and homes. One can interpret on the person's organization skills on how they dress and present themselves.


Are their clothes tucked in or hanging casually loose? Are they suited for a business environment or casual vacation? Does it look professional or fitted for someone living in the outskirts?
What about their hairstyle? Does it look like they spent time on it or more of a simple ""look in a mirror and quickly approve""? The ""look and go"" kinds of people may harvest an ""as long as it looks halfway decent"" personality than actually going through and seeing if it is the best they can do for a public appearance.
What kind of footwear do they have on? Do they take pride in having their shoes shined or do sandals have that last ""wear and tear"" to them?

, If they burp, do they make it conspicuous or do they try to conceal it? Burping, sneezing, and coughing in different ways can separate those whom exercise proper etiquette from the ones that don't.

, Are they looking straight in your eye or off to the side? Do their eyes stray away when asked for an honest answer? Look what paths the eyes goes when detecting lies.

, Some people tend to be nervous, especially in crowded areas, and think of any way they can to avoid being there.


Impatient people tend to tap their feet more at a stand-still position than relaxed individuals. They're also always fidgeting with something, such as lip biting, sighing, or looking at their watch/phone more than needed.

Make it clear that you accept them.",How to Relate to an Autistic Person," To relate to someone requires that you know where this person is coming from, so it is very helpful to learn about the challenges an autistic person faces. They may have trouble reading your emotions, or they might read your emotions but not be sure why you feel that way. In addition to this confusion, sensory issues and introversion are common, so socializing can be tiring. But the sense of a connection with you is still likely very important to them.To learn more about the symptoms and challenges of being autistic, see How to Recognize the Signs of Autism.;
, You may see in your friend a tendency to say or do things that are socially inappropriate at the time, such as saying something out loud most people have learned to keep in their heads, getting too close to someone else, or cutting in line.This is because understanding social rules can be difficult for autistic people.


It's okay to explain a social rule or tell them that an action of theirs upset you. For example, ""This isn't the back of the line, so we shouldn't cut in here. I see the back of the line over there."" Autistic people often have strong senses of fairness, so explaining how a social rule fits into these values may help.Assume that they mean well. Autistic people usually do not mean to be offensive. They don't want to hurt you or anyone else; they just don't understand how to respond.

, Autistic people tend to display a variety of atypical behaviors. For example, autistic individuals may:


Echo things someone else said. This is called 'echolalia'.
Talk about a topic for a long period of time, without recognizing when others have lost interest.
Speak honestly, and sometimes bluntly.
Interject with statements that seem irrelevant to the current discussion, such as pointing out a pretty flower.
Not respond to their own names.

, For many autistic individuals, routines are an important aspect of their lives. Because of this, you can better relate to an autistic person by keeping in mind that routine may matter a great deal to them; you can help this individual by making sure their routine stays on track throughout the day. If you have become part of this person's routine and then break it, it could be very upsetting to your friend.
Try to keep in mind their perspective as you interact with him. Keep in mind that just because you may not value routine that much, and so don't care much whether routine is deviated from or not, to them it may be a huge deal if you deviate from routine.

, Special interests are similar to a passion in non-autistic people, but are even stronger for an autistic person. Your friend may engage in their special interest(s) often, and love to talk about it. See if their interest area overlaps with yours, and use it as a tool to connect.


Some autistic people have more than one special interest at once.

, Every autistic person is different, and so it's important to understand them as a unique person.Difficulty reading tone of voice and body language is typical of autistic people, so they may need extra explanation.
Autistic people usually have slightly different body language, including an avoidance of eye contact and frequent stimming (repetitive self-soothing behaviors). Recognize your friend's own personal ""normal.""
Autistic people often have sensory issues. They may react differently, or even adversely, to strong odors (such as tuna), unexpected touches, loud noises, or certain textures (to name a few).

, There is a false stereotype about autism, most likely (unintentionally) propagated in part by the movie Rain Man, in which it is thought that most autistic individuals have super-human cognitive abilities (such as the ability to near instantly count how many toothpicks fell on the floor).In fact, such autistic savants are not all that common., On one hand, not seeing the person may lead you to introduce them as ""my autistic friend,"" stereotype them, or treat them like a child. On the other, refusing to acknowledge the disability and not accommodating their needs is also unhelpful. Strike a balance by treating their differences as natural, and overall unremarkable.


Don't tell people that your friend is autistic unless they have given you permission.
If they mention a need, accommodate it without making it a big deal. They may be surprised at your graciousness, and they will likely appreciate your being understanding., Autistic people may not pick up hints or cues, so it's best to directly state your feelings.This helps eliminate confusion on both ends, and that way if the autistic person has upset you, they have the opportunity to make amends and learn from it.


""I'm feeling really down about my day at work, and I need some quiet time right now. We can talk later.""
""Asking Jamal out was really difficult for me, and I was so surprised that he said yes! I can't wait for our date on Friday. Do you want to help me pick out what to wear?""

, Autistic people tend to move, speak, and interact in ways that are slightly offbeat.This is likely true of your friend. If so, keep in mind that it is part of who they are, and if you are going to be their friend, it's important to accept all of them.


If something crosses your boundaries (e.g., playing with your hair in a way that bothers you), or otherwise upsets you, it's always okay to explain how you feel.
If they state that they want to look less unusual, you might want to subtly point out when they do something strange. Explain it clearly and without condescension, the way you might tell a new driver how to merge onto a highway.

, If your autistic friend is looking to make new friends, then they may be interested in group events. No matter how obvious or subtle their autistic traits are in social settings, you might be surprised at how accepting other people are!, If an autistic person becomes overtaxed, it may end in screaming, crying, or losing the ability to speak. Your friend may not recognize stress cues on their own, so if you notice them becoming agitated, suggest that they take a break.


Help them get to a quiet, peaceful place with less noise and movement.
Take them away from crowds and spectators.Ask before touching or grabbing them. For example, ""I'd like to take your hand now and lead you outside."" You don't want to startle or scare them.
Avoid criticizing their behavior. They can't control themselves very well right now, and you don't want to stress them even further. If you're overwhelmed, leave.
Ask if they would like a tight hug. Sometimes this helps.
Let them relax for a while afterwards. They might want one-on-one time, or want to be alone.

, The same rules of respect apply to autistic and non-autistic people: don't grab or move their hands/arms/body without permission, don't take away a toy or object they're busy with, and be considerate in your words and actions. Some people, including adults, feel that disabled people don't need to be treated like real people.


If you see someone else being rude or mean to the autistic person, say something.
Encourage your friend to recognize when they are being mistreated, and to stand up for themselves. This can be difficult for autistic people, especially those who have PTSD as a result of compliance therapy or other bad experiences.

, Get insight on how to relate to this person by talking with them about what it is like for them in particular to live as an autistic person. You may find that they want to share and can tell you lots of useful information that will help you to relate to them better.A broad question like ""What is it like to be autistic?"" is too vague, and the autistic person will probably be unable to put such a complicated thing into words. Specific questions, like ""How does sensory overload feel?"" or ""Is there a way I can help when you get too stressed?"" are more likely to result in a useful answer.
Be sure to do so in a quiet place when you are alone so as not to draw a lot of attention to them. Be sure to speak clearly and genuinely, so the autistic person doesn't misunderstand or think you are teasing.

, Stimming refers to self-stimulating behavior and it helps autistic individuals to stay calm or manage emotion. For example, if they start giggling and flapping their hands when they see you, it means they really like you. Try to remember that stimming often helps the person doing it, so unless it's seriously disruptive or invading your personal space, learn to accept it. Try taking deep breaths in and out if you find yourself getting annoyed at the behavior. Stimming may include behaviors such as :


Fidgeting with objects.
Rocking.
Flapping and fidgeting with hands.
Bouncing.
Head banging.
Squealing.
Repeatedly feeling the texture of something, such as hair.

, Autistic people are routinely criticized by family members, friends, therapists, bullies, and even strangers, because they act or look different. This can make life very difficult. Work on communicating unconditional acceptance in your words and actions. Remind them that it's okay to be different, and you like them just the way they are.

Identify why you believe that you have an attachment problem.,
Avoid forming unhealthy attachments.,
Learn how to deal with certain attachment problems.,
Stop fearing loss.,
Befriend yourself.,
Stop living an illusion.,
Learn to let go of an attachment to feelings.,
After you have helped yourself, tell others about how you live.,
Understand that all things must come and go.

",How to Practice Non Attachment," Were you once a strong adherent to a belief or, faith that you have since recanted? Do you still seek out a person who has either abandoned or stopped caring about you? Are there things in your life that you have allowed to define you? Or have you suffered a great personal tragedy or a loss?

, It is often best to take adopting new beliefs and friendships slowly. Do not waste all of your energy by throwing all of your emotions into a single person or new creed; investigate slowly to avoid disappointment.
, Having attachment problems can hamper your progress in life. These need to be dealt with to ensure that renewal can occur and you can continue to grow. The following are some of the more common attachments that hold people back:

Changed beliefs. Maybe at one point in your life you championed a cause or considered yourself an adherent of something that you now think on with displeasure or disdain. Previously held beliefs are just that; previously held. You should be focused on ensuring that your current beliefs are morally justifiable instead of expending wasted energy worrying about what you previously thought. If your old beliefs were especially hateful, you should attempt to redeem yourself by helping those that you hurt.






Relationships with uncaring or toxic individuals. You should let them go. Realize that all of the feelings of mutual friendship or even love that you felt for this person were founded on shaky ground. This does not mean that you never had good times with this person, but it does mean that you should leave the entire situation alone until the other person realizes his or her wrongdoing. (Note: This does not apply to domestic abuse or abusive relationships. Seek protection, counseling and legal help for these situations.)






Attachment to things. Many human beings have a tendency to allow our possessions to define us, and ultimately what we own can entrap us. If you cannot move for clutter, cannot change your lifestyle for fear of not being able to accommodate the treasures you've accumulated, it's time to detach yourself. Letting go of an attachment to things frees you up to live with purpose rather than falling back onto the imagined comfort of possessions.






Personal tragedy or loss. You may have suffered a tragic experience in your life, and you may struggle with clinging on to the past or blaming yourself. Grief is a natural part of life, but it is not to be wallowed in. Remember that only one time truly exists, and that is the present. By clinging to the past, you let go of the present and never get to see the future. If you are not careful, it is easy to blame yourself or assume that you cannot go on. There are plenty of other people who need your encouragement and love, and just because it was too late to change your situation doesn't mean that you cannot help others in similar situations.







, Attachment to a job, particular people, possessions, or beliefs can mire us in the fear of losing these anchor-points in our life. When things do go wrong, as inevitably they will at times, our grief can stymie our growth and cause us to grind to a standstill. Accept the moment for what it is and believe that what you have now is enough. At the same time, be proactive to prevent yourself from being a sitting duck. Should things not be working out in a current situation, make plans to change your own part in the situation, such as sending out job applications, getting a makeover, or changing your study course, etc.
, Your self-worth should come from within, not from what you perceive that others think of you. Attachment to others gets unhealthy when you're continuing to be around people who are toxic for you just because you're afraid of being alone or left out. By befriending yourself, you won't fear the times of being alone as much, and you will also open up to being available to a wider group of people rather than attaching to merely a few. And strive to maintain healthy relationships with the people you do interact with daily, giving one another breathing space and not expecting too much of others.

Interact with new people and stay open to connections. While this shouldn't be about detaching yourself from one person just to immediately replace the former person with another, being open to the possibilities allows more people into your life and less potential to cling to them.







, Although it still matters to strive for a better you, a better tomorrow, acceptance of what is now is vital to living in the moment, in order to avoid the illusion that your happiness or fulfillment relies on contingencies not yet realized. Don't attach yourself to hopes and dreams in a way that excuses fixing things that aren't working in your life right now. Accept things as they are now and work on what you'd like to improve on with calmness and centeredness.

An obsession with the future is an attachment as much as is an obsession with the past. If your head is in the future, you're missing the now and how well you live right now makes all the difference for tomorrow's outcomes.

, Feelings are powerful but if we let them control us, we are imprisoned by wayward masters. Accept that sometimes we will feel pain and loss, but we can choose to suffer endlessly or to learn and move on. Feelings are better out than in, so expressing them will help you deal with them more productively than bottling them up inside. Write in a journal, write poems, leave anonymous blog posts, write a letter and burn it, or talk to your invisible or even best trusted friend. Find outlets for your feelings so that they don't serve as unhealthy attachments.
, Letting others gain your trust and going slowly in adopting new beliefs is the most practical non-attachment philosophy that you can practice, and you do not have to be a hermit to do it. Teaching others about non-attachment can be helpful no matter what their situation or beliefs. You can talk about it with people, write blogs, tweet; just keep open about your experience so that others can learn too.

This can come in handy if you're trying to network with a particular person in your field. Strive to catch people when they're alone and not involved in a group conversation. A one-on-one conversation will be less stressful for you and can help you foster a stronger bond., People love talking about themselves and tend to be drawn to good listeners. As introverts are naturally good listeners, use your listening skills when networking. Ask the other person a lot of questions and show you're listening by nodding, maintaining eye contact, and smiling when appropriate.However, make sure you don't only listen. It's important you showcase your skill set as well. If the person asks you anything about yourself, respond accordingly. Don't be afraid to talk up your skills a little.

, Don't think of your introverted nature as a hindrance during networking. It can actually benefit you. Introverts tend to form close relationships with a few people, so take advantage of your ability to develop strong relationships via networking. Strive for quality over quantity when it comes to connections.For example, if you feel a strong connection to someone at an event, talk to that person for a longer period. Follow up with them later and meet up for a one-on-one interaction. A solid relationship with someone in your field can lead to connections down the road.

, One advantage of being an introvert is that it can help you empathize during events. Remember, many other people in the crowd are also introverted. They are likely as nervous as you are. Thinking about this can make it easier to approach people, as you'll know they're likely intimidated as well. It helps the playing field feel more even."
"
Set a time to meet when closing conversations.,
Build up connections online.,
Challenge yourself to keep reaching out.",How to Network if You Are an Introvert3," When exiting a conversation with a potential connection, let them know you'd like to meet later on. Pass them your e-mail or phone number and suggest a time and place to meet.For example, ""I have to run now, but are you free for coffee Tuesday? I'd love to continue this conversation.""

, If you're more introverted, face to face interactions can be stressful. After meeting someone in person, nurture your relationship online. Add connections through Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. You can work on communicating via these platforms to strengthen connections.If your Twitter and Facebook are more personal than professional, you may want to stick to interacting via social media platforms like LinkedIn.

, Networking gets easier with practice. Push yourself out of comfort zone a little each day. For example, challenge yourself to e-mail three contacts in one day. The next day, challenge yourself to meet a colleague for lunch. With a little courage, you'll eventually get comfortable networking despite your introverted nature."

Consider various ways you can gain some insight into your bias.,
Explore the dynamic of biases.,
Recognize that the specific bias exists.,
Consider why it is usually so difficult to remove biases.,
Ask yourself questions.,
Meet the object of your bias head on with an open mind.,
Ultimately take things a step at a time.",How to Overcome Unconscious and Hidden Biases," Biases affect us all in ways we seldom fully realize, even when we have one we are aware of and would like to deal with. We may see ordinary, happy people living their day-to-day life in all kinds of environments, but they all have a bias of some kind which is directing their intentions. Biases can be positive or negative aspects of human nature; they all influence how we act and interact with other people and events. It's important to compare our biases, because the way we create biases in our minds is the same process for both mild biases and severe ones. Some aspects to consider include:


People form their personal identity based on a wide scope of aspects, but one of the most pervasive is bias. We often hold onto our biases because we feel they make us what we are. However, this is ultimately deceptive, as a bias is not what or who we are. Indeed, our biases change often. It is equally proportionate to the difficulty it is to let go of a bias in relation to how precious it is to us.






People of similar thinking often pool together, like raindrops that form a lake. There is nothing wrong with this, but hanging around the like-minded can influence you quite strongly, as a form of peer pressure. People select their partners, friends and associates according to personal biases and actually often train each other to adopt personal biases without realizing. This is largely because we want our friends to be like us. It can also happen exactly in the reverse, in that we want to be like our friends and so we adopt the same biases. We are highly susceptible to influence from others (current and historical life has shown we also commit suicide, murder and even war due to the power of influence.) And for an example many people can relate to––many employers look for employees with similar thoughts and feelings.






Bias and prejudice may often have been something someone has told you, or that you heard as a third party. As such, they're not always your own original opinion but one you have adopted. It may have been adopted recently, or a long time ago, and the older it is, the more tricky it may be to overcome its influence.






Sometimes the bias reappears in the mind on impulse, such as seeing or hearing of something related to the object of your bias. It can also expand by being made aware of something that is similar to your original bias. Very often there is an emotion behind your prejudice, such as greed (wanting something to be, something to happen), hatred (rejecting or wanting something to go away etc), or just ignorance of the object itself.





;
, Meditation is a good way to investigate your bias as well as how your mind acts in relation to them, as well as how they get created. Another good method is to discuss it with a friend, counselor, or a psychologist.


Bias is often a complex aspect, it mostly because our minds rely and uses measurement as a central way to process data. Every interaction and experience we encounter is measured by the mind in order to analyse and determine it. This determination can be a bias on its own (either a new one, or reinforcing an old one), but this determination depends on pre-existing biases and assumptions as well as experiences that you have developed over your lifetime.






The process of measurement is almost exclusively related to the past, specifically information we have heard or been influenced towards by other people, or our own experiences. If a mind is free from such bias and assumptions, it will typically approach the event with a clean slate, but with the clear intention of determining what it is. Recognizing this dependence on the past, or that the reflection of the past we measure against is not actually the thing we experience right now is a very useful way to overcome bias.






People consequently seldom like those who ""sit on the fence"", who are secretive about their feelings or are neutral. The reason for this is that they cannot easily categorize, predict or rely on such people to be manipulable to suit their own agenda. Being able to rely on another person is an important aspect, but while a person may be reliable, without trust people would still be hesitant to rely on that person. Trust is often built on finding common biases and prejudice as a way to identify with a person (and for probability calculating).






The flipside is the case when a person sees someone with skillful, beneficial or admirable qualities and feels inclined to adopt and practice these same positive qualities. This is usually called positive influence but it works in the same way as its opposite case (when someone adopts harmful or unskillful biases from negative influences). We model our good behavior from qualities we all have, but only from seeing others do them in a normal environment. Adopting biases is a way to be accepted by others, be it for better or worse, but can also be a way to improve oneself if the biases are of the positive kind.







, This is the beginning stage to enable you to overcome it. If you can, this means admitting there is a bias, as in really admitting it, not just thinking there is a bias. Often this is very difficult for most people to do honestly, as it is somewhat of a humbling act. But doing this will help you to explore it more in depth, as you are prepared to be more open. By recognizing your bias and what it relies on to stay in the mind, then you are one step closer to getting rid of it.

, There are often three main problems at play:


1. You often feel distant and uncomfortable with the fact that the object of the bias simply exists. This can be because you don't actually know anything about the focus of your bias. You might have heard plenty of negative stories about what you have a bias of, but how much of that is true or relevant?






2. As you identify with your prejudices, it can feel like you are surrendering part of yourself up, or betraying your cultural identity for someone else you don't know. These issues are often the main cause why many are reluctant to overcome their bias. Of these problems, the exact same question has to be asked as that of the bias––is it causing you more harm than good?






3. You may feel you have a bias but have not really come to a conclusion that it should be abandoned. Consequently, many parts of your mind will struggle against overcoming them as the bias is still attractive to certain parts of the mind.







, This is an effective way to not only gain an insight but to lessen the grip the bias has on you. Whenever the thought or bias arises, you can ask yourself: ""Is this bias of mine fair, relevant or even worthy of having?""; or, ""does this prejudice own me?""; or, ""does this help anyone?""; or, ""OK, it's a prejudice, but what is this prejudice, how did I get it, why is it so powerful, why do I find it important?"". This can help you understand as well as let go of the thought as it no longer seems attractive.


Many philosophers have also pointed out the benefits of being unbiased, in that you are virtually nonstick. Not only in a way that mud doesn't stick to you, even though life will always throw it at you, but also that as you wade through life, you can avoid it sticking to you and getting swamped. This means you can avoid getting snarled in pointless arguments, as you have transcended a powerful bait and trap system and you can be more happy, healthy and wise.

, The most effective (and hardest) way to get around it is to meet it face to face. Say you have a bias against a certain religion or nationality. Find out if their society or embassy is holding an open day and then go and meet people of that group. Your bias might be unjustified and you might meet some new friends at the same time.


Look for the humanity in the object of your prejudice. Everyone is human and has feelings, thoughts, wishes and dreams. It's just that everyone identifies with their own culture and at some time in history, their culture was isolated from yours and developed differences.
Use movements of time to your advantage. Biases have their roots in time, which means they are subject to change as well as modification. With each passing month or year, or a special date such as a birthday, you can use these measurements of time to choose and commit to leave the past behind and look at the future with a clean slate.

, It becomes easier the more you want to let go of the bias. The whole process of overcoming a bias is to understand what a bias is and how you got them, whether they are for your benefit and well-being or will make you cold-hearted and cruel. Finally check your own feelings about subjects regularly. Doing this can allow you to start to build practice and skills in letting go of the bias, able to overcome it through investigation and attention.

Observe yourself lying.,
Learn the downsides of lying or sugar-coating.,
Face uncomfortable truths about yourself.,
Push yourself to think rationally.",How to Practice Radical Honesty1," Most people lie throughout the day, every day, often during casual conversation.If you try to catch yourself lying, you may be surprised with how often you do it. It can also be enlightening to think about how often the people around you lie. Notice the things you say, and be honest about whether they're accurate.People often start with small lies, which grow over time. When people ask you how you're doing, do you respond honestly? Do you bite your tongue? Are you lying by omission? These small lies can often morph into bigger lies to keep up appearances.
People also may lie to make themselves look better. For example, you may find yourself lying to your doctor about your habits or to your boss about your work ethic. These lies can have big consequences if you keep up with them.;
, Should you really shelter someone from reality? Think about the consequences of the lies you tell. Each time you tell a white lie, pause and think about how it could harm you or someone else.Think about the potential consequences each time you lie. Is anyone getting hurt? Are you potentially hurting yourself? Is this a situation where lying has any benefits?
For example, maybe your spouse asks for your input about confronting their boss at work. They expect your support, but you think it's a bad idea. Lying to spare your spouse's feelings could have major consequences for their career.
Lying can also harm your self-esteem because you are not being genuine or true to yourself.

, Radical honesty is not just about pointing out truths about others. You need to be able to confront uncomfortable truths about yourself. People have a tendency to shy away from truths that are scary. Learn to evaluate yourself more objectively and ask yourself honest questions.Make a habit of examining every aspect of your life. Are you being as healthy as you could be? Are your relationships fulfilling? Are you working as hard on your career as you should be?
If something feels wrong or off, learn to confront it rather than ignore it. If you, for example, feel uncomfortable in a relationship, evaluate why rather than letting things go on longer than necessary.
Keep in mind that being honest with yourself takes courage and self-awareness. It is important to be honest to keep a balance mentally, physically, and emotionally.

, Try to step back from any given situation and look at it from an outsiders perspective. Part of radical honesty is being able to view things rationally. When you find yourself in a stressful situation, avoid justifying bad situations or behavior. Instead, try to accept situations for what they are. For example, if you've been developing bad eating habits, do not think to yourself, ""It's just because I'm stressed. This will change soon."" Instead, look at the situation from a more objective perspective. The truth is, you need to take care of yourself regardless of stress in your life.Being objective with yourself is part of radical honesty, and it also includes taking responsibility for your actions. For example, if you know that you are eating unhealthy foods, being honest about your eating habits will require that you change them.

"
"
Let people know your intentions.,
Confess when you lie.,
Express yourself directly.,
Communicate with ""I""-statements.,
Walk away when necessary.",How to Practice Radical Honesty2," If you're going to practice radical honesty, people deserve a head's up. This is especially true if you're practicing radical honesty with your spouse. Most people in society withhold the truth at least some of the time, so someone being so candid can be shocking. Before giving someone an uncomfortable truth, let them know you're a proponent of radical honesty.For example, before sharing your honest opinion with someone, say something like, ""So, I practice radical honesty, which means I try to give objective assessments.""
With your spouse, talk over the concept of radical honesty together before you begin practicing it. Talk about why it would help with your marriage and what the two of you can expect.

, If you find you've told a lie, stop and confess. Lying often comes naturally, especially white lies, so it's easy to be dishonest without realizing it. Lies have a tendency of getting out of control, so it's usually easier to be honest directly after telling a lie. If you caught yourself withholding the truth, stop and say so.For example, say something like, ""I know I said I thought your proposal was great earlier today, but I actually wasn't being entirely honest because I didn't want to hurt your feelings. I actually have some concerns and wanted to talk them over with you.""

, Once you're used to catching yourself in lies, learn to express yourself directly. In a situation, identify what you're feeling and any needs that result from that feeling. What do you need someone to do? How are a person's actions affecting you? Let someone know these things directly.Learn to express frustration to others. For example, ""I'm annoyed that you didn't respond to our memo earlier. I need you to be quicker in the future.""
If possible, express your honesty in person. It allows you to fully experience the ramifications of being radically honest, and makes it harder for the receiving party to ignore you.

, Any kind of harsh truths can be difficult for a person to hear. To minimize the impact, use ""I""-statements. These focus on personal feeling over objective fact. They begin with, ""I feel..."" followed by immediately stating your feelings. You then explain the actions that led to those feelings and why you feel the way you do.For example, say your spouse has a tendency to be on their phone while you two are out together. You have ignored this before, but the tendency really does make you feel ignored. Do not say, ""You shouldn't be on your phone all the time when you're out. It's disrespectful.""
Rephrase the above statement using an ""I""-statement. For example, ""I feel disrespected when you're on the phone all the time when we're out together because it seems like you're not paying attention to me.""

, Not everyone will accept radical honesty. Some people prefer to deny harsh truths about themselves. When this results in your boundaries being violated, it's okay to walk away. For example, if you've continually explained to a friend their behavior is hurtful and seen no change, it's okay to end this relationship."
"
Handle honesty in return.,
Be kind while being honest.,
Make requests and not demands.",How to Practice Radical Honesty3," When you are radically honest, some people will respond in like manner. Welcome it. This is a good opportunity to open new dialogue, and discover things about yourself that you might have otherwise never known. If someone gives you some harsh feedback, respond with gratitude. Say things like:


""Thanks for telling me.""
""That's fine.""
""That's true!""""

, How honest is too honest? In the honesty business, there’s a fine line between radical and reckless honesty. Think about how to phrase what you're saying in a way that is not hurtful. Having tact is not the same thing as lying, and some feelings are subjective. You do not, for example, need to tell someone, ""That band is bad."" You only need to say, ""I don't care for their music.""If someone asks for your opinion, find a way to give that to them in a way that's not overtly mean or comes off as a put-down. For example, a friend asks you what you think of a dress they're trying to purchase. Do not say, ""That looks awful on you."" Instead, say something like, ""That isn't the best style for you.""

, Remember, your honesty comes from your own perspective. If you need someone to change their behavior, request they do so. Do not try to make demands, as this will not be met well.For example, do not say to your spouse, ""You need to have your phone off when we're together."" Instead say, ""I would appreciate it if you could be on your phone less often when we're out.""

Know the difference between envy and jealousy.,
Think about how envy harms you.,
Identify the reason why you are envious.,
Write about your feelings.,
Consider talking to a friend about your envious feelings.,
Consider seeking help from a therapist if you can’t move past your envy on your own.",How to Overcome Envy1," Envy and jealousy are not the same thing, but they are often confused. It is important to know the difference between envy and jealousy to determine which emotion you are feeling. Jealousy is a reaction to the threat of losing something you already possess. Envy is a reaction to a something you think you lack.For example, jealousy is what you feel when you see your girlfriend flirting with another guy. Envy is what you feel when you see a friend driving up in a brand new sports car.;
, How has envy impacted your life in a negative way? Maybe a long-term friendship is on the verge of dissolving because you can't pretend to be happy for your friend anymore, so you avoid her calls. Maybe you check your ex's Facebook page obsessively to glare at pictures of him and his fiancée. Maybe you hate-read a classmate's photography blog, wishing you had anything close to his artistic ability. These are all examples of the way envy saps energy that could be better spent on something more positive. Envy might be harming you in the following ways:Taking up your time
Consuming your thoughts
Ruining your personal and professional relationships
Warping your personality
Creating negativity

, Before you can deal with your envy in a constructive way, you need to figure out what is causing it. If you feel envy over your friend’s new sport’s car, take some time to examine the reason why you feel envious. Ask yourself questions to identify the cause of your envy before dealing with your envy.For example, are you envious because you want a car like the one he has? Or are you envious of his ability to afford something so expensive?

, Journaling is a great way to express your feelings and deal with negative emotions. Journaling about your envy may help you to start to understand it better and begin to deal it. Start by writing down the reason that you feel envious. Describe the source of your envy in as much detail as you can. Try to determine why you are envious of this person.For example, you might write about your friend driving up in his new sports car and how that made you feel. What was your mood like at the time? How did you feel when he pulled up? What did you feel like doing/saying? What did you actually do/say? How did you feel after he left? How do you feel thinking back on it? What would you like to feel?

, Telling a supportive friend or family member how you are feeling may help you feel better and help you to express your emotions. Choose someone who is not closely involved with the person you envy. Also, make sure to choose someone who will be supportive and who will listen to you. Choosing someone who will brush off your feelings or who will not offer good support may make you feel worse.

, For some people, envy can interfere with daily life and happiness. Without help, it may be hard to understand your envy and determine the best way to deal with those feelings. A licensed mental health professional can help you to understand these feelings and help you work through them.

Stop judging yourself so harshly.,
Forgive the person you envy and yourself.,
Turn your envy into appreciation.,
Use your envy to generate a goal.",How to Overcome Envy2," When you're envious of someone else, it often stems from feelings of personal inadequacy. You're focused on how someone else has the career, partner, possessions, or intelligence you want, and these desires are rooted in what you perceive to be your own shortcomings. Try to back down from judging yourself so harshly and you won't be as inclined to compare your situation unfavorably to someone else's.For example, maybe you're envious of your friend's amazing career, which has taken off while yours is still in its fledgling stage. Try to be more patient with yourself - you'll get your turn in the spotlight if you just keep working hard.
Envy stems from being judgmental in general - thinking that this is better than that, and making your decisions based on getting what you don't have. Try to be more open minded instead of deciding that some qualities are good to have and some aren't.

, Forgiveness is an important part of moving past envy because resenting someone for their success will only weigh you down.One exercise that may help you to deal with envy is to declare your forgiveness for the person that you envy (not in their presence, of course) and for yourself as well. Simply take a moment when you are alone to verbalize your forgiveness.


Remember that you are not forgiving the other person for wrongdoing. You are choosing to view their situation from their perspective. By considering their perspective, you can empathize with their pride and accomplishments in a compassionate way.
For example, you might say something like, “I am proud with Sharon for having so much success in her career. I also forgive myself for being behind her on my path to success.”

, To overcome envy, it is important to appreciate what you already have as well as what the person you envy has earned.One way that you can start to change your perspective and overcome your envy is to find a way to appreciate the success or fortune of others. Work on developing a sense of happiness for the person who achieved or obtained what you envy them for. For example, try to be happy for a friend who can afford a sports car and change your envy into admiration.


It might help you to state your admiration out loud. For example, you might say to your friend, “Congratulations on the new car! I am really happy for you and all of your success.”

, Once you have identified the cause of your envy, you can deal with it in a constructive way by turning it into something positive, such as a goal. Using your envy to form a realistic, achievable goal will help you to stop dwelling on your negative feelings and feel empowered to change something in your life for the better.


For example, if you are envious of a friend’s new sports car because you wish you had the financial freedom to afford something like that, make it your goal to earn and/or save more money.
Break larger goals into smaller, measurable goals. For example, if your goal is to earn and/or save more money. One of your smaller goals might be to look for a higher paying job or find out about opportunities for advancement at your current job. Another small goal might be to save $20 per week.

Live by your own definition of success.,
Realize you don't know the whole story.,
Remember that others' success doesn't impact yours.",How to Overcome Envy3," Are you evaluating yourself and other people based on superficial ideas of what it means to be successful? Success does not necessarily mean having a big house, two cars and a high-powered job, or being so beautiful that people can't stop staring. Success is about finding out what life is best for you and living it to the very fullest. If you worry less about society's standards for success, and focus instead on what gets you going every day, you'll be less likely to fall into comparing yourself to other people so much.Remember that it's ok to be at a different stage in your life than other people. For instance, just because you might not have the job or partner you want yet, doesn't mean you're any less of a person than the person you're envious of. Life is not a serious of boxes we all check off on our way to happiness. Everyone travels a different path, and no one's is more meaningful or better than anyone else's.

, It might look like someone else has it all - the perfect boyfriend, great hair, straight As, you name it. However, there is always more to the story, because it's impossible for anyone to have a perfect life. If someone seems to have everything you want, chances are you have something they want, too. Don't put people up on a pedestal and grind your teeth thinking they must have been born under a lucky star. You may not ever know what their weakness is - after all, most people are adept at hiding their imperfections - but you can be sure it's there.


Reflecting on the fact that everyone has a struggle, need, or want may be enough to remind you that everyone is in the same boat. It's not necessary to go digging to find out what soft spots the person has! Rest assure there is something you aren't seeing. Try to put aside your thoughts of envy and focus on yourself.

, Let's say that someone you know started a running regimen, lost 20 pounds and just completed her first marathon. Sure, the person made a great achievement, but there's nothing stopping you from doing the same thing! Your success in life does not hinge on someone else's. Whether it comes to finding love, getting a good job or anything else you want, you can have it, regardless of how successful someone else might be.

Focus on your talents and assets.,
Be thankful for your loved ones.,
Change what you can change, accept what you can't.,
Spend time with grateful people.",How to Overcome Envy4," Now that you've stopped comparing yourself to other people, let's focus on what you have going for you. Channel your energy into your good qualities, so you become better and better at what you do and who you are. When you're focused on perfecting that cello song or writing an amazing thesis, there's not time to worry about what other people are doing.When you find your mind drifting to the realm of what you don't have, make a conscious effort to think about what you do have. Do this every single time you feel those pangs of envy. If you refuse to let your mind dwell, and focus instead on what makes you special and great, you'll start having a much more positive outlook.
Realize that not everyone has what you have - in fact, your talents and assets might even be the source of others' envy.

, Imagine the people who care about you and would do anything for you, and think about what you'd do for them. Focusing on the people who make your life feel full is a positive way to cancel out feelings of envy. Instead of thinking that your life is lacking something, be thankful for the people who are there. Being grateful is a lot like being mindful. It's about focusing on the present and turning your thoughts to what is already good in your life, instead of thinking about what's lacking.

, It's important to know what you can change and what is beyond your control. Spend energy working to improve the former and don't waste your time on the latter, because there's nothing you can do about it. If you dwell on things you can't change, you'll end up feeling extremely negative, and maybe even becoming depressed. You have a finite amount of time to spend, and you don't want to waste it on something that's not going to budge.


For example, if you wish you had your friend's musical talent, and you want nothing more than to be a singer-songwriter, try your best to become what you want to be. Pour your soul into making music, take voice lessons, perform at open mic nights - give it all you've got. If you think you have a shot at making it in the music scene, or you just feel so passionate about music that you want to spend your life singing, don't let anything stop you.
On the other hand, there are some things in life that aren't affected by hard work and strong desire. If you're in love with your friend's wife, and they're happily married, you're going to have to accept that this is something you can't change. It's important to come to a place of acceptance before your envy turns into an extremely negative force.

, If your friends are the type to constantly compare jobs, partners and kids, complain about what they don't have and cut down people who do, you might want to start spending time with different people. If you spend enough time with people who aren't grateful for what they have, you're going to end up feeling that way, too. Be around people who are content - not rub-it-in-your-face content, but happy enough that they don't slam other people or constantly complain. Find friends who are nonjudgmental, generous, and kind, and you'll start feeling that way about yourself and others, too.

Start a gratitude journal.,
Focus only on positive things for a day.,
Stay away from negative input for a week.,
Remind yourself that you are in control.,
Compliment five people per day.,
Volunteer.",How to Overcome Envy5," If it has been awhile since you thought about the good things in your life, take out a pen and a piece of paper and start writing them down. A gratitude journal can be a great way of helping you change your perspective and appreciate what you have. If a journal isn’t your style, consider starting a video blog (aka vlog) or drawing in a sketchbook. Since envy is about your perception of what you lack, put some time and energy into reminding yourself of what you have. Here are a few ideas to include in your journal:


Your talents
Your favorite physical features
Your best friend
Your dog
Your favorite foods
Things that make you laugh
Memories that make you smile
Future occasions to which you're looking forward
Favorite items you own
Accomplishments

, If you're an envious person who keeps it completely to yourself, you might not need to try this trick. However, if envy has consumed your personality and made you more negative than you'd like to be, try going a full day without making one complaint. It's not something you could do forever - after all, it's OK to feel annoyed about things now and then! - but foregoing complaining for a day might show you just how often you open your mouth to say something negative. If you find yourself keeping quiet for most of the day, the experience could be quite telling.


If you give this a try, consider all complaining off limits - even complaints about yourself. No cutting yourself down, comparing yourself unfavorably to someone else, or wishing things were different.
You might realize that your complaining impacts those around you as well. It's really not fun to be around someone who is constantly seeing the glass as half empty. Changing your attitude could result in improved relationships.

, ""Negative input"" means anything that feeds your envy and makes you wish for something you don't or can't have. The more obsessive it makes you, the worse it is for your psyche, so try going without it for a week to see if you feel better. Here are a few examples of negative input:


Advertisements. If you're constantly seeing ads for clothes you can't afford, for example, you might feel envious of those who have nice clothes. The ads are making your envy worse. You might have to stop watching TV and read a novel instead of fashion magazines for a week.
Social media. If you feel stung by the ""humble"" braggarts when you log into Facebook, you aren't alone. In fact, studies show that envy increases with Facebook use.If you tend to lurk on Facebook and other social media a lot, turn it off for at least a week.

, If you often feel envious of things that people have, remind yourself that you could have those things too, but you choose not to. For example, if you really wanted a designer wardrobe, you could rack up a massive amount of credit card debt, but maybe you don't do that because you value your credit. If you are making wise choices for yourself (like avoiding credit card debt), you should feel proud of those decisions., Try to make it five new people each day, so you aren't complimenting the same people over and over. Compliment each person on something you genuinely admire about that person - don't take the easy route and compliment on something too shallow. Taking the time to think about what you really like about people, and then expressing that out loud, will help your mind stay in a positive place. You won't be as worried about comparing yourself to others.


Research has suggested that complimenting the person you envy can benefit you. Look for ways to compliment the person you envy on their hard work and other attributes that you value., If you can't wrench your mind away from thoughts of what you don't have, spend time helping people who don't have much at all. Sometimes we fall into mental ruts that make it all but impossible to see how good we have it. Give yourself a dose of reality by volunteering in a soup kitchen, hospital, or animal shelter for a day.Reflect on your experience afterward. Helping other people can enable you see how rich you really are, and how much positive energy you have to offer the world.

Be up front and talk to them.,
Don't feel guilty if the person admits to being sad about not going.,
Make up for leaving them out if the person you are leaving out is often shunned by your set of friends.",How to Let Someone Know They Weren't Invited," That's the best way to know what's going on! Not all people are even sad because they aren't invited, and this person might think the people in your group are pretty lame anyway.;
, Explain why you weren't able to invite that person (you should probably prepare all this ahead of time). Whatever your reason, always say a heartfelt sorry.

, If the person is either a person you wouldn't dream of hanging out with or a close friend, try to hang out with them a little more from now on. The person might think you don't want to be friends, so prove this wrong. It would really help if you starting bringing them along to your house, the movies, a party, etc. You don't have to hang with them ALL the time. Just more than you usually did.

Continue networking in order to push yourself.",How to Network," Getting in touch with old friends, distant relatives, and people you went to school with can be a good stepping stone because you're reaching out, but you're not approaching complete strangers.Work on networking first on this group of people before moving on to people with whom you have a more tenuous connection.;
, As a professional, or an aspiring professional, your time is important. Be discerning and selective — you owe it to yourself. Simply approach someone confidently, stick out your hand, and introduce yourself. It's not easy to do, but it's straightforward, and the more you do it, the easier it becomes.


Be confident to inspire confidence in you. Many people who regularly schmooze aren't the most naturally confident people in the world. They've learned to project confidence. This projection soon becomes reality. The ""fake it till you make it"" strategy really does work.
Some people call this the ""hostess mentality.""You put others first and try to make them feel comfortable. This uncommon effort makes you feel powerful and, ultimately, puts you at ease.

, An elevator pitch is a personal blurb that sums up the ""professional you"" and can be delivered quickly — for example, in the time it would take two people to share an elevator ride. Not exactly a speech that you memorize, an elevator pitch is a couple of refrains that you remember that you can build around, given the situation. Here's an example:


""I just graduated from XYZ University with a degree in marine biology. In school, I studied the interaction of tidal patterns on puffin populations. Currently, I'm leading a conservation effort designed to save the puffin population in Eastern Egg Rock, Maine.""

, Having a great conversation often starts with a little bit of back-and-forth. It's an opportunity for you to get a feel for the other person, and for them to get a feel for you. Some people describe it this way: Conversation is a ladder, and small talk is the first rung that you step on.Don't worry if it feels unnatural at first. Smile, remember to be confident in your abilities, and listen intently.


Look for an anchor.This is something that you have in common with the other person. Perhaps it's a school, or a mutual friend, or a shared experience, like a love of sky-diving. You probably need to ask questions in order to find one, but once you have one, you're golden.
Reveal something about yourself related to the anchor. Asking questions is great, particularly if you're searching for an answer, but a conversation is a two-way street, and you gotta give a little in order to get something back.
Encourage the other person to continue sharing. Once a few pleasantries are exchanged, keep asking questions about the anchor or share different experiences you've had about the anchor.

, If your conversation stays on the bottom half of the ladder, you risk not distinguishing yourself from the dozens of other people that the person you're networking with meets over the course of the event or the year. In order to distinguish yourself from others, you'll want to dive deeper after the superficial chitchat and say something that really causes your contact to pause and think about you.


One prominent blogger recommends that you look for a passion or a problem.Obviously, finding a passion is probably a little safer territory for you to talk about, but don't be afraid to empathize with your contact if they talk about a problem they might be having in work or outside of it.

, In normal conversation, it's common to build up a flow of conversation and to fear the dreaded awkward pause. But when you're worried about constantly keeping up the flow of conversation, you often forget about listening to what the other person has to say and formulating an intelligent response.


Don't be afraid to take a second or two to pause and think about what you're going to say before you say it. This one or two seconds feels a lot longer to you than it does to your conversator-in-crime. If something intelligent comes out of your mouth afterwards, that investment was worth it.
Journalist Shane Snow describes the respect he has for a friend who thinks before he speaks: ""Whereas most of us (and powerful people especially) feel pressure to have instant answers to everything (job interviews and media training teaches us to do this), causing us to blubber and ramble and shoot from the hip, Fred takes his time. When you ask him a question, he pauses. Sometimes for a long time. Sometimes the silence makes you uncomfortable. He thinks carefully. And then he responds with triple the insight you expect."", Some people think of networking as a selfish act, because some treat the process as a means to an end instead of an end in itself. While some certainly treat networking that way, it's a less sophisticated way to think about networking. Instead, try approaching a networking situation being willing to help someone else out first. If you genuinely try to help others out, they'll want to do the same for you. Then, the motivation for mutual assistance will come from a genuinely good place.

, When you're talking to people, find out what they do for a living and for fun, as well as what their spouse or significant other, nearby family members, and close friends do for work and recreation, too. It may be helpful to make note of this in your address book so you don't lose track of who does what.


Pretend that you've meet Mary at a book club meeting and you find out that her cousin is an expert windsurfer. A few months later, your niece reveals to you that one of her life's goals is to go windsurfing. Find Mary, call her up, and ask her if her cousin is available to give your niece a private lesson as a birthday gift. Mary says ""Sure!"" and convinces her cousin to give you a discount. Your niece is thrilled. A month later, your car breaks down, and you remember that your niece's boyfriend is an aspiring auto mechanic...
Find the extroverts. As you continue to network, you'll find that some people are much better at it than you are — they already know everyone! You'll stand to benefit from getting to know such people first because they can introduce you to others who share your interests or goals. In other words, if you're an introvert, find an extrovert who can ""set you up"".

, Once you've had a pleasant chat, exchanged viewpoints, or commiserated over a horrible boss, don't be afraid to say that you've enjoyed the conversation. Offer something like: ""I'm glad we talked. You seem like a very knowledgeable and respected person. How about we continue the conversation soon?""

, Don't get someone's business card or e-mail address and forget about it. Find a way to stay in touch. Maintain your network. Because your network is like a tree: without nourishment, it will die. Be sure to give it the attention it needs to stay alive.


Whenever you find an article that might be of interest to them, for instance, send it on their way. If you hear about a negative event (a tornado, a riot, an electrical blackout) that happened in their vicinity, call them and make sure they're fine.
Keep track of everyone's birthday and mark them on a calendar; be sure to send birthday cards to everyone you know, along with a nice note to let them know you haven't forgotten about them, and that you don't want them to forget about you.

, Who says that you can't network while playing chess against a worthy opponent in Russia? Or network while on your favorite medical community researching your husband's autoimmune disorder? The internet has networking with groups of like-minded people a whole lot easier. Check forums, listings, classifieds, and internet mailing lists (known as ""listservs"") for local events or meetings that are likely to attract people with similar interests or passions.

, The internet has also made researching prominent (or not-so-prominent) people a lot easier than it used to used. Now, you can gather information about people with a simple Google search, or you can connect with them on one of the many social networks that people spend increasing time on. Research these people for two reasons:


It helps to be knowledgeable about different career arcs and career opportunities. Researching other peoples' careers teaches you that there are an almost infinite numbers of ways that you can get into advertising, for example, or become a merchant.
You're familiarizing yourself with their personal history. This information will come in handy when you reach out to them; it shows you've done your homework.

, An informational interview is an informal meeting you have with another professional in which you ask them questions about their careers and pick their brains. An informational interview can be coffee after work or a Skype interview in the middle of the workday. Whatever it ends up being, it's usually short — 30 minutes or less — and you should offer to pick up the bill if you grabbed coffee or lunch.


Informational interviews are a great way to both learn about the other person and develop your critical questioning and listening skills. You never know; you might impress the person so much during the informational interview that they decide to offer you a job if they have the authority. Some feel it's a lot less of a crapshoot than playing the resume game.
When you're done with your informational interview, express your gratitude and ask your contact for three other people who you might talk to as part of your continuing outreach. Reach out to those people and refer back to the original contact if needed.

, The next time you need something (a job, a date, a hiking partner) cast a wide net and see what happens. Make a few phone calls or send out an e-mail describing your situation in a friendly tone: ""Hey, I'm in a bit of a pinch. I have these concert tickets for Saturday and I haven't been able to find someone to go with me. Since this is a band I love, I'd like to go with someone I know I'll have fun with. Do you know of anyone who might enjoy it with me?""


Don't ever apologize when asking for a favor or help. It can signal a lack of confidence and professionalism.There's nothing to be sorry about--you're just seeing if anyone happens to be in a position to help you; you're not making demands, or forcing people to do anything that they don't want to do.

, You can establish great connections online, but the most successful networkers are those who take those online connections and translate them into intimate face-to-face relationships. Going out for lunch, coffee, or drinks is a great way to begin to establish a face-to-face relationship with people. Remember that you can also invite people to do things related to your interests. If you met someone at a caving club, why don't you ask them to check out a new cave with you? The objective here is to establish a connection beyond your initial online meeting. Preferably, this should be one-on-one.

, If you're reading this article, you're probably familiar with the benefits of networking. But perhaps you've avoided networking, for whatever reason (there are a number of them!), preferring the easy way out. Let go of that! Stop trying to justify your fears. Instead, try to believe in yourself and realize that we, in fact, network for some very good reasons.

, Sometimes, you're right. Networking can be a superficial way of leveraging a connection in a self-serving and thoughtless way. But there are also people who want to build genuine, mutually-beneficial relationships. There are people who are willing to do awe-inspiring things for the simple pleasure of helping someone else out. There are people who enjoy the sense of community that networking brings and who like the idea of empowering each other whenever possible.


When you're networking, you're going to have to sift through the people you don't want to know to get to the people you do want to know. That's just an essential part of networking, but the good news is that with practice, you'll get better at spotting the people worth knowing.

, Networking does require a degree of boldness. Yet with the advent of social networking sites, you can get to find others with similar interests and goals without being in a room full of people.


People who are shy and self-conscious tend to be a lot more open and talkative when they're doing or talking about something they're deeply interested in. If you find people who are just as obsessed with birding, origami, or manga as you are, then you'll have a much easier time establishing connections.

, Unless you're an extroverted person who thoroughly enjoys schmoozing, networking can be exhausting. Why bother, right? Yes, networking takes time and effort, but the time and effort you save by networking can also be tremendous. Imagine how much time and frustration you would save if anything you wanted or needed was just one or two phone calls away. Ultimately, a network is an investment, with benefits that outweigh the costs.You just need to stick with it and watch it grow.

, You want to grow as an individual, both personally and professionally. Networking helps you hone essential interpersonal skills that are huge assets in today's world. It helps keep you on your toes, teaches you to listen, and inspires a humility born of a desire to help others. If you do networking for nothing else, do it for personal growth. Networking can help you become the best version of yourself.

Wait for the right moment.,
Try to figure out if she'd like to be hugged.,
Approach her gently.,
Decide how long you're going to hold the hug.,
Release.,
Finish it off in a cute way.,
Learn about different hugging positions.",How to Hug a Girl1," When you hug a girl is just as important as how you do it, so play it safe by picking a good moment. Three good times are:


When you first see her. It's always nice to be greeted by friends with a quick ""friends"" hug (even if you want to be more than friends).
During an emotional moment. Whether you're on the same team that just won a big game, or if she's having a hard day, a hug can be a really good way to reinforce that you're there for her.
When you are parting ways. As with the greeting hug, saying goodbye with a hug is a nice, friendly gesture.;
, Girls make it obvious with their body language when they are open to physical contact. Based on how she is standing, or how she greets you, you can figure out if she is comfortable with you going in for the hug.


Signs she is interested:

She makes eye contact with you.
She plays with her hair around you.
Her hips or feet are pointed directly toward you.
Her tone of voice is animated and bright when she talks to you.


Signs she isn't interested:

She doesn't hold your gaze.
Her body language is ""closed"" (crossed legs, folded arms, body turned away).
Her tone of voice is flat when she talks to you.



, Resist the urge to dive in and hug her as quickly as possible. Instead, take a deep breath and move in at a pace that allows her to decide whether or not she wants to hug you. Make eye contact, move a little bit closer to her, then lift your arms and pull her in.


If you've read the signs incorrectly and she doesn't want to be hugged, it's essential that she has a second to back out before you make contact. Otherwise she'll feel forced, and the situation will turn awkward.
The upside is that slower movements are generally considered more romantic. So if she does want you to hug her, a smooth and gentle approach will seem all the more intimate.

, The duration of your hug says a lot about what it means to you. Here's a basic guideline to follow:


The longer you hold on, the more intimate the hug is. Embraces longer than a few seconds are meant for significant others or close family members.
Shorter hugs are more casual. The average ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" hug should be about one or two seconds of holding.

, Pull back from the hugging position in one smooth move. Typically, you want to begin to pull back before she does. Ending it a few seconds earlier than you have to can keep the hug from veering into awkward territory.


If she starts to let go or you can feel her go limp in your arms, it’s best to just immediately release. The exception to the rule is the ""intimate"" moment (for example: she's upset and crying or you just kissed) in which its considered appropriate to slowly pull back.

, The way you end it should depend on the situation. If you really like this girl, though, the end of a hug is your chance to do something adorable that she'll remember. Try these scenarios:


For a casual greeting or goodbye hug, say ""I'm so happy to see you!"" or ""See you later!""
For a hug that acknowledges an accomplishment, that often means a congratulations for an award won, a job well done, a wedding, or other significant life moment. Generally, ""Congratulations!"" is a great thing to say.
For a comforting hug, tailor what you say to the situation. ""It's OK,"" or ""I'm here,"" are both good things to say.
For the buddy hug, say whatever sparked the hug in the first place. ""You're awesome,"" or ""We really rocked that ultimate Frisbee game, didn't we?"" is always fun.
If it was a more intimate hug, we'll leave those follow-up words to you. Make them count!

, If you're still nervous, read up on these different hug positions and visualize which one might work best for your particular situation:


Slow-dance: Her arms will go upward to around your neck and your arms will go under hers. You can put your arms around her waist or higher up her back. The lower your hands go on her back, the more suggestive the hug is. This can be a very intimate hug—use it wisely.
Big bear and little bear: Her arms will go below yours and you will wrap around her back while her arms wrap around your waist. This is a friendlier hug and allows her to be pulled close to you and have her head rest on your chest.
One-arm sling: This is the least romantic kind of hug—more of a buddy hug, really. This is when the hugger comes in from the side and wraps one arm around her shoulders or neck, as a casual friendly hug.
T-Rex: Both the hugger and the girl’s arms stay around the waist and lower-back area. This will allow for the both of you to rest your heads on each others shoulders. This is going to allow for a friendlier, less suggestive hug.
Criss-cross: One arm goes up and the other goes down to create an ""x"" with your arms and hers. This can lead to the perfect ""pull back and kiss"" position where both of you still have your arms holding on to each other with enough room to still kiss.
From behind: This is a hug you only do with a girl you know well, and unless she likes scary surprises, let her know it's you as you move into the hug. This is a very intimate hug that can lead to very intimate things very easily.

Use your instincts, but the best rule of thumb is that if you're offered a hug, go for it.

, Remember to keep the physical contact quick and light for hugging friends. Anything more prolonged might be misinterpreted as romantic.

, Lucky you!

If you are a man, her arms should be around your neck, and you should be embracing her around the waist. Keep her in that position for no more than a couple seconds, and let go and soon as she does. Look her in the eyes when you separate and continue the conversation naturally.

Clean up after yourself.",How to Have Coffee Shop Etiquette," It is common courtesy to purchase something from the menu at a cafe or restaurant when you visit. Various enterprises advertise the conditions you should fulfill to access conveniences like restrooms or free Wi-Fi and most of these requisites include buying something to eat or drink. There is no silent decree about what item(s) you should buy to fill your implicit rift—anything is acceptable.;
, Whether it is the seasoned barista or the trainee, we, as humans, all make mistakes. Use an even tolerance when waiting for your purchase or, better yet, be lenient if your order came out wrong. By employing patience in circumstances that would normally call for frustration, you not only look good, but also establish a placid amicability.

, Deporting proper etiquette doesn't imply that you have to be poetically spoken. However, kindly do wear ""please"" and ""thank you"" as your standard bearing. Avoid complaining about or comparing any of the enterprise items while visiting. If you're not impressed with the service, mark the coffee shop in your mind as a 'Don't return to'. Avoid sparking an unnecessary scene with a waiter, barista, or member of staff.


It's also a good idea to conduct business and personal calls outside. If you're expecting someone to call you, aim to find a coffee shop with an alfresco dining option.

, No matter how vacant a coffee shop is, it's unnecessarily rude to take up an extra seat for your belongings. It's especially inconsiderate in a busy place with little seating, like Blacksmiths or Starbucks. Avoid hogging table space. - If you're at a giant table with only you and your laptop, refrain from cluttering it with papers, plates, and empty coffee mugs: It's not a personal desk. Make it clear that someone else can sit there by keeping your personal belongings to yourself.

, Despite some coffee shops offering the option for customers to bring small animals, especially dogs, leave your pets at home. If you decide to bring them to an animal-friendly establishment, make sure their temperament is compatible with all ages, especially young children. The last thing you want is for your pet to growl at or attack another pet or customer.

, Coffee shops are renowned as a place for building friendships and it all starts with an amiable smile or benign greeting. You don't have to be totally gregarious, however, a modest acknowledgement goes a long way. Good baristas often initiate short-lived conversations while brewing your coffee, so don't be rude—have a chat!

, We often miss good conversations because of our preoccupation with technology. By retiring your device to your bag or pocket, you'll be able to show proper regard to the person you are joined with. Even if they're not following, show them that their presence is more important than your screen.


If you want your partner to follow your lead, try steering the conversation towards them. Ask of things they will need to explain in detail rather than just give a cursory reply: career happenings, a prior vacation, or thoughts on the political front.

, Earphones are the best method to keep your device sounds to yourself in a business establishment. Coffee shops are a gathering place, so it's fine to converse, but any sound that comes out of your device should be funneled by earphones or headphones.


If you're not using headphones and plan to use a device that expels sounds, at least ensure that its volume is on low or muted. This way, you're not disrupting patrons around you.

, Depending on your culture, it may not be required, however, it's customary in the United States to tip for service rendered. Even if it's just pocket change, it's all about gestures and any tip is a significant one.


If you're in a locale that doesn't practice tipping, you could leave an unsolicited donation to a charity if the coffee shop sponsors one.

, Sometimes people choose to dine leisurely at a coffee shop for hours, reading a tabloid of choice, or clearing their clogged inbox of work-related emails, which is perfectly fine. However, this type of routine is commonly reserved for 'Habitué' or regulars per-se.


If you're not a regular but want to stay for an extended period of time, strive to purchase another item, be it food or drink, every 90 minutes. If you prefer not to purchase an item, make an effort to shift coffee shops every few hours or so.

, This sounds laborious but it doesn't have to be. - If all you've had is a coffee and a roll, it's not hard to return your dishes to the barista. This way you are saving wait staff the time to bus your table. Your effort will certainly be noticed, and if you plan to become a regular at the shop, your face will be remembered for next time.

Don't fight fire with fire.,

, This will show them you're a good person. Plus, volunteer work will look great on a resume.

,, For example, if they drop some papers, help gather them back up again, or if they need someone to help on a project (even if it's just moving some chairs) help them do it. They may not thank you, but a good respectful silence and eye contact (or even a nod) should help you understand if they really are secretly thanking you.


Don't invade their personal lives to figure out where you can help. If they hate you, they don't want you doing that. Do the obvious things.

, If you do so consistently, it is sure to help. Nobody likes being stranded with nobody to back them up, so you can become the person that cares enough to back them up.

, Make small talk, or talk about something else relevant. It might get you into a small friendly chat before the hate returns. Be sure to not dominate the conversation.

, For example, don't play loud music, keep your pets quiet and so on. Try to notice and avoid acting upon pet peeves - actions that make them highly uncomfortable or which create resentment.

Write your check in advance.,
Pay cash or use a debit card whenever possible.,
Avoid lengthy transactions If you are in the USA, try to avoid getting in line behind someone who is using coupons.,
Observe the express lane item limits, Express Lanes are not designed to handle three carts with 50 items each.,
Specify whether you want paper or plastic bags before being asked.,
Unload your hand basket.,
Never enter a closed checkout line, no matter how much shorter the ""line"" is.,
Have exact change.,
Shop during off-hours.,
Shop for the week.,
Use the self-checkout.,
Hand the money to the cashier.,
Plan ahead.",How to Get Through the Checkout Line at the Supermarket Quickly," If you know you are writing a check, have everything but the amount filled out while you are waiting in line. Waiting until you have the total amount to start writing the check is ridiculous. Approximate Time Saved - 15 to 20 seconds.;
, These are by far the fastest options. Approximate Time Saved: 15 to 20 seconds.

, These take longer to process than other transactions (sometimes up to 5-10 minutes). Approximate Time Saved: 5 to 10 minutes.

, As a result, if you take three carts into a ""10 items or less"" express lane, even if the cashier does ring up your order, it will take two to three times longer than if you went through a normal checkout. Theoretically, express checkouts are designed to handle a slightly higher capacity of the posted item limit, so you might be able to get away with taking a few extra items. Plus you are likely to incite an incident among people within the limits who are on very short time frames. Approximate Time Saved: 2 to 5 minutes (and potentially loads of bad karma saved)

, Don't assume the cashier or bagger automatically knows because you come in all the time. They deal with hundreds, even thousands, of customers every day and cannot possibly be asked to remember every moot little detail. Can you memorize 5,000 different habits on short notice? Approximate Time Saved - 10 seconds to 60 seconds, depending on if re-bagging becomes necessary.

, If you are using a hand basket instead of a cart, unload it. Merely hefting the basket up on the belt with the contents still inside is not only a major pet peeve of cashiers, it is a waste of time for you. When the cashier has to unload the items out of the basket (some do it all at once, others one at a time), it slows down the checkout process. Approximate Time Saved: 45 seconds to 2 minutes.

, Checkout number light on means the lane is open. Light off means closed. Period. If you enter a closed checkout lane where a checker has already taken a till out, 9 times out of 10 a new till has to be counted and inserted, all because you failed to pay attention. At the minimum, there is a 30 second delay. You may even be informed that the lane is closed and sent to an open lane anyway, in which case two people have already gotten in line ahead of you. Avoid the confrontation - stick to lanes with the light on only unless directed to another register by an employee. Approximate Time Saved: 1 to 5 minutes.

, Don't fish around for the exact change. This holds up the line for other people and delays you. Approximate Time Saved: 20-45 seconds (for you), 1-2 minutes (for people in line behind you).

, Avoid shopping during the rushed hours between 3PM and 7PM if at all possible. Also avoid hours that appear to be shift changes for most stores. In states with ""blue laws"" (laws restricting the hours during which alcoholic beverages can be sold) such as Ohio, where liquor cannot be sold after 10 p.m., and beer and wine can't be sold past 1 a.m., don't shop within 30 minutes of the cutoff hour, especially in large cities, or you will find yourself in a mad rush. Approximate Time Saved: 2 to 10 minutes.

, If you know the line is going to be 5 minutes each time, and you shop every day, you are losing 35 minutes every week. Start shopping every week and you save half an hour every week. If you can restrict grocery shopping to every other week, even better! Approximate Time Saved: 10 to 60 minutes.

, Become familiar with and use the self-checkout wherever possible. It's really not as hard as it looks. Once you get the hang of it, it will become much faster for you. Approximate Time Saved: 1 to 3 minutes.


If an error or prompt appears that asks for attendant attention, clear it yourself if the attendant is busy with another customer. Approximate Time Saved: 30 seconds to several minutes.

, Don't lay it down, physically give it to them in their hand. Actually, this is true just about anywhere except banks and casinos. Approximate Time Saved: 5 to 15 Seconds.

, If you are using WIC coupons, have each item (or set of items) ready to be processed, and keep orders separate. Approximate Time Saved: 60 seconds to 5 minutes.

Maintain distance.,
Be respectful.,
Keep your gaze lowered.,
Bow from the waist to a 45-degree angle.,
Shake hands, if offered.,
Provide your business card.",How to Greet People in Japan1," Do not step in for a handshake, a hug, or even a friendly clap on the back. Instead, maintain a respectful distance of several feet. Japanese culture values space and privacy, so make sure your body language reflects these values.


Keeping two or three feet between you and someone else is a good rule of thumb. If you are further away, speaking and interacting may prove awkward or difficult.;
, Speak distinctly but quietly, stay off of your cell phone in public spaces, and allow your hosts to take the initiative. Doing these things will demonstrate to your friends, hosts, or business colleagues that you are adaptable and value their cultural norms.Boisterous and aggressive behavior are both considered disrespectful. Be kind to any vendors or service people you come across.

, Bold eye contact is considered quite rude, so keep your eyes averted whenever possible. Although you do not have to stare at your feet, try to watch someone’s mouth while they talk, or their chin. Avoid staring people down with heavy eye contact, as it will appear aggressive and inappropriate.Practice avoiding eye contact in the mirror by talking and watching your mouth, or in interactions with people from your home.
This rule may be lax in some areas of Japan, or among younger crowds.

, Hold your bow for between two and five seconds, keeping your hands near your hips or thighs. The more respect you wish to convey, the deeper your bow should be.You can also bow with your hands pressed together near your heart.

, Although you should never initiate a handshake, you can accept one. Touching in general is considered somewhat taboo in a formal situation, so a handshake should only be engaged in if the person to whom you are speaking begins the contact.

, In Japanese culture, exchanging business cards is an important aspect of communication. To properly offer your business card, extend your card with both hands, preferably with Japanese writing on the side of the card facing your colleague.To accept a card, take the card with both hands and bow to indicate your appreciation.
Business cards are exchanged from the most prestigious person to the least, so do not offer your business card before your superiors have.

Avoid direct contact.,
Hold only brief eye contact.,
Give a small bow or dip of the head.,
Shake hands.,
Offer a smile.",How to Greet People in Japan2," Even if you feel comfortable with physical affection or physical demonstrations of familiarity, do not assume that the people around you feel the same way. Even in informal situations, stick to a simple bow and maintain a healthy distance.This is particularly important for people of the opposite sex. It is considered inappropriate and impolite for members of the opposite sex to exchange physical contact in public.
If you have a close relationship with the people with whom you are interacting, you may be encouraged to demonstrate more familiarity with them. Follow the lead of those around you.

, In more informal situations, you can make eye contact, but do not hold it for an extended period of time. Instead, allow your gaze to linger for a matter of seconds before moving to another focal point.


Follow the lead of the person with whom you are associating. If they do not initiate eye contact, you should follow suit.

, Even in informal situations, you should offer a bow as a form of greeting. The depth of your bow will determine how much reverence or respect you are offering, so a small bow from the waist or a gentle dip of the head will suffice for an informal setting.If you do not know the people to whom you are bowing, engage in a more pronounced bow and reserve gentle nods for acquaintances or known colleagues.

, In an informal setting, feel free to offer up a handshake, but do not be too firm or aggressive. Instead, keep your hand loose.Handshakes are also not held as long in Japan as they might be in Europe or the United States. Rather than holding a firm handshake for ten seconds or more, grasp hands for a maximum of five seconds before letting go.

, Large displays of emotion are not common in Japanese culture, so don’t be surprised if you do not encounter a lot of friendly smiling. If you are familiar with someone, however, don’t feel you have to shy away from smiling or grinning.

"
"
Address using their formal name.,
Say “hello” with a simple, “Konnichiwa.” This is a simple, straightforward greeting that means “Hi” or “Good day.” Appropriate for strangers and friends alike, this is the “one size fits all” of Japanese greetings, and is the safest go-to.When in doubt, use this phrase.,
Bow and say, “Ohayo gozaimasu” in the morning.,
Bow along with a “Konbanwa” in the evening.,
Address everyone in a group.",How to Greet People in Japan3," In public, you should expect to greet people by their family names, rather than their first names. Using first names is considered far too familiar in a public setting, and may cause confusion or upset.If you aren’t sure what to call someone, ask! Addressing someone incorrectly is far ruder than asking for clarification.

, It is easy to pronounce and can be used anywhere, with anyone.

, Translated as, “Good morning,” “Ohayo gozaimasu” is a wonderful way to greet someone formally in the morning. You can use this phrase for everyone, from the person working at the front desk of the motel, to your friends and acquaintances., Pairing with the aforementioned step, greet people with “Konbanwa” in the evening. Although it may seem unnecessary, the formal nature of Japanese culture encourages a formal greeting any time of day. Don’t be afraid to “overdo” it when it comes to greeting those around you.

, While a single greeting satisfies many cultures for a group of people, Japanese culture dictates that you address everyone in a group individually. If you encounter a group of three people, for instance, it is proper to bow and speak a greeting three times, turning to face each person in turn.This may seem awkward at first, but will become easier as you practice. If you have trouble, practice at every available opportunity. It will eventually become second nature.
